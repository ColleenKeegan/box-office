Rowlings (deservedly) ubiquitous novels. Yes the Mexican-born director had helmed A Little Princess a movie featuring a young protagonist who like Harry had lost her parents. But he had more recently (and more famously) directed Y Tu Mama Tambien a sexually explicit film about the relationship between two teenage boys and an older woman. Fortunately any fears that Cuaron would have Harry and wizarding buddy Ron Weasley trading graphic descriptions of their sexual conquests--Y Professor McGonagall Tambien?--proved unfounded. Rather Cuaron brought to the Potter franchise a quality curiously missing from the two previous films magic.The first two attempts to bring Rowlings work to the big screen--Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets--were both directed by Chris Columbus the corporate sentimentalist who gave us such explorations of contemporary domesticity as Stepmom Mrs. Doubtfire Adventures in Babysitting and the Home Alone movies. Columbuss firm grounding in the cinema of the Here and Now left him ill-prepared to capture the otherworldly appeals of the Potter series so he retreated into literalism transcribing Rowlings work onto the screen with stenographic fidelity. The result was two films that for all the spark and wit of their source material felt timid and lifeless like illustrated books-on-tape. Cuarons Prisoner of Azkaban while a touch less faithful to the details of Rowlings oeuvre captures far better its mood the constant sense of wondrous discovery and lurking danger.Harry as children fluent in any of (at last count) 61 languages are well aware is a teenage wizard enrolled at Hogwarts Academy a kind of coed Eton for the magically inclined housed in a vast medieval castle in northern England. Like the previous installments in the series Prisoner of Azkaban opens just before the beginning of the school year with Harry who spends summers in the suburbs with a cruel aunt and uncle pining for his return to Hogwarts. In keeping with Rowlings basic formula Harry has an unpleasant confrontation with his relations and responds with an unintentional display of magic. But already there is a more foreboding edge to the proceedings with both the abuse (a still-more-repulsive relative arrives to insult Harrys dead parents) and the boys response (he turns her into a fat heliated balloon that floats off into the twilight sky) considerably darker than previous episodes. And thats before Harry sees the sinister black dog snarling at him from the bushes....Things improve little after Harry reunites with school pals Ron and Hermione and arrives at Hogwarts. A murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the previously inescapable wizard prison of Azkaban and appears intent on killing Harry. Worse the Dementors charged with recapturing Black--soul-sucking wraiths that make Peter Jacksons Nazgul look like Ewoks--seem also to have taken an unhealthy interest in our young hero. From these ominous beginnings the plot unfolds with the meticulousness for which Rowling is justly famous with numerous interwoven storylines--the elevation of lovable ogre Hagrid to Professor of Magical Creatures; the arrival of Professor Remus Lupin yet another in a series of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers with a secret; the mystery of Hermiones overloaded class schedule; the disappearance of Rons pet rat etc.--driving the story toward a conclusion that will be utterly unexpected for those (presumably childless) viewers who havent already read the book.Like Columbus before him Cuaron struggles to squeeze all the elements of Rowlings overstuffed novel into the limited running time of a feature film losing odds and ends along the way. He never explains for example who Padfoot Prongs Wormtail and Moony are or why Harry sees a spectral stag across the lake as the Dementors swoop in for the kill. Other omissions are more welcome--specifically a dramatic reduction in the screen time devoted to Quidditch (a kind of cross between polo and Australian Rules Football played on broomsticks) and the decision to skip the self-congratulatory end-of-the-school-year ceremony featured in each of the first three novels.Cuaron does not limit his alterations to cutting however. Rather than treat his source material (the previous films as well as the novel) as received texts sacrosanct and untouchable Cuaron freely adds his own flourishes. Hogwarts now features a delicate gothic footbridge and a massive clock tower whose pendulum swings menacingly across the schools entryway--this latter hinting at the solution to the novels central dilemma. The changes of the seasons are dramatized with brief comic set pieces featuring a murderous bit of foliage known as the Whomping Willow.Most important Cuaron creates an entirely new topography for the Hogwarts grounds. The first two films took place almost exclusively indoors with only the occasional visit to the Quidditch field Hagrids cabin or the Forbidden Forest--none of which existed in any clear geographic relation to the school itself. Cuaron instead perches Hogwarts on a steep hillside overlooking a crystal lake and invites his characters to come out for some fresh air. (The magnificent scenery belongs to Glencoe and Loch Levin in the Scottish Highlands.) In front of this enchanting backdrop Cuaron even finds time to offer moments that are not strictly necessary for the fulfillment of the storyline. These scenes--among them two talks between Harry and Lupin one on the footbridge and the other in woods overlooking the lake--offer much-needed respites from Rowlings furious plotting. Cuarons unhurriedness his willingness to pause to enjoy a mountain view or a conversation between two characters opens the film up and gives it room to breathe. These days after all any director with an adequate technical budget can give us digitized trolls and basilisks flying cars and animated chessmen. It takes a cinematic wizard to remind us that there is greater magic out in the real word than can be made in any studio.The Home Movies List Midstream Horse Changes Gone with the Wind (1939). Crossing this particular stream required so many horses that its hard to believe anything else was getting accomplished in Hollywood at the time. In addition to cycling through four directors (George Cukor Victor Fleming Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies) producer David O. Selznick used a dozen different writers (including Ben Hecht and briefly F. Scott Fitzgerald) and even solicited (and then disregarded) input from Alfred Hitchcock. The Godfather Part 2 (1974). Has any willful decision by a minor actor ever affected movie history more adversely than Richard Castellanos refusal to return as Clemenza in Godfather 2 because he felt he wasnt being paid enough? His replacement Michael Gazzos Frankie Pentangeli was fine. But his betrayal and ultimate suicide couldnt possibly have the weight they would have had if hed been Clemenza--the man he was supposed to be the man whod taught Michael to make spaghetti sauce. The Empire Strikes Back (1980). The fact that the characters came more fully to life in this Irvin Kershner-directed sequel should probably have tipped us off that George Lucas needed to be kept as far away as possible from flesh-and-blood actors. (Gratuitous argument-starter Star Wars is still the better movie.) Aliens (1986). Its a testament to the dramatic versatility of nine-foot-tall slingshot-jawed monsters that they were just as at home in James Camerons war movie as theyd been in Ridley Scotts horror flick. Keanu Reeves should have such range. Hannibal (2001). Sadly Ridley Scott is better at beginning series than ending them. This distasteful serving suffered from idiotic source material and the absence of Jodie Foster but most of all from the replacement of humanist Jonathan Demme with aesthete Scott who perhaps had a little too much in common with Lecter to find his moral distance.This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

Twitter previousDr. Kinseys RevolutionnextClintons Perverse Legacy Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Alfonso Cuarons screen version of the third novel in J.K. Rowlings series summons up a world that never fully came to life in the first two films notwithstanding their strenuous pace and hectic effects. Its a world in which the natural and supernatural coexist readily almost casually yet a dark and dangerous world in which our suddenly teenage hero must confront a mortal fatefully personal threat. Mr. Cuarons predecessor behind the camera in those previous films was Chris Columbus an exponent of hard-charging exuberance over subtlety. Connoisseurs of the series -- in other words every kid in the Potter-speaking world -- may detect a different sensibility at work from the very first sequence. Thats when Harry casts a spell on an insufferable aunt a spell as dramatic as it is mischievous. Harry is an old hand at this stuff by now. This time though he goes about his mischief with a focus that bespeaks both his growing maturity and the directors skill. The sequence builds. It starts small takes its time and gets big -- hilariously big. Later Harry drops mischief-making in favor of urgent lessons in self-defense after learning that a devious wizard named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison in order to kill him. Yet the pattern of the film remains the same -- special effects harnessed to the purposes of drama rather than show-stopping impact and performances at least by the adults that cast their own ineffable spells. This is not to find fault with Daniel Radcliffes work in the central role of a 13-year-old coming to understand the powerful possibilities of himself -- he remains perfectly competent if not commanding behind his wire-frame specs. Nor is it to minimize the importance of Emma Watsons sharp-tongued quick-witted Hermione who is emerging as a formidable specimen of a take-charge witch. (Quite apart from her witchy ways Hermione is beset by stirrings of sexuality that Rupert Grints winsome Ron isnt ready to deal with; young witches mature faster than young wizards.) But the grown-up performers around these kids are so damned good that the whole film like that single scene in ""Troy"" with Peter OToole turns into an advertisement for virtuoso English acting. Alan Rickman is back as the matchlessly doomy Professor Snape along with Robbie Coltranes mountainous Rubeus Hagrid (he is now teaching a course on the Care Of Magical Creatures) and Maggie Smiths Professor McGonagall. (She is still bracingly tart but in all-too-brief appearances.) The great Michael Gambon has replaced the late great Richard Harris as Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore; he occupies the role authoritatively albeit coolly even though Dumbledore gets limited screen time as well. Among the new arrivals are Gary Oldman as the ostensible villain Sirius Black; Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney a marvelously dotty medium who professes to teach the uses of second sight despite the woeful shortness of her first sight; Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew a rat dirtier than any James Cagney had in mind and most memorably David Thewlis as Professor Lupin the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Concealing a dark secret of his own Lupin teaches students how to protect themselves but his greatest service is helping Harry reconnect with the pain of his haunted past. These classroom scenes are notable for the free-wheeling humor of their special effects -- Harry and his classmates practice banishing a succession of scary shape-shifting boggarts. But theyre memorable for the delicacy with which the director and his screenwriter Steven Kloves (who also adapted the two previous films) develop the comic solemnity of Lupins odd pedagogical process. Mr. Cuaron the Mexican filmmaker who directed two poetic films with very different kinds of poetry ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" opts for dramatic coherence and emotional resonance wherever possible even at the expense of fast-paced adventure. (Although ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the shortest of the Harry Potter features thus far it feels a bit longer than its 141-minute running time perhaps because the script like the book lacks the razzle-dazzle set pieces of its predecessors.) For whatever its worth on the part of someone outside the target demographic I didnt miss the dazzle let alone the razzle. The movies set pieces seduce you with elegance wit or suspense. They include a brilliantly funny medium-vertiginous sequence aboard a purple triple-decker called the Knight Bus; a short but gripping game of Quidditch Hogwarts airborne sport of choice during which Harry is beset by scores of Dementors nightmarish creatures that are supposed to be guarding the school against Sirius Black; a battle between a werewolf thats far from a common werewolf and a dog thats not only a dog. Theres also Harrys thrillingly beautiful flight on the back of a hippogriff a sort of Pegasus with a sharp beak and a sharper temper in a sequence that the director sets up with care that must have been inspired by the classic encounter between horse and boy in ""The Black Stallion."" Whats more -- a lot more -- the screen seethes like ""Mad"" magazine at a simmer with lesser or at least less solid life forms animated newspaper photos animated notes passed by students in class animated ""Have You Seen This Wizard?"" posters seeking Sirius Blacks apprehension flitting origamis paintings all a-bustle within their restraining frames on the schools walls. As galloping gags spectral knights on horseback thunder unnoticed or barely noticed through Hogwarts dining hall. And The Monster Book Of Monsters is of all things a nasty little monster with gnashing teeth and seizing claws as well as a spine. A prodigality of invention extends to every area of the production design which was created as before by Stuart Craig but which was shot this time by the excellent New Zealand cinematographer Michael Seresin using a restrained color palette and relatively high contrast. Hogwarts has become more of an alpine institution than before clinging to the sides of verdant hills and its much more densely inhabited than before; students swarm up and down those crazily tilted staircases and gather conspiratorially in rabbit-warren dorm rooms. Some may grumble about liberties taken with the book -- events scanted omitted or displaced -- or even those taken with the geography and topography of the first two films. My hat is off to Mr. Cuaron for having taken the most daring liberty of all -- changing the basic style of the series. Chris Columbuss films stressed the show part of show business with a vengeance Were going to show you remarkable stuff and because we dont trust your shriveled attention spans we will do so with all the flash and impact at our command. Thus did Quidditch turn into a video game and Jo Rowlings shimmering fantasies into thrill rides. Alfonso Cuarons style relies on trust. He trusts the intrinsic power of movie magic and the eagerness that keeps kids scanning movie screens like astronomers searching the heavens for new stars.    DVD TIP In Bernardo Bertoluccis ""Besieged"" (1998) David Thewlis is a concert pianist living in Rome who sells his precious piano out of love for his maid an immigrant medical student played by Thandie Newton.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Shepherded by hack auteur Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire Stepmom) whose commercial instincts border on diabolical the first two Harry Potter movies were all about delivering on the franchise. They werent adaptations so much as pop-up novelizations faithfully rendering J.K. Rowlings popular books without a surfeit of personality or imagination. So when it was announced that the third installment in the series was to be handed over to Alfonso Cuaron the superb Mexican director of Y Tu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess there was reason for cautious optimism. With so much at stake would Cuaron infuse the material with his own vision or would he be hamstrung by expectations the stand-in conductor of a runaway train? Miraculously Cuaron does a little bit of both in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban which keeps the Potter universe intact while wresting it out of kiddie-land introducing a sophisticated style thats simultaneously darker and more whimsical than the previous films. With shades of Carrie Harrys magical powers and adolescent angst make a combustible fusion taking on frightening vengeful implications that Cuaron honors by refusing to airbrush the shadowy regions of fantasy. But because he remains wedded to the source material the film represents a collection of minor improvements--in the acting in the fleet storytelling in the graceful integration of special effects--rather than a thorough overhaul. Returning for his third year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that a convicted murderer (Gary Oldman) has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban and intends to kill him for mysterious and convoluted reasons related to Harrys past. A flock of wraithlike soul-sucking prison guards called Dementors surround Hogwarts perimeter in search of the escapee but they may be more trouble than theyre worth. Fortunately for Harry and his friends theres a new ""defense against the dark arts"" teacher (David Thewlis) to help them combat these and other evil forces. As usual Rowlings busy plotting recalls Groucho Marx looking at a Treasury Department report in Duck Soup ""Why a 4-year-old child could understand this report Run out and find me a 4-year-old child. I cant make head or tail of it."" The third act especially is overstuffed with so many twists and shifting alliances that its hard to sort out the good guys and bad guys but even then the series takes an admirable leap into the folds of time. From the start The Prisoner Of Azkaban taps into the neato fantasies that have inspired the Potter cult but it never overemphasizes them and it relegates many bits of magic to background noise. For the first time the non-converted may actually see what all the fuss is about.

Comments click to enlarge Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Rated PG  141 minutes  2004 Chris Columbus who directed the first two Harry Potter movies has passed the wand to Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) and in contrast to Columbuss bloated theme-park rides this third installment (2004) more closely approximates the character-driven storytelling of J.K. Rowlings beloved childrens books. The young wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft for his third year but his studies are overshadowed by the escape of convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) an acolyte of the evil Lord Voldemort (whom Harry defeated in the previous film). Like the first two movies this is loaded with computer-generated imagery but for the first time theres a sense of dramatic proportion balancing the spectacle and the story line. By J.R.

Those of us who arent can still recall the restlessness the awkwardness the loneliness -- and the paranoiacs conviction that forces of evil (grown-ups in any case) are out to get you. Imagine then the pitiable state of Harry Potter who is not merely 13 not merely restless and awkward and lonely but is being pursued by denizens of the dark side. The fact they look like crepe-paper escapees from a party-supply store doesnt matter. Theyre after him and theyre trying to suck out his life force through the kisser. Poor kid no zits as yet but you should see what this process does to his complexion. ""Why do you look so miserable Harry?"" asks a solicitous adult after one such encounter echoing many generations of solicitous adults around the world. The remark draws a laugh -- not as a punch line but as a self-evident and painfully universal commentary on the agony that is early adolescence. Such is the balance of horror and humanity humor and hormones that sparks Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the third and most satisfying movie in the series based on J.K. Rowlings disarmingly addictive novels. Its not a perfect film by any means -- duck or youll be crushed by thundering aphorisms (``the ones that love us never really leave us"") -- but it succeeds unequivocally where the first two stumbled. Namely It stands alone as a movie apart from the book. It has its own funky vibe. Partial credit for this goes to Steve Kloves who wrote all three screenplays but seems sprung free with this one. Gone is the slavish devotion to source material that weakened the first two films both stolid adaptations. With Azkaban hundreds of pages have been eliminated sweeping away huge tracts of windy dialogue. The main plot remains the same Harry now in his third year at Hogwarts finds himself pursued by Sirius Black a ``murderous raving lunatic"" newly escaped from the infamous Azkaban Prison. On Siriuss tail and haunting Harrys every turn are ghoulish prison guards called Dementors who perform the soul-sucking maneuver previously mentioned. Also in the mix are Harrys old nemesis Snape (Alan Rickman bearing a startling resemblance to Marilyn Manson) and headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon taking over from the late gray eminence Richard Harris) along with three new characters Divination teacher Trelawney (Emma Thompson in full hippie) Dark Arts teacher Lupin (an avuncular David Thewlis) and Sirius Black himself played with exactly the sort of hyperbolic grand-guignol freak-out that weve come to love and expect from Gary Oldman. The whole cast seems to be having a ball. The film has an airiness to it a loose-limbed jangliness that was missing from the first two outings. Shots are longer; scenes less frenetically paced; the actors have more room to breathe. The kids just look more relaxed loping about in their hip clothing and mod haircuts. John Williams even spikes some jazz into the score. But the true liberator here is director Alfonso Cuaron whose laid-back inventiveness and nimble intellect lend Rowlings magical universe a dose of old-fashioned nervy wit. The Muggles might call it chutzpah. Early on Harry wreaks revenge on his vicious Aunt Petunia by transforming her into a reluctant dirigible First her finger balloons then the rest of her carrying this cantankerous blow-up doll into the dusk above Privet Drive. Its a nasty funny sequence reminiscent of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Cuaron uses it to underscore Harrys ferocious solitude. He is alone misunderstood and bitterly angry. Clearly Cuaron understands the stages and fears of childhood. Its no surprise the director of A Little Princess and Great Expectations has a knack for orphaned waifs but as the man behind Y Tu Mama Tambien he showcased something else entirely -- a keen insight into the horndog inclinations of two teenagers on a road trip with a bored married lady. Cuaron himself has pointed out the similarities between Y Tu MamaTambien and Azkaban (two boys and a girl -- wink wink) but too much can be made of the overlap. So what if Hermione happens to hold hands with both Ron and Harry. Theyre just being you know friendly. Hermione incidentally is looking sharp; Emma Watson has finally grown into her hair. Shes got a touch of the grrrl about her even landing a crisp right cross on the perpetual smirk of bad boy Draco Malfoy (played by Tom Felton whose hair is having isss-yous of its own). As faithful Ron Rupert Grint mugs ridiculously as ever but he has a sweet stretched-out geekiness that makes the mothers among us want to stifle him in a hug. And Daniel Radcliffe our own heroic Harry has morphed from squeaky preteen into a stripling poised on manhood. With his owlish eyes arching eyebrows and delicate pointed features he has the deceptive softness of a boy at a dangerous juncture. Early buzz on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban emphasized its grimness calling it a much ``darker"" film than the first two and arguably more violent. In fact it is the least violent so far. But it is the darkest The look is muted washed out the color of old gray flannel. And the emotions are darker tapping themes of betrayal and desolation reflected in the stark beauty of Scotlands Western Highlands. But in every other way this is a luminous movie -- luminous imaginative and affecting. For Harry Potter at least the third time is the charm.

Rowlings work and brings us one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News The essence of romanticism said the German writer E.T.A. Hoffman is ""infinite longing."" With the marvelous ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" J.K. Rowlings work has finally gotten the romantic filmmaker it deserves. Rowlings series of books about a young orphan and wizard-in-training named Harry Potter -- ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third -- are nothing if not romantic works. Of their numerous intertwined themes infinite longing rates pretty high Harrys parents a witch and a wizard were killed when he was an infant and he constantly wonders what they were like and whether hes anything like them -- he longs to know. In the first book of the series ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" Harry glimpses them in a magic mirror standing behind his reflection ""The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness."" Director Alfonso Cuaron didnt get to dramatize that sequence The movie versions of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and of the second book ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" were both directed by Chris Columbus who was doggedly faithful to Rowlings plots but singularly graceless in translating their syncopated lyricism to the screen. But ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first true Harry Potter movie -- the first to capture not only the books sense of longing but their understanding of the way magic underlies the mundane instead of just prancing fancifully at a far remove from it. In the spirit of a true romantic Cuaron knows that the secret to great fantasy is naturalism. In ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" 13-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his third year learns that a dangerous wizard and mass murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has broken out of Azkaban Prison the Alcatraz of the wizard world. Blacks picture appears -- moving like a TV news clip -- in newspapers and ""Wanted"" posters; he has the unkempt unhinged look of Charles Manson his eyes gleaming maniacally. Worse yet Harry hears that Sirius Black is responsible for the death of his parents and is now out to kill him. Harry and his fellow students at Hogwarts -- among them his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as well as the trios sworn enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) -- are warned that until Sirius Black has been apprehended the school will be guarded by horrifying hooded creatures known as Dementors Azkaban guards who have the power not just to terrify their victims but to suck their very souls from them. The Dementors seem to have a special interest in Harry Before he even reaches the school a Dementor confronts him turning the air around him cold as ice -- Harry faints causing some of his schoolmates to taunt him and he himself questions his bravery. But the schools new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher professor Lupin (David Thewlis) understands why the Dementors have singled Harry out. He agrees to teach Harry how to fight them so Harry will be freer to enjoy normal schoolboy pursuits like divination lessons and Quidditch matches. Lupin also has a link with Harrys past which makes him particularly protective of the boy. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" was adapted by Steven Kloves who also wrote the screenplays for the first two Harry Potter movies. In this as in the earlier scripts he shows a good ear for Rowlings lively unstuffy language. Hogwarts headmaster professor Dumbledore played wonderfully by Michael Gambon (stepping into the role previously played by the late and truly great Richard Harris) announces that the schools new Care of Magical Creatures instructor will be the beloved gruff-and-gentle giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). The former teacher Dumbledore informs his charges has ""retired in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs"" -- a direct quote from Rowling and one that captures the mischievous flavor of her prose. Kloves has also streamlined and sleekened the narrative which Cuaron paces beautifully It moves at a clip when it needs to but it also flows gracefully when it should. And while Kloves and Cuaron may have lost a few crucial details (most notably an explanation of how Harrys father used to adopt the form of a certain animal) theyve decanted the essence of Rowlings stories at last allowing it to breathe on-screen. Instead of feeling crammed with self-consciously clever details as the early Potter pictures did ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" inspires a sense of wonder at even the smallest touches Professor Lupins classroom features tall tapered candles that arent just your typical spirals -- theyre shaped like curvy human spinal columns complete with individual vertebrae. The passing of time is denoted by a graceful pan of the countryside as Harrys white owl Hedwig flies across it Its sun-tinted reds and oranges give way to the sparkling whites and grays of winter. The moving paintings that adorn the walls of Hogwarts have the dark richness of works by the old masters even as the characters in them chatter and bicker and shuffle around. Cuaron and his cinematographer Michael Seresin even show us the texture of the paint a surface of swirls and stippling that make these pictures look like real paintings-in-motion and not just wowee special effects. You Might Also Like And all of the movies characters human and non- seem finally at home in this extremely believable universe. The movies loveliest creature is Hagrids beloved Buckbeak a hippogriff (thats a cross between a horse and an eagle in case you didnt know) whose bright-eyed expressiveness is as mesmerizing as the swooping of his wings. The most terrifying figures are the Dementors silent and virtually faceless specters that float in the sky the tendrilly edges of their shrouds making them look like menacing silky black squid. The Dementors rank among the most evocative horror images ever put on-screen I wouldnt advise bringing a very young child to ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" considering Im not really sure I can keep the Dementors out of my own nightmares. Although the previous Harry Potter movies have included some fine performances (from the likes of Harris and Kenneth Branagh as well as from Coltrane Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith all three of whom reappear here) ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first Harry Potter movie thats really a showcase for actors. Radcliffe Watson and Grint were appealing enough in the earlier movies but their performances were also a bit stiff and perfunctory. Slightly older and more seasoned now -- in addition to the fact that theyre working with an intuitive director who clearly knows how to guide young actors -- theyve learned how to fully relax into their characters. They never mug; their faces show gradations of expression we havent seen before. Emma Thompson is hilarious in her small role as the dotty aged-hippie divination teacher professor Trelawny. And Oldmans Sirius Black and Thewlis Lupin bring vast reserves of emotional gravity balanced by the right proportions of good humor to the picture. Even before any critics or viewers had seen ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" we all heard rumors of its ""darker mood."" ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker than any of the previous Harry Potters in keeping with the tenor of Rowlings books. But the deeper undertones of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" feel organic -- theyre not just pasted-on gloomy colors. Oldman and Thewlis in particular embody the pictures mood Theres shadowy complexity as well as luminescence in their hearts. Thats true of the overall look of the movie as well which Im beginning to think is one of the most masterfully conceived and shot fantasy films of all time precisely because it looks so un-fantastical. For one thing despite the fact that ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" shares many of the same sets as the earlier Harry Potter movies and like them was shot in the United Kingdom its the first Harry Potter movie that looks distinctively English. Columbus gave us lots of garish tones and busy bustle. But Cuaron -- who was born in Mexico City -- is highly attuned to that most quintessentially English characteristic understatement. Seresin clearly shares his sensibility. The colors of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" are muted and intense. Parts of the picture were shot in Scotland and those sections set the movies palette of smoky grays misty browns and brilliant greens. These are the types of colors that dont reach out to us -- we need to come to them. And thats how ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" works its most powerful magic The picture is naturalistic without being aggressively pastoral. Set against such arrestingly realistic grays and browns the sight of a hippogriff majestically flapping its giant Pegasus-like wings looks more real than say a jet streaming across the sky. Most movie audiences are familiar with Cuarons last picture the joyous and deservedly praised ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" That movies success may have led some viewers to seek out Cuarons first American feature the 1995 ""A Little Princess"" an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnetts Victorian childrens story and for my money one of the most lush and emotionally resonant childrens films ever made. Cuarons 1998 adaptation of ""Great Expectations"" has far fewer defenders but I adore it and in the context of this new Harry Potter movie I urge people who may have dismissed it to have another look. If nothing else the verdant romanticism of ""Great Expectations"" points the way to ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" Cuaron has the eye of a landscape painter and the heart of a humanist. The killer twist is that hes also an extraordinarily gifted storyteller. Rowling is reportedly a big fan of ""A Little Princess."" Its fitting that Cuaron is the filmmaker to at last give her writing the on-screen life it deserves. I often think of great movie adaptations not just as extracurricular versions of the books they represent but as vital accessories to those books -- compact but substantive ghosts that sit on the shelves among and between the pages huddled up close guardians of their elusive yet sturdy spirits. As an adaptation ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is all you could wish for. It has earned its place on the bookshelf.

(c) 2004 Warner Bros. By Christy Lemire AP Entertainment Writer Harry Potter is 13 now an awkward age for anyone --even a boy wizard armed with magical powers. But ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the third film in the series couldnt be more self-assured. Alfonso Cuaron best known for making the gritty coming-of-age film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien has taken over directing duties and taken the tale in a darker direction. Much of that comes from author J.K. Rowlings source material itself -- ""Azkaban is heavier thematically than its predecessors as Harry learns more about how his parents died and begins to understand who he really is. (Steve Kloves who adapted the first two ""Harry Potter books for the screen wrote the script for this one as well.) Visually though ""Azkaban"" isnt as glossy or whimsical as the first two films -- ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets -- both of which Chris Co-lumbus directed. Cuaron has completely reinvented the series with a bleakly beautiful style that resembles German expressionism using cold shades of gray a generous amount of black and off-kilter camera angles. The skies are constantly cloudy over the Hog-warts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and even a game of Quidditch the young wizards beloved sport takes place in a driving rain storm. Its a daring move one that makes ""Azkaban"" more stimulating for adults but may have resulted in a film thats too scary for young kids. The Dementors - hooded creatures who guard the Azkaban prison and suck the souls from their victims -- are sent to Hogwarts to protect the students from escaped wizard Sirius Black but that doesnt make them any less ominous. (Perhaps though playing video games has taught children how to divorce this kind of experience from reality; a Dementor may seem like just another zappable bad guy.) ""Azkaban"" has some wondrous moments too. A scene in which Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) takes a ride on a hippogriff -- a flying animal thats half horse half eagle -- has a soaring Im-the-king-of-the-world energy about it only without the bombastic Celine Dion music. The supporting cast is more fabulous than ever. Besides the returning actors -- including Alan Rick-man as the snippy Professor Snape and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid -- there are some wonderful additions. David Thewlis plays the supportive Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who helps Harry face his fears and Emma Thompson is a scene stealer as a hippie-chick divination professor a showy role thats a great contrast with the prim parts for which shes best known. As the mysterious misunderstood Sirius Black Gary Oldman infuses his character with great heart and sympathy. (Michael Gambon takes over seamlessly as Hog-warts headmaster Albus Dumbledore the role Richard Harris played until his death in 2002.) Most importantly Radcliffe and the young actors who co-star as Harrys pals are more confident than ever. Radcliffe who was a likable if slightly goofy kid in the first two movies has grown into a charismatic (and cute) 14-year-old. Emma Watson as Harrys bossy buddy Hermione has developed into a strong beautiful young woman. And as Harrys best friend Ron Rupert Grint shows an improving sense of humor and timing. Purists may balk that this is an art-house version of Harry Potter and with any revered pop culture phenomenon fans are likely to get riled about something. But ""Azkaban"" is by far the meatiest most magical film in the series thus far. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is rated PG for frightening moments creature violence and mild language. Running time 141 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

The filmmaking does too. ""Azkaban"" the third installment in the Harry Potter series is everything the first two films were not complex frightening nuanced. The Potter purists who were so sorely affronted by the choice of Chris Columbus to direct the first two films expected great things from Alfonso Cuaron -- director of the Oscar-nominated ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" -- and they are not likely to be disappointed. ""Azkaban"" is so much more sophisticated visually and in terms of storytelling that its hard to believe the source material is the same. Its not perfect or even close but it delivers on the promise of J.K. Rowlings novels to a far greater extent. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086323457216?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086323457216?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086323457217?""></a> Before the series is done it will offer audiences something of a cinematic education -- at least in terms of directorial style. Consider for example that Columbus of ""Home Alone"" fame directed the first two Harry Potter movies and that Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") will direct the fourth which starts shooting next month. Throw in Cuaron and whomever else it takes to complete all seven projected films and youve got the same material filtered through multiple sensibilities -- some of which we can now say with confidence are much better suited to it than others. Directorial interpretation aside its entirely fitting that the more grown-up book gets the more grown-up movie. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best of the five Harry Potter novels and its markedly different from the two that precede it. With its ominous mood and surprise ending its less like a fairy tale and more like a whodunit. (Not that theres any reason for these movies to be sunny. At their most fundamental level the series is about coping with the death of a parent -- something which finally comes across here. Only in a work of fiction could it invariably be considered such a precious compliment for people to say they see your parents in you.) Cuarons wholesale disavowal of cuddliness couldnt have come at a better time. At the start of his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Harry learns that Sirius Black the wizard whose betrayal of his parents resulted in their deaths has escaped from Azkaban the wizarding equivalent of a maximum-security penitentiary -- and hes coming after Harry. The film opens with our hero finishing out the summer holidays at the home of his Muggle -- non-wizarding -- relatives. Its clear from the outset that this is Harry with an edge When he is insulted beyond endurance by the loathsome Aunt Marge and the dishes begin to rattle and shake its hard to miss the ""Carrie"" reference. Like the film as a whole Harrys human family is less cartoonish here and therefore more threatening- less cartoonish that is except for the part where Harrys Aunt Marge inflates like a middle-aged Violet Beauregarde and floats away. This Harry no longer inhabits a primary-colored world. In Cuarons film which has a palette of dull browns and grays its almost always dark wet or both. The locations have undergone a similar transformation. The Leaky Cauldron for one is no longer a Magic Kingdom-style tavern but a dirty and sinister place one where youd do well to keep an eye on your wallet. Not even Hogwarts seems quite so inviting. The building is now Gothic rather than baroque and the director has picked it up and set it down in a desolate mountainous landscape. The schools dress code seems to have been relaxed as well. Robes and witches hats are still in evidence but the kids spend most of their time in street clothes. Even bus conductor Stan Shunpikes pimples and greasy hair seem designed to strike a new note of (relative) realism. Aside from the radical change of mood the biggest difference in ""Azkaban"" is the burgeoning maturity of the films three lead actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) look older old enough for there to be -- ewww -- sexual tension between Ron and Hermione. (It seems altogether appropriate when at one point Harry uses his invisibility cloak like a fake ID entering a bar where underage wizards arent allowed.) Like its predecessors the film includes cameos by a slew of fine British actors some of whom make something of their fleeting screen time (Alan Rickmans Professor Snape is still a formidable presence) and some of whom dont (Emma Thompsons goofy turn as Professor Trelawney would have been a much better fit in one of the Columbus movies). The real surprise in this category is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin who inexplicably eschews his customary air of menace in a role that require just that. It may be that working with the likes of Kenneth Branagh and Maggie Smith has had some long-term benefits for the young actors All three give more subtle performances than before -- even Grint keeps his mugging to a minimum this time around. The best thing about ""Azkaban"" is its success at capturing and elaborating on the details that make the books such a delight. The Whomping Willow always dangerous is now apparently carnivorous; passing birds disappear into its foliage and their feathers drift gently to the ground. Cuaron hangs familiar Old Masters among the living paintings in the schools stairwell; at one point an angry Rembrandt self-portrait shushes Harry. Rowlings book introduced the hippogriff -- half griffin half horse -- but its Cuaron who answers the question ""What do hippogriff droppings look like?"" During one classroom scene Professor Lupin puts on a jaunty phonograph record giving a harrowing magic lesson a disconcerting choreographed effect. Because of its position in the lineup ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" suffers from what you might call Low Bar Syndrome. Its so easy to quantify the ways in which its better that you lose sight of whether its good. Certainly the film is not without its disappointments The Dementors spectral Azkaban prison guards and Rowlings metaphors for depression look an awful lot like crepe-draped basketballs. The pacing is slightly off kilter some sequences pass in a flash while others seem to unfold in real time. And the plot -- although the film is better for not being overloaded with exposition -- can be hard for the uninitiated to follow. (Good news for those of us whove wondered when being the kind of nerd whos read the books again and again will pay off.) Still such imperfections seem a small price to pay for a Potter film with fangs.

"Harry-Raising Adventure washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Harry-Raising Adventure Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 4 2004 Stephen King meets Charles Dickens in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the third installment of the hugely popular serial. The franchises eponymous hero a teen who attends a boarding school for witches and wizards is a winsome bespectacled orphan who uses his powers only to fight evil -- a cross between Carrie and David Copperfield. Thus hes the perfect embodiment of his young fans deepest anxiety (being abandoned) and greatest desire (being all-powerful). Then again Peter Parker has those qualities too and ""Spider-Man"" was a much better movie. In the interest of full disclosure let it be said This reviewer is not a Potterphile has never cracked a Potter book or darkened the door of a theater playing one of the Potter movies. She went to this one cold to see how it played simply as a movie-movie unfettered by the bonds of hype baggage and a mental checklist of Things Missing From the Movie That Were in the Book. And the result of this little experiment? She still doesnt get it. At a little more than two hours ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" clocks in as the shortest of the three Potter movies a fact that makes ones tushie tingle just contemplating it. Put delicately this is one long sit made all the more so by a turgid story a dour visual palette and uninspiring action. No doubt those details are quite beside the point for fans who eagerly if not rabidly await each chapter of their favorite long-running soap opera (theyre like ""Sopranos"" fanatics only nicer). They should be well pleased for the film deepens maybe even darkens Harrys complicated family story and introduces some characters who promise to provide some spice and spark to future movies. As for the unconvinced friends and family those true believers may drag along with them well theres always Alan Rickman. Rickman is just one of several supporting players who give ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" periodic glints of wicked humor. He plays one of Harrys professors Severus Snape a mirthless martinet who can inspire fear and loathing just by droning ""Please open your books to page thrrrree-haundred-and-ninety-fooour."" Good too are David Thewlis as a new teacher at Hogwarts School Emma Thompson as the spacey divination teacher and Michael Gambon who replaces the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore Hogwartss stern but kind headmaster. And special mention must go to Timothy Spall for being a good sport in a clever instance of anthropomorphic casting. These veterans of the British stage and screen give ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" lifeblood that cant be transfused through endless computer-generated effects no matter how often director Alfonso Cuaron resorts to them. As in so many such spectacles what are supposed to be dazzling set pieces here fall flat; the scene that got the biggest reaction at a recent screening was when Harrys friend Hermione (Emma Watson) sucker-punched the school bully. ""The brightest witch of her age"" Hermione is clearly the star of the show here far outshining Daniel Radcliffes Harry P. in humor and spirit. Shes even tougher than the Dementors (which uncannily resemble ""The Wizard of Ozs"" famous flying monkeys). These swooping banshees turn out to be more dangerous to Harry than the storys villain the Prisoner of Azkaban himself. That last character an escaped fugitive named Sirius Black has vowed to come after Harry and the Dementors -- who were Blacks guards at Azkaban -- have been sent to Hogwarts to capture him. The problem is they cant seem to discern between good guys and bad when theyre flying around Harry and his fellow students trying to suck out their souls by way of their faces. Those scenes may be a little strong for young viewers as might a sadistic execution of an innocent hippogriff (half horse half griffin) and a brief but terrifying fight between a werewolf and a huge black dog. Indeed the entire movie is filled with surprisingly dark and ambiguous material as Harry comes to terms with his parents deaths and learns whom he can and cannot trust. Cuaron who directed ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" brings as much sophistication as he can to the proceedings but hes hemmed in by J.K. Rowlings original novel; his main artistic decision seems to have been what to leave out of that hefty 435-page story. Whats surprising is how little verve Cuaron brings to the franchise. Its true that Hogwarts and its plashy fens are meant to evoke a grayer more lugubrious era but something more than a few oversize pumpkins by way of color wouldnt have hurt. Still there are a few arresting sights such as the giant spider on roller skates that Harry and his schoolmates encounter while learning to face their fears or the schools giant clock one of Cuarons frequent and wistfully effective allusions to times passing. For those who have yet to succumb to the charms of Hogwarts bumblequirks and weaselpeeps that clock will only be a grim symbol of how slowly ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is proceeding. For the rest of the audience it will no doubt serve as a bittersweet reminder that their beloved hero is growing up and his story must eventually come to an end. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (136 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for frightening moments creature violence and mild language.

Thanks to director Alfonso Cuaron a dazzling storyteller with a keen eye for whimsical detail the third film in the Potter franchise is a visual delight. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in a scene from the third Potter film. Warner Bros. Pictures It also has plenty of heart. Cuaron is not afraid to make a darker film and tackle painful emotions involving the bespectacled hero. The plot focuses on Harry played with an affable intelligence by Daniel Radcliffe and the menacing presence of prison escapee Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Emma Watsons Hermione is spunkier and all three young wizards have become more facile actors. Azkaban is a brisk 2 hours and 10 minutes substantially shorter than its predecessors despite being the longest of the three books. But it is unlikely even die-hard fans will miss what Cuaron and screenwriter Steve Kloves left out. The pacing cleverly alternates between frightening scenes and lighter moments. Cuaron who co-wrote and directed the bittersweet Y Tu Mama Tambien clearly gets the nuances of teen behavior. While former director Chris Columbus stuck closely to Rowlings vision Cuaron rounds out Harrys world giving us more context. ABOUT THE MOVIE Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    1/2 (out of four) Stars Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Emma Thompson Gary Oldman David Thewlis Director Alfonso Cuaron Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for frightening moments creature violence and mild language. Opens Friday nationwide Here special effects are secondary to characters and story. The teachers scenes are brief but leave an indelible mark. Emma Thompson is hilarious as divination Professor Trelawney and David Thewlis plays the melancholy Professor Lupin with a lovely poignance. The special effects that are used are powerful starting with the soul-sucking dementors which float ominously over Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Harrys home away from his terrible home with his cruel Muggle -- non-wizard -- relatives. Just as impressive is a soaring ride Harry takes on the hippogriff Buckbeak a hybrid bird and horse. In contrast one characters transformation into a werewolf is rather underwhelming. Harry is now 13 and moody. When his odious Aunt Marge insults his dead parents Harrys temper takes an explosive turn. He runs away and is scooped up for a careening ride aboard the triple-decker Knight Bus a magical vehicle that races through London streets. Though Potter is set in a magical realm with an ethereal beauty there is an honest and grounded quality to the human interactions. To paraphrase one of Harrys spells this third Potter film has managed mischief brilliantly.

"Harry Potter Side trips on the way to Hogwarts | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentHarry Potter Side trips on the way to HogwartsThe many characters and strange figures of the Harry Potter series pulled us every which way like the Hogwarts train leaving from secret Platform 93/4.Dobby the House Elf who practically worships Harry made his debut in the second film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. July 15 2011Looking back on 10 years of Harry Potter movies brings to mind the classic Grateful Dead lyric ""What a long strange trip its been.""Except in Harrys case Id amend that to ""What a long strange side trip its been."" Because for me and I suspect for a few other moviegoers the central narrative about the boy wizards looming battle with evil Lord Voldemort wasnt the main fascination of this decade-long cinema journey.It was the many odd characters and strange figures that pulled us every which way like the Hogwarts train leaving from secret Platform 93/4 or a Quidditch match where anything goes.Characters such as Sirius Black Bellatrix Lestrange and Severus Snape all proved to be deeper than our first glimpse of them suggested. Or that shrunken head on the ghostly Knight Bus talking with rastaman cool. Or those ghastly wraith-like Dementors who guard prisoners but also steal souls.The eight-movie Harry Potter franchise which exceeds author J.K. Rowlings book series by one because the final story has been split into two films has been dutifully reviewed in the pages of the Toronto Star. Article Continued BelowIt concludes with the July 15 release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. To mark the occasion Ive assembled a short reprise of my reviews for the previous seven films. All received thumbs up ratings of varying enthusiasm.Two important notes before we begin  The Potter series stretches from the time when the Star had a rating system of up to five stars which changed to a four-star system with 2005s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.   And I didnt write the review of record for film number three Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; colleague Geoff Pevere did. But I have seen it back then and again recently so Ive written a fresh capsule review and included both my rating and Geoffs.1. Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (Chris Columbus 2001)()The Hogwarts Express has arrived carrying Harry Potter and his chums to their magical destination. The film is scrupulous in design faithful in execution and boasting a near-perfect cast of faces new and old. The film will delight the many who want to see on the big screen the exact images they have in their head of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) his pals Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) and others in their world as told in J.K. Rowlings fantasy novels about a boy wizard and his school of sorcery. Fresh face Radcliffe makes an endearing bow in the title role nimbly assisted by acting elders Richard Harris Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane. Positive role models are rarely this enjoyable -- or so handy with wands and magic potions. 2. Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets (Chris Columbus 2002)()Wizard-in-training Harry struggles to get back into Hogwarts fighting to save both his reputation and his hide.The film is considerably darker and more frightening than Philosophers Stone. What it gains in dramatic tension it loses in childhood appeal. The unabashed joy of seeing Rowlings beloved series brought so convincingly to the screen is dimmed by the realization that the faces are less fresh this time around and the magic seems more computed than conjured.There is no question though that much of what made the first film so enchanting remains firmly in place from the strong ensemble performances through Stuart Craigs magnificent production design. The late Richard Harris makes his last appearance as Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore.3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban (Alfonso Cuaron 2004)(Howell ; Pevere )Perhaps because rookie Potter director Alfonso Cuaron hails from Mexico a place where ghosts of all kinds are nationally celebrated in annual Days of the Dead parties he brings to the third film a delicious sense of the absurd and the undead.Harry finally breaks free of his enslaving Muggle relations -- not before inflating vile Auntie Marge -- only to learn that hes at risk from Sirius Black a Voldemort stooge who has escaped from fearsome Azkaban prison. But the good guys include a new face Michael Gambon in the role of Albus Dumbledore ably replacing the late Richard Harris.Arguably the series most visually inventive film -- its my personal favorite -- Prisoner of Azkaban also introduces such chillingly demonic creations as the Dementors. Theyre vile creatures capable of sucking ""every happy memory"" out of you -- not a good thing if you want to keep up with this ever-expanding series.4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Mike Newell 2005)()Skulls skeletons and slithering serpents are suddenly everywhere but they pale next to the scariest ""S"" thing of the lot sex.Boy wizard Harry continues to seek knowledge at Hogwarts despite all manner of increasingly dangerous distractions. People get killed graphically so and the dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is finally seen in the flesh if you can call it that. Even the candy has teeth in this one.The fourth film and book of J.K. Rowlings wizardly series is also the most hormonal to date. Harry Ron and Hermione acknowledge something only hinted at previously There is more magic and mystery in sexual attraction than in any spell they could conjure. Just ask Robert Pattinson the future Twilight vampire who pops up here as Quidditch ace Cedric Diggory.5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (David Yates 2007)(3 stars out of 4)The Harry Potter franchise is maturing along with its core audience which is now facing adulthood with its attendant challenges fears and disillusionments.This is the darkest episode yet as ghoulish Dementors launch an attack that causes physical and psychological damage to orphan wizard Harry. He must also contend with vicious Death Eaters followers of Voldemort.Harry is accused of using ""underage magic"" to battle the demons and forced to defend his actions in a kangaroo court convened by the increasingly fascist Ministry of Magic. Hogwarts begin changing for the worst especially when Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) arrives to take over the school with greater discipline and a hidden agenda in mind. But another order rises the one named Phoenix as the good guys marshal their defenses.6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (David Yates 2009)()Hormones continue to race but the magic mainly idles in this sixth Harry Potter episode a stage-setting film in which boyish fascinations give way to manly concerns.The boys and girls have grown into young men and women leading to serious romantic entanglements and attendant jealousies. There is still wizardry but it all has dramatic purpose -- and much of it points to the final two films in which Harry and his nemesis Voldemort will engage in decisive battle.Returning director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned this as more of a mystery than previous instalments with many more plot threads. 7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (David Yates 2010)()Trust is a life-or-death issue as Harry Potters cinema swan song begins its two-part telling.Disguised characters concealed clues (and motives) and accusations of emotional deceit swirl in this seventh and most brutal chapter of the boy wizards 10-year saga.The high quality of the series remains. Returning director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves remain attentive as ever to Rowlings holy text and the mood is as magic as always.Harry Hermione and Ron are on the run. So are nearly everyone and everything ever to lend a hand claw or talon in Harrys decade-long battle against evil Lord Voldemort a contest that now approaches its violent conclusion.Follow on Twitter peterhowellfilmThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

His third film is darker more complex rooted in character. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fantasy. Starring Daniel Radcliffe Gary Oldman and David Thewlis. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (PG. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a different kind of Harry Potter movie a better kind. Though its glossy look and exaggerated scale give it the required family resemblance to its predecessors this third installment signals a change of course away from the limited conventions of action-movie formula and into a more metaphysical direction. Its where this fantasy series has wanted to go all along. Director Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") still has the burden as did Chris Columbus who directed the previous entries of fashioning a film that works as a discrete entity and yet doesnt disappoint the legions of fans for whom the movie can only be an adjunct to the reading experience. The strain is sometimes felt. Too much is left in and theres an uninflected quality to the movies first half hour as if everything is being given equal importance. But Cuarons respect for the material going beyond the surface enables him to steer clear of the twin traps of cuteness and meaningless freneticism. For Cuaron the movie is more than just a chance to dazzle and amuse with spectacle. The amusing dazzling spectacle is there to be sure and its better now than ever arriving as it does within a context of recognizable of human emotion. Much more than its predecessors ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a movie for adults too. Of course Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is more of an adult these days and that might be a part of the change in tone. Hes a teenager now and at the start of the film its summer recess and hes living with his horrible aunt and uncle trying to resist the temptation to put a nasty spell on both of them. He finally loses his composure when his uncles sister (Pam Ferris) shows up and insults him. In retaliation he inflates her with hot air. She expands she floats she bounces gently off the ceiling goes out the window and floats up to the sky screaming all the way. Its a lovely fantasy. In its first minutes the new ""Harry Potter"" seems at pains to assure audiences that this is indeed going to be one jolly ride of a movie. So the floating-aunt sequence is soon followed by another magical bit in which Harry is whisked back to school on a three-decker bus that narrows and elongates in order to pass through dense traffic. Again the effects are expertly done but the scene plants a suspicion that the movie will be nothing but an amalgam of computer sequences. That turns out not to be the case though the suspicion takes some minutes to go away. Harry is always in danger. This time its because Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) the man who may have been responsible for the death of Harrys parents has escaped from prison and is now looking to find Harry. In setting up protection for Harry and his fellow students the administrators of Hogwarts bring in monstrous guards known as Dementors. These Dementors read the mind of their adversaries and take the form of that which most terrifies them. Its an obvious but concise and vivid rendering of mental illness to be made helpless by ones own fears. Because Harrys own past is darker than those of his fellow students he has a particularly adverse reaction to the presence of the Dementors and must take special training under the Dark Arts professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to learn to manage his fear. Thewlis (""Naked"") is an actor of demonstrable intensity but he wisely holds back playing Lupin as one of those quiet relaxed teachers who by their comforting example communicate to youngsters the illusion that the adult world is manageable. Its Lupins job to teach Harry to face down the Dementors by fixing in his mind a happy meaningful memory. Its a measure of novelist J.K. Rowlings sophisticated understanding of memory that the most powerful recollection Harry can summon is of something he cant quite be sure ever happened. Emma Thompson has a funny turn as a tactless and flighty professor of divination and Michael Gambon as headmaster Dumbledore proves a droll replacement for the late Richard Harris. As it hurtles toward the finish the movie doesnt shortchange the action but neither does Cuaron feel obligated to end the film with a special-effects orgy. The result is a climax thats rooted in character -- Hermione (Emma Watson) especially has an opportunity to shine -- and thats lively and aglow with imagination rather than frantic and insistent. Like the film itself its a finish big enough to impress but not so brash as to obscure a pervasive undertone of real adult sadness. Thats something new for ""Harry Potter"" and the best hope yet that this franchise will not just continue but grow. -- Advisory This film contains fantasy violence and scary monsters.

"The Best Yet - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections The Best YetMovies - REVIEW - `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanThanks To A New Director And Sharp Acting The Newest Harry Potter Adventure Is An Enchanted Delight.June 4 2004|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticThird times the charm for Harry Potter the amazing boy wizard whose much-awaited film No. 3 opens today.His first movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone wasnt bad. His second Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was like a spiffier version of the first.FOR THE RECORD -  CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED JUNE 8 2004 A trivia quiz on Page 29 of Fridays Calendar section accompanying a review of the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban contained two questions that were worded incorrectly. Question No. 3 should have read ""What should you consume after coming in close contact with a Dementor?"" The extra-credit question should have read ""What words should you recite to open the Marauders Map when you first touch it with a wand?""Both (especially Chamber) worked well enough as adaptations of J.K. Rowlings fine witty novels. But neither had much independent movie magic.Thats whats so different about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. While its true to Rowlings spirit it also contains a distinctively cinematic energy.This one is really a movie.As Harrys devoted readers already know Prisoner of Azkaban tells the story of the 13-year-old wizards encounter with Sirius Black an escaped prisoner who is said to want to kill our boy.""You are in danger"" confides Mr. Weasley -- father of Harrys close friend the perpetually nonplussed Ron Weasley -- pulling Harry aside ""grave danger.""Nevertheless Harry attempts to carry on with his studies at his beloved Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry alongside Ron and their third musketeer the studious Hermione Granger.Screenwriter Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) is back on board. And the main cast hasnt changed drastically despite some newcomers and the replacement of the late Richard Harris by Michael Gambon (Open Range) in the role of Hogwarts bushy-faced headmaster Albus Dumbledore.So why is Prisoner of Azkaban so different from its predecessors?Wizardly Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron takes over for the mugglelike Chris Columbus. A gifted filmmaker Cuaron directed A Little Princess the 1995 gem of a childrens film that is said to have impressed Rowling. (In grown-up circles hes known for 2001s superb sexually charged coming-of-ager Y Tu Mama Tambien.)The most obvious difference between Columbus and Cuaron is that the former relied too much on close-ups as if he envisioned everything in terms of a TV screens talking heads. Cuaron prefers to pull the camera back so that we can take in how the characters relate to each other and to their often- eerie environments.One of the best sequences comes early when the triple-decker Knight Bus unexpectedly arrives to pick Harry up. The magical vehicle swerves through city streets at super-speed suddenly and inexplicably contracting to squeeze through tight spots.Another high point is Harrys flight on Buckbeak a half-horse half-eagle creature known as a Hippogriff. Watching that scene you feel as if youre flying too.Even things weve seen before such as the great hall at Hogwarts somehow appear different as if a wand had been waved over them. Has Hedwig Harrys messenger owl ever seemed so sleek and snowy?Cuaron doesnt like to repeat things from the earlier films unless he can give them a twist. He sets the new films Quidditch match (basically lacrosse on broomsticks) in a storm with umbrellas whizzing by and the scary guards known as Dementors wafting their menacing way through the game.At two hours 22 minutes Prisoner of Azkaban is the shortest of the Harry Potter movies. But like the others it bogs down in the middle; theres a lot of plot to get through.You accept that more easily this time though partly because the performances are sharper than ever.Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron have learned to play off one another smoothly and to sharpen their characterizations. Harry is more rebellious Hermione is more endearingly vulnerable and Ron well is more Ron.Some regulars -- including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Julie Walters (Calendar Girls) as Rons mom -- appear only briefly. Others including Alan Rickman (Love Actually) as the severe Professor Snape Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid and Tom Felton as the malevolent Draco Malfoy have more to do and are still reassuringly their old selves.An especially welcome addition is David Thewlis (Naked Besieged) as Professor Lupin the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. His loping performance is amusing before you know Lupins secret and even more amusing afterward.Also very welcome is Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility) as Professor Trelawney an expert in ""divination"" who wears Coke-bottle-thick eyeglasses. Theres so much desperate life in Thompsons performance that you wish the film could stop and tell her story.The cast also includes Richard Griffiths Fiona Shaw and a brilliantly feral Timothy Spall.And lets not forget Gary Oldman (Bram Stokers Dracula) a terrific choice for the role of Sirius Black because the escaped prisoner must remain mysterious until near the end. One of Oldmans specialties after all is creating coherent characters with seemingly contradictory traits.The grand plan calls for seven Harry Potter books and presumably seven Harry Potter films. And so far the filmmakers have managed the near-miraculous.Although most film series get progressively worse each of these films has improved on the last.

RELATED  CNN/Money Harry Potter Hot or not?  An older darker Harry Potter  UK fans flock to Potter premiere  Potter star suspects Harry may die  NYC spellbound at Potter premiere YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Daniel Radcliffe J.K. Rowling Movies or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Im just wild about Harry. ""Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban"" the third in the series of movie adaptations of J.K. Rowlings wildly successful Harry Potter books is an utter delight. ""Azkaban"" leaps into a much darker universe while still retaining all the mystery magic and charm of the first two movies. This is due in large part to the presence of a new creative force in the directors chair Alfonso Cuaron. Chris Columbus who directed parts one and two of the series has stepped down -- while remaining one of the producers -- to let Cuaron (who was approved by Rowling) add his voice to the Potter films. Cuaron best known for his award-winning film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" makes wonderful fluid use of the camera darting through clocks and mirrors as he guides his characters from childhood into their more serious teenage years.The story begins with a bang when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) -- once again spending his summer with his dismal relatives the Dursleys -- loses his cool by blowing his obnoxious Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) up into a balloon after she harasses him one too many times.Fearing reprisal from the Dursleys and the Ministry of Magic Harry runs away from home only to be picked up by the magical Knight Bus a rollicking triple-decker vehicle which whisks him away to the Leaky Cauldron pub. There he is met by the Minister of Magic. Much to Harrys surprise and relief he isnt punished for practicing magic out of school. Instead the Minister is just happy hes safe and sends him off to his third year at Hogwarts. On the way there he meets up with his good friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Sirius -- and dangerousIt appears that bigger things are afoot than a little mal-practice of magic. A dangerous wizard Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison something no one has ever been able to do before and hes believed to be on his way to Hogwarts. Black is thought to be responsible for leading Lord Voldemort to Harrys parents and therefore to their ultimate deaths. Now it is feared that hes set his designs on Harry. Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman has escaped from Azkaban prison in new Potter film.Seeking to find Black are the Dementors a group of terrifying Azkaban guards now surrounding Hogwarts. The Dementors suck the soul from their victims and seem especially attracted to Harry while at the same time theyre supposed to be protecting him and the other students from Black. Coming to Harrys rescue is a new character Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) whose specialty is Defense Against Dark Arts -- as Potter readers know a fateful position to have. Lupin teaches Harry how to use the a special charm to shield himself from the Dementors.Other new additions to the cast include Divination Professor Sibyl Trelawney played with great gusto by Emma Thompson and a divine creature called Buckbeak a hippogriff -- half horse half eagle -- introduced into the story by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). After many adventures including the mysterious appearances and disappearances of Hermione Harry is finally confronted by the evil wizard -- Sirius Black himself.Aging well The latest Harry is 13 years old and finding confidence within himself.As always it is impossible to take your eyes off Oldman whenever hes on screen. Black is a major character in the Harry Potter saga and Oldman -- haunted unkempt weirdly magnetic -- brings a wonderful complexity to the role. As for the three main characters they are all maturing well with no signs of those sometimes awkward teenage phases many of us know so well. Theyre also starring in the next installment ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" That film is currently in production and will be helmed by yet another director Mike Newell. Its set to be released in 2005.Its safe to say that the mythology of Harry Potter is creating one of the most successful film franchises in Hollywood history and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a top-notch entry. Indeed if theyre all this good Id be happy to see a Harry Potter movie come out every year until hes collecting retirement.""Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban"" opens nationwide on Friday June 4 and is rated PG.

Hope rising In the very first frames new director Alfonso Cuaron - the arty Mexican who explored youthful hormones with gleeful zest in Y Tu Mama Tambien - eases his camera through the pitch black night and into the darkened bedroom of Harry Potter who a card-carrying teenager now is seen huddled under the covers with one shadowy hand engaged in a clearly furtive activity and - say it isnt so - could it be that our little wizard is playing with his wand? Hope dimmed Alas it is literally so - our little wizard is playing with his wand. Again. Nope that opening gag may be on the saucy side but dont expect Cuaron to stir any truly hot tamales into J. K. Rowlings recipe for success. Neither she nor her books legions of devoted readers would stand for such pernicious tampering. Thats not to suggest Cuaron who took over from the faithful if pedestrian Chris Columbus hasnt put his own stamp on the series third instalment. This chapter has an entirely different look - gone are the faux Victorian touches in with a vengeance are the moody Gothic elements.Whereas Columbus took a gander at the orphaned Harry and saw a Dickensian hero packed off to a snooty boarding school Cuaron heads straight into the shadows. Instead of Copperfield and class he sees castles and monsters - dark castles multiple monsters. Folks who like their kiddie flicks to be primarily visual drenched in atmosphere and garlanded in style will applaud the changes. Those who prefer an engaging narrative and developed characters will not. This superannuated kid does not. From my doddering perspective - rheumy with a view - Volume 3 puts plenty of cinema into the picture but leeches all the charm out of the tale.After that naughty giggle in the opening frame and before the Gothic trappings get firmly appliqued the early scenes allow us to regain our Potter bearings by recycling some familiar tropes. Once more Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) gets tormented by his Muggle guardians; this time his teeny self rebels and with a practised flick of that wand he inflates an already puffy aunt to Goodyear proportions then floats her off into the blue yonder. Sayonara Colonel Blimp.Cue the usual bizarre conveyance that transports our lad out of Muggle-land and toward the Hogwarts Academy - neither train nor flying car here but a magical mystery bus three-decks high (yep more is less). Of course this leads to the proverbial reunion with his bosom pals Ronald (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) who are themselves showing signs of hormonal eruption - shes armed with a training bra for this campaign and keeps shooting amorous glances in Rons receptive direction.Meanwhile the faculty are assembled as always in roles seemingly designed to provide gainful if cameo employment to half the British acting community - Alan Rickmans Snape Maggie Smiths McGonagall Robbie Coltranes Hagrid Michael Gambons Dumbledore (Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris although - wigged and costumed as he is - youll barely notice the change).You will however spot the directorial touches at this stage. Hogwarts has become a decidedly creepier place as if it got spirited out of England and plunked down somewhere in Transylvania. Cuaron repeatedly employs a wide-angle lens to deepen the spooky atmosphere and has a further habit of angling sharp objects directly at the camera creating a kind of ersatz 3-D effect.The purpose? Perhaps to cash in on the films further release in IMAX theatres. The result? Less visually dazzling than inadvertently comic. As for the deliberate comedy Emma Thompson pops up as a jabbering sorcerer with a PhD in the neglected field of tea-leaf divination; whats more shes equipped with her own wide-angle lens - a pair of Coke-bottle glasses that make her eyes bulge out like blue pop tarts on an ivory saucer. On the dramatic half of the ledger the always compelling David Thewlis is a welcome addition in the friendly personage of Professor Lupin. Well apparently friendly - in that lupine surname Latin students will hear the promise of a plot-turn whenever the full moon comes out.Actually its devilish plot-turns are the movies undoing. First theyre not devilish enough - this chapter lacks a singular villain. Timothy Spall and Gary Oldman put in a bid and given his characters moniker - Sirius Black - youd figure the smart money would be on Oldmans efforts. But (and heres the second problem) the narrative twists keep undercutting the villainy adding dollops of grey to the moral universe. Now youd think this would be a commendable advancement on the usual white hat/black hat scenario; unfortunately the grey areas come to seem more confusing than complicating. Frankly as the abrupt end nears the yarn is hard to follow without the help of a cheat sheet - preferably a 10-year old keener steeped in the tomes.Consequently in a series thats episodic by definition too many of these episodes lack any climax or payoff. Cuaron compensates with his visual flourishes - like the ghostly presence of the Dementors a squad of spectral security guards with soul-sucking talents. Or like the sight of Harry in mid-ascent on the back of the Hippogriff a newly-minted beast thats half-horse and half-eagle and as seen in soaring flight all-thrills. But another aerial sequence the de rigueur game of quidditch is a lot less successful. Shot among leaden clouds and drenched in noirish rain this one scene captures the ongoing trade-off of the whole movie - brightness and clarity sacrificed on the altar of atmosphere and mood.More to the point though these franchises are all subject to the law of diminishing returns. The first flick off the line starts as a cultural phenomenon the next gets downgraded to a cultural event and the rest soon slip into the ritualized haze of a cultural habit - the kind that die hard the kind that play to die-hards. Now ritual is reassuring and even profitable but exciting it aint - theres just no magic in old habits.Potters past adventuresHarry Potter andthe Philosophers StoneReleased Nov. 16 2001Worldwide box-office sales 976475550Production budget 125-million The Globes rating Rick Groens take ""The cast were in their element and the money was on the screen - in the vintage train and the idiosyncratic school and the costumes and the monsters and in the special effects that mimic the wand-waving magic.""Harry Potter andthe Chamber of SecretsReleased Nov. 15 2002Worldwide box-office sales 876688448Production budget 100-million The Globes rating Rick Groens take ""Its a film that will serve the Potter franchise well that will not disappoint either youngsters or their parents and that bears the markings of its solid studio craftsmanship - worthy performances credible effects competent direction.

That competition was over -- declared a forfeit really -- as soon as the respective first installments appeared the Gandalf wizard movie vanquished the Harry wizard movie in thrills and technical splendor artistry and maturity. But in the values Hollywood understands worldwide box-office income the first two films from the J.K. Rowling books outperformed the first two Tolkien films 1.84 billion to 1.78 billion. Reason enough to continue with the education of Harry Potter. Theres another reason. As the new Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban proves these can be smart enjoyable films if the stars are properly aligned. It helps that Azkaban has one of the strongest plots in the canon thus far. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) now 13 and in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is challenged by the escape of the notorious Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from Azkaban the Alcatraz of the wizardly world. With a new danger a new protector Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) a wise kindly gent with the habit of disappearing every few weeks then returning with unseemly scratches on his face. Aided by his school chums Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) Harry must discern protective friend from mortal foe at the risk of his life -- and of learning astonishing things about himself.

Cuaron however also made the English-language childrens film A Little Princess so he knows his way around precocious kid actors. He caught his three young leads at the right time. Uncertain in their first films they are comfortable with the camera now and have grown into their roles as into their maturing bodies. That is appropriate for this episode is a parable of puberty -- of boys bursting into young manhood when the sprouting of hair and the deepening of voices are exciting and threatening. No lad is fully prepared for this convulsive rite of passage not even a Hogwarts wizard -- of Harrys generation or the one before. Just about everything plays better this time. The production team headed by designer Stuart Craig has stopped pausing to admire its handiwork and splashed splendid images on the screen at a brisk pace. Azkaban conjures up a purple triple-decker bus (it can instantly slim itself to pass between two vehicles) a Monster Book of Monsters (it snarls at Harry then scoots under his bed) and Buckbeak the hippogriff (a wonderfully realistic creature with an unpredictable personality). And does it all without preening. Perhaps realizing that 2 1/2 hr. is a marathon length for a bedtime story screenwriter Steve Kloves tried a few changes to make this one 15 min. shorter than the first Potter film and 25 min. shorter than the second take the story at a sauntering pace; ditch the Quidditch mostly; and (wed argue with this choice) drop the novels most arresting scene a flashback to an earlier band of Hogwarts students on a cross-species nighttime prowl.

"Harry Potter grows up. Slate Sign In Sign Up Harry Potter grows up. Harry Potter grows up. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 3 2004 647 PM The Plot Against Harry Young wizard battles evil deals with puberty. By David Edelstein Potters hotter than ever What a bummer when that genial Hollywood company-man Chris Columbus was hired to direct the movie of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (2001). The adaptation was faithful to a fault but the picture was a bland twinkling Christmassy thing that missed or muffled the books emotional beats and it had none of the subversive energy out of which J.K. Rowlings Harry had been forged. Im not saying Rowling is some kind of Riot Grrrrl. But despite the headmistressy civility of her prose and her insistence on a disciplined and controlled nonconformity her books express a rage against a certain fascistic strain of the blue-blood English upper crust and their clueless allies the vulgarly snobbish middle-class mortals known memorably as ""muggles."" Every book begins with the lonely friendless maltreated orphan Harry shut in his room practicing his magic in secret--just as Rowling must have shut herself away to summon up the pagan fury at the core of each new adventure. At the time I suggested that a better filmmaker for Harry would be the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. And now three years later we have the third Potter picture Harry Potter and the Prisoner ofAzkaban(Warner Bros.) and look who directed it. And look how much better it is than the first two installments What a call Should I ask for a finders fee? Advertisement Well OK picking Cuaron wasnt such a stroke of genius. He directed maybe the most evocative live-action kids movie since The Black Stallion (1979) A Little Princess (1995) and his failed modern 1998 Great Expectations (set in Florida and New Yorks SoHo) was a worthy stab at re-energizing a classic. More important his approach to constructing a world on film is the opposite of Columbus. Where the latter works from the top down dollying into his lavish sets from on high Cuaron builds his scenes from below from deep inside his storybook universe. It helps that the characters emotions are so vivid. The tactile power of Cuarons filmmaking is clear from the first scene in which Harry (once more Daniel Radcliffe) is discovered under his covers in the middle of the night in that awful Dursley house doing something naughty. No its not what youre thinking Hes playing with his wand. I mean hes testing out his new potency. I mean ... Theres room for suggestiveness here because Potter isnt pre-pubescent anymore and neither is the actor. Harry is a gangly and confused English teen uncertain both of his right to express himself and the extent of his powers to do so. Hes the quintessential prickly hormonal adolescent. When a nasty aunt (Pam Ferris) insults his dead mom and dad Harry cant contain his rage and blows her up like a barrage balloon. Cuaron doesnt direct the scene for whimsy Hes one step away from some David Cronenberg vision in which shes splattered all over the walls. The entrance to Hogwarts dining hall with the Glee Club warbling ""Double double toil and trouble ... Something wicked this way comes"" is both funny and goose-bumpingly operatic. But the palette of this film is scarier The contrasts are higher the blacks deeper and Cuaron irises in and out of many scenes like a silent Expressionist master. The colors reflect a new uncertainty. Harry is in mortal danger from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) a wizard whos supposed to have it in for him and who has managed to escape from the prison Azkaban. The guards who pursue Black are possibly worse than he is cowled skeletal creatures called Dementors that suck peoples souls out of their bodies--and that take a mysterious interest in Harrys soul too. In truth those Dementors are not quite as bone-chilling as Id hoped theyd be at least compared to Peter Jacksons Ringwraiths in Lord of the Rings. But theres a chilling effect when they hover in the air and pull at their victims faces like taffy. Harrys pal Ron   (Rupert Grint) says the Dementors make him feel cold as if hell never be cheerful again--an evocative description of real adolescent depression. Cuaron is mindful of these metaphors so the movie works on more than one level. Unfortunately it isnt gangbusters on the first narrative level. Although possibly the best of the books Prisoner of Azkaban is very much a middle chapter. It loses momentum in the second half and theres no climactic wand-off with some super-villain. (Voldemort remains off-screen.) Gary Oldman can be a terrific actor but hes too finicky cold and small of spirit for Sirius Black. (Sean Bean would have been a better choice.) And Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as the top wizard Dumbledore cant resist camping it up. The happy additions are the always enigmatically lewd David Thewlis as a mysterious professor named Lupin (the name hints at his secret) and Emma Thompson as a spaced-out frizzy-haired divination instructor with glasses that triple the size of her eyeballs. Shes proof that even wizards have their New Age pseudoscientists; and she gives Emma Watsons delectable Hermione a chance to show that girls can be more healthily skeptical than boys any day. Even when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban runs down there is so much magic to marvel at the stranded wizards night bus thats like a visit from Hayao Miyazakis My Neighbor Totoro (1988) with a rasta shrunken head calling out the stops; the giant flying hippogriff with its body of a horse and head of an eagle; and the whomping willow which flings the three protagonists around in unprecedented dimensional detail. Theres a 3-D texture to those ornate corridors the oil paintings with their parallel vaudeville routines the undulating landscape and the lakes like magnificent fjords. In Cuarons hands the world of Harry Potter doesnt feel like a synthetic movie theme park anymore. Its almost real Hogwarts and all. Correction June 11 2004 The original version of this article misidentified the source of the comment on the gloominess of the Dementors. It was not Harry as we had at first but Ron. Return to the corrected sentence. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Movie 3 -- Prisoner of Azkaban A darker shade of Potter - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeMovie 3 -- Prisoner of Azkaban A darker shade of PotterGlenn LovellMercury NewsPosted 06/04/2004 120000 AM PDTUpdated 06/16/2011 022038 PM PDTClick photo to enlarge<<1>>You can tell ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is going to be a different kind of Harry Potter movie right from the first sepia-toned shot. Our just-turned-13 hero though still a summer captive of Aunt and Uncle Dursley has undergone a personality makeover Hes moodier now more intense than he was in the first two installments. And as his expansive hello to a horrid visitor makes clear he refuses to take guff from anyone. None of which will come as a surprise to fans of the J.K. Rowling novels. The boy wizard (again played by Daniel Radcliffe) -- about to embark on his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- is growing up passing from confused child to testy teen and his conduct now is anything but servile and acquiescent. Hes about to take firmer control of his destiny and with the help of the overachieving Hermione (Emma Watson) and the impulsive Ron (Rupert Grint) to learn more about the deaths of his parents at the hands of Dark Lord Voldemort. Something else youll want to know about this installment especially if youre planning on taking preschool or elementary-age Potter fans Directed by Mexicos Alfonso Cuaron (``A Little Princess ``Y Tu Mama Tambien) its much darker in mood and look than its predecessors and it moves much faster refusing to coddle or spoon-feed those who havent seen the first two movies or read the books.Advertisement This is both asset and detriment Its good in that this one is more purely visual than the others. Indeed its the first real Potter movie. Its problematic because skipped subplots secret alliances and Rowlings made-up terms (animagus patronus etc.) may lead to ``Huh? What? confusion. But dont let that deter you. Were in very good hands with Cuaron and returning screenwriter Steve Kloves who somehow have talked the controlling Rowling into sacrificing plot twists secondary wizards and bits of hocus-pocus for swifter pacing and a more manageable running time. (At 2 1/2 hours this is by far the shortest of the Potter adaptations.) And since this one is more character study than Re-Intro to Hogwarts 101 the digital wizardry has been used sparingly to forward the intricate mystery/time-travel plot and not as before as so much eye-popping window dressing. This translates into fewer but better effects. Besides the now-familiar castle ghosts and talking paintings we get a triple-decker bus that collapses like an accordion in traffic a wardrobe full of boggarts (conjured from each students worst fears) the banshee-like Dementor guards and for the Forbidden Forest climax a very different looking werewolf. A happenin Hippogriff The half-horse half-eagle Hippogriff -- wisely thinned from Rowlings herd to a single majestic specimen -- is without question the best new beastie. Introduced by Hagrid the Giant (Robbie Coltrane) who has been promoted to teacher the griffin-like creature is straight out of an Arabian Nights yarn and has the heft and stylized look of a vintage Ray Harryhausen creation from ``The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Harry gets a royal tour of Hogwarts aboard the flying Hippogriff as John Williams lovely score keeps time and the creature dives toward a shimmering lake dipping its talons gracefully in the water. This easily is the goose-bump highlight of the third Harry Potter movie which overall is much earthier and more naturalistic than the others. Cuaron has elected to shoot more of the action on location in Scotland rather than on London soundstages. As soon becomes clear this more-realistic look is well-suited to the psychological tone of the plot. Once he runs away from ``home and his Muggle aunt and uncle Harry learns that a ``murderous raving lunatic named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban a maximum security prison for wizards and is gunning for Harry who as an infant stopped his boss Voldemort from returning to power. Weaving their magic Standing between Harry and a bad end are a number of returning wizards -- Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and headmaster Dumbledore (a glum Michael Gambon subbing for the late Richard Harris) -- and a couple of new ones the ragtag but resilient Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and the hilariously theatrical psychic Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson peering through huge magnifying glasses). The contemptuous Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and the chief of the Slytherin-dorm bullies Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) are again allied for evil. Draco if possible has become even more of a weasel and a coward especially when confronted by Hermione who as played by Watson comes this close to unseating Harry as the real hero of the piece. Meanwhile Harry plays a halfhearted game of Quidditch and wrestles with soul-sucking demons within. In the book the magical Marauders Map holds the secret to Sirius Blacks true character and long-ago associations. The movie tosses out much of this backstory which will be good news to casual fans who begin checking their watches at two hours but heresy to Rowlings most avid readers who argue that longer is better even if it isnt more cinematic.

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban ) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (United States/United Kingdom 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its interesting to note that of the three Harry Potter novels thus far filmed the longest on the written page has turned into the shortest on screen. This is a good thing because it means that the filmmakers are becoming less literal and more cinematic in their adaptations. A flaw of the first two movies Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is that they tried to cram every nuance into the screenplay - an act that had a negative impact upon the films pacing. For Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban script-writer Steve Kloves has pared J.K. Rowlings story to its essence resulting in a more streamlined motion picture. Although Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands well enough on its own it has a ""middle chapter"" feeling. In other words theres no real beginning or ending. Little is resolved and the films climax is low-key. The villain of the first two chapters and the overall series the dreaded Voldemort is absent. His apparent replacement is Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) although appearances can be deceiving. All of this doesnt make The Prisoner of Azkaban inferior to its predecessors. The appeal is much the same but the ""feel"" is a little different. The tone is darker and more claustrophobic. I attribute this to the change in directors. Chris Columbus who helmed the first two movies has stepped into the producers chair leaving the primary behind-the-camera duties to Alfonso CuarA3n (who establishes this closer in nature to A Little Princess than Y Tu Mama Tambien). If theres a theme to The Prisoner of Azkaban its ""something wicked this way comes."" Those lyrics rattle around in the brain even before they make an explicit appearance. There are plenty of candidates for who can fill the ""wicked"" role the convicted killer Sirius Black who apparently is determined to eliminate Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe); the vile Dementors who are pursuing Black and look like Ghosts of Christmas Future; nasty Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) the school bully; or Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) who dresses in black and sneers most wonderfully. For Harry now in his third year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry it becomes increasingly difficult to tell friend from foe. While there are no questions about his best pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) nor about Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) what about the secretive new professor Lupin (David Thewlis)? Or Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thomspon) who sees ominous things in crystal balls? For Harry surviving his encounters with Sirius Black and the Dementors means unraveling the truth about whose betrayal of his parents led to their deaths. Theres no question that CuarA3n has put his stamp on this movie. The return of so many familiar characters will keep viewers comfortable but the stylistic changes make it seem as if this Harry Potter adventure is taking place in a different universe. The most obvious change is to Hogwarts. Although outwardly the same the school is photographed and presented in a manner that makes it more ominous and less friendly than in the previous two installments. Wardrobe is another seemingly minor yet significant alteration. Harry Ron and Hermione have abandoned the school uniforms that were their standard garb in The Sorcerers Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. Instead they dress in ""normal"" clothing sweatshirts jeans sneakers etc. This has the effect of making Hogwarts feel more alien than before. Moments of character development are widely spaced. (That has a lot to do with the deeper cuts made to the source material.) Still we learn a few things about Harrys background. The Malfoy/Potter feud enters another chapter. And we see the beginnings of a tentative affection between Ron and Hermione. (The two of them exchange glances and hold hands. Theres little question where Rowling is going with this relationship especially considering the predictability of romance in fantasy stories.) As in all long-running series there are some comings and goings. Although Kenneth Branagh is not back (nor was it expected that he would return considering the fate of his character) his ex-wife Emma Thompson joins the cast as the eccentric professor of divination. She doesnt have much screen time but makes an impression. David Thewlis a solid character actor is Professor Lupin. As Dumbledore Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris without missing a beat - some viewers may not even notice the change in actors. The most significant newcomer may be Gary Oldman. Its a tricky role that he handles deftly. Finally Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese) didnt just end up on the cutting room floor - he was excised from the screenplay. Since even a little Cleese is better than no Cleese heres hoping he makes a return in the future. The lead trio - Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - are growing at about the same rate as their characters. All are likable and recognizable and the hope is that they will be able to continue in these roles until the series ends. (Re-casting any of the parts mid-stream would be a mistake.) Of the three Radcliffe is the weakest actor but Harry Potter isnt the kind of character who demands amazing range. As Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill wasnt a world-class thespian but despite his shortcomings would anyone have preferred to see him replaced midway through the original Star Wars trilogy? The recent bankability of fantasy has resulted in a large number of copycat possibilities entering the production pipeline. With both The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter movies proving to be solid box-office performers theres little question that the genre is here to stay. Although Tolkiens story is done J.K. Rowlings has at least four more installments to go (the final two of which havent even been published). If the filmmakers continue to keep the quality level high there will be plenty of pleasurable hours ahead. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban proves that a new director with a different perspective can freshen a series that could otherwise resort to stale repetition.

Rowlings Harry Potter universe Columbus - the one-time protege of Steven Spielberg - never captured the soul of the books just their special effects. Certainly in the first two films the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry looked amazing with its M.C. Escher stairways and wild and woolly Quidditch field and the secret worlds beyond the grasp of us earthbound Muggles were re-created with awe-inspiring detail. Too much awe in fact - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his schoolmates seemed forever gazing up mouths agape eyes a-poppin boggled.From the get-go Azkaban directed by Alfonso CuarAn is better. Brooding bespectacled Harry at home for summer with his adoptive (and abhorrent) Dursley clan loses his temper at the dinner table. Really loses it unleashing a mighty spell on his visiting aunt - turning her into a human zeppelin sailing aloft into the English skies screaming. Its a big no-no misusing your powers of magic like that but theres a wonderful glint of triumph in Harrys eye a bit of teenage rebellion. Yes hes 13 now.The jumbled battlements of Hogwarts Castle when Harry Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) arrive there for the start of their third year appear more rooted to a place - specifically to a hilly lakeside land with an imposing wood and rock-sharded grounds. When theyre out of their school uniforms and wearing sneakers corduroys and hoodies the three Gryffindor pals look as if theyre in Nick Drake country shaggy young hipsters traipsing through beautiful melancholy old Britain draped in mist and mystery.The titular villain of The Prisoner of Azkaban is one Sirius Black (played by Gary Oldman when he finally shows up) a legendary figure linked to the dastardly Lord Voldemort - and hence to Harrys parents untimely deaths. Harry is warned that Sirius escaped from jail is now out to kill him too. Siriusly. Those few souls (what - three people in Iceland maybe?) who remain unfamiliar with the Rowling books or the previous pics may find themselves befuddled by the references to Voldemort and all the Hogwarts intrigue but fear not. There are more pressing matters.Along with a returning retinue that includes the blackhearted student Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) the scowling sourpuss Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) the gigantic eccentric Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Hogwarts creaky headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon taking over from the departed Richard Harris) new faculty - and new creatures - are on the scene. Foremost among these is Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) a kindly tutor in the defense of the dark arts who takes Harry under his wing but whose scarred visage portends a troubled past - and perhaps a troubled present. The relationship between Lupin and Harry is at the emotional heart of The Prisoner of Azkaban along with the fast friendship of Harry Hermione and Ron. The threesome are truly that - watching each others backs thinking each others thoughts.Of the non-human newcomers to populate CuarAns movie Buckbeak a half-horse/half-eagle ""hippogriff"" who appears to have stepped out of a Ray Harryhausen fantasy steals the show. Clumsy on the ground and graceful in the air this huge beast is not just a special- effects marvel but a character that without uttering a word figures prominently in the tale.CuarAn who scandalized his native Mexico two years ago with the mAnage A trois road pic Y Tu MamA TambiAn (but also has a Hollywood childrens classic under his belt 1995s A Little Princess) is as interested in relationships - alliances rivalries secret histories budding romances even - as he is in animatronics and CGI. The result is a movie that feels more substantive and has more heart.Occasionally the Hogwarts huggermugger gets ahead of itself or bogged down in detail. And this viewer at least found the digitally created Dementors - deathly phantoms assigned to guard Hogwarts from intruders but with indiscriminate vigilance against both friend and foe - to be disappointing.But in the end Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban offers what neither of its predecessors for all their wand-waving and witch-brooms had real magic.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (out of four stars)Director got the potion right for Prisoner of AzkabanProduced by David Heyman Chris Columbus and Mark Radcliffe directed by Alfonso CuarAn written by Steve Kloves from the novel by J.K.

Running time 141 minutes. Rated PG (frightening moments creature violence mild language). At the Astor Plaza the Union Square the Cinema 1 others. FINALLY on the third try they got a Harry Potter movie right. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" directed with immense flair by Alfonso Cuaron is darker and grittier than its two predecessors. And unlike the earlier movies ""Azkaban"" isnt weighed down and dragged out to punishing length by an attempt to faithfully render every possible detail of J.K. Rowlings book. By portraying its central characters more realistically as adolescents with an array of serious emotional issues - and even putting them in more contemporary clothes in some scenes - Cuaron makes the magic that much more magical. The big issue for aspiring wizard Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) this time around is anger management. He finally blows his stack at the Dursleys his overbearing foster parents and violates the wizard rules by using magic to turn a particularly obnoxious relative into a Monty Pythonesque human balloon. Harry expects to be punished by the wizard authorities after a fantastical ride on a triple-decker bus but theyve got bigger worries. It seems that Sirius Black (a somewhat under-used Gary Oldman) a former friend of his late parents who was convicted of involvement in their deaths has escaped from the Azkaban prison. To protect Harry the prisons guards - the hooded soul-sucking and deadly Dementors - have been posted at Hogwarts which is no longer the whimsical (Nearly Headless Nick is A.W.O.L.) and golden-hued institution of wizardly learning it was in the past. The distressed Harry is taken under the wing of yet another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the tweedy and mysterious Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) who was also a friend of his murdered parents. Also new to the faculty is Emma Thompson as the wacky professor of divination with Coke-bottle glasses who provides much needed laughs. Another great British actor Michael Gambon takes over from the late Richard Harris to play a more hippie-ish and subversive Dumbledore; and Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith return as the grumpy Snape and McGonagall respectively though Smith has little more than a cameo. And the lovable giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) has been promoted at least temporarily to the faculty. But this movie belongs to its young stars who have grown immensely as actors since they were first ideally cast by Chris Columbus the hack who directed the first two movies. There are hormonal stirrings between Ron Weasley (the rubber-faced Rupert Grint) who is more fearful than previously (sometimes with very good reason) and the brilliant Hermione Granger (the increasingly beautiful Emma Watson). Hermione has developed the trick of being in two places at the same time - a skill she puts to very good use in the climactic sequence. Cuaron the lyrical Mexican director of the superb ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (as well as Hollywoods ""A Little Princess"") strikes exactly the right balance between scariness and magic - the latter best represented by Harrys ride through the air on a half-horse half-eagle called a hippogriff. The director worked with Steven Kloves (who also wrote the first two movies) to pare down Rowlings book to the essentials achieving a brisk pace by losing the plodding exposition that slowed things down previously. The difference is best illustrated by the Quidditch sequence - theres just one of these wizardly games its in driving rain and its over quickly and really violently. ""Harry Potter and the Wizard of Azkaban"" is precisely the kind of invention the franchise needed and Warner Bros. deserves enormous credit for going with Cuaron who never directed a blockbuster before.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out?

With Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson. DirectorAlfonso Cuaron. At area theaters (220). Rated PG Frightening moments creature violence and mild language. 3.5 Stars. Harry Potter faces his inner demons with a maturity way beyond his 13 years in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a thrilling highly entertaining and somewhat darker addition to the franchise about a young magician with the mark of greatness on him. The official opening day is tomorrow but Harry will rush into certain area theaters at midnight tonight with the same eagerness with which he flees his clueless aunt and uncle for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is an entrancing experience for Potter fans. Its a carefully crafted dreamy immersion in a world that feels snugly familiar even when evil intrudes. Dark beings that suck out your soul a maniac on the loose a winged Hippogriff that favors only the wary rider strange new teachers at the chalkboards - why it must be third year at Hogwarts that place of magic and wonderment created by the pen of J.K. Rowling. This chapter deserves to be pressed in the book of childhood memories. It is certainly the most satisfying of the Potter movies. Its also a more mature Harry Potter. Speaking of maturity - though the kids are supposed to be 13 the actors look like they are approaching adulthood. Its not a bad thing. Charismatic Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and the appealingly goofy Rupert Grint (Ron) are poster-ready for the ceilings of adolescent girls everywhere. And the seriously beautiful Emma Watson (Hermione) is developing nicely not only in her acting abilities. In this third installment of the series with a smart screenplay that adheres closely enough to the book for diehards our hero Harry has a lot on his plate. He still has his usual childhood preoccupations catching the Golden Snitch for his Quidditch team (during a breathtaking thunderstorm) hanging with pals Ron and Hermione and studying hard - for the ""Harry Potter"" books are above all about the love and magic of learning. But Harry is also being stalked by Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) a presumed maniac who has escaped from the wizards prison at Azkaban. Sirius is said to be the insider who betrayed Harrys parents to You-Know-Who all those years ago. (Okay well tell you Lord Voldemort already twice vanquished in the previous Potter movies.) Harrys confrontation with Sirius is important to the story. But the movie also cleverly explores more universal adolescent concerns like hormonal tempests. Harry is moodier and less compliant this time around. His search for a father figure has become more pronounced and has not lost its mournful quality. Among his initiations into adulthood Harry learns to confront his worst fears in Hogwarts Defense of the Dark Arts class with Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). There are other new faces at Hogwarts most notably Michael Gambon as the wise and good Prof. Dumbledore a role left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. An inspired addition to the regulars is Emma Thompson as a ditzy Divinations professor who sees only doom in the tea leaves. Other new faces - except they dont have faces - are the Dementors nasty floaty dark things that suck the joy of life from their environs. Theyve been sent to patrol Hogwarts but like any independent militia they often cross the line of duty. They are rendered in bone-chilling computer-generated imagery. If ""Azkaban"" is darker it is partly due to the more serious path Rowling has taken over the course of her books. The path mimics the road to adulthood but it also widens the scope of Harrys world to include social struggles and racial prejudice. Key to handling this material was the magnificent choice of Alfonso Cuaron to direct. Hes best known for the sexy ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" but he also made ""A Little Princess"" a movie in which childhood is portrayed as a changeable landscape of magic sadness and dependency.

"Conjuring up the magic - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (movie)NEWS amp; REVIEWS | MOVIE REVIEW Conjuring up the magicAlfonso Cuaron brings a darkly expressive edge to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.June 03 2004|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer The escape of renegade wizard Sirius Black from a hellish incarceration is the plot mechanism that drives ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the third in a never-ending series of adaptations of J.K. Rowlings phenomenally popular novels.But the more pressing issue is whether the films talented director Alfonso Cuaron can escape the prison constructed for him by the man who directed the first two Chris Columbus. The answer is yes but just barely and true to the tradition of adventure yarns only at the last minute.Actually make that the last 60 minutes. For the final hour of the two-hour-and-21-minute ""Azkaban"" is the closest any of the films has gotten to capturing the enormously pleasing essence of the Potter books.The fact that it took Cuaron who last did the exceptional ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" so much time to break free says a lot about how much individuality and personal expression any director no matter how gifted can bring to a moneymaking franchise of such fecundity that it has to be shielded from risk at all costs.Thats why even though Cuaron -- with ""A Little Princess"" on his resume -- was one of Rowlings top choices to do the first Potter films he did not get the job. Warner Bros. instead turned to the unapologetically mainstream Columbus an unadventurous Hollywood apparatchik who ended up re-creating all the detailed surface and none of the underlying magic of the Potter books.Still that soulless fidelity went down well enough to earn the first two films some 1.8 billion worldwide enough to ensure that any director would be too straitjacketed by what had come before to put his own stamp on the material and make a truly great film.So Cuaron who used the same writer (Steven Kloves) production designer (Stuart Craig) composer (John Williams) and trio of leads as the previous two films did ended up putting the best face on a problematic situation.""I think Chris created a very elegant universe"" he told one reporter. ""It would have been not only irresponsible but also stupid to come and say OK just for the sake of change lets change all this stuff that is working fantastically well.""And even if Cuaron had wanted to Columbus had installed himself as a producer on ""Azkaban"" with a particular goal in mind ""I wanted to make sure that the film didnt stray too far from the world the audience and the fans have sort of fallen in love with over the course of the first two movies"" he told The Times John Horn last year.Thanks Chris we needed that.Those three leads (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Emma Watson as Hermione Rupert Grint as Ron) play characters who are now 13 an age when anger and frustration are more publicly expressed. One of the benefits of Cuarons direction his expertise with younger actors means that the constant determination and occasional fury exhibited by the characters especially Harry and Hermione are completely convincing.And Harry raging hormones aside has a good deal to be angry about as he returns for his third year at Hogwarts. That pesky wizard Black (Gary Oldman) imprisoned for betraying Harrys parents to the dread Voldemort has apparently escaped with the termination of our young hero at the top of his to-do list.Plus with only defense-against-the-dark-arts teacher Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) on his side Harry has to deal with the black-robed Dementors those soul-destroying kiss-of-death-bestowing Azkaban prison guards who look to be the direct descendants of the similarly robed and equipped Nazgul who gave Frodo such a hard time in ""Lord of the Rings.""Rowlings ""Azkaban"" had a darker cast than the first two Potter books and its fortunate that Cuaron is a convincingly edgy director someone for whom a sense of genuine unease feels natural and appropriate.Also helpful is Cuarons ability to work with fully grown performers as well as the young adult variety.Doing especially good work are the key people new to the series. Oldman exhibits a delicacy he hasnt always shown with the character of Sirius Black and Thewlis best remembered for starring in Mike Leighs ""Naked"" brings a mature and compassionate presence to Professor Lupin. Between the two of them they do the best most realistic acting the Harry Potter films have offered to date.The rest of ""Azkabans"" new casting is regrettably uneven. Michael Gambon through no fault of his own does not have the gravitas the late Richard Harris brought to the role of Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore. Emma Thompson has been either allowed or encouraged to painfully overact as divination professor Sibyl Trelawney and Julie Christies cameo as a Hogsmead tavern functionary is even briefer than her appearance in ""Troy.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDeathly Hallows a sure bet to reign at box officeNovember 19 2010Its Harry and the hormonesNovember 6 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTHarry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (movie)Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/03/news/wk-turan3,200,harrypotterandtheprisonerofazkaban30,harrypotterandtheprisonerofazkaban,latimes
"Now its Sirius - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Now its SiriusNew director gives Potter III a darker richer glowMOVIE REVIEW Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(star)(star)(star)1/2June 03 2004|By Mark Caro Tribune movie reporter.Just as J.K. Rowlings ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" represents a step in maturity beyond the series first two books so does director Alfonso Cuarons film version improve upon its predecessors. This third ""Harry Potter"" movie shakes the candy coating off of the franchise without violating its spirit.Chris Columbus who directed the first two is skilled at assembling the elements and moving a story along but he doesnt leave behind ideas that haunt or images that linger (unless Macaulay Culkins ""Home Alone"" scream pose counts).Cuaron is one of the most gifted visual storytellers around whether hes working with the lavish production design of ""A Little Princess"" (1995) or the intimate near-verite style of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (2002). What those two very different films have in common is that the Mexican-born director goes so far beneath the young protagonists skin that you virtually can feel their hearts beating.Its no wonder then that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) comes into his own at last in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" which has the advantage of being based on an emotionally rich book that begins with him hitting the troublesome age of 13. In ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" (2001) and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" (2002) Radcliffes title character was too cute unruffled goody-goody.The Harry of the books is far more of a mischiefmaker and Cuaron and the increasingly assertive Radcliffe get the idea. You know youve entered new territory from the opening shot as Harry reads his wizard books under his bedsheets while flicking his wand furiously for light.Using magic while living with Muggles (non-magical humans in this case the beastly Dursley family) is forbidden but Harry has had enough of being treated like the black sheep. As in ""Chamber of Secrets"" the new film has Harry causing havoc in the household but Cuaron doesnt play the sequence for slapstick. When Harry casts a spell on his visiting Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) after she cruelly disparages his late parents his rage and his relatives fear become palpable.Like all of Rowlings books this episode aims for an incrementally older audience than its predecessor while covering a year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Once again Harry tries to excel in wizard training and the airborne game Quiddich while warding off the increasingly dark forces that threaten his life.This time a notorious killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) is on the loose after becoming the first-ever escapee from the famed Azkaban prison and Harry soon hears that Black is after him. Making matters worse Azkabans cloaked phantomlike prison guards called Dementors are roaming in search of Black striking our hero with fear and dread.Also fresh on the scene are new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Lupin (David Thewlis a warm lanky presence) who has a habit of protecting Harry at key moments and Divination Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson wearing Coke-bottle glasses in a comic-relief role).The usual suspects are back as well Harrys best friends regular-bloke Ron (Rupert Grint) and assertive brainiac Hermione (Emma Watson); the gentle bearish Hagrid (Robby Coltrane) who takes over the Care of Magical Creatures class with typically unwieldy results; the sneering Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) of the rival Slytherin house; the acidic Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); the stern but kindly Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Hogwarts wise eccentric headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon adding a sly twinkle as he replaces the late Richard Harris).Its hard to return to the books and not have the movies actors in your head. The same goes for the scenery as Cuaron has inherited production designer Stuart Craig and his clearly articulated vision of Hogwarts though the place has never appeared so weirdly wonderful as in our first glimpse of it here as choir singers grasping fat frogs serenade a banquet hall illuminated by airborne candles.A fresh lookCuaron makes us view the familiar with fresh eyes as he and new-to-the-series cinematographer Michael Seresin (best known for work on Alan Parker films such as ""Angelas Ashes"") abandon the verging-on-Disneyland colorfulness of the first two movies for more muted tones and film grain you practically can scrape your hand on. The camera moves more and the magical feels more real even if some of the computer-graphics work (such as on Buckbeak the Hippogriff) remains dodgy.Most important the visuals inevitably are tied to mood and feelings. When a power outage hits the students annual train ride to Hogwarts theres a beautiful faraway shot of Rons hand pressed to the window his flesh the only visible light at that moment of vulnerability.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHarry Potter The past and the futureJune 4 2004Alfonso Cuarons Signature Style Offers Unique Viewing...September 3 2013""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (PG)June 18 2004J.K.

With all due respect to Chris Columbus who has shifted from directing to co-producing while bequeathing to director Alfonso Cuaron some terrific sets and the talented screenwriter Steve Kloves the latest of Harrys excellent adventures is an inspired meeting of minds and (more to the point) hearts between Cuaron and Potter creator J.K. Rowling. In plain Potter-speak Columbus -- who directed the capable if uninspired Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and the suffocatingly dull Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets -- is a bit of a Muggle a solid citizen altogether too grounded in the common-sense world. Perhaps Columbus is too well-adjusted to commit fully to Rowlings instinctive affinity for the outsider or her grasp of that childrens power -- especially with abandoned kids like Harry -- to create parallel universes that simultaneously give shape to their darkest fears and provide them with alternative communities that redeem their loneliness. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Cuaron has explored this territory before in his adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnetts old-fashioned tale A Little Princess a small jewel of a movie about a poor little rich girl whose storytelling gifts transform her pricey boarding school from an arid emotional wasteland into a warm oasis of the imagination. Despite loud championing by the critics and a re-release by Warner Bros. the public turned its back on this exquisite picture. Theyre unlikely to do the same with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and not only because its a juggernaut going in. The movie is a marvel of special effects seamlessly hitched to a powerful coming-of-age story. Part of the secret of Rowlings success is her ability to tap into the mind of the modern adolescent a terrain mined by Cuaron in Y Tu Mama Tambien. To judge by minor sartorial upgrades (Hermione has dumped the plaid uniform for cool jeans and even Ron Weasley looks a little less as if he just rolled out of a sleeping bag) and a whiff of romance in the air Harry played once again by the cute but wanly inexpressive Daniel Radcliffe and his pals are growing up though not enough to jettison the prankish vitality that makes the Potter novels such a gas for kids of all ages. Cuaron clearly enjoys his special effects. In the priceless opening scenes Harrymisuses his powers to inflate his hated Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) and send her floating off a furious balloon popping buttons into the ether. Fleeing from his awful relatives hes picked up by a purple Knight bus a triple-decker conveyance complete with a scrofulous bus conductor and a shrunken head gabbing unstoppably in a Caribbean accent and rushed through the quiet Muggle streets to the Leaky Cauldron inn.And so to Hogwarts a haven not only for trainee wizards but for every child in the world who finds school an infinitely more inviting place to live than home. With its grumpy talking paintings and its ghosts flitting merrily through the halls Hogwarts is not just an eccentrically jolly magic castle but a safe house patrolled by the usual severe but for the most part kindly teaching staff. Michael Gambon uncharacteristically benign in his knotted beard replaces the late Richard Harris as headmaster Dumbledore and several new characters complete the picture David Thewlis as Professor Lupin a tweedy professor of the Dark Arts and an entertainingly hammy Emma Thompson as a hippie-spinsterish prof of Divination who sees big trouble in Harrys future. In fact the future has already arrived in the person of Sirius Black an escaped prisoner convicted of collaborating with the dastardly Lord Voldemort (valiantly dispatched by Harry in a previous installment) in the deaths of Harrys parents. Black has escaped from the fearsome prison of Azkaban and is headed for Hogwarts which for Harrys protection is now being guarded by the dreaded Dementors fluttering batlike creatures who suck the souls from their victims. They appear to be particularly interested in Harrys which is about to embark on its own long dark night as he tries to discover who betrayed his parents and why.Chris Columbus made the first two Harry Potter movies for the more literal-minded of Rowlings fans those who are switched on by mere wands and wizards and Quidditch matches and by getting scared out of their britches. Theres plenty to delight that constituency in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban including a shiny creature called Buckbeak half horse half eagle a total klutz on the ground and grace itself in flight. Theres a house of horrors called the Shrieking Shack a Marauders Map and a time-traveling device that adds some wicked twists to an already exhausting plot. But in the end Cuaron true to the spirit that swept through Y Tu Mama Tambien has made a Harry Potter movie for romantic explorers of the soul. If Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is Rowlings darkest novel to date it is also the clearest articulation of her sense that our most potent fears come from within. Around that proposition worked over to the point of banality by a hundred years of horror movies Cuaron creates a moody gray-and-silver Transylvanian dreamscape the kind we wake from at once sweating with terror and as satisfied as if wed exorcised a vampire ourselves. The battle between good and evil is never a simple Manichaean struggle. In fact ugliness may be a virtue and beauty suspect and what drives the story is that its hard to tell whos who. Far from being the wild-eyed wacko of the tabloids vivants that broadcast news of his escape Gary Oldmans Sirius Black is civilized and regretful a man tortured by his own conscience. Kindly Professor Lupin has his own dark secret as well and even Rons pet rat Scabbers is not what he seems. Nor in the end is Harrys family history news of which shakes the pedestal upon which hes placed his father. I dont know enough about J.K. Rowlings childhood (though Ill wager being born in a place called Chipping Sodbury was enough to cultivate her taste for Dickensian names and places) to tell what makes her cleave so sympathetically to werewolves jailbirds hairy giants and Muggle-magician hybrids like Hermione. Like many Brits Rowling is a committed populist who also never met an underdog she didnt like. In Alfonso Cuaron for the first time she has found a soul mate someone who can speak for the Frankenstein monster in all of us. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Pictures | CitywideQuerying Cuaron A word with Harrys new potterJet-lagged to the gills and exhausted by the two grinding years it has taken to make Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Alfonso Cuaron still has enough energy to talk about his debts to author J.K. Rowling and to Chris Columbus who directed the first two Harry Potter movies and co-produced the new one. ""I set out to be faithful to the spirit rather than the letter of the book"" the 41-year-old Mexican director tells me over the phone. ""On the other hand I wanted people who hadnt read the book to enjoy it too. And I wanted to give continuity to the franchise.""Cuaron clearly loves CGI effects but deploys them sparingly alongside more traditional devices. ""Theres a tendency in film to be very showy with effects"" he says. ""We tried not to be. For example I wanted to use an amazing underwater puppeteer named Basil Twist for the Dementors. But though they tested beautifully it ended up too complex and we had to use CGI. For the Knight bus though we used the oldest technique on planet Earth. We undercranked the camera so that it looked as though the [very slow-moving] cars were going at normal speed and the bus was going very fast.""Though theres no obvious connection between the subject matter of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Cuarons two previous movies A Little Princess and Y Tu Mama Tambien the director considers them thematically all of a piece. ""So far all the films Ive made have been about the search for identity about children and teenagers moving toward adult status"" he says. ""The temptation in Harry is to find a mask but then he has to deal with the fact that he had a flawed father. The search for identity is a lifelong process and whoever tells you that theyve found their identity is talking rubbish. What theyve found is a comfortable mask.""--E.T.

Posted June 16 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT When we last saw Harry Potter on screen he was going through a bit of an awkward phase. Stretchy and pale the bespectacled young wizard played by a sprouting-into-adolescence Daniel Radcliffe appeared to be touched by a force - puberty - as unruly as any otherworldly spell. But in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry has come out the other side of his growth spurt and looks all the better for it. Hes leaner more handsome and bolder than before and thats true as well of the movie itself. In ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" Harry faces down assorted foes including Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) a scraggly escaped convict who may hold a violent grudge against him and he does it with an authority he hasnt previously shown. Harry also has interludes of jaunty rapture like his soaring king-of-the-world flight aboard a Hippogriff (half horse half eagle). All of this has been staged by Alfonso Cuaron the Mexican-born director of ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (he takes the reins from Chris Columbus) with a breathless visual and dramatic flow that only underscores what buggy contraptions the other two ""Harry Potter"" films were. Shot in spooky gradations of silver and shadow ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first movie in the series with fear and wonder in its bones and genuine fun too. The droll enchantment of the ""Harry Potter"" books comes from the way that J.K. Rowling turns a childs wild and woolly dream-world of spells creatures and sky-high Quidditch matches into something scruffy and Dickensian transportingly everyday. That was the quality violated by the first two movies. Columbus staged them like the ultimate Muggle zapping you with each beastie and wizardly doodad. His tone of mechanized japery said ""Look heres the next effect The next blockbuster money shot"" What was missing was the flippant and addictive offhandedness that Rowling in her madcap stew of Roald Dahl the Hardy Boys ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" ""E.T."" and ""Star Wars"" infused into every page. Right from the start of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" when Harry confronts a tyrannical aunt by forcing a glass to break in her hand - shades of Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie"" - the supernatural in this movie has an emotional anchor and it isnt belabored. Trying to get to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that magic-mushroom vision of a British prep academy Harry boards a triple-decker bus for a ride so speedy its nutzoid as a shrunken head chatters like a refugee from ""Beetlejuice."" The whole movie zips along with a matter-of-fact cleverness that stays a step ahead of you. At Hogwarts Harry meets several new instructors like a flighty Divination professor played by Emma Thompson as the most myopic of seers (""Your aura is pulsing dear"" she quavers to one student. ""Are you in the beyond?"") and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin the requisite new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor. Asked to think of what scares them most each student readies his or her wand and the shape-shifting fiend hidden in the cupboard takes the form of their fear - until its changed into something laughable. Timid Ron (Rupert Grint) conjures a giant spider; another student calls forth Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) whose dour menace is dissipated when the boy imagines him wearing his grandmothers clothes. As for Harry his mind drifts toward one of the Dementors - no not an obscure group of psychedelic 60s garage rockers but a chilling phantom with a head like an octopus and a ghostly body of ashen black. It can suck the soul right out of you and as it looms up in class Harry can scarcely contain his tremors. The effects may have come out of a digital lab but theyre never far removed from the characters heads and hearts. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is still too long with that slightly arbitrary quality thats better filtered through the fairy-tale tranquillity of Rowlings prose. But Cuaron streamlining the book and inventing a few marvels of his own (like most of that Hippogriff ride) has gotten Rowlings spirit on screen. You can feel it in the way the paintings on the Hogwarts walls are animated in every sense yet never lose their gilded Renaissance glow or the doleful way Harry emerges from his Invisibility Cloak after hiding out from the world. The universe here is always in flux A rat turns into a ratty-looking man and Harry confronts his fears by literally stepping out of time to gawk at himself. By letting him and the series grow up a bit ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" turns kids stuff once again into serious play.

Pent-up demand should ensure magical returns initially but the unwieldy elements make it less likely to conjure up the kind of staying power exhibited by its predecessors. Much like a child going through puberty the maturation of the Harry Potter franchise has yielded awkward growing pains for the third film in the series. Visually dazzling and considerably darker than the prior incarnations the story suffers from a slightly disjointed feel that will prove less accessible to those not intimately familiar with every corner of author J.K. Rowlings world. Pent-up demand after an 18-month hiatus should ensure magical returns initially but the unwieldy elements make it less likely Warner Bros. can conjure up the kind of box office staying power exhibited by the ""Potter"" predecessors. On paper Alfonso Cuaron represented an inspired choice to inherit the series -- his most salient credit being not indie darling ""Y tu mama tambien"" but rather his radiant 1995 childrens story ""A Little Princess."" In terms of style the director immediately puts his stamp on the material by delivering a bold shift in the films color palette using muted washed-out tones that help capture a sense of wonder and foreboding. The problem is that both the narrative and Cuarons flourishes mark a rather stark departure from Chris Columbus approach of closely adhering to the books which played better with children than this film is apt to while still appealing to adults. Notably lacking is the sort of action-oriented climax that punctuated the earlier films as ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" closes with a cerebral time-traveling interlude that nearly requires a crash-course in ""Terminator"" logic. Rowlings ever-growing novels have exacerbated the adaptation process for Cuaron and writer Steve Kloves (who has scripted all three films) demanding tough choices in terms of what to keep and what to throw away. And while Potter aficionados should be able to knot the story strands others might find the connections a bit fuzzy. Entering his third year at Hogwarts school for budding wizards Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) once again is found with his disapproving Muggle family the Dursleys exacting magical vengeance on an unwelcome guest who winds up resembling Mr. Creosote in Monty Pythons ""The Meaning of Life."" Soon Harry is whisked back to school en route learning of the escape of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) -- a criminal jailed for a dozen years in the prison of Azkaban for having conspired with the dreaded Lord Voldemort to do in Harrys parents. The story takes some time reassembling familiar faces from Harrys buddies Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to nemesis Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his entourage all of whom display signs of growing older in varying (and not always flattering) degrees. The cast additions include the latest teacher of defense against the Dark Arts Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and a slightly daft professor of divination played by Emma Thompson who dives in with relish behind finger-thick glasses. Another key addition is only a new face of sorts as Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Harrys mentor Albus Dumbledore providing a somewhat less warm and avuncular presence. Unfortunately beyond the threat posed by Blacks inevitable return the pic is lacking in a strong through-line. Ghastly creatures called Dementors are unleashed to capture the fugitive and a werewolf is on the loose. Meanwhile the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) introduces students to a Hippogriff -- a Harryhausen-esque eagle-horse hybrid whose soaring feats represent the films artistic apex. Clearly theres laudable ambition in wedding a director like Cuaron with a large-scale summer entertainment but the Potter mythology -- from the assortment of characters that require servicing to the sometimes-confounding rules of wizardry -- tie his hands to an extent. In a sense each new layer tacked on complicates the juggling act even with a less rigid and literal devotion to the source than Columbus employed. What emerges then has its thrilling and even beautiful moments but never quite coalesces into a fully realized story. As such ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is actually the shortest of the three films yet at times feels like the longest. Thats no fault of the talented young performers who are ably growing up with their pubescent characters including Rons growing discomfort around Hermione. Thewlis is also fine as the most prominently featured adult while Oldman does what he can with relatively scant screen time. Once again the production is technically superior with the grimmer tone reflected even in John Williams score which seems to heighten the sense of menace in its elfin theme. The one disappointment comes in the form of the werewolf a gangly apparition that looks more cartoonish and less fearsome than it ought to be. With a sixth ""Harry Potter"" novel still to come theres hardly a danger of the franchise disappearing. And while theres no pleasure in seeing a studio possibly penalized in essence for setting its creative sights higher than might have been anticipated ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" could provide a reminder of the pitfalls in that strategy -- namely that adjusting ones aim also risks not quite hitting the target.
