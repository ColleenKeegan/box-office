BOTTOM LINE An aimless misfire from the otherwise terrific Sofia Coppola (""Lost in Translation""). CAST Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning WHEN/WHERE ""Somewhere"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 138 It opens with a successful but dissatisfied actor racing a black Ferrari in a circle passing us once twice three times more times. The film is called ""Somewhere"" so maybe youre already grokking the irony The protagonist is going nowhere. It seems impossible that this heavy-handed self-serious movie comes from writer-director Sofia Coppola who cleverly captured the surreality of celebrity life in 2003s ""Lost in Translation"" and 2006s ""Marie Antoinette."" In those movies the central figures were a middle-age man and an 18th century queen respectively; ""Somewhere"" focuses on someone perhaps too close to Coppolas age and background. His name is Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) and Coppola is so moved by his inertia that for much of the film she simply watches him do nothing. advertisement | advertise on newsday When Johnny isnt sitting and smoking in room 59 at Hollywoods legendary Chateau Marmont hotel (Benicio Del Toro shows up in the elevator) he tends to fall asleep even if theres a panting woman beneath him. He brightens somewhat around his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) so its good news for us when she visits. Whether they bond or not is unclear - they hit the pool order gelato talk about ""Twilight"" - but its better than watching cigarettes burn. Coppola still has an eye for memorably weird moments (the stripteasing twins are fascinating) but she also feels lazy. When Johnny yells something that Cleo cant hear Coppola is only ripping off her own wonderfully enigmatic ending to ""Lost in Translation."" In ""Somewhere"" that insightful filmmaker is nowhere to be found.

"Somewhere (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Somewhere (R) Writer-director Sofia Coppola pens a tender love letter to parenthood Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/19/2011 Editor rating 3.5 The best movie directors arent just masters of technical craft They also are artists capable of showing you the world through their eyes -- of making you see and feel exactly what they do. With Somewhere her fourth smallest and most risky film writer-director Sofia Coppola succeeds at the difficult task of turning moments of apparent nothingness -- a scene of a man alone in a hotel room quietly smoking; a shot of a father and daughter sunbathing at poolside -- into eloquent insights into the moods and psyches of her characters. Filmed by cinematographer Harris Savides in the seductive haze that is typical of Los Angeles Somewhere is filled with long uninterrupted shots in which little seems to happen but Coppola holds and holds on them until theyre suddenly suffused with emotion. Coppolas previous pictures (The Virgin Suicides Lost in Translation Marie Antoinette) all had an air of stylish artiness. Watching them you felt they were made by someone who was experimenting with the boundaries of conventional storytelling but still observing its confines. With Somewhere though Coppola goes whole hog into minimalist mode This is an intentionally fanciful gossamer movie extremely personal and heartfelt influenced in equal parts by Michelangelo Antonioni (although never so elusive) and Gus Van Sant (just not quite so self-conscious). On the surface the film tells the perfectly accessible story of Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a hotshot Hollywood movie star who lives in the Chateau Marmont the famed hotel that serves as hideaway (and occasional final destination) for the rich and glamorous. When hes not making a film Johnny hangs around the hotel has sex with hookers drinks and smokes attends the occasional party drives around in his black Ferrari and indulges in the occasional drug. He can have any woman he wants (his pick-up line is simply ""Hi Im Johnny"") yet his life is utterly empty and he seems neither able nor willing to do anything about filling it. In a tricky performance that often requires the actor to convey a lot of information without saying a word Dorff plays Johnny as a buoy drifting along with the current. Johnnys career has brought him great wealth and fame so he must be doing something right. But he has become completely disconnected from the world He is as bored watching twin pole-dancing strippers as he is at a press conference at which journalists lob inane questions. Then enters Cleo (Elle Fanning) his 11-year-old daughter who lives with her mother and spends the occasional weekend with her divorced dad. Cleos mom has gone away to take some time off from single parenthood and Cleo shows up at Johnnys room needing for him to be a father for much longer than usual. So Johnny incorporates his daughter into his life jetting off with her to Milan to accept an award on Italian TV or playing Guitar Hero with her and taking her to ice-skating practice. And gradually silently Cleos unconditional love for her father -- whom she doesnt fully understand but adores blindly -- changes something in Johnny. This all sounds a lot more trite than it plays because Coppola rarely spells anything out in Somewhere. Instead she simply allows her camera to observe but always points us toward memorable details. Scenes such as the one in which Cleo marvels at the size of his gigantic hotel suite in Italy make you think of Coppolas upbringing by her famous father Francis. (She was the baby being baptized at the end of The Godfather made cameos in The Outsiders and Rumble Fish when she was just about Cleos age and was torn apart by critics when she took over as Michael Corleones daughter from an exhausted Winona Ryder in The Godfather Part III.) But Coppola who currently lives in New York (after a stint in Paris) and has two children is also far enough removed from Hollywood to reflect on the movie-star lifestyle with insight and melancholy. Somewhere isnt merely about the hollowness of L.A.s fast lane or a study of moneyed West Coast ennui (such as Bret Easton Ellis minus the violence and murders). Those are shallow readings of a tender beautiful film that demands an open heart and delves into much more universal themes told strictly from a male perspective (a first for Coppola). This is a study of a Lost Boy who in the process of enjoying his impossibly pampered life forgot how to care about anything or anyone including himself. Then he remembers and climbs back on the horse. Cast Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning Chris Pontius Michelle Monaghan. Writer-director Sofia Coppola. Producers G. Mac Brown Roman Coppola Sofia Coppola.

Comments (6) click to enlarge Somewhere Rated R  98 minutes  2010 Sofia Coppola inhabits such a thick bubble of fame culture and privilege that she needed the help of novelist Jeffrey Eugenides to imagine a middle-class family in her first and best feature The Virgin Suicides (1999). Her subsequent movies as writer-director--Lost in Translation (2003) Marie Antoinette (2006) and now Somewhere--have all been meditations on the quiet suffering of the superrich in this case a scruffy divorced ennui-ridden movie star (played by the perpetually underrated Stephen Dorff). His typical evening involves twin strippers in his hotel room and a visit from his young daughter (Elle Fanning) is supposed to expose the painful emptiness of his life. Fans of Coppolas movies (and/or perfume ads) will find this free of the absurd pop-rock flourishes in Antoinette and more consistent with the skilled tonality and narrative ambiguity of Translation. But if youre impressed by the fact that this won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival go look up the price of a flight to Venice. By J.R. Jones User Rating Director Sofia CoppolaProducer G.

Focus Features Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning in director Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere"" (Focus Features) When my college chums moved to Hollywood with an aspiring actor named Brad Pitt they got a backstage pass to the spectacle of celebrity. But even the slyly self-aware Pitt hasnt made a movie as astute about stardom as ""Somewhere."" Sofia Coppola brings a privileged perspective to this dramedy about a burned-out star who warms to his estranged daughter.The center of this universe is the Chateau Marmont a hideaway hotel on Sunset Boulevard thats the temporary home of actor Johnny Marco. He is a blank slate upon which groupies and sycophants scrawl their fantasies. Between movies while he drinks and smokes in the hillside hotel his boredom is barely disturbed by anonymous angry texts and by twin strippers who bring their own poles to his room. When Johnny gets a visit from his coltish daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning enchanting) and then her mother promptly disappears to go find herself the movie star has to play a role for which hes not suited attentive father. His idea of bonding is defeating his 11-year-old daughter at Rock Band dragging her to a film festival in Rome and sharing some room service. But slowly -- and I emphasize slowly -- we see that the red-carpet lifestyle is interwoven with threads of melancholy. ""Somewhere"" is a distinctly European exercise in observational nuance and tonal restraint in which Coppola stretches static images to the breaking point. But theres a dry undercurrent of satire. When the actor is slathered with special-effects goo and left alone while the mask hardens the scene is both sad and sardonic. And when hes besieged by foreign reporters whose inane questions are lost in translation ""Somewhere"" stakes a place between Woody Allens ""Stardust Memories"" and Federico Fellinis ""81/2.""If you accept that this place is reserved for open-minded moviegoers theres pleasure on the other side of the velvet rope.

In fact the sleek 360 Modena is going around in circles (true to its name) - and then it just stops. Not much later the driver Hollywood star Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) repairs to his suite at the fabled ChAC/teau Marmont on Sunset Strip and proceeds to nod off while twin strippers do a pole dance at the foot of his bed.Somewhere then is a movie about inaction - about a thirtysomething actor who has found fame and wealth but seems to have lost any sense of purpose or passion. And like Coppolas Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette it is a film about people of privilege (celebrities royalty) sealed off in luxury - a five-star Tokyo hotel Versailles or in Somewhere the funky French Renaissance hostelry that has been home down through the decades to Marilyn Monroe Robert Mitchum John Belushi.For Johnny whose head is fogged with pharmaceuticals and booze and who shows up for a photo session to promote his latest release all disheveled and distracted (""You look great"" his leading lady Michelle Monaghan cracks bitterly) the ChAC/teau Marmont is a kind of prison. If that sounds like a clichA(c) - its lonely at the top money cant buy happiness yada-yada - indeed it is but Coppolas eye for detail her instinct for both whimsy and irony and her ability to conjure a mood through the cameras lens make the hoary truisms of Somewhere feel new and real.And then Elle Fanning enters the picture and Somewhere becomes something else. As Cleo Marcos 11-year-old daughter Fanning appears unexpectedly by her hungover fathers bed; its their day together and he has to take her to her figure-skating lesson.When Cleos mother calls later in the throes of a personal crisis and says that she has to get away Johnny becomes the designated parent. He has to take care of Cleo and take her to school - and he also takes her on a trip to a film festival in Milan.Suddenly his rudderless life - the groupies the drugs the haze the ennui - gives way to the realities of parenthood to its pressures but also to its pleasures.Dorff plays Johnny with a blankness thats fitting for the character but its a performance thats difficult to gauge. The actor has a scruffy charm and he can do drugged-out and dispirited with easy conviction. But theres an emptiness here that may not all be coming from the character or from Coppolas brushstrokes script.Fanning however radiates a spirit and sensitivity that light up the pairs scenes together. Happily preparing eggs Benedict for her dad and his personal assistant-slash-pal (Jackass Chris Pontius) or explaining the appeal of the Twilight franchise or taking in the exotic amenities of an Italian hotel or breaking into tears on a car ride Fannings Cleo emerges fully realized a smart sturdy inquisitive soul. If the relationship between Scarlett Johanssons character and Bill Murrays in Lost in Translation was a stand-in father-daughter thing in Somewhere the emotional and psychological complexities of that relationship are explored in deeper more direct ways.Ultimately Somewhere may be too static too minimalist a tale. But theres grace here in its aching assessment of loneliness in its examination of connections and family and yes in its view through the windows of the ChAC/teau Marmont into a world of casual celebrityhood.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The sound of its engine fading and cresting becomes nearly hypnotic. The extended moment teeters on the monotonous. So does one is tempted to say writer-director Sofia Coppolas fourth feature about an actor named Johnny Marco whose numb L.A. routine changes when his tween daughter comes to stay with him at the hotel where he resides. Its more complicated than that of course. Because the writer-director of ""Lost in Translation"" (2003) and ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006) has made the malaise of the privileged her special turf. Ennui is her milieu. And Coppola has a talent for revealing its existential and cultural dimensions. This gift takes her only so far this outing which has lovely performances by Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning but a central character whose melancholy doesnt quite earn its close-up. ""Somewhere"" focuses on Marco whose dim decadent routine finds a softer hue when daughter Cleo shows up for her extended visit. He is living at the famed Chateau Marmont hotel on Sunset Boulevard. Dorff and Fanning have poignant chemistry as the father and daughter pair. And Dorff all stubble and sleepy-eyed weariness brings an unexpected sweetness to Marco. He could be a lout but often seems plain exhausted. He wears a cast courtesy of a drunken mishap. He barely goes through the motions of bad-boy behavior. When he watches his private pole dancers -- played by blond twins Kristina and Karissa Shannon -- hes appreciative and looks on dreamily right before he dozes. Coppola and production designer Anne Ross have a sharp sense of detail in a film in which so much is conveyed in the items collecting on Marcos nightstand or the artwork propped against the wall still in its wrapping. ""Somewhere"" is not a movie about the film industry. We dont see Marco on location. We dont see what makes him famous. How famous? A jaunt to an Italian awards show in Milan hints at how luxury and fawning have become standard fare. Cleo is the only one whose eyes pop. There are other inklings of Marcos obligations. Hes wrangled for a media conference at which hes asked wincingly inane questions. A rich scene of the actor having his face cast for a special-effects mask underscores the weird -- even claustrophobic -- requirements of the moviemaking gig. Coppola keeps the volume on Marcos liaisons turned down. He poses with a co-star of an about-to-be-released action film (Michelle Monaghan in a quick turn). Clearly theres unpleasant history but its not teased out. He receives slightly unhinged text messages. But were not privy to the source. Even he and Cleos mother seem on fairly civil footing. This helps us detect the subtle lovely music of Marco and Cleos deepening relationship. Its gentle chords sound early when Marco takes Cleo to an ice-skating lesson. Cleo floats and turns to the strains of Gwen Stefanis ""Cool."" Sitting on some risers Marco fingers his BlackBerry. Then he starts to watch his daughter. Dorff does wonders with the gradations of Marcos attention -- from casual curiosity to pride. Its a look that heralds the beginning of something aching something beautiful.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 07 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Jun. 20 2013 434PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Sofia Coppolas film Somewhere which won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival last year has divided critics between those who find it formally audacious and moving and those who found it vacuous. The critical split may have more to do with the directors personal baggage than the quality of this wistfully sophisticated modest film about the relationship between a celebrity father and his daughter. Naysayers see Coppola as queen of the lucky club - shes the daughter of a lion of Seventies cinema Francis Ford Coppola (who was her executive producer here) and the former girlfriend of Quentin Tarantino (who headed the Venice jury).For the believers those same connections work in her favour. As well as being the heir to a golden age in American filmmaking shes the only female member in a loosely affiliated group of directors who are considered its spiritual descendants including her former husband Spike Jonze Steven Soderbergh Paul Thomas Anderson Wes Anderson Alexander Payne and Tarantino.True to her legacy Coppola brings a distinctly retro feel to Somewhere (as well as the same set of now-vintage lenses her father used to shoot Rumble Fish). The movie can be seen as a throwback to what critic Robert Kolker called the Seventies ""cinema of loneliness."" The mood arises from cinematographer Harris Savidess precise compositions and long meditative takes. Music and dialogue are minimal and background information on the characters is in short supply.Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a scruffily handsome B-movie actor who lives in a hotel and drives a black Ferrari. In the opening scene we see him driving laps around a rural race track. Next we see him back at his hotel falling drunkenly down a set of stairs which leaves him with a cast on his broken arm. He drinks beer pops painkillers and goes to bed with a readily available rotation of attractive women. Most comically memorable are a pair of pole-dancing twin strippers (former Playboy centrefolds Kristina and Karissa Shannon) who bring their own collapsible poles and finish their acrobatic act by crawling into bed with Johnny.Why should we care? The answer comes when we meet Johnnys willowy quiet 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) whom he doesnt seem to know very well. When her mother (Lala Sloatman) has some undisclosed crisis she dumps Cleo to live with her father in the interval before she goes to summer camp.We see the father-daughter bond grow through a series of vignettes. Cleo cooks breakfast for Johnny and his doofus childhood friend Sammy (Chris Pontius). He takes her to a skating lesson and watches amazed as she figure skates beautifully. They play Guitar Hero. Suddenly they go on an overnight trip to Milan where he picks up an award and they share gelato in the hotel room in the middle of the night. Graceful and innocent Cleo is an angelic presence whose reproving stare when he betrays her trust is a stabbing reminder of his moral emptiness. We know its only a matter of time before Johnny awakens to his inner anguish.Throughout Dorff is doggedly credible as an obtuse actor but the richer performance here is from Fanning and it might have been a stronger movie told from her characters point of view. Its no great stretch to see Cleo as writer-director Coppolas fictional surrogate a rueful daughter looking at the self-indulgence and imagined guilt of her celebrity father.That leads to the final question about Somewhere Isnt it time to move on? For all its admirable understatement Coppolas fourth film suffers from a surfeit of deja vu. There are many scenes here which repeat elements of Coppolas most successful film Lost in Translation. They include the basic situation of a jaded actor and a younger woman as playmates in a hotel through specific matching scenes - an inane press junket an odd-ball hotel masseur an immersion in the land of wacky foreigners. Sofia Coppola may be neither a flash in the pan nor the great hope of American cinema but it seems a bit premature for her to be creating homages to her own work.SomewhereWritten and directed by Sofia CoppolaStarring Stephen Dorff and Elle FanningClassification 14A Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere"" is another ""woe is me Im famous"" wallow. In it Stephen Dorff plays a wasted movie star. Wasted in the sense that Johnny Marco is often stoned in the sense that his work appears to be a string of crass action flicks and in the sense that failing to connect with his wise fun-loving sensitive daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) he is throwing away his lifes potential. He lives in the luxurious limbo of Hollywoods Chateau Marmont marinating in crass materialism. When he orders up some live entertainment in his penthouse bedroom its not one paltry pole dancer but identical-twin blondes. Talk about conspicuous consumption. The notion that lives glamorous on the surface may be an unsightly mess is one Coppola has pursued through ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Marie Antoinette."" This much she has proved Ennui is a communicable disease. Her characters with worldviews that scarcely extend beyond their gilded goldfish bowl are as boring as they are bored. This is not a miscalculation on Coppolas part. She would not train a fixed camera on Johnnys Ferrari circling a lonely track again and again and yet again unless she wanted us to feel the banality of his jaded existence in our bones. And we do. Do we ever. This is a man who nods off to sleep while making love to starlets. Like Louis XVI in ""Marie Antoinette"" this slacker-deity is a boudoir incompetent. ""It wasnt even that good"" snips Michelle Monaghan as one of Johnnys ex-lovers. Eleven-year-old Cleo reappears in his life dumped like a piece of luggage in his suite by her mom who needs an unspecified amount of time to herself. The girl is an unspoiled life force possibly the only person who can budge Johnny out of his torpor. He welcomes her gladly but doesnt have a clue how to relate. His hanger-on buddy Sammy (Chris Pontius of ""Jackass"") teases Cleo tells her stories and keeps her giggling. Johnny looks on silently bemused as he does when she solves Sudoku puzzles skates with Olympic grace and cooks Dad world-class eggs Benedict with ingredients ordered from room service. It seems fatherhood is wasted on parents just as fame and wealth are squandered on celebrities. The film skips from Hollywood to Milan where Johnny is being honored on an awards show. As sequined showgirls writhe around him onstage he smiles awkwardly. Rootless and soulless Johnny is a commodity to be used up before his expiration date. He is endlessly photographed. His handprint is pressed in a trough of cement and makeup artists encase his head in a plaster cast. Coppolas lens stares unblinking at the image of Johnnys noggin slathered with what looks like mashed potatoes. In case we didnt comprehend the idea that Johnny needs to get unstuck he wears a cast on his left hand and wrist for most of the film. We get it. Really we get it. ""Somewhere"" is a fuzzy unstructured dialogue-starved film. Incidental details draw the cameras attention as much as the movies central relationship. Nothing makes much impact and Johnnys possible breakthrough at the denouement is half a baby step at best. Coppolas message is clear minutes into the film Celebrity without creativity is empty life without love is meaningless and the Chateau Marmont is still haunted by John Belushis overdosed ghost. I hope this concludes her Antonioni-esque exploration of deluxe loneliness. Thats enough anomie for me. SOMEWHERE  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content nudity and language. Theater Uptown.

"Movie Review Coppolas Somewhere manages to make us care | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie Review Coppolas Somewhere manages to make us careSofia Coppolas affecting new film Somewhere manages to make us care for a dissolute movie star and his indulged young daughter.Dorff left and Elle Fanning star in Sofia Coppolas Somewhere.  (Merrick Morton / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 6 2011 Somewhere (out of 4) Starring Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning Chris Pontius and Lala Sloatman. Written and directed by Sofia Coppola. At the Varsity. 96 minutes. 14A ""The problems of three little people"" Humphrey Bogart famously declared in Casablanca ""dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" Amen to that and the bean pile is even smaller when the ""little people"" are Hollywood celebrities whose entanglements have been movie fodder since movies began. They fascinate but ultimately matter to us as much as a car wreck passed on the highway. Somewhere forces a reappraisal of this cynical truth. Its the singular achievement of Sofia Coppolas affecting new film that she manages to make us care for a dissolute movie star his angry ex-wife and their indulged daughter. The star is Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) who might be thought of as a pre-Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. although writer/director Coppola insists hes a composite of many actors shes met and seen. Introduced by way of his black Ferrari aimlessly tooling about the L.A. County countryside Johnny is an immobile object inside a moving force. He resides -- mainly sleeping -- at the Chateau Marmont the L.A. party haunt remembered as the scene of John Belushis final (and fatal) binge. Johnny is surrounded by louche scenesters who occasionally invade his room. Hes so blissed out from drink and pills he barely notices even when sex is on the agenda. He barely stays awake while watching identical-twin call girls pole dance for him and nods off completely while in a very intimate moment with another conquest. He breaks his wrist after stumbling down stairs his feet failed to find. So much for his ""I do all my own stunts"" boast. Johnny isnt a bad guy -- although someone obviously a woman keeps texting him angry messages -- and he still possesses some semblance of a work ethic. He shows up for press duties for his latest action movie (Berlin Agenda) yawning through moronic questions pitched by real-life members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. He also submits to the taxing process of modeling for a latex mask which special effects men require to make him look considerably aged for an upcoming film -- symbolism alert Johnny in short is a somebody who is fast drifting into becoming a nobody until he gets a short and sharp call from his agitated ex-wife Layla (Lala Sloatman) who needs him to look after their 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning a sweet little something). Cleo may be just another Hollywood brat but shes whip-smart and like all girls she needs a dad. In many ways shes more of an adult than her father. She realizes that he needs helps and sets about pulling him out of his funk through games and other diversions that make much of Somewhere seem almost like a Disney family movie albeit one where Chris Pontius of Jackass fame is part of the family. Coppola works on a tiny canvas but she paints with very fine strokes. Three features in Somewhere continues a fascination with celebrity alienation that began with the more potent Lost In Translation in 2003. That film paired Bill Murray with a then-unknown Scarlett Johansson and Coppolas sub-Antonioni asceticism played much better against the backdrop of Tokyos many visual and cultural distractions. Somewhere does have its own magic thanks to Harris Savides luminous cinematography which gives a special glow to Tinseltown. And Coppolas wicked sense of humor is dry enough to mix martinis with. Her choice of Dorff for Johnny Marco is spot on even if he isnt the most interesting of actors because he actually once was a hot star. In the late 1990s Dorff was tipped to play doomed rocker Kurt Cobain in a much-touted biopic that never happened. Now he plays a poser who wears Seattle rock T-shirts pops Propecia pills to curb a retreating hairline and listens to the Foo Fighters ""My Hero"" (sung by Cobains former band mate Dave Grohl) while watching strippers. Such is the toll of celebrity life where crows feet and fickle tastes are feared more than global warming. Somewhere doesnt lead us anywhere new or profound but it finds a rainbow where at least some dreams come true.

Director Sofia Coppola. Cast Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning Chris Pontius. Rating R for sexual content nudity and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. Guide to this weeks new releases Guys as caretakers Qamp;A Sofia Coppola on movie famous family In ""Somewhere"" she tells the story of Johnny Marco a movie star drifting through an emotionally stagnant life. Until his 11-year-old daughter shows up for an extended visit hes mired in boredom. Coppola gets at that from the first scene in which Marco (an excellent Stephen Dorff) drives a sports car around a circle large enough that the car disappears from the frame for a time during each lap. Around he goes. Again. And again. And again. Coppola holds the scene far longer than audiences are used to; frankly were bored too. The uselessness of the act of literally going in circles is driven home from the start. >> Guide to this weeks new movie releases Its the kind of thing some people will appreciate and embrace while others will flee in a fit of frustrated boredom. My advice Stick around. Coppolas audacity in not only portraying the unmoored nature of Marcos life but immersing the audience in it proves satisfying over time. Dorff and Elle Fanning as his daughter are both adept at the tricky business of simply being present in the moment and still holding our attention. Marco has finished his latest movie but is committed to publicity demands which he trudges through as listlessly as he does his day-to-day tasks of hanging out at the Chateau Marmont where hes living entertaining hangers-on. Hes so bored he nods off watching the twin pole dancers he hires for a private viewing. His daughter Cleo shows up for a brief visit but her mother tells Marco he will have to keep her for a while. Initially this seems ludicrous; Cleo is far more mature than her father. Surely disaster awaits. Not so. Certainly Cleo remains the stable force but Marco rises to the occasion as well. He clearly loves his daughter and she loves him and he cares for her as any father might - any father who can jet her off to Europe for an awards show sneaking a woman into his room after Cleo falls asleep. Their relationship is easy natural - and yet unnatural. Theres an almost pathetic quality to Marcos repeated asking of Cleo whether she thinks that SUV following them is the same one from before if its a paparazzo looking for a shot. You sense some disappointment in his face when she assures him its not. Coppola with her lineage surely is familiar with the trappings and perils of fame. But ""Somewhere"" is not a cautionary tale. Its more an observation of a life albeit a different kind of life that Coppola through her insistence with the camera pulls us into. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

First and foremost came Bill Murrays jet-lagged star navigating the cultural incongruities of Tokyos Park Hyatt in Lost in Translation. Then she turned Marie Antoinette into a teen pop star lost in the vast spaces and mechanical ceremonies of that ultimate 18th-century hotel Versailles. The focus of her uncompromisingly low-key new movie Somewhere is Johnny Marco (Steven Dorff) a divorced directionless affluently homeless movie star living at the L.A. hipster mecca Chateau Marmont while recovering from a broken wrist. Johnny lolls on his bed in a stupor as twin pole dancers attempt to arouse him drifts in the Marmont pool and compulsively uses sex to fill the void where his self should be. Hes got good looks and a modicum of charm when he cares to bother but hes not much fun to be around. Not that anybody notices because hes famous. Scruffy and lost he goes through the motions of his business with little affect while everyone else--publicists ushering him into a photo shoot Italian journalists interviewing him in a Milan hotel lobby--burst into enthusiastic overdrive in his presence.Coppola a sharp observer of the small absurdities of show business (Franciss daughter knows this milieu in her bones) has earned the right to make movies exactly the way she wants. Somewhere is her most minimal and Europeanized film yet. Long stretches pass with only the most cursory (and unrevealing) dialogue shes less interested in events than the spaces between them. What passes for a plot arrives in the form of Johnnys 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) a precocious self-starting charmer whos learned not to depend on her absent father for emotional support. Mom for reasons unexplained has split indefinitely leaving Cleo with Johnny until summer camp begins. Fanning by far the liveliest thing in the movie may be a stand-in for the director but Coppolas focus remains fixed on the empty shell at the center of her movie and thats a problem. Its not just that exposing the emptiness of celebrity is hardly fresh news--its apparent from the start that Johnny is a hollow man. Casting the less-than-charismatic Dorff may bolster Coppolas thesis but its dramatically self-defeating.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 29 2010 Save for later Saved Elle Fanning stars in Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere."" Focus Features          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere"" opens with a long shot of a black Ferrari circling an empty desert speedway for what seems like an eternity. After about the fifth lap I understood what Coppola was going for real-time anomie. Theres lots of that in this film.The driver of the car turns out to be Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a mid-level movie star recently divorced who is shacking up at the Chateau Marmont a funky Hollywood hotel known for sequestering fringey celebrities.Having broken his arm Johnny is nursing his impediment with a parade of willing women with whom he mostly dozes off in mid-act even when being entertained by twin pole dancers. Their routine goes on for about as long as that Ferrari roundabout and is just about as sexy. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Related Ten best movies of 2010 Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? When not nodding off Johnny heads out for the occasional party or publicity junket or prosthetics fitting session for his next film. When his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (an excellent Elle Fanning) shows up for a visit that turns into an extended stay Johnny gradually bonds as best as he can with her. She seems a lot wiser than he. At least she knows how to cook.I admired Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" which was also about a celebrity paired with a much younger woman who is confined by stardom. I also admired ""Marie Antoinette"" which was equally about confinement although from the regal end of the spectrum. In ""Somewhere"" Coppola is attempting to complete what is in effect a trilogy of high-end loneliness.Unlike those other two films though ""Somewhere"" reinforces cliches instead of dissolving them. For all its Antonioni-esque lassitude and dreary artiness ""Somewhere"" is pushing a cliched agenda Celebrity is empty; Hollywood is empty; life is meaningless. Although Johnny is a star you never get a sense of what made him one - or even if hes any good as an actor. I guess were not supposed to care.Were also not supposed to care that he doesnt seem to care about anything.Im grateful that once Cleo enters the picture Coppola didnt try to turn ""Nowhere"" - I mean ""Somewhere"" - into an art-house variant of ""The Champ."" Cleos tentative attempts to reach her father some of which are canny and successful (she makes a mean eggs Benedict) are touching and comic.But most of the time were stuck watching the chain-smoking Johnny acting dopey - I mean existential. Because Coppola plays out many of her scenes in actual time she encourages us to sit still and discern the elemental in all that ennui. Its what Warhol in his endless movies also tried to do.But sometimes empty is just empty. What Gertrude Stein said about Oakland can also apply to ""Somewhere"" ""There is no there there.""

Johnny hopping beds and limousines slinks through his days like a passive snake going wherever hes told from a cretinous press junket to a makeup session in which his head gets slathered in latex. As long as he shows up spewing monosyllables in a hungover daze hes adored by everyone. Without even trying he knows how to play the role of a too-cool-for-school screen idol. At times Somewhere is like Entourage minus the entourage except that Coppola works in very slow deadpan exploratory takes putting the film world -- publicists groupies the sleaze-chic culture of the Chateau Marmont where Johnny lives -- under a behavioral microscope. Somewhere is also a tale of alienation as well as a father-daughter buddy movie. Johnny you see has a problem Hes such a star such an image that he doesnt know who he is. He likes to whip around the desert in his black Ferrari (shades of Antonioni or maybe Vincent Gallo) but only by taking care of Cleo his 11-year-old daughter from a broken marriage can he find himself. It helps that Cleo is played by Elle Fanning a more wide-awake actress than her sister Dakota. The movies redemptive structure is a bit routine yet I watched nearly every scene with a sense of discovery. Coppola is a true filmmaker and in Somewhere she pierces the Hollywood bubble from the inside.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Love Among the Ruins ShareThis It can be argued that beginnings and endings of relationships are relatively simple to diagram and that the true drama happens in that hazier middle zonethe part that Cianfrance leaves out. By the time we get our first glimpse of Cindy over her bad quick oatmeal her mind is essentially made up. It would have been fascinating to see her first twinge of uncertainty What triggered it? On the other hand three time periods would make Blue Valentine more head-spinning in places than it already is. More than two and you start having flashbacks to Lost. As little Frankie Faith Wladyka is an unusually convincing child actress and its her playful and funny rapport with Goslings Dean that makes you like him even when the darkness is taking hold. To Cindy hes another child to take care of. To Frankie hes the person who makes her feel safe. Perhaps that horror-film-like threat to the child in the movies first scene is apt after all. Blue Valentine leaves you with the shattering vision of its truest victimthe one wholl someday look for safety in places it might not be. And the psychodrama will go on and on Another year another Mike Leigh gem this one called Another Year a minor-key ensemble drama four seasons in the life of an aging coupleTom a geologist and Gerri a medical counselorplayed by those wonderful Leigh veterans Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. They are true Earth People first seen tending to their vegetable garden a short distance from their suburban London house comfy together with their graying hair and thickening waists. Their home is roomy and inviting a place of refuge for lonely people among them their good-hearted thirtyish son Joe (Oliver Maltman) and Toms old friend Ken (Peter Wight) whos in appalling physical shape and getting fatter and more sadly soused by the day. The films most epic lost soul is Mary (Lesley Manville) an alcoholic with teased hair and plunging blouses and a desperate eye for a suitable man who will have hereven at one point Toms broken-down barely verbal newly widowed brother (David Bradley). Leigh fans will be in clover amid all this garrulous despair and grotesquerie. For others Another Year will test the paradox of Leighs work. Its well known that he presents his actors with characters and a premise rather than a finished script and sends them out to amass details physical and psychological. When they return with their bounty he shapes a screenplay and films them indulgently. The more prodigious their misery the more indulgent he is. The problem is that most viewers spend less time marveling at the actors inventiveness than being crushed by the weight of the characters suicide-worthy lives. Its particularly true here Leigh has given Manville a frequent collaborator a monumental pedestal which means that every admiring close-up of her builds to some cringe-worthy humiliation. My advice Steel yourself against the too-muchness and savor as if you were a social scientist the variety of ways in which middle-class English people create edifices in which to house their aloneness. Leigh opens in the office of Gerris colleague (Michelle Austin) with a close-up of Imelda Staunton as a woman so utterly depressed and shut down that every scene that follows feels escapist in comparison. (Asked what would improve her life she murmurs barely audibly Different life ) With their shared lot Tom and Gerri are exemplaryand yet their happiness has an aspect of complacency. They know theyve got this human-isolation thing licked and view Mary and her ilk with a mix of sympathy and condescension the poor dear. But its better to be them than others which means the lesson of Another Year is Get busy on that garden. Sofia Coppolas absent-daddy issues are front and center in Somewhere about a rich and promiscuous movie star (Stephen Dorff) who is in existential terms nowhere and the young daughter (Elle Fanning) he barely sees but has to tote along on a promotional trip to Italy. This is a mood piece shapeless but often lyric. There is on one hand all that sex and wealth and glamour; on the other a floating wistfulness in the absence of home. Coppolas poor-rich-girl vision is certainly consistent although you sometimes wonder if she knows that hers is not the universal human condition. Blue Valentine The Weinstein Company. R.

"Somewhere A Hollywood daughters daddy issues washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On movie review Somewhere A Hollywood daughters daddy issues RED CARPET COUPLE Stephen Dorff as Hollywood sybarite Johnny Marco and Elle Fanning as his daughter Chloe who share an easy unforced rapport. (Franco Biciocchi) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 22 2010 Sofia Coppola doesnt tell conventional stories and her characters often remain opaque and cipherlike. Rather than satisfying third-act payoffs she prefers indeterminate fuzzy what-ifs. But since making her directorial debut in 1999 with ""The Virgin Suicides"" Coppola has mastered the most difficult aspect of filmmaking without which a director cannot be truly great. Her ace in the hole - the thing shes better at than any of her colleagues in Hollywood or on its indie margins - is atmospherics. No filmmaker does mood better than Coppola whether its adolescent longing (""The Virgin Suicides"") jet lag (""Lost in Translation"") or extravagant unexamined privilege (""Marie Antoinette""). In ""Somewhere"" Coppola turns her observant forgiving eye to the world shes been closest to all along Hollywood stardom in all its narcissism pampered decadence and jaded anomie. The opening shot serves both as tone-setter and leitmotif as a high-end sports car goes around and around a dusty track. The driver is Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a hot actor who has little else to do but drive take calls from his publicist party with his entourage at the shabby-chic Chateau Marmont and pay pole-dancing twins to provide private entertainment. The only interruption to Johnnys mundane sybaritic pursuits arrives by way of his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) who visits him on weekends. Johnny and Cleo enjoy an easy unforced rapport - even if hes surprised to learn shes been taking ice-skating lessons for three years - but he gets more than he bargained for suddenly when her mother announces hell have to keep her longer than a few days. His self-indulgent routine of zero commitment blown Johnny takes Cleo with him on a publicity trip to Italy and other everyday excursions of the rich and aimless realizing along the way that she might be the only tether he has to anything real. By now most viewers know whether theyre on Coppolas wavelength or not - honk if you found ""Lost in Translation"" insufferably pretentious come sit by me if you found it funny lyrical and poetic - and ""Somewhere"" can be profitably avoided or eagerly embraced on that basis. Every movie has its ""click"" moments when some moment or detail either sucks you in or fatally breaks the spell. Coppolas details are all spot-on; in this case the bottle of Propecia on Johnnys sink signals that were in good hands as were shown a world usually shrouded in paparazzi flashes and management-created myth. As with every Coppola tone poem ""Somewhere"" is laced with moments of pure loveliness - Cleo swirling on the ice in a dreamy pastel-colored cloud or playing Guitar Hero with Johnny on an idle afternoon - and snippets of knowing humor. The inane questions Johnny entertains at a press junket which range from his workout routine to post-global colonialism are depressingly accurate (take it from someone whos asked them). Later when he sits with his head encased in goop for an hour to make a latex mold of his face the scene is played both for its comic absurdity and when he sees the results intimations of mortality. (A pitch-perfectly random scene featuring a cameo in the Chateau elevator is played for absurdity period.) Like ""The American"" earlier this year ""Somewhere"" is best appreciated as a 1970s art film made by a time-traveler in Coppolas body. Neither film features much of a story both unfold in long languid takes and both create indelible portraits of men changing their minds. Most filmmakers would represent that journey with windy speeches or showy breakdown scenes but Coppola does it the hard way by simply depicting Johnny navigating his environment making choices and behaving accordingly.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 24 2010 1201 a.m. ET The patch is on the other eye and the boot is on the other foot in the Coen brothers remake of ""True Grit"" with Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn. Its the role that won John Wayne his only Oscar four decades ago and Mr. Bridges fills it with boozy panache. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen fill the film with self-conscious good humor--hey its the Coen brothers--and the charmingly old-fashioned locutions of the Charles Portis novel. Remaking a cherished movie is not to borrow a fancy phrase from the dialogue malum in se--wrong in itself--but there are always losses along with the changes and gains. The main loss here is inevitably innocence. Mattie Ross the 14-year-old heroine originally played by Kim Darby is no longer sweet-faced and freshly scrubbed. Shes gimlet-eyed grimly purposeful and precocious in a distinctly modern youre-not-the-boss-of-me way and she delivers her lines like a train conductor with too many stations to announce. Watch a clip from ""True Grit"" starring Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin Barry Pepper and Hailee Steinfeld. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Mattie and her quest to avenge her fathers murder have gained new prominence from the filmmakers decision to use the structure of the book which Mattie narrated rather than to emulate the earlier film which was dominated by John Waynes stirring larger-than-life presence. Yet the heavier load of intricate language is too much for young Hailee Steinfeld. You can see and hear her struggle during a deliciously funny stretch of hard bargaining in which Mattie outwits a pompous horse trader named Stonehill. Ms. Steinfeld who is Matties age does her dogged best but the scene works as well as it does largely because the character actor Dakin Matthews who plays Stonehill brings a lifetime of skill and experience to the encounter. (Strother Martin played the role just as skillfully in the original version.) When it comes to life experience the movies star is no slouch either and he couches it in zestfully comic terms. ""Ive grown old"" this Rooster declares in a growl more gravelly than Popeyes. So he has but Mr. Bridges hasnt; hes grown for the occasion a beer belly a bibulous sneer a lecherous leer and a broader-than-life comic style thats lovely to watch whether Rooster is taking errant potshots at bottles under the influence of too much whisky or confronting four adversaries who mean to blast him off his saddle (in a showdown thats set up lazily and staged perfunctorily). Matt Damon is the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf who lets Mattie know that hes a Ranger with an amusingly vain flip of his lapel to reveal his badge. On the whole though LaBoeuf adds up to less than the sum of his sometimes fumbling and sometimes heroic parts. Josh Brolin who starred in the Coen brothers ""No Country for Old Men"" plays a minor role here as Tom Chaney the man who killed Matties father. Roger Deakins did the cinematography with mixed results. Many of the classic Western exteriors looked washed out and indifferent when I saw the film on a big screen and just as much so later on a DVD screener. But his masterful interiors with their darkly sumptuous tones give the movie a resonance that goes beyond its galloping action and cantering comedy. ENLARGE A scene from The Illusionist. Sony Pictures Classics The Illusionist Sylvain Chomets animated feature began as an act of devotion and became a thing--a fable a tone poem an elegy--of ethereal beauty. Its a movie about melancholy though much more than that and it asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. Savoring its singular bittersweetness--and accepting its imperfections--requires suspending customary expectations of story and narrative pace. And of dialogue since many scenes suggest a silent film. Whats left to savor then? Exquisite images poignant humor echoes of cinema history and a sense of having watched genuine magic. As the title indicates the hero is a magician an aging Frenchman called Tatischeff who is struggling to survive on the shrinking music-hall circuit of the late 1950s. (This film has no connection with the Edward Norton film of the same name.) Tatischeff was the real name of the late Jacques Tati the French actor who created the bumbling Mr. Hulot and therein lies the devotional link. Mr. Chomets astonishing debut feature ""The Triplets of Belleville"" had included by way of homage a clip from Tatis 1949 ""Jour de Fete."" Thanks to Tatis daughter Sophie the animator was able to make ""The Illusionist"" from a script that Tati had written but decided not to film in the belief that it was too personal probably because of its implicit father-and-daughter relationship. Watch a clip from the animated film ""The Illusionist."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. In everything but name the magician of the film is Mr. Hulot. He moves like Hulot walking in sequential teeters and bows like Hulot with courtesy tinctured by servility. Like Hulot hes an outsider but Tatischeff is also painfully a loner moving from Paris to London and then points north in search of a livelihood. He finds one for a while in Scotland where he meets Alice a young chambermaid who is innocent enough to believe that his magic tricks are the real thing. Their relationship is chaste and all but wordless the filmmaker embraces Tatis minimalist approach to dialogue and music even though their absence gives the troubling impression of dramatic emptiness. (The impression subsides when you give yourself over to the gorgeous images.) Far from prestidigitating his way out of penury the illusionist secretly takes odd demeaning jobs to provide Alice with shelter and pretty clothes. And the love between them remains unstated. Mr. Chomet expresses his story almost exclusively in hand-drawn paintings that move wonderfully nostalgic watercolors of a vanished era. When ""The Illusionist"" is funny the jokes are fragile (scattered feathers mistaken for snow Tatischeffs feral rabbit the magicians fear of rabbit stew). When its lyrical the images shimmer with inner life (Edinburgh as an enchanted city). At one point Tatischeffs deepening sadness prompts him to insist that ""magicians do not exist."" But they do. This movie proves it. Somewhere Sofia Coppolas first feature film in four years is very much about a father and daughter and here again not much at all about overt action. (Like its driver the black Ferrari in the title sequence is going around in circles.) Theres so little action for so long that ""Somewhere"" could qualify as a clinical test for attention deficit disorder; if you stay with it you dont have it. I stayed with it despite the glacial pace maybe because Bill Murrays torpor in Ms. Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" paid off brilliantly and this hero a disconsolate movie star played by Stephen Dorff is nothing if not torpid at the outset. Whats more Im glad I did. ""Somewhere"" eventually finds humanity--a man you really care about--in the midst of its precious milieu. Mr. Dorffs Johnny Marco recently separated from his wife is holed up and contemplating his life or at least his navel and broken wrist at the famously seedy Chateau Marmont Hotel on the Sunset Strip. Nothing much happens unless youre inordinately interested in pole dancers--Johnny is not--until his daughter Cleo shows up for a visit; shes played with infectious energy and effortless grace by Elle Fanning. Its easy to speculate that the loving Cleo and the frequently absent Johnny are stand-ins for Ms. Coppola and her own famous father but ""Somewhere"" neednt be seen as a film a clef. The movie stands on its own terms as a slow-burning drama of life in a Hollywood purgatory where you can not only check out but leave. Watch a clip from ""Gullivers Travels"" starring Jack Black Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. Gullivers Travels In my travels Ive seen Roman ruins Greek ruins and Byzantine ruins but Ive never seen a ruin like this live-action version of ""Gullivers Travels."" Jack Black as a wannabe travel writer named Lemuel Gulliver hustles himself a boat trip to the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself in Lilliput. The 3-D is cheesy (2.2-D at best) the gags are gross (Gulliver urinates on an 18th-century palace to extinguish a fire) and the production abandons all hope of coherence when the hero fights a climactic battle with a giant robot out of ""Transformers."" What were they thinking? What were they smoking? What were they singing on the way to the bank? Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Big Lebowski (1998) Strictly speaking Joel and Ethan Coens now-classic comedy is an absurdist neonoir film about mistaken identity. But theres no reason to be strict about this big sweet teddy bear of an entertainment and no mistaking the identity of the actor who makes the whole thing so consistently likable Jeff Bridges in what might reasonably be assumed is the title role. He plays Jeff Lebowski or The Dude an amiable California stoner mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski the Big Lebowski of the title an aging Pasadena millionaire (David Huddleston) in whose life and tortured loves The Dude is soon enmeshed. Mr. Hulots Holiday (1953) Innocent fun in a nearly silent classic that pays homage to the era of silent comedy. Jacques Tatis Mr. Hulot an eccentric stranger in his own land arrives at a seaside resort in his ancient sputtering car and carries a butterfly net at the ready. If you wanted to stretch a point you could call it social satire but this first of Tatis Hulot series--which includes ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Trafic""--is much more consistently and enduringly a succession of gently humorous sketches having to do with oddity and human frailty. The School of Rock (2003) Jack Black found his mojo in a movie that gives the lie to Norma Desmonds deathless remark about the pictures having gotten small. This joyous farce is a big deal and its star is nothing less than majestic as a scruffy irreverent rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue in a private school. Mike Whites dazzling script and Richard Linklaters ebullient direction are fully equal to the challenge of morphing Mr. Blacks Dewey Finn from a dissolute mooch into a madcap Mr. Chips who turns a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Somewhere amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Tron Legacy True Grit >> Somewhere In Somewhere Sofia Coppola plays anthropologist to track an actor through his native habitat the Sunset Strips Chateau Marmont. Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is sliding downward from his peak the kind of imperceptible fall thats cushioned by booze flattery and women. The nearly silent first half plays like Nanook of the North only the ladies are wearing a lot less clothes. With the invasion of 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) usually a flickering presence in Johnnys life the flick gets louder but not by much--Coppola might believe in redemption but shes no sucker for big speeches. We meet Johnny Marco racing laps by himself in a sleek sports car. Hes going nowhere but he looks great doing it. Later two identically dressed exotic dancers do a routine on parallel stripper poles in his hotel room proving that double the choreography halves the excitement--theres no thrill when the girls are focused on the timing of ""ass shake ass shake spin spin bend."" The punch line is that Johnny falls asleep though most directors would let us first enjoy leering at the girls. Not Coppola. To her decadence is dull and she asserts that with the conviction of an heiress. Shes more interested in the awkward clunk of the dancers heels as they pack up their bags and slink off (sound designer Richard Beggs masterfully deflates any unavoidable visual glamour). Johnny is a passive character a prop in his own life. People tell him where to go and what to say and when he cant figure it out--say at an Italian awards show where hes ambushed by dancing showgirls--he just smiles and nods. Hes been made so impotent by handlers and maids and room service and a banquet of available women that he cant even be bothered to bone. Scene after scene he falls asleep while still half-dressed. In the animal kingdom hed be a panda popular photographed and useless. Its fair to call Coppola a boutique filmmaker interested only in the poor-me problems of the privileged. (Id rather she direct what she knows than mimic the middle-class.) But though her world view is narrow its also deep. Shes a keen and sensitive observer of her world and in Somewhere she seizes the details that make us understand and empathize with Johnnys inertia. Two special effects mask makers slather him in plaster and leave the room his best friend (Jackass Chris Pontius well-cast) throws parties on his tab the endless hours of Guitar Hero that pass for bonding with his daughter the comfort with which she orders cooking ingredients from room service. There are very few big moments in Somewhere but the melancholy sticks with you for days like a layer of SoCal smog. As the film ends we leave Johnny back in his sports car but now speeding straight down the highway destination unknown. And when even thats not enough he pulls over gets out and lets his feet hit the pavement.

Sofia Coppolas Somewhere with Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 22 2010 600 PM My Sofia Problem I wanted to love Somewhere but I could not. By Dana Stevens Elle Fanning in Somewhere I want to be one of those people who loves Sofia Coppola. Ive been waiting for years now to see the things in this young directors work that so many of my smart colleagues do a fresh promising American voice (that much Ill grant) whos maturing and deepening with every film (thats where the Sofia-lovers lose me). I dont begrudge the woman her Hollywood upbringing or her scion status--many gifted directors including Coppolas ex-husband Spike Jonze come from privileged backgrounds and its certainly possible to be both the offspring of a great artist and a great artist yourself. With Herculean effort I try to disregard Coppolas annoying persona in the press the casually-yet-impeccably dressed disarmingly soft-spoken designer muse who I hope and assume is a reductive misrepresentation of the real person. But movie after movie I find myself resisting the same things about the work itself. Coppola has a gift Ill even call it a genius for devising individual filmic moments that transport and transform both the characters and the viewer. Shes the queen of fleeting brilliance little glimpses of beauty and sadness and truth. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. When a director is 28 years old as Coppola was when she made The Virgin Suicides fleeting brilliance is bounty enough. All that remains of that movie for me is the music-video-like scene in which teen lovers Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett make out in the front seat of his car but I remember that scene as vividly as my own first kiss. Yet in the 11 years since neither that Sofia movie nor any other has stayed with me as more than a delivery vehicle for moments. Bill Murray singing karaoke to Scarlett Johansson in Lost in Translation glorious but I still dont understand their relationship in that movie. Kirsten Dunst and her ladies-in-waiting consuming cakes and dresses to the sound of 80s pop in Marie Antoinette scrumptious but I might as well have seen that montage in isolation on YouTube. Advertisement Somewhere (Focus Features) begins very strong with a great first shot thats a seemingly endless fixed take of a driving track somewhere out in the desert. A black Ferrari zooms around and around a track making three or four complete laps the only sound the harsh whine of its engine. Finally the car stops and a man emerges and stares out at the desert. Its a deliberately disorienting cold open that could have come straight from a film by Antonioni or Chantal Akerman and it works beautifully especially when soon followed by another even longer take of a pair of identically dressed pole-dancers as they perform an elaborate routine in the incongruously cramped space of a hotel room. Where are we? What is this empty science-fiction-like space in which luxury goods and women who resemble them are ceaselessly rotated in front of our eyes? Oh its Hollywood. Its after these two arresting long shots that the storytelling machinery kicks in and Somewhere begins to feel less assured. The Ferrari driver and viewer of the pole dance routine is Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a Hollywood actor who we infer from the few details were given about his career is pretty near the top of the A-list. Hes currently in between projects doing junket publicity for his last standard-issue blockbuster while starting makeup tests for the next. During this transition Johnny is living at the Chateau Marmont a historic Los Angeles hotel youre no doubt familiar with from the countless magazine profiles in which stars meet journalists by the pool. Johnny is depressed self-medicating and very very lonely; these facts already established by the two opening shots described above are hammered home in a long string of insufficiently differentiated scenes. This first half of the movie is to be sure studded with powerful images. In one scene Johnnys head is encased in some kind of latex putty to make a mask hell need for an upcoming role and we watch for a long time as he sits in a makeup chair his head turned into a featureless terrifying blob of goo. But the presence of two monster masks carefully placed in the background of that shot--plus the fact that several preceding scenes have made a similar point--blunts the impact of what could have a been a revelatory image. Fame makes you a monster. We get it. The film improves--and starts providing some of those patented Sofia moments of transcendence--in the second half when Johnnys 11-year-old daughter Cleo (an ethereal Elle Fanning) shows up at the Marmont having been temporarily but painfully abandoned by her mother Johnnys ex. The mother who we experience only as a voice on the phone ""needs some time""--the 21st-century equivalent of Kramer-vs.-Kramer-era ""finding yourself""--and wants Johnny to care for Cleo for a few weeks before dropping her at summer camp. In the scenes that follow Johnny and Cleo loaf around the Marmont visit Italy on a publicity trip then head back to Los Angeles and loaf some more. Advertisement Its not the loafing thats a problem--many great films are about little more than the characters sharing daily life in all its tedium. (Bergman Antonioni Ozu Whit Stillman--take your pick.) Its that the precise contours of Johnny and Cleos relationship never emerge from the aesthetic fog. If Somewhere were a movie about a father and daughter not learning to connect--if it set out to be a chilly study in alienation that kept the viewer at arms length from the drama--this narrative vagueness would be fine. But I dont think its revealing too much (no more than the elliptical trailer does) to say that this is a movie about a father and daughter who are learning however haltingly and briefly to connect. As they do there are lovely moments along the way--I adored a casual improvised-sounding scene in which Cleo and her dad play a video game while Johnnys childhood friend Sammy (Chris Pontius) heckles them from the sidelines. But theres no discernible trajectory that joins one epiphany to the next making Johnnys last-scene revelation--and his ambiguous final gesture--feel unearned and underwhelming. Maybe Sofia Coppola is more of a tastemaker than a filmmaker someone who knows what fabric would work with which buttons. She certainly chooses nice music--much of it here from her real-life partner Thomas Mars of the French band Phoenix--though I wish she had eased off the pop songs in some scenes that feel overly engineered for emotional effect. And Coppola was smart to work with the great cinematographer Harris Savides who for the second time this year (he also shot Greenberg) makes Los Angeles look like an eerily-lit fairyland. Coppolas known for working closely with actors and eliciting intimate surprising performances from them. The small ordinary-guy-looking Dorff is a little miscast as what appears to be a Brad Pitt-grade superstar but hes excellent in the role and Fanning--well Id call her a revelation if I hadnt already praised her here and here. Its almost bizarre that a child whos been acting since the age of 3 can deliver a performance this unaffected. She reminds me of Mariel Hemingway in Manhattan so fresh and spontaneous that its hard to believe she knows theres a camera on her. If only Fanning and Dorff had been given a chance to do something other than float side by side in a vague luxurious limbo. Im not talking about the swimming pool at the Chateau Marmont; Im talking about the movie. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> By taking her sweet subtle time to tell the story of a Hollywood child (Elle Fanning) spending time with her neglectful movie-star daddy (Stephen Dorff) writer-director Sofia Coppola defies American audiences who want their films like their food fast. Got to love the Coppola resistance. She gives Somewhere the hypnotically deliberate pace of a European art film as Cleo 11 hangs with her father Johnny Marco around L.A.s Chateau Marmont. The two play video games slouch around the Chateau lobby and pool and jet off to an awards show in Milan. Cleo ice-skates; Johnny invites two pole dancers to his room. Through the awkward boredom we are meant to discern a relationship between a man in crisis and a daughter on the cusp of womanhood. Dorff and Fanning could not be better at embodying those states. As in Lost in Translation Coppola keeps an eye out for the broken places. Thats when Somewhere is really something.

Elle Fanning . To compete with the quintessence of nullity that is Sofia Coppolas insufferable ""Somewhere"" imagine a film called ""Wanna See Me Crack My Knuckles?"" or possibly ""Lets Learn How Long It Takes This Shallow Dish of Liquid To Evaporate."" This isnt an artistic effort its a vacant lot whose signpost reads ""Space available. Movie can be made here. Or not. Whatever."" ""Somewhere"" is about a visit to a small planet -- planet Hollywood -- as seen through the eyes of a bored and dissipated movie star Johnny (Stephen Dorff) who lives by choice in the Sunset Strip celebrity ant farm the Chateau Marmont. Johnny is galactically famous the kind of star whose Italian hotel room comes with its own pool. This condition has left him wrecked. We feel his pain as he endures the lameness of the servant class -- buzzing publicists naked masseurs and chatty celebrity interviewers -- and suffer knowingly as the worlds failure to be interesting causes mildly embarrassing situations. Johnny falls asleep during sex with one interchangeable blonde and gets his partners name wrong during a romp with another. He churns through beer and strippers while shatteringly eventless scenes rip through three and five minutes of screen time exploring such questions as ""How many times will Johnnys sports car go around this track?"" (four) and ""What kind of gelato will he order?"" (all of them). Two further unanswered questions hover in the air or rather (since theyre never answered) settle in like dust Who is sending him texts saying things like ""Why are you such an a - - hole?"" And how did he wind up with a cast on his arm? Johnny has an adolescent daughter named Cleo (Elle Fanning) with whose mother he has little or no relationship. Johnnys acquaintance with Cleo too is partial. After watching her ice skating he asks when she took up this discipline. Shes been doing it for three years. When her mother tells him she needs to go away for a while he is stuck actually fathering his child and forced to take her on a film-promoting trip to Italy. This unexpected call to duty seems marginally to defrost his soul. The number of empty beer bottles in the vicinity decreases and Johnny even takes up family-friendly activities such as playing Guitar Hero with his daughter. Dorff and Fanning are both subtle and almost intriguing and a film as elliptical as this one might be promising from a rookie. But this is Coppolas fourth movie and as she heads into her 40s its clear that she has access to only one thuddingly autobiographical subject Unripe celebrities with locked-in syndrome. Cant the world feel how hard it is to be a little princess? Everything Johnny has to say in the film could fit on one sheet of paper (and Im not talking about a legal pad). Its all of the purest banality. His sole moments of self-analysis come when he tells Cleo ""Sorry I havent been around"" but she doesnt even hear him (over the fwomp of his awaiting helicopter) and when he tells an unidentified lady-friend on the phone ""Im f - - king nothing. Im not even a person."" We know that. Are we supposed to feel sorry for a guy who has squandered his freedom for a cliche of alienation? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Avatar tops list of the most-pirated films of 2010 repo...

"Somewhere | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; somewhere ) Somewhere (United States 2010) December 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With her most recent directorial outing Sofia Coppola has strayed into an area of pretentiousness that we have rarely seen since the height of the French New Wave. Theres probably a class of cinephile who will lap up Somewhere savoring its bland flavor between bites of Baluga caviar and sips of Margaux 1982 Cabernet Sauvignon. For the rest of us though this movie works best as a sleep tonic. Somewhere isnt just frustratingly slow-moving; its inert. The movie begins with a static shot of what appears to be an elliptical race course. The way the camera is set up we can see two sections of it - one in the foreground and another in the background (opposite sides of the oval). A Ferrari zips by entering on the left and exiting on the right. Shortly thereafter it re-enters higher on the frame now moving right to left on the other side of the course. This is followed by a few seconds of inactivity during which we can hear the car engine. Then it reappears in the bottom portion of the frame once again headed left to right. This continues for several laps and more than a minute. It represents the first of numerous times throughout Somewhere in which Coppola sets down her camera and focuses on mundane repetitive action. Theres a point to this but the side effect neutralizes it. She wants us to understand the aimless mindset that defines the main character but by doing it this way she makes the film inaccessible. She misses the point that one does not have to make a boring film to dramatize the situation of a boring character. The tedium created by the filmmakers approach overwhelms its effectiveness. Instead of being hypnotized into continuing to watch we feel a powerful desire to either fall asleep or walk out. Once Somewhere has moved passed the Ferrari it introduces us to Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a movie star who lives out of a suite at the Chateau Marmont. His life is characterized by parties recreational sex junkets and occasional visits by his 11-year old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning). For the first 15 minutes theres no dialogue and even when the talking begins its sparse and rarely is anything important or memorable said. The only thing of interest in Somewhere is the relationship between Johnny and Cleo but this is so marginalized by the limited screen time accorded to their interaction that it becomes almost meaningless. Only one scene evidences any humanity - a moment in Johnnys car when Cleo starts crying because shes afraid both parents are abandoning her. Johnnys parting remark to her (which she cant hear) - that he wishes he had been there for her - rings hollow in light of the metaphorical way in which Somewhere concludes. Ultimately this is intended to be the story of how Cleo breaks through Johnnys barriers and brings him into touch with the real world giving him back his life. In the end however I didnt care. I was simply counting down the minutes until the end credits rolled. With Somewhere Coppola seems to be attempting something similar to what she accomplished with Lost in Translation at least in terms of tone. One obvious difference is that in the earlier film there existed an empathy with the lead characters that is absent here. Also where Lost in Translation was meditative and seductive Somewhere is flat-out boring. Although lead actor Stephen Dorff exhibits little in the way of charisma the same cannot be said about Elle Fanning who is ethereal. She speaks volumes with her expressions which are often her only means of communication in a production thats light on dialogue. Easily the equal of her older sister Dakota in talent Elle represents Cleo as a young girl on the cusp of womanhood. In some scenes she is presented as a child. In others (especially those in which shes hanging out with Johnnys adult male friend) theres a quasi-sexual aspect to the character. Unfortunately Coppola curtails Fannings scenes (possibly due to hourly limitations for working minors) thereby limiting the number of scenes with potential emotional resonance. Indeed the only instances in which Somewhere comes to life are when Fanning is on-screen. Somewheres self-conscious and obvious artiness may prove to be its undoing in all but the most elitist film circles. It demands more from its audience than most viewers will be willing to give and offers scant rewards for those sacrifices. Theres something to be said about the simplicity with which the movie has been composed and the quiet tranquility of some of its scenes but such pleasant sidelights are not enough to overcome the movies central problem.

Photo Merrick Morton Focus Features Somewhere review Compelling look at celebrity 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Somewhere Drama. Starring Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning. Directed by Sofia Coppola. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The question about ""Somewhere"" is whether anyone will like it for the right reasons. That is for pure reasons for how it was intended. Or will they enjoy it for the way it allows them to press their noses to the glass and see how the other ... not half but privileged sliver-of-a-percentage ... lives? For 15 minutes this new film from Sofia Coppola is blase and deadpan slightly precious and not particularly interesting. The movie follows a scruffy fellow played by Stephen Dorff as he goes about his life. He tests a sports car. (Coppola shows us lap after lap after lap). He watches twins do pole dances in his hotel room. (Coppola gives us two whole pole dances.) Whenever he steps outside women smile at him even though he looks like an unshaven slob. One wonders why and then the reason is revealed. Hes a movie star. As in a big one like bigger than Stephen Dorff. More like Brad Pitt when he was single. With that revelation ""Somewhere"" suddenly becomes riveting. But do we actually care about this man? Do we feel sorry for him when he calls his ex-wife weeping about how hes ""nothing"" and ""not even a person""? Maybe we do if the ""we"" in this case includes other movie stars and people who travel in that world. But I suspect most other people will think gee too bad huh? What a hard life poor baby having to talk to the press and have sex with lots of women and accept all those awards and all. It must be a living hell. Related Stories Somewhere This is a winning formula for Coppola all the more winning because its arrived at sincerely First she shows us people who are enormously well off. Then she assures us lest we begin to resent them and by extension her that every one of these people is absolutely miserable. Whats more she gives us enough specifics in terms of manners mores and functional details that we completely understand why they easily could be miserable. After all it gets stuffy in those hotel rooms and its a little irritating having everybody laugh at your jokes when youre not funny or jump into bed with you just so they can gossip about it later. There are worse and more dignified ways of being unhappy of course but in a way thats part of the misery too. Thats part of feeling like youre ""not even a person."" Elle Fanning plays the stars 11-year-old daughter another child of privilege in the Coppola oeuvre (like Marie Antoinette) and another witness to the inside world of celebrity (like Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation""). Forced by circumstances to stay with him for a few weeks she lives in the various hotels playing high-end video games travels with him to Milan to promote a film and wakes up to have breakfast with his latest one-night stand. She stares daggers at her father across the table. The emotion in ""Somewhere"" is diffused as if the characters are feeling things but not completely not as other people feel them. Theres a disconnect or a distance that perhaps comes from overstimulation. To have access to everything means to feel less and to have so many people in ones life and so much distraction and so many temptations of the ego and the flesh is to find oneself on the outside of normal things like family. Personal relationships just doesnt mean as much even if you want them to or need them to. Indeed it could be a disservice to Coppola to believe that she wants us to care about this father and daughter and we dont. Coppolas ambitions may not be so conventional. I suspect her real intention and what she reinforces stylistically (and what she could never admit on a talk show or else people will get mad at her) is for us to watch this relationship from a cool distance and observe where its real and where its distorted to see it as a modern-day curiosity with some residual human elements. Whatever the intention ""Somewhere"" in its odd detached way is compelling viewing. By the way did you know that if youre a big shot and you check out of a hotel you dont have to pack your bags? You dont even have to have an assistant pack your bags. The hotel will do it for you and store your stuff until you come back.

(Morton/AP) BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS FILM CRITIC Wednesday December 22 2010 400 AM Title Somewhere An isolated actor finds meaning in fatherhood. With Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning. Director Sofia Coppola (137). R Nudity sex language. At the Angelika Lincoln Square.Despite its evident sense of self-importance Sofia Coppola""s ""Somewhere"" is an undeniably minor film. But if you""re willing to be indulgent you""ll find surprising pleasures hidden within.Chief among these are its two central turns from the unlikely pair of Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning. Dorff is Johnny Marco a lonely superstar whose schedule of press junkets parties and anonymous sex are taking their toll. When his preteen daughter (Fanning) arrives for an extended stay at his Chateau Marmont suite his crisis deepens. Their bond gives meaning to Johnny""s life but it also highlights what""s missing most of the time.There is no greater insight here beyond the contrast and connection between an authentic child and an alienated adult. But Dorff and Fanning are perfect in their roles and Coppola captures the draining narcissism of celebrity culture with the understanding of someone who""s witnessed it all her life.The film is also visually striking though Coppola""s intentionally overlongshots only occasionally achieve the poetry or perception they""re meant to evoke.Ultimately it""s unlikely many New Yorkers will be especially moved by the existential angst of Hollywood.

"Movie review Somewhere - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review SomewhereSofia Coppola goes minimalist with this ode to connecting in a disconnected world. So whats with the big moment of overstatement?December 22 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Stephen Dorff center and Elle Fanning right star in Sofia Coppolas... (Franco Biciocchi / Focus...)""Somewhere"" is a kind of road movie of the soul a delicate meditative look at a particular state of mind in a particular time and place. The latest from writer-director Sofia Coppola its a film in which doing less on screen is more and doing more is less and if that sounds kind of Delphic that suits the situation precisely. Slight but often seductive and so deliberately not in a hurry it periodically threatens to dissolve right in front of our eyes ""Somewhere"" is more successful in creating ambience and visual imagery than it is in telling its story of a movie star bonding with his 11-year-old daughter. In fact Coppola credits a conversation she had with masterful cinematographer Harris Savides (best known for his dreamy work with Gus Van Sant) with inspiring the project. They talked about collaborating in telling a story with maximum simplicity a ""I wanted the whole thing to be understated and subtle"" the director says a and thats been accomplished here. Savides striking visuals turn out to be the films major strength. ""Somewhere"" was not only shot primarily in Los Angeles it feels like the city the way few films do not only because of familiar locations such as a Big 5 sporting goods store Sunset Plaza and the 101 Freeway heading north but because the places air of impermanence and particular quality of light have made it onto the screen. Even the films title has an L.A. connection Coppola says it was inspired by the use of type in artist Ed Ruschas paintings. Like Coppolas previous ""Lost in Translation"" ""Somewhere"" deals with themes of adult dislocation and free-floating ennui and like that film it is set largely in a hotel this time Los Angeles clubby Chateau Marmont the Sunset Boulevard establishment that functions as a de facto home away from home for movie business types. Before we meet the hotel we meet the man who stays there Johnny Marco and before that we meet his car a jet-black Ferrari thats shown for several minutes speeding around an empty track at an empty desert location. Clearly this is not a life that is going anywhere special at the moment. When Marco (played by Stephen Dorff) gets out of the car what hes wearing a the standard L.A. hipster uniform of black T-shirt jeans hiking books and sunglasses a marks him as the person we gradually learn he is a louche movie star kind of a combination of Johnny Depp and Steve McQueen who is essentially killing time between projects. Staying at the Chateau Johnny breaks his arm in a moment of celebrity inebriation and that puts a further crimp in a life of privileged boredom. Johnny serves as a poster boy for the excesses of celebrity from pills to parties to the pouty women who seek his amatory attention but the reality is that nothing involves him nothing makes him happy nothing keeps him fully awake even during sex. The truth that Johnny is not a particularly interesting person is a drawback that never goes away. What ""Somewhere"" is especially good at is detailing the unreal minutiae of movie star lives something Coppola certainly is familiar with. Johnny has to attend a press junket at the Four Seasons Hotel where real journalists playing journalists ask him deeply inane questions. He experiences the ministrations of an unconventional masseur as well as pole-dancing identical twins Bambi and Cindy (played by Playboy models Kristina and Karissa Shannon). And in the films most surreal scene Johnny goes to a special effects house where his entire head is slathered in a kind of white goo to create a rubber mask depicting him as an old man. The conventional dramatic focus of ""Somewhere"" kicks in when Johnny returns to his room to find his daughter Cleo ( Elle Fanning) waiting by the door. Johnny clearly is not a major presence in Cleos life but arbitrary complications mean that the two are going to spend more time with each other than theyre used to. Though the filmmaker the daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola has been firm in rejecting the notion that ""Somewhere"" is autobiographical it is also clear as she said in one interview that this story is ""informed by familiarity"" and that knowledge helps give this particular situation added piquancy. But for several reasons not the least of which are obviousness and over-familiarity this part of the film a the story of a celebrity living in a world short on meaningful connections who discovers that children are what matters in life a does not really have enough drama to sustain our interest. This difficulty is heightened by the fact that unexpectedly in a film that has been so beautifully reticent for so long ""Somewhere"" ends with specific voicing of emotions in a way that feels forced and unconvincing. Better to have followed the example of ""Lost in Translation"" in which Bill Murray whispers something to Scarlett Johansson that only she can hear. Still though it loses its nerve in places ""Somewhere"" has success with what it sets out to do. Its a quiet experiment a minimalist tone poem that does more with less than were used to seeing. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Somewhere MPAA rating R for sexual content nudity and language Running time 1 hour 37 minutes Playing at the ArcLight Hollywood; AMC Century City 15 Century City MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBrad Pitt is a model for aging actorsJune 22 2013Review Sofia Coppolas Bling Ring a pretty empty...June 13 2013Sofia Coppolas showbiz story thats intimate not personalDecember 20 2010The Directors Sofia Coppola takes a floor at the Chateau...October 31 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentSteve McqueenMovie StarCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-somewhere-20101222,0,1340757.story",200,somewhere27,somewhere,latimes
"Somewhere review A story that goes nowhere |       NJ.com comments Somewhere review A story that goes nowhere Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 22 2010 at 803 AM View/Post Comments Merrick MortonStephen Dorff and Elle Fanning star in Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere."" Its been interesting watching Sofia Coppola turn into an artful filmmaker. Waiting for her to become an exciting storyteller though just gets more frustrating. She showed an occasional almost cartoon playfulness in ""The Virgin Suicides""; her latest ""Somewhere"" shows a very knowing sense of composition and pacing. But apart from ""Lost in Translation"" -- basically a short story carried along to feature length on the deadpan mug of Bill Murray -- her movies range from the uninvolving to as in ""Marie Antoinette"" the just plain wrongheaded. ""Somewhere"" for example the story of a dissolute movie star begins with a shot of him testing out his sports car on a desolate racetrack. The quick immediate visual metaphor is of a rich man going in circles; the image which tightly crops the oval so the car is off-screen for long periods signals the directors intent to show us only part of the picture and have us fill in the rest. Movie Review Somewhere (R) Focus (98 min.) Directed by Sofia Coppola. With Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains sexual situations and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Except what Coppola goes on to show throughout the film isnt elliptical as much as simply empty. The actor hires strippers (and falls asleep during their pole dance) stumbles down a flight of stairs sits through a long makeup session -- and slowly reconnects with a pubescent daughter he barely knows. Yet theres no drama here because theres not a lot at stake and the filmmakers preoccupations -- which since her teenage script for father Francis section of ""New York Stories"" have focused on the precocious the privileged and the bored -- remain uninvolving. Franco BiciocchiStephen Dorff and Elle Fanning star in Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere."" Thats not a question of the material; F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about old money and youthful ennui too. But compare ""Somewhere"" to his story ""Babylon Revisited"" -- in which a crashed-and-burned father tries desperately to win back custody of his daughter -- and you see the difference between hip attitude and high art. As the shallow movie star Stephen Dorff -- whos always seemed like the poor fans Kiefer Sutherland anyway -- convinces a little too easily. As his daughter Elle Fanning has one good scene as well as the sweetly vulnerable look of a girl on the brink of adolescence. But the movie gives them very little to do. And its not helped by Coppolas own slightly snarky sense of superiority to her supporting characters -- really for a supposedly sophisticated young woman shes an oddly parochial snob. The Japanese in ""Lost in Translation"" the French royals in ""Marie Antoinette"" the Italian celebrities here -- boy foreigners are just funny arent they? Sofia Coppola is closing in on 40 now but she spent her 20s bouncing around a lot of different dilettantish interests; to her credit all of those passions from music to fashion inform her films today. She has a good eye and an interesting way of saying things. Now if she could only find something interesting to say.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Theres a trick with realism that allows us to think a filmmaker has dropped everything to follow someone and in so doing we want to follow that someone too. Its a mastery of illusion that Sofia Coppola for all her other talents as a filmmaker doesnt have yet. For ""Somewhere she invites us to spend an hour and a half or so in the company of a famous actor named Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff). With his arm in a cast Johnny languishes in a suite at Los Angeless Chateau Marmont hotel which under the circumstances doubles as a kind of celebrity halfway house.I cant say why Coppola wanted to spend time with this man. Its like following someone on Twitter who fails to generate many compelling tweets.""Drove the Ferrari around in circles. Cool.""Twin strippers came by. Brought pole. Danced to Foo Fighters. Wuznt feelin it.""Think that was Benicio Del Toro in the elevator. Sup bro.""Twins came back. Did tennis routine to that song that sounds like JLo.""Got massage today. Wasnt my usual girl. A dude. Took off his towel. Wuznt even feelin it.""In Italy for junket. Mayor gave me key to city. Girl I never called back gave me finger.Even by the rather forgiving standards of realism Johnny is dull. Coppola might have been wondering whether its possible to do for the affluent what directors like Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne do for the indigent locate profundity in desperate little moments. When Johnny goes into a makeup studio to have a mold made of his head for a new project it feels as if the movie might take off. The prosthetic takes 40 minutes to set. After its done Johnny looks like an old man. He seems sufficiently impressed with the results. But the moment is purely that -- a moment. Coppola simply affixes her playlist to the soundtrack and lets her camera gaze at whatever.Most of Johnnys time is spent in the company of his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) whose mother has dropped her with him for a few weeks. Cleo is semi-independent (see her cook) and semi-spoiled. But she loves her father and seems disappointed by his sluttiness and many paternal shortcomings. Coppola has mentioned that ""Somewhere might be a loosely personal tale about her girlhood spent with her own reckless father Francis Ford Coppola. Its too loose to be apparent. The melancholy that wafts through the film is the sadness of privilege. For instance having to catch a helicopter to arrive at your summer camp in the California desert really doesnt look like fun at all.What a flat movie for Coppola to have made four films into her otherwise remarkable directing career. ""Marie Antoinette her last from 2006 was a vibrant surprisingly shrewd essay on the power of shallowness and the shallowness of certain power. Its a movie thats getting better with age. ""Somewhere is a natural next movie only insofar as the protagonist has no head. It feels as if Coppola is on the verge of having an opinion about celebrity and the toxins of fame that she might have the antidote to the misguided if well-meant lunacy of ""Im Still Here. Both have titles that proclaim relevance. So Im not sure Coppola senses a problem and if she does she spends the film clearing her throat instead of speaking.The movie could be a comment simply on her own star. Dorff has never been the most exciting actor. But he and Johnny have the tattoos of a man whos made some poor choices. One reminds us that hes ""made in the USA and on his elbows are birds. Once with the strippers he looks on from his bed like a sick child home from school. The second time hes like a little boy on Christmas day. After 20 minutes with him were no longer moviegoers. Were baby sitters. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

ABOUT THE MOVIESomewhere    (out of four) Stars Stephen Dorff Elle Fanning Michelle Monaghan Laura Ramsey Benicio Del ToroDirector Sofia CoppolaDistributor Focus FeaturesRating R for sexual content nudity and languageRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens Wednesday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Somewhere is a perceptive look at celebrity culture even if it sometimes feels more like a collection of scenes a character piece in search of a larger overarching story. Anchored by engaging performances by Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning it trains a sharp eye on both the rarefied existence of a movie star and the world of an adolescent shuttled between divorced parents and yearning to find a home. Given that the writer/director is Sofia Coppola and that a father-daughter relationship is at its core its hard not to look at this film through the lens of autobiography. How much is Fannings young Cleo like Sofia struggling to find common ground with her famous filmmaker father Frances Ford Coppola? Or maybe it cribs from the life of her movie-star cousin Nicolas Cage? Whatever the influence Coppola knows something about fame not only from her own upbringing and the lives of famous people around her but also as a celebrated filmmaker. Somewhere won the top prize at this years Venice Film Festival and her second film 2003s Lost in Translation won her an Oscar for best original screenplay. Dorff makes the lead character hard-living action star Johnny Marco more likable than we might expect in a celebrity whose every need is anticipated and met. Had a different actor taken this role Johnny might have been an obnoxious narcissist. But as played by Dorff hes a lost disconnected but inherently decent person unfailingly courteous even though he does tend to fall asleep during amorous encounters. The film opens with him lying in his bed at the famous Sunset Boulevard hotel Chateau Marmont watching a pair of blond twins work a stripper pole. Theres a pathetic quality to their cheery gymnastic efforts. His slight smile is rueful. He has more depth than he lets on as he struggles to transcend the trappings of movie stardom. He shares sweet moments with the daughter he doesnt know well but loves and he clearly has the heart of an artist. But he spends so much time trying to escape himself that at first we fail to see it. Twelve-year-old Fanning is stepping out of the shadow of her older sister actress Dakota Fanning. She is superb in the role of 11-year-old Cleo a competent strikingly mature and surprisingly unaffected child who has learned to fend for herself. She cooks like someone far beyond her years whipping up a picture-perfect breakfast of eggs Benedict. But she giggles adorably at improvised silliness with her dads buddy (Chris Pontius). She seems remarkably well-adjusted despite a checked-out mother and a dad always off on film sets. Theres a hypnotic poetic quality to this impressionistic piece with long wordless scenes capturing the lassitude of Johnnys aimless existence. These scenes and the music speak volumes. Some could find the story verging on self-indulgence and indeed there are patches that teeter perilously close. But we care about the two main characters and we root for them to reconnect as father and daughter. That says much about Coppolas gifts as both a storyteller and a filmmaker.

Coppolas fourth feature winner of the Golden Lion at Venice this year is at times similarly aimless and empty. But those who groan that the writer-director has made another indulgent film about the obscenely privileged have overlooked Coppolas redoubtable gifts at capturing milieu languor and exacting details.West Hollywoods Chateau Marmont where Johnny lives continues the role played by Tokyos Park Hyatt in Lost in Translation and Versailles in Marie Antoinette a liminal pleasure palace where all desires are anticipated before theyre even articulated and no request is too outlandish. Yet for all the twin pole dancers Johnny can order up to his room and naked women wearing sailor caps waiting in his bed Coppola also shows the flipside of erotic abandon and concierge service in her portrait of the Chateau (where John Belushi ODd in 1982) focusing on the ""braindeadness aphonia sadness [and] ineffability"" of boutique living in the words of cultural critic Wayne Koestenbaum in Hotel Theory.Aphonia or loss of voice Not much is said in Somewhere a loose-jointed chronicle of Johnnys copious down time as he nurses the wrist he broke while drunkenly falling down the Chateaus stairs and waits around to be told what to do by his fawning manager. Of his scant professional obligations one involves doing a few hours of publicity for his latest mediocrity Berlin Agenda--a set piece that hilariously sends up the particular stupidity of the press junket from the aggressive obsequiousness of publicists (""That was awesome"") to the staggering inanity of film journalists (""How do you think this role represents Italian-Americans?"").Coppolas bid for audience empathy for Johnny--played by an actor whose career has oscillated between B and D list over the past 20 years--proves to be Somewheres most insurmountable obstacle (though its a much more palatable request than being asked to feel anything for Bill Murrays intolerable middle-aged depressive in Lost in Translation). Dorff like Johnny is seedily handsome and plays his role with an impressive disregard for vanity A box of Propecia visibly rests on the bathroom sink; after posing for photos with his Berlin Agenda co-star Michelle Monaghan (in a tart cameo) Johnny steps off a three-inch platform. But his final-act epiphany accompanied by tears and midnight confessions grates as much as the smirk on his face in the films closing image--its an unearned catharsis with as much poignancy as an Us magazine ""Just Like Us"" photo spread.Yet Somewhere does find emotional ballast in Elle Fanning (11 years old when the movie was shot) playing Cleo Johnnys daughter. All limbs and flaxen hair like the Lisbon sisters of The Virgin Suicides--Coppolas first film and one of the best about the mysteries of girlhood--Cleo easily and necessarily assumes the role of caretaker preparing eggs Benedict for Johnny and his goofball friend Sammy (Chris Pontius of Jackass) during one of her visits to Dad at the Chateau. Though smart and capable Cleos not precocious and Johnny is most comfortable with his daughter when theyre playmates battling each other in Guitar Hero or indulging in room-service gelato.Coppola and Fanning almost as tall as Dorff subtly incorporate the fact that Cleo still a kid and eager for parental guidance and support is also on the cusp of adulthood of shifting from pre-sexual to sexual being. The withering look she gives her father as shes forced to make breakfast small-talk with one of his many rotating bedmates indicates the preteens own burning discomfort at having to endure her fathers carnal misadventures--and also inadvertently showcases Fannings superior talent outshining her lead. Where Johnnys tears will make you roll your eyes Cleos will break your heart.

Share Tweet Viewers averse to obvious visual metaphors involving cars should probably skip the first (and maybe the last) scene of Sofia Coppolas fourth feature Somewhere. The film opens with protagonist Stephen Dorff driving a Ferrari around in circles for long minutes shortly before we see him living the directionless hard-partying life of a between-projects movie star at the Chateau Marmont. The scenes mean much the same thing but at least in the car Dorffs character can pretend hes in control. With little but a few hours of movie promotion on the agenda he drinks pops pills smokes cigarette after cigarette and has listless sex with whoever floats his way. Or not In an early scene a pair of pole dancers perform a private routine in his room to a blaring Foo Fighters song as Dorff nods off. Hes wearing an approving smile but unable--or just too bored--to do anything about it. Coppola shoots the scene like she shoots the movie lingering over the image of the women performing their stiffly choreographed tease and letting Harris Savides grainy cinematography and the sound of flesh squeaking on metal remove any hint of glamour. Then she shows the women packing up their poles and leaving. From his room Dorff can order up pretty much anything he wants but hes reached the limits of what his imagination can summon up and possibly what his body can handle. And in the end nobody sticks around. Enter Dorffs daughter cheerily played by Elle Fanning. Usually just around on weekends shes dumped in his care when her mother takes off for undisclosed reasons for an indeterminate time. Suddenly responsibilities like shopping for summer camp enter the picture and a whirlwind trip to Italy to promote his latest none-too-promising-looking movie turns from a transplanted version of his usual debauch to a family vacation for two. That sounds cloying on the page but in Coppolas hands its anything but. Fanning remains almost relentlessly upbeat but her performance doesnt hide the sadness beneath it all and as the film moves forward it becomes clear how much shes had to invent herself. Shes turned out great but probably only through sheer force of will. Her presence has an effect on Dorff but it often seems more unnerving than life-changing. Looking up from his cell phone hes enthralled by an ice-skating lesson but wonders why he never cared before while Coppolas camera captures each uncomfortable realization of how much hes missed. Coppolas films are no stranger to this sort of world; each one has studied the psychic toll of isolation and privilege. Somewhere has strong echoes of Lost In Translation in particular from the luxury hotels to an encounter with another countrys bizarre television but the style--all understatement and studied long takes--breaks rewardingly with what shes done before. Its all so uneasily compelling and quietly moving it might be too much to ask her to sustain it through the conclusion which gives Dorff a Charlie-Sheen-breaking-down-in-Wall-Street moment before the symbolic Ferrari shows up again.

"A Hollywood icon anchors a transients tale - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A Hollywood icon anchors a transients taleSomewhere a 3 starsDecember 21 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticMany including writer-director Sofia Coppola herself have noted that Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" ""Marie Antoinette"" and now ""Somewhere"" take place in either literal or (in the case of Versailles) metaphoric hotels magnets for ennui as well as possibility. In a hotel as Vicki Baum wrote in her novel ""Grand Hotel"" nothing ever happens but everything happens in spite of all that nothing.So it is with ""Somewhere"" a small but in its way daring picture set largely within the confines of the Chateau Marmont just above Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. This is a starry hotel with a wonderfully narcissistic web site whose homepage describes the Marmont as ""the set of a film waiting for someone to call action.""Or Inaction ""Somewhere"" has just enough incident to hold itself together and no more. Coppolas film -- about an even-tempered 11-year-old and her occasional father and the time they spend together -- is not interested in thesis statements or head-on crises. We are eavesdropping between the lines and in the margins here hanging out with a successful action star played by Stephen Dorff who spends his time and money at the Marmont his current residence prior to the promotional duties attached to his latest paycheck a thriller called ""Berlin Agenda.""For a while Coppola observes this character named Johnny Marco mostly in isolation often drinking and smoking. Hes alone even when hes in the proximity of rent-a-strippers who come to his hotel room with their own portable poles and whose jewelry clanks against the metal poles in a slyly funny way. Into this easygoing somewhat forlorn decadence comes a naif. It is Johnnys daughter Cleo (played by the very fine Elle Fanning) whose mother (who has primary custody by a mile) is having some problems. Abruptly it is Johnnys turn to take care of the kid before she heads off to summer camp. So they go ice skating. They go to Italy for the Italian premiere of Johnnys movie. They do nothing in particular albeit expensively. They get acquainted in a way Johnny hasnt made time for before.In a nod to maverick ""loner"" pictures of the late 60s and early 70s studio era ""Somewhere"" begins with a shot of Johnny going in literal circles somewhere in the countryside in his sports car and ends with a figurative straight-line walk into the unknown. Dorff clearly relishes the chance to play this role though hes more effective detailing the groggy amiable side of Johnny the one skating on the surface of his own life than he is at suggesting what may be beneath that surface. Coppola though wants only so much overt conflict.Dorff and Fanning share the screen with two key co-stars. One is the hotel which we get to know as well as Johnny knows it. The other is cinematographer Harris Savides a true unsentimental artist. Hes a genius with digital video (""Zodiac"") but with ""Somewhere"" as with Noah Baumbachs ""Greenberg"" he proves himself a master with old-fashioned film stock. The way he captures the hazy somewhat sinister sunlight of L.A. you can practically taste it. Its pretty but never in a postcard way. Coppolas film may frustrate some with its narrative concerns (i.e. not enough of them) but I found myself grateful that a filmmaker the daughter of a famous director and a relative of many other famous and talented showbiz kids could make a convincing case for this kind of inside-baseball story both in the writing and in the leisurely observant telling. mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for sexual content nudity and language)Cast Stephen Dorff (Johnny Marco); Elle Fanning (Cleo); Chris Pontius (Sammy)Credits Written and directed by Sofia Coppola; produced by Coppola G.

This time she swaps Versailles for Sunset Boulevard and the French queen for Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) a movie star living in limbo in a Hollywood hotel. Not any lodging house either but the Chateau Marmont a haven for upscale decadence where one is likely as Johnny does to bump into the likes of Benicio del Toro in the lift (a nod to Scarlett Johanssons joke that she had a steamy encounter with him in one of the hotels elevators).Johnny does little apart from feel like a spare part at his own parties lie in bed watching strippers slide down poles as he recovers from a broken arm and occasionally obey orders to attend press conferences. The only constant in his life beyond room service is his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning). Even then this smiling smart girls visits feel like an awkward duty. Its only when Cleos mother leaves her with him for longer than usual that Johnny hangs out with her takes her to Italy and enjoys the warmth of a father-daughter relationship even if theyre not doing much more than playing tennis on Wii Sports and sharing ice cream.The upscale hotel location the character in limbo and on the cusp of recovery or reawakening and the tenderness between two unlikely characters are all familiar from Lost in Translation and theres a sense of treading old ground. At the same time for all the familiarity the difference is that this is a film about Hollywood the place as well as the ideal and theres a hint of the sinister side of celebrity in the anonymous nasty texts Johnny receives and his paranoia that hes being followed by paparazzi wherever he goes.That said the films notes on fame are gentle and wry never damning or deep so questions from journalists dont reach the satirical levels of 8 1/2 or even the reality of Dont Look Back. Some gags - of which theres only a sprinkling - are surprisingly broad Johnny goes to bed with someone and falls asleep between her legs; his masseur alarms him by preferring to work in the nude; crude Italian models swamp him at an awards ceremony.Coppola is more comfortable with the quieter more moody and dominant side of her film. She opens as Johnny drives a sports car round and round a track at length. Later he motors across the country en route to a suggested personal epiphany to which Coppola is too cool to get too close meaning that the film fades out weakly. She prefers to look not touch standout scenes include Chloe skating around a rink as her father looks on and another in which Johnny has a mould made of his head leaving us feeling claustrophobic and him strangely free as he sits in silence and encased. Coppola works with Gus Van Sants cinematographer Harris Savides and the link with Van Sant shows in a use of natural light  stillness and a search for the essential in quiet scenes.For all the knowing Hollywood face of Somewhere its the non-celebrity Chloe who is the films soul. Her age moving from child to teens means her interaction with her dad and other adults is oddly ambiguous and Coppola again shows how keen she is to show cosseted young girls and women struggling with their place in the world. The rapport between Dorff and Fanning is fun and tender especially when she shoots him daggers when he brings a woman to breakfast in Italy but while its Johnnys life we see the most of its Chloes which ends up being the most intriguing.

But Im not so sure about this film. I mean it was good - the trailer probably gave away too much (probably should have been more done in the way Blue Valentines trailer was done as it hardly tells you anything) - but it feels like Sofia hasnt put in as much time amp; planning into this film as the others. The minimalism of the film affects the script - as it is quite bland in parts for example when Stephen Dorff is in the elevator listening to Benicio Del Toro talking about how he met Bono in the hotel. I feel the beauty of the Chateau Marmount was also not completely captured I was expecting more...and there were also too much nudity (i.e. bare breasts) in the film. And that dude who played Guitar Hero with Elle was totally lame. Not even compelling - why was he cast..? Too much facial hair. Elle Fanning is brilliant - she was a stand-out - what a gem Sofias experimental approach was good though - you have to tip your hats to her courage in making a film that is reminiscent of the long takes of the French New Wave era. Looking forward to her going back to usual style using Lance Acord as the DP.

Opening image. Protagonist drives sexy phallic car very fast round and round in circles on a racetrack. Going nowhere. Closing image. Protagonist slows to a stop walks away from and leaves said car on the hard shoulder key in ignition. Going somewhere. In between Coppola tells the story of the hip movie star and the shallow meaningless life that drains his soul. Forced to spend time with his estranged daughter he reconnects with a life of value and having at last found a loving relationship and someone who needs him he chooses to mend his broken spirit by exiting Tinseltown and re-entering fatherhood. The expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 20 2010Two Jews On FilmFeaturedThe Two Jews On Film thought Somewherewas nowhere Boring pretentious film that will fool a lot of people Check out our full review at YouTube.com/user/twojewsonfilmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 16 2010EvieFeaturedA few scenes could have done with some HEAVY editing - notably one where Johnny is just sitting alone on a sofa drinking a beer for about 5 minutes - however i liked the unhurried pace which allowed scenes the space to breathe. Not a demanding film you can just relax soak it in and enjoy the soundtrack. Loved the iceskating scene really beautiful. Dorff is perfect at playing the superficial film star but I wasnt so convinced by Johnnys breakdown. Its hard to have empathy for the characters self pity when he has no worries in the world apart from being occasionally a bit bored.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 16 2010ianFeaturedYet more know it all comments All these wanna be film critic types just a blinkng bore.

Much left open-ended but that is like life. I enjoyed seeing this on a grim sunday afternoon some amusing bits such as fawning publicity people.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 14 2010david glowackiFeaturedl was eager to see this film as an admirer of Copellas films.This latest effort turn out to be a flat and uninvolving film..The well worn story of moral and sexual debasement in glitzy LA is rolled out.The usual footage of LAs freeways and swimming pools etc are in evidence.The films complete lack of any emotional connection and hackneyed story make the film very mild.The flesh creeping world of Los Angeles lifestyleswhere one can indulge in moneysexfast cars and fameyet still go home every night feeling empty inside has been done better before.The main actor is not quite up to his role.However the 11 year old daughter is a delight with her shysweet and gentle persona.However Sophie Copella will eventually surpass her famous dad in film makingas she has an eye for the intimate and personal in her films whilst her father was a more conventional large scale film makerFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 13 2010pet28FeaturedIm a big fan of Coppola Both daughter and father. I felt like this movie is a tribute to her dad. I like the film alot especially the fact that its made so beautifully. Although its not as good as i was expected. The message is too easy. And the theme is definitely out of extra-ordinary. But maybe thats her point. By the way can you please fix the text since her name is not Chloe Its CleoFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 12 2010PipFeaturedYes not alot happened and yes it was a dull story line but that was the point. The point of the film was to show the mournful and lonely side of fame and thats what it did. It was honest and beautifully made. Viewers who think bad of it obviously dont understand the concept of Coppolas work.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 11 2010Jane taylorFeaturedI really liked the film the sparseness and sense of dislocation. The fact that nothing happenned seemed to be the point. the ending was ambiguous and again I enjoyed the welcome lack of resolution leaving the viewer more room to provide their own interpretation. Good luck to Coppola. It was a film about the redemptive power of parenthood- not an orginal subject but one which resonates. On the minus side the most intersting journeys of the minor characters were left unexlored.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 9 2010CIFeaturedIts a beautiful film with wonderful symbolism and stmosphere that those who appreciate realistic films without unneccesary melodrama will love. Its melancholy and touching and allows us to examine the way we make decisions in our own lives.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Sofia Coppolas study of L.A. dolce vita had its world premiere at this years Venice Film Festival where the Jury headed by Coppolas former boyfriend Quentin Tarantino awarded it the top-prize Golden Lion. Somewhere opens Dec. 22 in New York City Los Angeles Chicago San Francisco and the Boston and Washington D.C. areas. Below is Richard Corlisss review from Venice which originally ran Sept. 5 2010 on Time.com. Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) the focal character in Sofia Coppolas Somewhere belongs to a social class that might be called the homeless elite. A Hollywood star of undefined wattage he doesnt have an ocean-front Malibu palace perched on an earthquake fault line. He stays at the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Blvd. -- that funky-cool faux-French hotel where Garbo and Howard Hughes lived and John Belushi and Helmut Newton died. All amenities available twin blonds performing an elaborately sexy pole dance right in Johnnys room and an old waiter wholl sing Elviss ""Teddy Bear"" on request. Johnny is restless; he knows his life needs direction but in which direction? Well... somewhere. For now though hes a permanent transient. Movie people are nomads ever on location forming alliances and liaisons that are as intense as they are evanescent. (Who are you I love you goodbye.) For these traveling salesmen of make-believe a hotel is home -- an artificial but for film folk natural domestic domicile. The other members of the crew are the siblings of this post-nuclear family; the hotel-suite desk is the dining room; room service is the helpful spouse whos there only when needed. (See Richard Corliss review of Black Swan.)And after the production is finished movie people promote their wares at film festivals where they stay in different posher hotels. Here on the Lido at the Venice Film Festival theyre often at the Excelsior across the street from the Sala Grande where the big movies are shown. Many stars used to stay at the century-old Grand Hotel des Bains where Death in Venice and The English Patient were shot but which closed this year to be turned into a luxury apartment complex. During festivals movie critics are hotel critters too pursuing the celebrities and their films -- mice after the big cheese. Coppola who often accompanied her father Francis as he made movies around the world has been in more hotels than the Gideons. Her own work as writer-director often reflects her touring days with Dad. Lost in Translation (2003) booked Bill Murray as a middle-age movie star into a Tokyo hotel where he found a temporary cure for the spiritual blahs in Scarlett Johanssons smile. Of the 2006 Marie Antoinette which imagined the budding French queen as a giggly teen Coppola says ""Versailles was like a hotel too."" Now comes Somewhere with Johnny at the Marmont and at hostelries in Las Vegas and Milan. Like the Murray character hes a vaguely unhappy guy who gets thrown an emotional lifeline when his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) is sent to stay with him -- and as Sofia frequently did becomes her dads hotel pal. (See pictures of the glitz from Venices Film Festival 2008.) Somewhere could be described as a comedy-drama about self-discovery. Or the inside-movie story of a loner star. (The film is Entourage without the entourage.) Thats its similarity to Lost in Translation which on a 4 million budget took in a hefty 120 million at the worldwide box office and earned Coppola Oscar nominations for Best Picture Director (the first American woman in that category) and Screenplay. But viewers expecting the earlier movies muted seductiveness -- charm on wry -- will be disappointed. Somewhere has a lot of good impulses and a salutary faith in an audiences patience; but the films tone in its script performances and visual style is studiously uninflected. Its a document of people seen remotely maybe from outer space. Over the past decade directors of movies and TV shows have gone nuts with shaky-cam technique. Bless Coppola for keeping her camera still but she goes to the other extreme of European minimalism. Like Johnny the movie is an object in stasis. In the whole movie the camera moves only a few times and then just to give a slighter wider or closer view of the same static image (like Johnnys head caked in makeup goo for a monster mark). Other directorial ideas smell of freshman film school the opening shot of Johnny driving in a wide circle six or eight times matched by the closing shot of Johnny leaving his car to walk straight down a highway. The film is sometimes too obvious often too opaque. The blase-faire strategy extends to the main character. Coppola is to be cheered for not editorializing about Johnny; hes not a walking placard for Hollywood excess not a desperate artist. Hes really not much of anything. And hes not played by a star whose previous roles could give a hint to his internal makeup. In Lost in Translation Murrays soft saddish face and of course his quarter-century playing louche funnymen brought a comic attitude to the quiet precisely observed proceedings. Dorff 37 started acting on TV when he was Chloes age in an episode of The New Leave It to Beaver and starred in Backbeat (as original bass player Stu Sutcliffe) and Blade. Handsome but not distractingly so he has an agreeably crinkled face that could reveal his characters emotions if Johnny wanted to convey any. What Dorff lacks no insult intended is a clearly defined movie personality that would help clue the viewer to whats going on inside Johnny -- and for that matter inside the film. (See ""Sofias Choice."") Those secrets must be gleaned from the gifted young actress playing Johnnys daughter. The younger sister of Dakota Fanning Elle gives Cleo a fresh winning goodness. She likes rock n roll cooking figure skating and Twilight. Shes something you dont find in most movies especially movies about movie people -- a nice normal kid -- and Coppola must have been tempted to make Cleo the central character. But the writer-director resists any plot device as stark as redemption. Johnny is own his own at the end of the film and viewers will have to intuit that for this Hollywood nomad Cleos heart is his true home. She is the somewhere he needs to get to.

Daily Edition Login to download Somewhere -- Film Review 1007 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Deborah Young FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sofia Coppola makes a charming return to small-scale storytelling. TWITTER After her foray into historical costumers with ""Marie Antoinette"" Sofia Coppola makes a happy return to ""Lost in Translation"" territory in the cutback charmer ""Somewhere"" which illuminates the emptiness of a movie stars life in Los Angeles through close observation and gentle irony. Despite its subject Coppola seems to be exercising more of her European than American sensibility in the small-scale intimacy of this portrait. Lacking the stars of Translation it might not go quite as far with audiences but still can count on a strong critical push. Again shooting from her own original screenplay Coppola stays close to the details and innuendoes of the story making every shot count. With lots of fixed-frame shots and occasionally playing out scenes in real time the film has a relaxed indie rhythm and laid-back style that mimics the way young Hollywood actor Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) coasts through life. He is introduced in a daringly long monotonous opening shot as he drives his noisy Ferrari in circles on an empty track in the desert. The meaninglessness of this activity from which he emerges a little dazed is typical of everything he does falling down the stairs high and breaking an arm having sex with a stream of interchangeable blondes living on a diet of beer and cigarettes constant parties and more girls. With sardonic humor sex is shown as putting Johnny to sleep or as a quick meaningless physical workout. His venomous ex-girlfriends think hes a shallow jerk. But Johnny in Dorffs easygoing slightly anonymous interpretation actually is a nice guy. He doesnt even realize how lost he is until his ex-wife leaves town and forces him to spend several days in the company of his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning). Although he never has developed any fathering skills Johnny manages to show her a good time on a trip to Milan for the Telegatto Awards a send-up of Italian TV glitz. He still wakes up with a blonde in his bed (Italo starlet Laura Chiatti on this occasion) raising Cleos eyebrows but the foreign country brings them closer. Much of what works in Somewhere is subtle and glancing like the unemphasized comparison of fresh natural Cleo to Johnnys jaded lovers. In two delightful scenes repeated perhaps to show the unimaginative nature of his sexual fantasies pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) appear in his hotel room performing to disco tunes. Not long afterward Cleo performs an ice-skating routine to music in an equally succinct costume as her father looks on admiringly. Johnnys stumbling effort to assume a fathers role with Cleo is the first step to breaking out of his celebrity torpor. Scene by scene a bond builds between them eventually bringing Johnny to the Big Question first posed at a farcical news conference Who is he? An upbeat final scene gives hope hes looking for an answer. Dorff has the body and looks to play the hunky star as well as the humility to erase most traces of personality for the bland role which sometimes requires just smoking a cigarette from start to finish. Young Fanning who already is a veteran actress gives Cleo poise and lots of skills -- cooking skating -- that help mask her emotional fragility. In the part of Johnnys longtime buddy Chris Pontius (Jackass) has the naturalness with Cleo he badly lacks. Los Angeles is Somewheres""Tokyo and the city plays a principal role in the film. The iconic Chateau Marmont with its singing waiter Romolo and duplex suites plays a major part as Johnnys impersonal home and refuge. L.A.s interminable roads and freeways also figure prominently accompanied by the roar of the Ferrari imprisoned in traffic and always driving placidly down the middle lane.
