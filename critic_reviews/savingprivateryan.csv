Flicks picks.Heroic `Ryan Rings TrueJuly 24 1998|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is Steven Spielbergs World War II epic ""Saving Private Ryan"" which accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult -- making an action-filled anti-war film or at least one that doesnt in some way glorify or lie about combat.The opening 25-minute battle sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" expertly uses hand-held cameras -- including one operated by Spielberg himself reminding us hes literally a hands-on director as well as an impresario -- to take us into the middle of the death-filled D-Day landing of Allied troops on the bloody beaches of Normandy while German soldiers commanded the high ground and were able to pick off our arriving troops with ease.The D-Day story has been told many times on film as an episode in heroic planning and execution. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" execution takes on a different meaning while Spielberg still honors the heroism of moving forward in combat while enemy rifles are visibly trained on you.Critic and filmmaker Francois Truffaut once told me that he thought it was difficult to make an anti-war film because movies he said ""glamorize everything and always argue for whatever behavior they show."" I wish more directors believed that; wed get better more responsible movies. In a recent interview Spielberg told me that Truffaut who acted in Spielbergs ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" had told him the very same thing and that that challenge was very much on his mind during production. Maybe thats why Spielberg took most of the color out of his photography giving the film a gray-to-silver wartime snapshot look. When someone is shot we focus more on the horror of the death than on any blood.Spielberg also tells his heroic story in a different way through adult dialogue. The films title very loosely based on a true story has a squad of arriving American troops under the command of a captain (Tom Hanks) being asked to find and protect a certain private who parachuted behind enemy lines. It seems his three brothers recently have been killed in action and Army policy is to try to save families from complete devastation. The casting of Hanks is a master stroke. He has such a sweet persona that to place him in combat is heart-breaking. And Hanks character and other troops regularly challenge in dialogue the wisdom of the mission as any reasonable person might.In a summer of films with lot of explosions and firepower ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the only one with ideas. Rated R. (star) (star) (star) (star)- MAFIA A completely lame play on ""The Godfather"" and ""Casino"" that ends up being an unintentional tribute to the many indelible scenes in those films. This picture from one of the creators of ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" comedies is more likely to make you want to rent the originals than laugh at them. PG-13.

It cements Steven Spielbergs reputation as one of the seminal filmmakers of the era. It tells a gallant story of honor and duty and courage under fire. It shows you things about war that have never been seen on a motion picture screen. It makes you proud to be an American without a lot of phony sentimental patriotic flag-waving. And it revives my faith in the potential greatness of movies. And now having said enough to raise eyebrows let the controversy begin. Some people will not want to see this powerful and electrifying film because of the violence. (These are the same people who liked Pulp Fiction .) Well I cannot lie. Saving Private Ryan is violent. War is violent. But one of the many strengths of this phenomenal film that separates it from the usual ""Bang bang youre dead"" stuff is the way it not only examines the nature of violence but redefines the whole concept. You watch the most inhuman aggressions and understand why they were necessary for self-defense. Mr. Spielberg goes beyond the war movie genre; he brings you the war itself. Saving Private Ryan wastes no time on exposition. It drops you into one of the most violent clashes in world history from the very start. It is June 6 1944 the day known in infamy as D-Day when the Allies landed on the beach at Normandy to face the German tanks that threatened the future of the civilized world. More than 4000 Americans died in the battle that followed and Mr. Spielberg captures the noise and confusion the tears and terror of the boys who died like heroes before their time in one of the most harrowing combat sequences ever filmed. You are plunged head-first into the eye of slaughter where survival was a miracle. You are the Germans and you are the wounded and vomiting G.I.s too as the beaches fill with bodies and blood and the injured are blown right out of the arms of the Red Cross medics before they can be dragged to safety. This devastating sequence lasts 30 minutes and its the most overwhelming and agonizing half-hour I have ever spent in a theater. Theres no attempt to alter the sound in order to make individual lines of dialogue easier to hear. To a man the actors are hoarse from the cacophony that engulfs them and the viewer feels as trapped and disoriented as the soldiers. The Normandy invasion was well documented in the epic The Longest Day  but Mr. Spielbergs canvas is on an even more massive scale with a virtuoso explosion of annihilating horror that hurls the audience into the center of the action with a centripetal force that is indescribable. The story that follows is about eight brave but battered soldiers led by Tom Hanks who are ordered to rescue a private (Matt Damon) missing in action behind enemy lines. Nobody wants the assignment but the chain of command descends all the way down from Gen. George Marshall who is willing to risk the lives of eight men to save one boy in order to ease the suffering of a bereaved family in Iowa after their other three sons have died in action. In a galvanizing performance Mr. Hanks must justify the risk to his men keep them from deserting and find decency and responsibility in the hell of war. In the brilliant screenplay by Robert Rodat you get to know every man like a member of your own family and in the course of almost three hours Mr. Spielberg proves that nothing in war is black and white. Americans are good and bad cowardly and noble. Some are capable of committing the same atrocities against surrendered Germans theyre fighting to prevent. Above all they are human. The acting ensemble is first-rate. Tom Sizemore is especially fine as the tough veteran sergeant who plays by the rule book and Edward Burns as the tough rebel from Brooklyn who has no mercy for the enemy breaks out of his usual dull monotone to etch a portrait of cynicism and rage under stress that is surprisingly visceral. Loyalties and values change when youre emotionally distraught and the cast does a convincing job of showing inner conflict. In the final analysis the values Mr. Spielberg explores in these men are the ethics of mankind. You go away from some movies saying ""I know how they did that."" In Saving Private Ryan  the battle scenes are so graphic you cant believe what youre seeing. You are never aware of the cameras presence. Nothing looks rehearsed or staged. You are simply knocked out of your seat. Far from a conventional gung-ho war movie full of macho heroics it still makes you feel the tiny moments of valor that came unexpectedly to the men who fought in World War II without losing track of its human narrative. Some people will object to the scratch patrol of eight guys who sometimes seem to wipe out half the German Army with an endless supply of artillery but the film is so beautifully paced by Mr. Spielberg and frenetically edited (by Michael Kahn) that you never have time to fret about the occasional plot contrivance. For pure brute force it outranks Battleground  Battle of the Bulge  Bataan and even The Longest Day as great war movies go. For younger audiences whove never heard of Omaha Beach or Bastogne or even Adolf Hitler this movie is a valuable history lesson. For more mature audiences its a renewal of understanding for the last war that was really worth fighting. I said it before and Ill say it again. Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. And why not? Mr. Spielberg has made one of the greatest childrens movies of all time. He made one of the greatest horror movies of all time. He made the greatest Holocaust movie of all time. After E.T.  Jaws and Schindlers List  its only logical that he should now make one of the greatest war movies of all time. And thats exactly what he did. Sedgwick Arrives. Wheres Shakespeare? Despite the smell of incense and the sitar music Nicholas Hytners attempt to move Shakespeares Twelfth Night to the Orient in the controversial summer production at Lincoln Center often seems more like Jacques Offenbach than Ravi Shankar. Its a lavish spectacle for the eye if not always for the ear. Designer Bob Crowleys Illyria is built on canals that look more like Venice than Kashmir. Persian carpets with peacocks are separated by boardwalks of Indian mosaics and into the sapphire-blue swimming pool buffed and burnished actors from the Reebok Gym thrash around wearing as little as the law allows. When Paul Rudds Orsino says the famous line ""If music be the food of love play on"" hes smoking an opium pipe in a horizontal stupor. When Helen Hunts Viola enters she emerges from a shipwreck wading through pools of gossamer mist. Yes theres razzle all over the place new ideas in motion and plenty of dazzle to divert the attention but where is William Shakespeare? I welcome any revisionist version of Twelfth Night  including Your Own Thing  the rock musical that even included a scene between Humphrey Bogart Queen Elizabeth Michelangelos God from the Sistine Chapel and John Wayne. But setting this most romantic of comedies in a disco would somehow seem less bizarre than some of the antics in this odd production. The tangled loves of Viola and her twin brother Sebastian Count Orsino Olivia and the assorted servants and court jesters who confuse them further are still a dizzy delight ripe for a romp be the setting Marrakech or Maine. But its a strange assortment of miscast bedfellows who do the romping here. The major surprise is Kyra Sedgwick a movie star with the beauty timing and body language to make Olivia the giddy goddess dreams are made of. Helen Hunt with her boyish ponytail and no-nonsense delivery is a fetching gender-bender who often reduces the archaic meter to contemporary readings that will please people who hate Shakespeare but she doesnt have the vocal shadings or the stage training to make Viola memorable. With earrings dangling and long curls cascading down his back like a horses mane Paul Rudd looks like a rock guitarist on bad drugs. Light-years removed from the charming gay schoolteacher he played in Mr. Hytners endearing film The Object of My Affection  he still lacks the manly stature to make Orsino the center of attention. Brian Murray and Max Wright play the fools as a drunken Laurel and Hardy eating Chinese takeout with chopsticks while their cohort in lowbrow comedy Skipp Sudduth in knickers and beanie is dressed like Warren Beatty in Bulworth . Always a marvel Philip Bosco is a riotous Malvolio making the transition from stern financial wizard to witless moron with a shriveled attitude and wrinkled brow that reminded me of the Smirnoff vodka man with constipation. Some members of the huge cast are still searching for the sub-layers of their roles and others like Rick Stearn as the handsome Sebastian are scarcely on speaking terms with the Bard at all. In the impressive sumptuousness of the production design there is much to admire but when you spend more time counting and recounting the number of candles raised and lowered from the ceiling on a starry Twelfth Night (I counted 60) there is something wrong with the night itself.

Saving Private Ryan begins with a 24-minute opening sequence depicting in horrifically intimate shorthand the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6 1944. For all that it turned the tide of the war against the Germans the D-Day operation was so bungled by Allied strategists that it transformed Omaha Beach into an abattoir strewn with men burning drowning or bleeding to death from the onslaught of fire by dug-in German troops. Spielberg shoots the battle which was saved by the courage of the soldiers who survived with the savage candor of a field photographer. A hand-held camera spattered with blood swings wildly like some half-drunk participant in the carnage the muted greens and grays of uniforms soaked by a driving rain. One soldier staggers to shore cradling his severed arm as if it were a cherished newborn. Another lies prone amid scores of dead fish feebly trying to prevent his innards from spilling out of him. Blood washes the waves as wounded men sink gracefully underwater. Gradually the camera picks out the scruffy unit with whom we will spend the rest of the movie. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) one of the few to escape injury gazes about him shrouded in the muffled silence of a man deafened by shock and the roar of artillery. Dragging a soldier to safety he turns to discover that he is pulling half a man. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Pious - and doubtless jealous - Hollywood voices have cried overkill about the savagery of Saving Private Ryans battle scenes especially in light of the movies relatively wimpy R rating. The hypocrisy is grimly amusing for no one raised a peep about Jurassic Park which was viciously exploitive of its mostly young audience. Although Spielberg has racked up his share of pointless fright nights in Saving Private Ryan he uses screen brutality just the way it should be used - to deglamorize the undiscriminating overkill of modern combat in which survival is governed far more by dumb luck than by derring-do and heroism is beside the point.Not that Spielberg can ever fully sate his bottomless hunger for heroes though in his maturity they grow ever less mythic ever more vulnerable and shaded. Schindlers List which tethered the directors abiding obsession with World War II to his own voyage of Jewish self-discovery drew its inspiration from the ambiguous bravery of a man who does the right thing for the murkiest of reasons. In Saving Private Ryan Spielberg re-creates all the father-heroes he ever wanted - and resented - in the aloof high-minded Captain Miller played by Hanks in a canny inversion of his wide-open turn as the ingenu Forrest Gump. Yet Miller too is an innocent a man of principle in a war that mows heedlessly over his scruples. Through him Spielberg asks what it means to speak of a ""good war"" that killed millions and maimed their families and what possible form of nobility could flourish under such conditions.These are mighty questions and for as long as Spielberg explores them through the wordless scenes of fighting Saving Private Ryan remains awesome in its power to move the heart and mind in sync. The trouble starts when the soldiers open their mouths. One has to wonder how much the flat expository screenplay credited to Robert Rodat who also wrote the lovely goose movie Fly Away Home has been fiddled with by a director whose ear for dialogue is as tinny as his eye is sound. Rarely in Saving Private Ryan as the soldiers move from one real or symbolic minefield to the next swapping stories of mothers and brothers and sweethearts left behind do they talk in anything resembling ordinary speech. ""This time the mission is the man"" Miller declaims as he rallies his men to go behind enemy lines and retrieve a soldier whose three brothers have perished within days of each other. Its a premise no one could fail to warm to and that precisely is its tyranny. Who would harden their hearts to the attempt to restore a sole surviving son to a mother of four especially an ample heartland mother with goodness written all over her careworn features? Yet its precisely here that the film starts to sag under the sentimentality thats second nature to Spielberg and decay into a stage play about decency that makes for some pretty speeches which drain the movie of its angry ambivalent vitality.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Once the fighting stops Saving Private Ryan scales down into a regular old combat movie of the kind made popular during World War II. Thats no insult The resilience of the genre lies in the deep emotional satisfaction it offers stripping away the emotional and material clutter of everyday life in peacetime simplifying and clarifying the morality of working together for a higher cause. Spielberg keeps faith with the prototype the tight little unit whose members represent American diversity glued together by a laconic leader who knows instinctively when to unbend just enough to raise depleted morale and how to contain the one feckless soldier who challenges the purpose of the mission. Theres honor in that and good acting in particular by Tom Sizemore as Millers sergeant and protector Barry Pepper as a prayerful crack sniper and Jeremy Davies as a nerdy outsider whos brought along for his language skills and serves as our witness to the fate of the unit. When Edward Burns rather good as the detached self-serving Private Reiben asks why the lives of eight men should be risked to save just one its a legitimate question that falls away as the movie sinks knee-deep into the heroic individualism which defines American romantic aspiration.""Every man I kill the further I feel away from home"" says Miller when his men champ at the bit to execute a German soldier who has killed one of them. To Spielbergs credit he acknowledges that Millers scruples are as garbled as his grammar for they return later on to haunt him in ways that underscore the anachronistic fragility of his honor code. When Spielberg returns to what he does best - showing not telling - we see the unit digging in for its last stand along with Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who has refused to leave his own detail until it completes its mission to defend a bridge. In the final battle a wounded Miller sits weakly emptying his handgun at an approaching tank. One thinks of William Holden in The Bridge on the River Kwai aghast at Alec Guinness mad interpretation of honor observing that the point is not to die like a gentleman but to live like a human being. Such is Spielbergs skill that Millers scene at once telling and moving needs no elaboration. Except that as always Spielberg cant resist completing the thought on our behalf. Like Schindlers List Saving Private Ryan ends in a burst of schmaltzy ritual. One of the survivors now an old man falls to his knees in a cemetery filled with white crosses then begs his wife to tell him that hes a good man. With this hopelessly cloying coda Spielberg having won his battles loses sight of the war. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Ella Taylor Follow L.A.

Part of its increasing popularity is that standing upright allows surfers to spot waves more easily and thus catch more of them multiplying the fun factor. Paddling back to the wave becomes less of a strain as well. The ability to cruise along on flat inland water surveying the sights is another advantage. Finally its a good core workout.

Written by Robert Rodat. Starring Tom Hanks Ed Burns Giovanni Ribisi Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon. Opens Friday July 24 at area theaters. The first shot in Steven Spielbergs remarkable World War II epic Saving Private Ryan is an American flag with the sun behind it. Its an exquisite almost diaphanous image -- the fabric has the transparent delicacy of a chrysalis. This is the perfect introduction to a movie about the fragility -- and fortitude -- of compassion in wartime. Spielberg puts us through the hair-trigger terrors of combat in a way no other filmmaker has ever dared and yet theres a gentleness to his enterprise. Hes interested in the humaneness that comes through the horror. His film is a paean to the good that survives. The flag that we see in the beginning flies above the vast cemetery in Normandy honoring the fallen Allies. After a brief prologue we flash back to the June 6 1944 D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach where many of the soldiers off the boats are instantly agonizingly slaughtered. We can make out a few recurring figures in the ensuing inferno -- such as Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) who is first revealed in close-up as a pair of trembling hands before the camera moves up to his ardent tragic face. With waves of men falling around them Millers platoon of seven soldiers finally storms the beach to gain the high ground against the Germans. We feel every atrocious inch of their odyssey. This opening sequence in which thousands of men are splayed and pulverized is perhaps the most wrenching battle scene ever filmed. It goes way beyond what were used to in war movies. Even the greatest battles staged in film until now -- in the work of such directors as Griffith Kurosawa Eisenstein Ford Welles and Peckinpah -- had an overarching artfulness. The violence and terror had an aesthetic dimension -- a horrid beauty and sometimes a nobility -- that kept us from being entirely aghast at the awfulness of what we were watching. Spielberg is attempting something much more punishingly immediate. For almost half an hour he puts us on Omaha Beach and refuses us any respite. We dont get any wisecracking Hollywoodisms to reassure us we are only watching a movie. Spielberg doesnt frame the soldiers as martyrs or heroes (though many are). We arent made to feel that we are inside an artists vision (though we are). Instead we seem to be looking at the collective nightmare of an entire generation of combatants -- a horror show that has once again come startlingly to life. If you go to the movies at all these days you realize that filmmakers have become so giddy about the new visual and aural technologies -- with their capacity for sensory onslaughts -- that theyve lost sight of what can really be achieved in bringing us shudderingly close to experience. When you watch Saving Private Ryan especially in this opening Normandy sequence you suddenly realize the sheer power of all that advanced sound-and-picture movie engineering. One reason there has never been another battle sequence like this one is that no filmmaker of Spielbergs gifts has ever had at his disposal such an arsenal of effects. But theres another reason to be startled Spielberg is the first director to connect up the Vietnam experience -- as an experience of combat -- with WWII. This is a radical move. We accept the gruesomeness of Vietnam movies because the nature of that war and the ways in which it was brought into our homes on television demands such treatment. To be ""tasteful"" or sentimental would be an affront. (The rage in those movies is a rage of national self-immolation.) But WWII movies have almost always lacked the explicit horror of Vietnam films because WWII is billed as the Last Good War. Its presentation was and to a large extent still continues to be sanitized for mass consumption by Washington and Hollywood. In Saving Private Ryan the panorama is as excruciating as any Vietnam footage. The soldiers are splattered by bullets; their heads are blown from their shoulders in ripe red bursts. A man picks up his just-severed arm while another mans guts pour into the sand. The obscene squeal and thump of mortar is everywhere in the air. For perhaps a minute in the middle of this sequence Spielberg suddenly shuts down the din on the soundtrack as we watch Capt. Miller numbly surveying the scene. The silence is even more sickening than the sounds of carnage. With his crack sniper Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) who recites Scripture to himself before each kill Miller finally knocks out a German machine gun nest. He looks back at the beach in the momentary calm. His sergeant (Tom Sizemore) says to him ""Quite a view"" and thats when we see for the first time the corpse-strewn expanse of Omaha Beach. Its the deathly reposeful image this relentless sequence has been building to all along and it holds you Hieronymus Bosch meets G.I. Joe. A large number of films about WWII are in production or about to come out including an adaptation of James Jones The Thin Red Line that marks the return of Terrence Malick to directing. Some have tried to explain this phenomenon by presuming that audiences are hankering for comprehensible war-movie conflicts with clearly marked heroes and villains. For such a conflict the Vietnam War obviously wont do. Neither will the intergalactic variety -- you can only take so many hyperspace shootouts. But Saving Private Ryan isnt a reassuring alternative; it doesnt offer up the homilies that have drenched the morale-boosting WWII movies. By throwing off the impediments of a strictly patriotic agenda Spielberg is free to function as an artist. By going back to a Good War and focusing so clearly on its carnage hes putting forth the most obvious of positions War is about killing people. And yet Capt. Millers platoon is sent on a mission after Omaha Beach that connects up to a deeper truth War is about saving people. Miller is ordered by U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) to take his company behind German lines and somehow locate and bring to safety a Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon) who was part of a misguided 101st Airborne drop and whose three brothers have all been killed in different battle zones within days of each other. Miller risks his mens lives and his own to rescue and send home a single soldier -- so that Ryans mother in Iowa will still have a son. Miller has already lost 94 men in his command; he rationalizes their deaths by imagining the lives he will save in the long run. But the rescue of Pvt. Ryan is a mission that bears no such scrutiny; no one in Millers company can rationalize it and few can abide it. The platoon bears a superficial resemblance to the mixed-nuts brigades familiar from WWII movies. Besides the sergeant and Pvt. Jackson theres Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg) the Jewish guy; Pvt. Reiben (Ed Burns) the Brooklyn guy; Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) the medic guy; Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel) the tough guy who tries to rescue little French children; and Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) the bookish guy who has never fired at anybody before. (Hes our stand-in like the youth in The Red Badge of Courage.) Even Pvt. Ryan when hes finally located has the cornfed all-American look weve seen in dozens of flag-waver flicks. But Spielberg and his screenwriter Robert Rodat dont go in for overtly sentimental displays. On the surface these men may seem like stereotypes but the actors give their roles a hard-edged authenticity. (As performers they are on their own kind of mission.) We can see these soldiers are learning on the job how to make war. The youth and innocence they brought with them into combat has already slipped from their faces. They look prematurely old. Tom Hanks has perhaps the most difficult role and he brings it off with the best performance of his career. For most of the movie Capt. Miller is a cipher to his soldiers but his unreachableness isnt a power play -- its just his way of not feeling too close to the men who may soon drop one by one before his eyes. And yet we can see in him what his platoon cant or can only intuit. War hasnt coarsened him; its opened him to a deeper level of anguish. Away from his men he breaks down sobbing. At one point he says ""Every man I kill the farther away from home I feel."" And yet we realize the irony in what he is saying Killing is what will bring him home. Saving Private Ryan doesnt pretend as do so many war movies that soldiers in the frenzy of battle are fighting for the noblest of motives or that only the virtuous survive. WWII may have been fought by the Allies for impeccable reasons but Miller and his soldiers on their mission of mercy are thinking overwhelmingly about personal survival. Theres something cauterizing -- and yet liberating -- about this view. For the Hollywood war movie it represents a new and more transcendently honest approach to human experience. And yet Spielberg disdaining the easy cliches of war movies understands the impulse to want to make sense of the senseless. He wants to memorialize these men but in a way that doesnt turn them into plaster saints. He wants to make them powerfully confusedly human. The soldiers who grouse and die to save Pvt. Ryan come to realize his rescue ""is the only good thing we can take out of this shitty mess."" Its a hard-won revelation designed to give meaning to a chaos they can no longer comprehend. Ryans survival is the measure of their sacrifice and he must spend the rest of his life living up to what they have done. For Spielberg the great romantic gesture in war is also the most necessary -- it is the gesture toward decency. He commemorates the soldiers in that vast Normandy cemetery in the most absolute and honorable way possible.

Spielberg has clearly stated in recent interviews that he made the film as a monument to the brave men who fought and died in that terrible war (and on D-Day in particular) but hes also done something morally heroic in the process. ""Private Ryan"" clearly illustrates once and for all that war -- the real appalling thing not the flag-waving glorification that you usually see at the movies -- is hell on earth. Spielberg accomplishes these goals with a technical virtuosity that no other director arguably in the history of the cinema can even approach. Though he too often jumps into films that are way beneath him (""Always"" ""Hook"" and ""The Lost World"" among others) or gets too poundingly sincere for the kind of choreographed glossiness that often informs his style (""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"") Spielberg is the real McCoy. Hes a director whose work has grown right before our eyes from that of a precocious whiz-kid to the complex humanistic statements of a true artist. Whether or not you always appreciate how he utilizes his skills the man is an undeniable genius. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is not a flawless movie. Robert Rodats screenplay falters a little too often for complete comfort. War movie cliches that get dismantled in the latter part of the film still stand as nothing but cliches as you watch them in the early going. This is a forgivable sin though because Spielbergs camera (and a group of great performances especially another iconic one from Tom Hanks) pulls us deep into the action and never lets go. I found tears streaming down my face several times during the film not only out of sadness for the characters I was watching but also for the men who actually got torn to bits out on those beaches. That doddering old man who annoyed you yesterday by taking too much time in the checkout line at the grocery store very possibly served this country and experienced the unspeakable horrors of war firsthand. ""Saving Private Ryan"" drives that point home unflinchingly and its about time. Brutally like the real thing View the theatrical trailer to ""Saving Private Ryan"" Video 3.3Mb QuickTime File format infoPlease enable JavaScript My father who died this past May was a Korean War combat veteran. This movie gave me a greater understanding of what he must have gone through during his war while enlightening me as to why he could seldom bring himself to talk about his experiences. If your father also served seeing this film with him could bridge a gap between the two of you that you dont even know exists. The defiantly brutal battle sequences that frame the story are almost too visceral to bear but you owe it to the people who were actually there to watch as they unfold. As the film opens Hanks (as Capt. Miller) is approaching Omaha Beach in a landing craft full of soldiers who are literally vomiting with fear and seasickness. The film doesnt make it very clear if you dont know anything about the events of June 6 1944 but Allied bombers were supposed to have destroyed massive German fortifications that lined the cliffs above the beaches the night before the landing. Dense cloud coverage caused the planes to miss almost all of their designated targets so the next morning thousands of soldiers were hitting the shores of France and running face-first into what amounted to an open-air slaughterhouse. In the movie as in the invasion machine gun and mortar fire is so intense chunks of human flesh and blood go flying when the landing crafts doors open. Spielberg studied legendary director John Fords documentary account of the actual event and he brilliantly duplicates that footages hand-held washed-out look. You feel as if youre watching the real thing even when Spielberg reverts to Hanks characters point of view. The sound mix (which is spectacular throughout the film) slows down to a dull roar as Hanks and several of his comrades climb over the sides of the craft and sink into the ocean. You can see bullets whizzing past the panicked soldiers as they struggle underwater to remove the binding equipment thats pulling them down. Some of the shots hit their marks and clouds of red mist float up from the now-lifeless bodies. Obscene carnage This opening sequence which lasts 25 minutes is one of the most devastating things ever committed to film. The carnage is so obscene it almost becomes hallucinatory. A stunned soldier calmly reaches down and picks up his severed arm then wanders along the beach in shock. At one point (though its hardly the focus of the shot) Hanks is pulling a wounded man towards what little cover there is when he suddenly realizes that hes dragging only half a body. Another soldier screams in pain as he lies on the sand calling for his mother while literally grasping his intestines in his own hands. Yes its hellish and yes its supremely disturbing. It also really happened to real people not illusory figures like John Wayne or Errol Flynn. After making it across the beach (and after we watch a surprisingly heavy-handed scene concerning General George Marshall back in the States) Hanks is given a unique mission. Three Iowa brothers have been killed in combat - we see one of them lying in the bloody surf at Omaha - and now Hanks must take a group of men into the French countryside to try to retrieve the familys last remaining son Private James Ryan (Matt Damon.) The moral dilemma of the movie outside of the numbing brutality of war itself is the skewed reasoning behind sending eight men through highly dangerous territory in order to rescue a single soldier. The covering-all-the-bases content of the squad that Hanks assembles is where a lot of the weaker elements in the film can be found. We get a Brooklyn loud-mouth (Edward Burns) a sensitive medic (Giovanni Ribisi) a timid language specialist (Jeremy Davies) a sarcastic complainer (Adam Goldberg) the tough Sarge (Tom Sizemore) a southern-fried sharpshooter (Barry Pepper) and an Italian-American goon (Vin Diesel.) All of the actors do admirable work (especially Ribisi whos the key element of a gruesome truly heartbreaking scene) but this grab-bag sampling of The Great Melting Pot is a staple of the kind of war movie that Spielberg is supposed to be deconstructing. Im absolutely certain that the directors aware of this; I just think it takes too long before those stereotypes start getting shattered. When that moment comes during another lengthy (and just as harrowing) battle scene at the end of the film its fairly astonishing stuff. I think the movie would have been better served though if the characters had been a little less on-the-nose in the early going. Seminal performance from Hanks And then theres Tom Hanks. Its become rather old-hat by now to say that Hanks is this generations Jimmy Stewart but Spielberg understands the guy-next-door persona thats central to Hanks popularity and twists it inside-out several times during the film. You can feel Capt. Miller fighting to maintain his humanity while often giving in to his blinding fear and anger. Sometimes he makes the wrong decision but then you have to deal with the question of exactly what the ""right"" decision is when youre in the middle of a situation in which concepts like right and wrong dont apply. Hanks is constantly described by critics as being an ""everyman"" performer. In this film hes truly standing in for every man exploring the often dark heart that beats in all of us. This performance proves yet again that hes one hell of an actor the kind we should cherish. Spielberg himself has said that ""Saving Private Ryan"" shouldnt be viewed by children under the age of 14. I would say though that older teen-agers should absolutely be taken to see it. In this purposefully shallow MTV-driven society that weve created Memorial Day speeches just dont cut it anymore. If people have to see to understand then let them see it. It would be infinitely better for their souls than the almost jubilant violence in something like ""Lethal Weapon 4."" Rated R. 165 minutes.

Now ask yourself this questionAm I tough enough for an action film that is more intense than all of them put together?The movie that raises this question is Saving Private Ryan the new World War II adventure starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg. In particular Im talking about an approximately 30-minute sequence near the start of the nearly three-hour movie that shows Hanks character Capt. John Miller and a wave of Allied soldiers storming Omaha Beach on D-Day.This tour de force sequence is brutal rapid brilliantly chaotic. Seen from a grunts eye view the random violence of warfare isnt just disturbing or scary its utterly overwhelming.In punishing detail this film shows how lives are ripped apart by the enemys destructive power.Blood and guts spill out of wounded bodies. A man who has lost a limb picks it up and stumbles off. To what?All the way back in Jaws (1975) - Spielbergs first megahit and in a way the template for Godzilla and all other summer thrill rides - his mastery of the camera was so great that you never knew when or from what angle the killer shark would strike.Now 23 years later the filmmakers technique is if anything even more potent. But this time Spielberg isnt on any thrill ride.This time hes looking straight into the jaws of war.After the D-Day sequence things settle down enough for a story to develop. It focuses on the titles Pvt. James Ryan (Good Will Huntings Matt Damon in a smallish role) a soldier whose three brothers were all killed on D-Day.The top brass have decided to find Pvt. Ryan and send him home to his grieving mother. So it falls to Capt. Miller and a small squad to locate him.Its like looking for ``a needle in a stack of needles complains the captain who also finds it hard to accept the idea of risking the lives of an entire squad for the sake of a single man.As the movie regains its momentum it moves toward a climax in which Miller his men and a few others attempt to defend a strategically important bridge against a German invasion. This sequence is more classically structured than the earlier oneYou watch as Miller works out a battle plan and positions his limited forces against the onslaught. And as the Germans advance youre braced for what happens.Or anyway you think you are.Both this sequence and the earlier one evoke a mixture of amazement and repulsion Spielbergs technique is as abstractly compelling as the human waste of this war is disgusting.Superb as it often is Saving Private Ryan is no tidy ``perfect film.Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat (Fly Away Home) touch on a lot of war-related issues without fully exploring their emotional dimensions. The least effective gambit is a modern-day prologue-and-epilogue frame set in a cemetery that too closely echoes a similar device in the directors great Holocaust epic Schindlers List (1993).Saving Private Ryan works best in its action scenes and at other times when it stands the cliches of the war-movie form on their heads.Capt. Millers squad is pretty much the usual ethnically geographically and temperamentally diverse band of WWII warriors that youll find in other films Theres the Southern sharpshooter (Barry Pepper) who quotes scripture as he pulls the trigger the soldier (Adam Goldberg) who takes pleasure in announcing his Jewishness to captured Germans the hothead (Edward Burns of The Brothers McMullen) the loyal sarge (Tom Sizemore) and so on.But the relationships among these men dont work out the way you would expect them to.Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies of Spanking the Monkey) the newest member of the group and the least experienced is the squads ``Shakespeare - that is the one who aspires to be a writer. You expect the crucible of war to be a growth experience for the young soldier.But is it?The cast functions as an effective and believable unit. And Hanks gives a strong increasingly solemn performance as its mysterious leader.With Hanks in the lead you feel that Capt. Miller must be an unpretentious decent man. So the horrors of war feel especially horrible when their effects start to tell on him.In much the same way the bold red blood of battle is just that much more shocking when it is seen against the quiet palette of pale greens and grays that Spielberg has selected for his fine singularly disturbing war movie.Does it sound a bit cold to discuss a fierce wrenching movie like Saving Private Ryan in terms of its visual design?Maybe so. And yet the new film is one of the most compelling visual depictions of war ever created. And its D-Day section may be the greatest battlefield sequence in any movie about any war ever.I will admit however that its probably superfluous - and definitely trivializing - to add that Saving Private Ryan is easily the best action flick of the summer.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet You can forget both the creepy ""The Last Great Invasion Of The Last Great War"" tagline and the slow-motion feel-good trailers created for Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan. Theyre advertising a different movie. Saving Private Ryan is a brutal film free of the gooey-eyed romanticism suggested by its promotional campaign. In fact large portions of Saving Private Ryan are given to calling into question the attitudes played upon by its ads. Tom Hanks plays an American army captain who after taking part in the invasion of Normandy--portrayed here in what are likely some of the most viscerally affecting scenes ever put to film--is ordered to find the titular Private Ryan (Matt Damon) a paratrooper whose whereabouts are unknown and whose three brothers have died in the war. As they travel deeper into the war zone the soldiers Hanks leads on the mission (Edward Burns Tom Sizemore Adam Goldberg Jeremy Davies and others) question their public-relations-oriented task. Packed with about as many moral ambiguities as a Spielberg movie can handle Saving Private Ryan provides a startling grunts-eye view of war refusing to subscribe to simplistic blindly patriotic notions of honor and duty while working toward an understanding of what those words really mean. Of the many fine supporting performances Davies (Spanking The Monkey Going All The Way) is particularly notable as a dangerously innocent translator. By the time Saving Private Ryan wins the Best Picture Oscar next year it will probably be smothered in the sort of overstated reverent praise that can obscure any movie no matter how good. Calling it the greatest war movie ever made does a disservice to other equally worthwhile lower-profile films (Sam Fullers The Big Red One for instance). But its still an excellent movie as effective in battle scenes as it is in that of soldiers ruminating on an Edith Piaf song. It should be seen for what it is while it still can be.

The blood of the dead and the screaming wounded laps against Omaha Beach. A Sam Higgins boat pushes through the smoke and deafening machine-gun fire.As the squad of Rangers makes its way ashore and into chaos and carnage that is rendered without compromise it seems almost redundant to say that Steven Spielberg has placed the filming of war on a plateau that other directors will find very hard to scale. He has also challenged himself. How can any filmmaker who opens his movie with such a prodigious and unbearably intense virtuoso set piece possibly hope to sustain the level for the rest of the movie?Saving Private Ryan begins to answer that question by posing another that is eternal and unanswerable. How is one mans life more valuable than anothers and what meaning can that life have in a maelstrom of death where survival is a matter of fate and luck?It is a question that Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the men of his company who have survived the D-Day landing will address in especially wrenching circumstances. Behind them lie the mutilated corpses of their buddies men who have died clutching their own entrails or been incinerated by the flamethrowers they were carrying. Ahead lies a highly dubious mission.Pvt. James Ryan a paratrooper stranded somewhere in the confusion of the invasion has lost his three older brothers in recent action in other war theaters. The Army brass as a mercy to his devastated mother back in Iowa and a public relations move wants him pulled from the front line forthwith. Miller and his squad draw the short straw and set off to find him across the treacherous landscape of Normandy where every hedgerow and window seems to hide sudden death.The pivot of Saving Private Ryan is thus not a military objective - a hill to be taken or machine-gun nest to be stormed. In war movies from Pork Chop Hill to Hamburger Hill the grunts could growl about the stupidity of command decisions but they went anyway. Miller played as a decent Everyman by Hanks in a performance of unassuming authority that anchors the picture has his doubts but perseveres.As they begin to take casualties and the price of Pvt. Ryans life keeps escalating the men begin to balk. Robert Rodats fine screenplay defers to the tradition of the war movie by making Millers squad the usual disparate mix forced to work together. But he doesnt stray into the usual banalities. There is no one here who will one day become a famous writer and pen the definitive war novel.With the exception of Tom Sizemore as the stalwart sergeant Spielberg shrewdly casts actors who have done most of their work in independent movies. The caliber of their work - especially Edward Burns as Pvt. Reiben the most vocal of the gripers; Jeremy Davies as a terrified interpreter dragged into the action; and Barry Pepper as the nerveless sharpshooter - ought to make several mainstream careers.The long segment of the film devoted to the search has its lapses. Spielberg sometimes italicizes the central debate by having the men air it as they camp for the night in a church. But what they are arguing is a question that transcends war just as Saving Private Ryan transcends the traditional war film.When they find the precious private effectively done by Matt Damon there is a galling problem. Pvt. Ryan and his company are holding a vital bridge. He vows to stay with his comrades.In effect the search and its questions have played as a long and provocative prelude to another question that is posed to Miller and the squad. When is something worth the ultimate sacrifice? Spielberg takes the last full measure of their dilemma in Saving Private Ryan with the climactic battle for possession of the bridge.Hanks gives a performance of gathering strength and bedrock decency that can stand comparison with anything Henry Fonda did in simliar roles. His Capt. Miller keeps his distance from the audience and his men gradually losing his mystery and remoteness as the trek across the fields of France progresses.The technical support that Hanks and the cast receive goes beyond Spielberg. The drained color of the cinematography by the great Janusz Kaminski (who also shot Spielbergs other World War II masterpiece Schindlers List) perfectly matches the exhaustion and terror of the soldiers. The editing is stunning and the sound that envelops the viewer in the whistling bullets and the din of war is sometimes overwhelming.Stephen Ambrose the World War II historian who was a consultant on Saving Private Ryan has remarked that 100 years from now it will be the picture people watch when they wish to understand what World War II was about. Anyone who would like to know what superb filmmaking is all about need look no further than this overpowering movie.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN    Produced by Steven Spielberg Ian Bryce and Mark Gordon directed by Steven Spielberg written by Robert Rodat photography by Janusz Kaminski music by John Williams distributed by Dreamworks Pictures.Running time 249Capt.

"Apocalypse Then Slate Sign In Sign Up Apocalypse Then Apocalypse Then Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 24 1998 330 AM Apocalypse Then The viscera of war. By David Edelstein Saving Private Ryan Directed by Steven Spielberg DreamWorks SKG How do you portray violence in movies nowadays so that it isnt a turn-on? Nearly 30 years ago Sam Peckinpah devised a massacre at the climax of The Wild Bunch that he thought would take the casualness out of killing. He lingered on it slowed it down fastened on blood-spurting bodies as they hurtled through the air--and ended up making it lyrical aestheticizing it distancing it. Less well-intentioned filmmakers followed in the wake of ""Bloody Sam"" turning carnage into spectacle even into rock n roll. What Steven Spielberg has accomplished in Saving Private Ryan is to make violence terrible again. Nothing in the movies melodramatic narrative can diminish the shocking immediacy of its combat scenes. Advertisement The opening battle might be the most visceral ever put on film. After a solemn but predictable modern-day prologue--an old man and his extended family trudge out to a cemetery to view row upon row of white crosses--theres a shock cut to the boats of Allied soldiers surging toward Omaha Beach in Normandy France. Its D-Day 1944. Trembling hands open a canteen. They belong to a familiar star--Tom Hanks--but everything that follows is alien. The camera is down in the surf pitching as young men pray and vomit. Theyve barely beached before the first bullets come--before these smooth-faced overgrown kids begin to get blown through. We dont see the enemy machine guns or rifles but we hear the pops and the ceaseless whine of bullets and we watch the men as their chests and heads explode. Some drop underwater but still the bullets come in near silence producing squalls of blood; above the water the din resumes with a vengeance. The images are supersharp as if viewed through too-strong glasses yet they streak and pixilate--break into shards--as the camera jerks wildly left then right. Color has been drained from the frame The greens of uniforms and browns of earth are muted the sky rendered a neutral gray. Against this monochromatic palette the brackish blood leaps out of the screen. That blood is everywhere. A helmet full of seawater turns out to be full of sloshing gore; a soldier with a gushing arm socket picks up his severed limb and staggers aimlessly; a man with his intestines on the outside wails through a last protracted hemorrhage. A soldiers helmet stops a bullet with a clank; he removes it in wonder; his brains are then blown out. For nearly half an hour the horrors come one upon another unaccompanied by music and unrelieved by any point of view except that of the soldiers in the middle of the slaughter. There are no objective ""establishing"" shots and no possibility for emotional distance. Nauseated I fixed on Hanks because I knew the star would survive until at least the last reel. But even that reassurance seemed precarious. In Saving Private Ryan death can come at any instant from any direction. For the rest of the films running time (nearly three hours total) each action--even a small one such as the eating of an apple--is thick with potential finality. This is not the work of the Spielberg weve come to know. After Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) he could afford to build any set throw money at any creative problem. His mise en scene became increasingly synthetic He seemed to lose touch with the texture of life. Even Schindlers List (1993) edged into the movie-ish. Deciding to shoot Saving Private Ryan as if it were a war documentary gives Spielbergs art a new orientation. Or rather a new disorientation. He shoots battles so that we cant always see whats happening our vantage is frighteningly restricted and the world of combat is reduced to pure sensation. This isnt about ""bravery"" or ""heroism"" but getting from Point A to Point B without being torn apart by bullets. Advertisement Saving Private Ryan from a script by Robert Rodat doesnt remain as feverishly abstract as its imagery but at its best early on it feels undiagramed--unmapped. A squadron of Omaha survivors led by Capt. Miller (Hanks) is sent behind enemy lines to find one Pvt. Ryan whose three brothers have been killed on the same day in separate battles. The seven men under Millers command are furious with what they see as a PR mission and a misallocation of military resources; they cant believe theyre risking their lives to rescue one anonymous private. But we in the audience know that the mission is more than PR--that Gen. Marshall (Harve Presnell sounding like Bob Dole) has ordered it out of a Lincolnesque compassion for all the families ripped apart by war. Freighted with such symbolism the odyssey cannot help but amount to something. M illers journey into the bowels of the war--through rubbled villages and fields strewn with rotting corpses--attains the surreal intensity that Francis Ford Coppola strove for in Apocalypse Now (1979) except without the self-conscious Golden Bough stabs at myth-making. Spielberg stages an agonizingly prolonged encounter with a German sniper in a mounting drizzle the life of a wounded exposed soldier streaming out of his body with the rainwater. The next assault is different an attack on a concrete Nazi ""pillbox"" thats barely glimpsed through the thick smoke the action viewed through the eyes of the squadrons skinny bookish translator (Jeremy Davies). After the shooting subsides the tenderfoot hurries ahead to discover the groups medic (Giovanni Ribisi) mortally wounded being ministered to by squadron mates hysterically pressing the dying man for instructions on how to stop his bleeding. Its no wonder that later the men go through piles of dog tags taken off dead Americans with little more than numb irritation and that when they finally stumble on Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon) they can barely contain their hostility. Soldiers in war movies are usually undercharacterized--it comes with the territory. But these young actors register. Vin Diesels loping charisma made me sad to see him blown away so early and Barry Pepper gives a stock part--the sniper who prays fervently before he kills--a monomaniac concentration. Mellish Adam Goldbergs nervy Jew who cant keep from taunting captured Germans with his religious identity is a study in aggression like Groucho without punch lines. There are stellar turns by Davies Ribisi Tom Sizemore as a plodding but good-hearted sergeant and Edward Burns whose acting is less mannered when removed from his own movies. Tom Hanks efforts to submerge his moody-wise-guy personality dovetails movingly with his characters struggle to keep his humanity in check. I find Damons proletarian integrity deeply suspect but must admit that he holds the camera like a star and that finding Pvt. Ryan is not an anticlimax. The battles in Saving Private Ryan make most World War II pictures seem like Hollywood kid stuff--even the bleak ""existential"" ones like Sam Fullers Steel Helmet (1951) and Don Siegels Hell Is for Heroes (1962). These sequences carry a post-Vietnam aura of futility and the scenes between the skirmishes are similarly modern full of rambling talk and post-Godot waiting around. But the movies overall vision is surprisingly old-fashioned. In most Vietnam films authority is insane. Here orders from on high bring meaning a glimpse of a more divine purpose. The mission has the opposite end of the one in Apocalypse Now not the wars heart of darkness but its heart of light. Theres another more virulent way in which the movie is old-fashioned. In the course of the endless massacre of Americans on Omaha Beach I wrote in my notebook ""No one who experiences this scene will ever cheer for a war again."" But when the tide of the battle turned and the Germans started getting their heads blown off I wrote ""YES"" And when a pair of Allied soldiers fresh from witnessing their buddies being blown to bits shot several pleading Germans rather than take them prisoner I didnt applaud the act but I didnt feel much like grieving either. The Germans are faceless with one exception a captured pillbox Nazi who babbles and cajoles for his life sings American anthems extols Betty Grables gams and screams ""Fuck Hitler"" Reiben (Burns) and Mellish want to blow him away but the translator--who has almost never fired a gun--protests vigorously that such an act would be a war crime and that the German must be taken prisoner or freed. It would be wrong to give away what happens next but the consequence of the squadrons action is ham-handedly predictable and morally speaking takes the picture down a peg. Too bad. It goes without saying however that Spielberg makes the case that soldiers morals explode like land mines amid the terrors of war. This is not after all where they live. Its hard to recall a more chilling stretch in modern movies than the one before the last big battle when the American soldiers surrounded by the debris of a devastated town listen to the echoey piped-in strains of an Edith Piaf recording--and then hear the first low rumbles of approaching German tanks each man alone in the shared knowledge that this foreign music will likely be the last theyll hear.

"Saving Private Ryan (R) Related Item Go to Video Finder Spielbergs War Its Hell By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 24 1998 Tom Hanks stars in ""Saving Private Ryan."" (DreamWorks) Director Steven Spielberg Cast Tom Hanks; Tom Sizemore; Edward Burns; Matt Damon; Vin Diesel; Jeremy Davies; Adam Goldberg; Barry Pepper; Giovanni Ribisi Running Time 2 hours 48 minutes For an extremely frank view of combat casualties as well as profanity Oscars Director; Sound; Cinematography; Sound Effects Editing; Film Editing There are movies and then there are movies. And then there is Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan."" Searing heartbreaking so intense it turns your body into a single tube of clenched muscle this is simply the greatest war movie ever made and one of the great American movies. In one stroke it makes everything that came before - with the exception of two or three obscure European variants on the same theme - seem dated and unwatchable. And it redefines the way we look at war. Generically it could be called the last example of that vanished category the unit tribute film. But this unit is not the 2nd Ranger Battalion or the 101st Airborne. Rather it is a generation those men born in the late 1910s and early 20s who when asked simply put aside their tools and settled the great issue of the century determining who would administer the industrial revolution dictatorship or democracy. They did this without complaint bitterness anger or remorse. Then they came home and picked up their tools again. To this day few will talk about what they saw and did and Spielberg shows us why. In the first seconds you understand you are in a different place than youve ever been before unless you survived the Normandy invasion. Youre in a Higgins boat in the gray dawn of June 6 1944 wet and cold and already exhausted scudding through the sloppy surf and all around you men are puking. The noise is astonishing. Your hands tremble; your breath comes in dry hurtful spurts. Then the landing gate falls and in the very first instant zeroed German machine gun fire spits through the boat. At this moment youll wish you were elsewhere as did surely every man in the real thing. In Spielbergs terrifying version the bullets seem somehow angry - they pierce the air trailing a whine or a streak of neon illumination and when they strike sand or steel they kick up big vicious geysers; and there are so many of them and they come so fastfastfast. But when they strike flesh they strike it with a thudding finality that reduces a man to maimed meat in a sixth of a second and takes it all away from him so that he falls forward obedient only to gravity. He dies like a sack of potatoes falling off a shelf. Spielbergs ability to capture the palpable madness of all this borders on the incredible. The first 25 minutes of the film - a re-creation of Omaha Beach from the point of view of an all-too-human Ranger captain whos been here and done this but not at this level of violence - is surely one of the great tours de force of world cinema. From the spillage of viscera the shearing of limbs the gushing of blood and the psychotic whimsy of the bullets to a final kind of fog of panic and soul-deep fear he makes you glad it was your daddys job and not yours. But Spielberg also understands wars deepest reality which is that being there is not enough and being willing to die for your country is also not enough; you have to be willing to kill for your country. So much of the battle carnage pictured in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is based on the craft of close-quarter small-unit combat Its watching men maneuver across terrain for geometrical superiority hunting for a position to vector fire in on the enemy. He who shoots from the best position and brings the most fire to bear hes the winner. The thermodynamics of infantry combat Shoot well shoot fast shoot often. Where does this unprecedented version of war come from? It may come out of a few other movies ironically all of them German. I think of ""Das Brucke"" (""The Bridge"") ""The Winter War"" (actually Finnish about the short brutal Russo-Finn war of 1940) or ""Stalingrad"" or even ""Das Boot"" - all movies that portrayed unflinchingly the iron randomness of war. But more vividly it has clearly been informed by a close study of as much archival footage of The Real Thing as can be had. In this sense its ersatz documentary with desaturated 40s color jittery terrified camera movement (you feel the cameramans fear of getting hit) and the sensation of overwhelming chaos. Its mean terrifying exhausting and quipless. Theres no spunk and very little humor. Morale is nonexistent. Its a grinding debasing job carried out in physical misery in an environment - mud rain cold - that is itself an enemy. Its Bill Mauldins Willie and Joe without the punch lines but with a lot of dead GIs and a crushing melancholy hanging over everything like smoke. But this will become evident only in time. Initially we are in such a fog from the intensity of the invasion sequence that fatigue is the only response A few survivors eat K-rations and try to decompress from the pressurized brutality theyve both suffered and dealt. Word comes a mission. Here the movie broadens somewhat for just a moment Two Ryan brothers have died in the invasion and a third has just perished in New Guinea. Mrs. Ryan of Every Farm U.S.A. will get three letters on the same day. But it seems theres a fourth Ryan James (Matt Damon) the youngest somewhere with the advance units of the 101st Airborne in the small French towns that cover the approach to the beaches. No less a personage than George C. Marshall himself the chief of staff (played by Harve Presnell with a less kitschy quality than might be expected) orders that a unit be sent out to pluck this boy from battle and return him to the farm. Its typical of Spielberg that this position is not treated glibly as another bit of idiocy by ""the brass."" In a spirit of decency and in accordance with what seems to be his career-long recognition of benevolent authority he makes us see on what basis Marshall makes his decision and how no matter how it plays out it represents the best of the American spirit not the worst. Eight men - that heroic captain John Miller (Tom Hanks in another of his quietly brilliant everyman roles) a sergeant (Tom Sizemore) a Browning Automatic Rifleman (Edward Burns) a sniper (Barry Pepper) a medic (Giovanni Ribisi) two riflemen (Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg) and an interpreter (Jeremy Davies) - are charged to cross the dangerous ground between the beachhead and the town locate Private Ryan and bring him back alive. Or bring back his dog tags. As pure story the movie has a swiftness to it that goes far beyond the sheer fidelity of the battle sequences. The narrative has been expertly configured; it moves us through a variety of experiences - squad assault town battle sniper duel a final stand against armored units - while at the same time keeping precise track of the overall story situation. Simultaneously the personalities of the men are expressing themselves in small ways. Even Damons Ryan who could be the font of sentimentality turns out to be just another kid low-key and quietly furiously decent. (Damon like all the actors is excellent in this lesser role.) But its no flashback-o-rama in the fashion of ""The Naked and the Dead"" where each mans life is summed up in a banal recollection. Rather - this is a point Spielberg makes over and over - these men have essentially given up on their civilian personalities - with the exception of the unit intellectual the interpreter played by Davies - for the duration. They know the drill. They know what to do. They can hold it together. Theyve become in Stephen Ambroses wonderful term complete Citizen Soldiers. In this way the film approaches its true subject which isnt heroism but duty which is to say repression. Its about men who make a conscious decision that the self does not matter; the ""personality"" is irrelevant; feelings are dangerous. Thus they become what they must to survive to kill and to win sealed-off beings locked away hoarding their emotions giving vent only to rage. They let nothing hang out because hanging out can get you killed. And Spielberg dramatizes this point twice explicitly in episodes where two soldiers yield to compassion. In this cruelest of worlds the result is catastrophe. This movie is about a generation that put its heart on the shelf dialed its minds down into a small cold tunnel and fought with its brains. All the way through you can feel Spielberg flirting with cliche almost daring us to recognize it and then at the last moment pulling it away from us and leaving us open-mouthed. But the biggest cliche that the movie assaults is the very conceit upon which war movies have been eternally built It is the idea that somehow combat is cool. Theres always been an athletic grace to battle as the movies have portrayed it a kind of photogenic sportiness. Even in the most violent of battle sequences a little boy in you thought ""Hey thats kinda neat."" You know dropping grenades on the German high command trapped underground in ""The Dirty Dozen"" or spray-painting Nazis red with your Thompson in ""The Longest Day."" And there was that Hollywood thing where the hero ran through blizzards of fire and somehow was never touched because after all he was the hero. Thats all gone here. Not merely because of its gore but far more because of its cruelty the war here will inspire no enlistees and no one will relive it in private later. Its flat-out terrifying and the emotion it finally produces in you is more than any other film has gotten but about one-thousandth of what the infantrymen of 1944 must have felt after one day on the line utter exhaustion. You feel bled out and at least emotionally you have been. So in the end this one is for the boys of Pointe-du-Hoc and also the boys of Utah and Omaha Salerno Monte Cassino Iwo the boys who took the long walk ashore at Tarawa through the Japanese fire the boys whose last moments were spent in a flaming Fortress over Schweinfurt or whatever wherever between the years 1941 and 1945. Take a bow little guy it says to them. And to us their inheritors it says Hey look what your daddies did what they went through what they survived or didnt survive - and be proud. And it also asks us the hardest of all questions Are we worthy of them?

"Saving Private Ryan (R) Related Item Go to Video Finder Spielberg Wins Battle Not War By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 24 1998 Tom Hanks stars in ""Saving Private Ryan."" (DreamWorks) Director Steven Spielberg Cast Tom Hanks; Tom Sizemore; Edward Burns; Matt Damon; Vin Diesel; Jeremy Davies; Adam Goldberg; Barry Pepper; Giovanni Ribisi Running Time 2 hours 48 minutes For profanity sex talk and some of the most graphic bloody battle scenes ever re-created on film Oscars Director; Sound; Cinematography; Sound Effects Editing; Film Editing The first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" contain some of the most intense footage you will see this year-quite possibly the most bloodcurdling images of war in all its hideous brutality you have ever seen. How any film could live up to this searing introduction is almost impossible. What follows in the rest of the Steven Spielberg-directed drama is powerful stuff indeed but its relatively minor imperfections seem more glaring when compared to the near flawlessness of the films lyrical scorching start. After a brief contemporary prologue in which a family-to the schmaltzy orchestration of John Williams-strolls through a forest of white military grave markers the screen and the music fades out to another time and place-D-Day just off Omaha Beach on the coast of Normandy in northwestern France. Immediately Spielbergs shaky hand-held camera places you in the middle of things alongside the first wave of soldiers waiting nervously inside a military Higgins boat-basically a glorified tin can one of many used to dump hundreds of American boys on the shore of Europe. It feels claustrophobic and the gut-clenching terror on the faces of its cargo of grunts is palpable. Everyone who knows World War II history knows what happened next. Mowed down by the merciless mortar and machine-gun fire from the concrete pillbox fortresses of the German defenses the vanguard of the Allied invasion suffered heavy casualties before gaining a toehold on the beach. But thats history statistics dull words written on the page of a textbook. With the verisimilitude of a combat cameraman Spielberg brings the horrific battle to life from the vantage point of the sand and splashing surf itself as Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his men ashore. Most of the ensuing dialogue is unintelligible shouts lost in a dense roar of weaponry and crashing ocean water. The only notes that jump out from the sonic chaos are the unrelenting ping and thud of bullets hitting metal and flesh. Spurts of blood blossom like dark flowers underwater. Faces and limbs are torn asunder by exploding shrapnel. Finally it ends and calm descends like the deceptive eye of a hurricane as the real fiction-and the films real problems-begin. Remember There are still over two hours of movie left to go. From stateside Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) issues Miller a new and equally dangerous order to find and rescue Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) the last surviving member of four enlisted brothers. After parachuting behind enemy lines and becoming separated from his unit Ryan is now lost somewhere in the French countryside. From the tattered remnants of his command Miller assembles a platoon of seven men to risk their lives in the search for one. They are a motley and superbly cast bunch and with the exception of Tom Sizemore as Millers right-hand man Sgt. Horvath and Edward Burns as the wisecracking Brooklynite Pvt. Reiben none of the actors are household names. Barry Pepper plays Jackson a country-bred sharpshooter who prays to Jesus for his deadly accuracy; Adam Goldberg is Mellish a Jew for whom the war is all too personal; Vin Diesel is Caparzo whose Achilles heel is his softheartedness; Giovanni Ribisi is Wade the medic; and Jeremy Davies portrays Upham an unseasoned pencil pusher whose skills as a translator are needed on the mission. This flawed bickering and yet cohesive crew has the touch of the common man which leads to the films first failing. As Miller and Ryan Hanks and Damon seem too pretty-boy clean too movie-star handsome to be deeply convincing. Hanks plays Miller with an off-the-rack tic a spastic hand whose trembling gets worse as the film and its tension progress. But it feels like a shtick that-along with the actors furrowed brow-is meant to add gravitas to a role that demands more depth than the bantamweight can muster. When they find Ryan guarding a remote but strategic bridge in the rubble of a bombed village he appears as a beardless and unblemished cherub compared to his dog-faced comrades. Albeit he is a teenage Iowa farm boy but he is in a war zone miles from nowhere. Why does Spielberg seem afraid to put a smudge scratch or bit of stubble on him? Its not just the two leads but the director himself who apart from the brilliant D-Day scenes seems unwilling to get his hands dirty-emotionally dirty that is. Remarkably realistic as a whole ""Private Ryan"" nevertheless shies away from the very messy question it begs What is the value of human life and why is one man worth risking eight? It is a weakness of Spielberg that has been noted before-his compulsion to pasteurize even the mud of battle and his reluctance to confront the complex and the contradictory especially when there is no satisfactory answer. Unlike such classic war movies as Stanley Kubricks ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" or even Spielbergs own ""Schindlers List"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" opens a wound but then hesitates to investigate it. It must be said that the film is well worth watching all the same. In it Spielberg goes a long long way toward overcoming his tendencies toward the shallow but the visceral punch of his not-quite-masterful film is softened by an almost neurotic slickness that keeps getting in the way of the important explosive issues it raises.

With Tom Hanks Matt Damon. Directed by Steven Spielberg. At area theaters. Running time 170 mins. Rated R. 4 Stars SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is Steven Spielbergs best war film and one of the two or three best movies the director has made. In the past Spielberg treated World War II as farce (""1941"") as swashbuckling adventure (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") and as tragedy (""Schindlers List""). But in ""Private Ryan"" the war is all of those things melded together into a confounding awful contradictory whole. Spielbergs war takes men and turns them arbitrarily and unpredictably into cowards or heroes. Most of the characters we meet are capable of the noblest acts of self-sacrifice at one moment and become sobbing and vomiting wretches the next. Though the film runs close to three hours and includes a large cast of extras and several large meticulously staged battle scenes it is by no means a vast impersonal epic in the tradition of ""The Longest Day."" Spielbergs D-Day is experienced largely through the eyes of one man Capt. John Miller Tom Hanks who is superb. Leading his men through the invasion of Omaha Beach his mission to take out a single seemingly unassailable German bunker Miller focuses on the few square yards of sand and scrubland in front of him. Using long space-compacting lenses darting hand-held cameras and an unusual shutter technique that gives the action a percussive strobe-like effect Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski narrow the visual field to match Millers perceptions.The initial attack which occupies the first 30 minutes is filmed with an intensity and realism no other war movie has attempted. Death is everywhere. Bodies splatter. Heads are split. Limbs are blown away. Only when the battle is over does Spielberg in one extraordinary tracking shot suggest the huge scale of the invasion. As Miller walks with his trusted sergeant (the excellent Tom Sizemore) explaining the strange mission they now face the vast battlefield unfolds behind him though the characters themselves are too concentrated to notice. Their mission is to follow in the wake of the Normandy invasion and to find a single soldier among the thousands of men caught up in it. He is Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon) a young man from Iowa whose three brothers have already died in battle. He is to be pulled out and sent home to his grieving mother in a humanitarian gesture ordered by Gen. Marshall (Harve Presnell). Diverse characters The script by Robert Rodat (""Fly Away Home"") reportedly with uncredited assistance from Scott Frank and Frank Darabont imagines Millers unit as a classic ethnic mix. Theres the tough-talking Brooklynite (Edward Burns) the swaggering Italian (Vin Diesel) the wisecracking Jew (Adam Goldberg) the Southern sharpshooter (Barry Pepper) and the conscience-stricken medic (Giovanni Ribisi). Theres also the timorous intellectual Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) a translator with no combat experience. Upham becomes the films other center of consciousness one directly opposed to Millers concentration and self-control. Upham is terrified both of killing and of being killed. If Miller represents our best hopes for ourselves under pressure Upham represents our worst fears. As Miller and his men move across the devastated countryside they experience an anthology of different kinds of conflict from claustrophobic hand-to-hand combat in a burned-out village to an assault on unseen snipers in a rolling cow pasture. Storm and calm As expertly as the action sequences are filmed Spielberg pays equal attention to the dialogue scenes the important moments of character interaction and development that come between them. Unlike the monotonous mayhem of ""Armageddon"" ""Private Ryan"" is careful to establish a rhythm of tension and relaxation of strong moments and moments of replenishing strength. As Miller Hanks finds a new depth and darkness in his screen personality while still remaining the open accessible all-American hero. As many writers have pointed out James Stewart returned from his World War II experience (as a bomber pilot) with a new gravity and edginess the gawky young man of Frank Capras comedies became the troubled protagonist of Alfred Hitchcocks thrillers. Hanks seems to have willed himself into a similar transformation. Though Miller still possesses Hanks innate decency and charm the character has something else behind his eyes He knows what its like to send men to their deaths. Like all of Spielbergs work ""Saving Private Ryan"" is ultimately concerned with a yearning for leadership and protection in a world without guidance or security. That yearning can produce cuddly space aliens (""E.T."") or idealized father figures (""Schindlers List""). Here it produces something more complex and perhaps more mature. In his hesitations and resolutions his vulnerability and necessary cold-bloodedness Capt. Miller is the most accurately scaled the most identifiably human protagonist that Spielberg has ever created. No longer seduced by fantasy he is looking for hope among men. (Rated R Violence gore language.)

"Apocalypse Then - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Apocalypse ThenSteven Spielbergs Violent `Saving Private Ryan Depicts Both The Horror And Humanity Of World War IiJuly 24 1998|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.Wars hell has often been portrayed in movies -- but never with as much bloody detail or gut-wrenching physical impact as it gets in Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan.""This great World War II battle film -- shot with all its directors famous technical genius and sense of wonder but tempered with a new toughness and maturity -- is a watershed picture for both Spielberg and war movies in general. Set during D-Day and its aftermath -- and centering on a strange humanitarian mission to save one soldier who has become the last survivor of four Army brothers -- ""Saving Private Ryan"" accomplishes something rare and extraordinary. Grimly and unflinchingly it conveys much of the brutality and madness of 20th Century warfare. But at the same time it celebrates believably the courage and self-sacrifice of people who fought it.FOR THE RECORD - Additional material published July 25 1998Corrections and clarifications.A movie review of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in the July 24 Friday section listed an incorrect date for D-Day. The correct date is June 6 1944. The Tribune regrets the error.A contradiction? Not necessarily. Spielberg the son of a WWII Army veteran as well as a child of the movies works here with both the dream archetypes of ""The Last Good War"" and its shattering reality. Time and again in this movie he shows us the kind of bloodshed and savagery (mass death a wounded medic clutching his guts as his life bleeds away) that the classic WWII movies usually left out. Most memorably he stages two battle scenes -- including an awe-inspiring re-creation of D-Day -- which rank among the most convincing and terrifying ever put on film.Through it all Spielberg infuses the film with a heartfelt admiration for WWIIs ""citizen soldiers"" -- especially Tom Hanks as Capt. Miller leader of the expedition to save Pvt. Ryan -- while refusing to romanticize or soften the horrors they went through. The films framing sequence a John Fordian cemetery scene awash in tragic irony is saturated with both that horror and admiration.The movie was made from an original script by Robert Rodat (doctored by ""Shawshank Redemptions"" Frank Darabont and ""Out of Sights"" Scott Frank) and its intense violence and earthy dialogue are obvious products of the post-Vietnam ""Apocalypse Now"" era. But its story is cast in the mold of the classic wartime epics of the 40s and 50s (""A Walk in the Sun"" ""Attack"" ""The Steel Helmet"") -- one more tale of a small tight-knit unit on a dangerous character-revealing mission. Here theres an extra ""historical"" element After three Ryan brothers die in combat Gen. George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell ""Fargos"" father) orders that the last survivor Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) whom the Army lost track of when he parachuted into Normandy be found and returned home.Marshalls ""order"" -- entirely fictitious but reminiscent of the actual WWII stories of the decimated Sullivan and Niland clans -- is given to a handpicked platoon (led by Hanks Miller) members of a group that has already survived the Omaha Beach landing. But as the mission drags on and more of them die tempers flare and morale begins to crumble. Why save Ryan when an entire world is in flames? Why submit to the Armys incessant goofups snafus and ""FUBARs"" (""F----- Up Beyond All Recognition"")? Why pull these soldiers away from action -- or delay their own returns home -- for a kind of military publicity stunt?These questions haunt the movie which begins and ends in that military cemetery where an unnamed initially unrecognizable soldier is visiting the graves of his old WWII companions. In between Rodats script uses not only a stock ""dangerous mission"" situation but also near-stock types in the search party the tough battle-scarred sergeant (Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath) the wisecracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns as Reiben) the ""Sgt. York""-style godly Southern sharpshooter (Barry Pepper as Pvt. Jackson) the feisty Jewish guy (Adam Goldberg as Pvt. Mellish) the salty Italian-American (Vin Diesel as Caparzo) the dedicated medic (Giovanni Ribini as Wade) and the sensitive writer and outsider (Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Upham). The movie and the actors -- especially Hanks Burns Sizemore and Davies -- transform and transcend these types give them blood flesh and grit. So does Spielbergs harrowing vision of the war itself.So jolting and shocking is ""Saving Private Ryans"" first big battle scene -- an amazing half-hour re-creation of the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach June 16 1944 as seen through the eyes of Miller and his company -- that the entire movie afterward seems haunted by it. In charged moments that recall the opening of Norman Mailers WWII novel ""The Naked and the Dead"" Spielberg shows the apprehensive men in the landing boats as they descend on the beach. Then on the beach they crawl through hell itself beneath a storm of machine gun and rocket fire an inferno more appalling because it is so believable.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesA Different Kind Of Horror MovieJuly 19 1998Under A SpellNovember 9 2000Extra touch of TLCMarch 23 2002A `Night` Without Scares-or DramaOctober 26 1990Find More Stories AboutFilmSpielbergTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-24/entertainment/9807250006_1_spielberg-actual-movies,200,savingprivateryan15,savingprivateryan,chicagotribune

Set over a 10-day period that begins with the D-Day invasion at Omaha Beach in Normandy France ``Saving Private Ryan features two long battle scenes that confirm Spielberg as the most technically gifted director of his time. Theyre as graphic and as disturbing as anything put on screen so disturbing even Spielberg backs off from what they reveal. Tom Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller the frightened leader of an eight-man squad that has survived D-Day and has been given the unwanted mission of tracking down a missing soldier Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon). His three older brothers were killed in action and Millers job is to tell him hes going home. The battles happen near the beginning and near the end of the movie taking up about an hour. Theyre filmed in documentary style real time handheld camera no music. Then again Spielberg doesnt need music. He arranges the sounds of war into his own symphony of bullets pinging off metal and severing flesh of soldiers vomiting and screaming of blood pouring out of helmets and dirt exploding into the sky. The scenes are everything the director could have wanted and more because the movie would have worked better without them. Having argued that war is insanity devastating both for conquerors and conquered Spielberg follows with a conventional story of heroism and sacrifice. The master of illusion doesnt know what to make of disillusion. With a running time of 170 minutes ``Saving Private Ryan is structured like war itself long periods of boredom between moments of the most horrifying excitement. The film has the look and the feel of greatness but something is missing. Hanks role is underwritten and so is everyone elses. Despite some talented actors including Edward Burns Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies the GIs remain character types rather than characters a Jew an Italian a pencil pusher a wisecracking New Yorker a Bible-quoting Southerner. War may be a faceless affair but war movies shouldnt be. According to the production notes Spielbergs intention was to find ``decency in the hell of warfare a search he pursued more thoughtfully in ``Schindlers List. Battle footage aside theres something naive about ``Saving Private Ryan. The screenwriter Robert Rodat is best known for the childrens film ``Fly Away Home. John Williams bland hymnlike score feels as out of place as the casting of Ted Danson as an Army captain. Hanks like Spielberg a symbol of innocence and idealism makes his first appearance in one of the directors films. Why did they wait so long? They were meant for each other like Frank Capra and James Stewart. But ``Saving Private Ryan was the wrong project for them. Capra and Stewart in ``Its a Wonderful Life did a better job of taking us to the abyss and back. Then again they had just returned from the war. ___ An Amblin Entertainment production ``Saving Private Ryan is a joint-presentation of Paramount Pictures and Spielbergs DreamWorks Pictures.

Saving Private Ryan"" relates the kind of wartime stories that fathers never tell their families. A searingly visceral combat picture Steven Spielbergs third World War II drama is arguably second to none as a vivid realistic and bloody portrait of armed conflict as well as a generally effective intimate drama about a handful of men on a mission of debatable value in the middle of the wars decisive action. Grim sometimes moving and just occasionally windy film is unusually demanding and serious for a mainstream midsummer attraction as well as a questionable bet for some women and more conventional thrill-seeking teens. Backed by strong reviews DreamWorks gamble could as easily pay off handsomely as a shrewd piece of counterprogramming as it could land in a commercial middle ground. Plunging the viewer headlong into battle in a manner akin to some of the more intense Vietnam films such as ""Platoon"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Hamburger Hill"" but quite rare for a World War II drama Spielberg wrenchingly presents combat from the grunts p.o.v. as it is fought inch by inch bullet by bullet in all its arbitrariness and surreality. Whatever else there is to say about the picture what remains in the mind is the transforming fear the sound of ammunition ripping into flesh and other metal the sight of bodies being blown apart the relentlessness of the pressure and tension the immense suffering the feeling of always being on the brink. In retrospect qualities such as heroism and bravery can be ascribed to the actions of soldiers the film suggests but in the moment there is only necessity. After a brief prologue featuring an older man silently leading his family into the vast military cemetery at Omaha Beach in Normandy pic drops the audience onto a U.S. landing craft getting ready to unload the first GIs to hit the beach on June 6 1944. From the opening moments the anxiety and fiercely discomforting conditions are underlined and as soon as the gate opens the German artillery comes raining down. Many men are mowed down before they can take three steps but Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad -- Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore) Pvts. Reiben (Edward Burns) Jackson (Barry Pepper) Mellish (Adam Goldberg) and Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) -- painstakingly make it past the many obstacles and are finally able to take one of the enemys concrete pillboxes on top of the bluff. Nonstop action lasts 24 minutes and every one of them is infinitely more intense than anything in the standard work on D-Day ""The Longest Day."" But no sooner have Capt. Miller and his men paused for a smoke then they are ordered to try to locate a certain private James Ryan who parachuted into France the night before. The reason His three brothers have all recently been killed in combat and government policy dictates that he should return home lest his family be deprived of all its male offspring. Robert Rodats original screenplay thus transforms to a mission format. Taking on a skinny timid translator Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has never seen combat the group which has previously seen action in North Africa and Italy treads gingerly through territory that is still riddled with Nazis as they discover when they come upon a bombed-out village and the first of them is killed. After the rest of them slaughter a bunch of Germans there is a bit of down time in a church for the men to argue the merits of their needle-in-a-haystack mission. Why one argues should several men risk their lives in the outside chance of saving a single man even if he is the last left in a family? How is one to judge the value of some men sacrificing their lives for the sake of saving many others?Such tentative attempts at philosophizing and stabs at profundity succeed in raising some issues that arent often considered these days but they still dont begin to lend the film the kind of weight in the intellectual arena that would match the action of its purely physical sequences. Unquestionably the picture strives to delineate a morality of decency and righteousness in a context defined by hate and inhumanity but the speechifying here cant compare in power to the brute force of warfare which is sufficient commentary by itself. Even if its thematic elements are not as richly developed as they might be and the story itself somewhat irksome in its far-fetched even contrived nature the film packs a heavy emotional punch at many moments as the tenuousness of life and the abruptness of loss assert themselves. A key skirmish occurs at a German radar station resulting in another American death and a fractious argument over what to do with a Nazi who has surrendered and begs for his life. To the disgust of some Capt. Miller lets him go a decision that unsurprisingly has fateful implications later on. Interestingly this soldier is the only German shown up close and given any kind of personality throughout the picture. Finally nearly two hours in the squad locates Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon) who complicates the mission even further by refusing to return insisting that he has orders of his own to continue fighting. As it happens a devastated village nearby contains a bridge that must be held and Miller orders Ryan to stay by him as they try to prevent the Nazis from taking it. What follows is yet another ferocious and protracted battle sequence small in scale and numbers but gripping in its details surprises and the way the chaos of fighting is strikingly conveyed. Epilogue connects once again to the personal tribute being paid by the contemporary visitor to Normandy. Using his technical virtuosity to the utmost Spielberg is pushing here to claim new ground for himself and for a revival of the World War II film and scores strongly on both counts. Opting out of the black-and-white of ""Schindlers List"" and the long-standing images of the war Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski have desaturated the color in a way that strikingly emphasizes the pale greens of the uniforms and landscapes blue-grays of the water and skies and flesh tones; in this context the red of the blood always jumps out. Frequent hand-held shots add to the intimacy and impact while a shuttering device makes some of the action appear a bit jumpy even pixilated creating an effect that is both ultra-vivid and somewhat jarring. Essentially Spielberg has made an amazing piece of pure visceral cinema akin to a great silent film in which the words are basically superfluous. Of almost equal note is the sound which emphasizes the frightening noises of war but occasionally shifts gears to blot out anything realistic in order to create subjective impressions of disorientation and detachment. Michael Kahns editing maximizes the power of the story and visuals while John Williams score is sparing with music avoided entirely for long stretches but coming into its own elsewhere notably over the final credits. Production design costumes and wartime ambience are all on the money and extra effort has clearly gone into the explosions stunts and military details. In a performance that has parallels with James Stewarts move into more complex conflicted and bitter characters -- in his case after his World War II experience -- Hanks impressively flexes his acting muscles once again. His Capt. Miller deliberately conceals most personal information from his men as well as from the viewer for most of the running time yet one comes to see clearly a decent man of the sort that America was theoretically meant to produce  and perhaps did during the generation in question. Of the supporting cast which consists largely of young actors generally associated with independent films Sizemore best fits with ones idea of a gritty tough and capable Yank soldier of the era while Davies impresses as the proverbial brainy weakling who is toughened by facing up to battle and difficult decisions. The others all have their moments Pepper as a lean-and-mean Southern sharpshooter the kind of guy you definitely want on your side; Goldberg as a personally motivated soldier who likes to flaunt his Jewishness at captured Nazis; Diesel as the likable Italian-American hulk; Ribisi as the considered medic; and Burns as the cynical New Yorker. Damon forcefully handles his limited but crucial scenes. Perhaps realizing that there was no avoiding the old truism that war is hell Spielberg decided to underline italicize and boldface it in startling terms that no one could miss. No further commentary is needed when the raw brutality of combat is presented as indelibly as it is here.

By Andrew Sarris  07/27/98 1200am Prodigiously produced and researched ambitiously acted and grandiloquently scored by the eternal John Williams Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan is the ultimate buddy-buddy picture of the 90s with surprisingly little moral historical or emotional resonance which is to say that I found it tediously manipulative despite its Herculean energy. Still the nearly-three-hour-long boom-boom shaggy-dog story set in the time and place of D-Day in 1944 is the kind of hot-air balloon that wins Oscars for its production values alone. And these I concede are considerable. Superstar Tom Hanks here in the predominant lead role of Captain Miller is O.K. I guess evolving from stoical secretiveness to sobbing vulnerability. Matt Damon is O.K. too as the elusive Pvt. James Ryan. Also O.K. are Edward Burns Barry Pepper Adam Goldberg Vin Diesel Giovanni Ribisi and Jeremy Davies as the members of Captain Millers mission sent out to return Private Ryan alive to his mother after his three older brothers have been killed in combat. Harve Presnells Gen. George Marshall Chief of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II is also fine reading President Abraham Lincolns famous letter to Mrs. Bixby on the loss of her five sons in the Union Army during the Civil War as a prod to his subordinates to bring the surviving Ryan son home safely from the War. This must have seemed to screenwriter Robert Rodat and Mr. Spielberg like a wondrous premise on which to spin a tale of quixotic valor around the massive pain and suffering of the Allied invasion of Nazi-controlled Europe. Mr. Spielberg wasnt there but he has heard stories from his father. Many of the younger admirers of Mr. Hanks and Mr. Damon may have heard war stories from their grandfathers. After all D-Day happened more than 54 years ago. So why spend 60 million re-creating it on the coast and plains of Ireland? Is there some historical antiwar revisionism afoot as there was after World War I with such odes to Allied-German fraternity as King Vidors The Big Parade (1925) Lewis Milestone and Erich Maria Remarques All Quiet On the Western Front (1930) and Jean Renoirs Grand Illusion (1937)? Not in this film. The Germans in Saving Private Ryan are the same kind of swine we saw in World War II movies of the 40s. Indeed in a mini-drama within the movie the lesson is taught that the only good German soldier is a dead German soldier even if he is a prisoner of war. To hell with the Geneva Convention. The pornography of violence and cruelty is pursued as assiduously in Saving Private Ryan as it is in all war movies even the most well intentioned. In what other genre can the massively indiscriminate slaughter of human beings by other human beings be justified as edifying historical fact? The two extended battle sequences that sandwich the rest of the movie display such ghoulish delights as arms and legs flying apart from their owners in a river of red blood. All sorts of flame-throwing devices from Molotov cocktails to the more advanced technology pay off in the sight of German soldiers being burnt to a crisp. As I recall even newsreels of World War II limited flame-throwing sequences to the Pacific sector where a kind of interracial war was raging. What Saving Private Ryan possesses that earlier World War II war movies didnt is a post-Holocaust perspective. At that time sympathetic actors like Peter Van Eyck and Erich von Stroheim under Billy Wilders direction in Five Graves to Cairo (1943) could play intelligent and charismatic Germans if not the heroically good German in Mr. Spielbergs Schindlers List (1993) for which gentile absolution Mr. Spielberg has been attacked by the unforgiving David Mamet. But until 1945 few of us had any inkling of the horror of the death camps. Still no war movie even bothered to suggest that the war against Hitler was connected to his persecution of the Jews. In Saving Private Ryan  a scene is inserted in which a Jewish G.I. mocks German prisoners of war by saying "" Juden Juden "" as an incantation. Even the Hollywood left wouldnt have dared test the tolerance of mainstream audiences with a scene like this before 1945 and the release of the death-camp footage. There is a nice scene with a little French girl who beats up angrily on her father after he tries to send her away to safety with the Americans. In addition as an amateur military historian I appreciated the dig at Field Marshal Montgomerys notorious slowness in advancing on the channel ports a dig shared by Captain Wilson and a fellow officer. A shot of Edith Piaf records on an old gramophone amid the rubble of a ruined town can be described as privileged. Yet there is no buildup to a satisfying climax and conclusion at least not for me. Mr. Spielberg tries to avoid the more obvious ethnic and regional contrasts in his unit but he still winds up with the usual suspects from Brooklyn and beyond that some of us remember too well from William Wellmans The Story of G.I. Joe (1945) and Lewis Milestones A Walk in the Sun (1945). What is most lacking in Saving Private Ryan is the creative eccentricity of a personal vision such as is to be found in Stanley Kubricks Full Metal Jacket (1989) and Oliver Stones Platoon (1986). If Mr. Spielberg can be criticized for magnifying the pitifully small subtraction made by Oscar Schindler from the tragically and monstrously huge number of casualties of the Holocaust in Schindlers List  he can be faulted here for miniaturizing the spectacular scale of an invasion of the European mainland by a multinational coalition with no prior experience in the task. Everything had to be done for the first time. Everything had to be tested on the spot and for a time victory itself hung in the balance. I cant help feeling that it is too late for people of Mr. Spielbergs Mr. Rodats Mr. Hanks and Mr. Damons generations to start playing soldier as though they and they alone could authenticate the past. When Lloyd Bacons The Sullivans came out in 1944 I was in high school and we all cried at this true story of five brothers who were killed in combat on the same ship. As I recall the War Department decreed that members of the same family would thereafter be dispersed into different units but no one suggested that any surviving sibling of any future catastrophe should be sent home. Perhaps that is why Saving Private Ryan did not move me as much as its mournful soundtrack suggested it should. Preston Sturges at 100 I have been singing the praises of Preston Sturges (1898-1959) for 50 years ever since I caught up with four double-bill programs of his fabulous 40s burst of brilliance at the old 55th Street Playhouse. He had seven Paramount comedy hits in a row and one undeserved mixed-mood flop a batting average higher than that of any other Hollywood director past or present. Now the invaluable Film Forum 209 West Houston Street (727-8110) is launching ""Preston Sturges 100"" a centennial retrospective to run from July 24 through Aug. 6. The series will open with two of Hollywoods wittiest and funniest sex comedies in any decade but nothing short of miracles in the heavily censored 40s. The Lady Eve (1941) pairs Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda in one of the merriest mismatches since Samson and Delilah. Charles Coburn William Demarest Eugene Pallette Melville Cooper and Eric Blore form a discordant hilarious chorus to the stormy shenanigans of the two leads. The Palm Beach Story (1942) teams Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea in a romantic quadrille with Mary Astor and Rudy Vallee. With two sets of twins and endless misunderstandings Sturges unscrambles this comedy of errors with Shakespearean audacity. This program will run July 24 through July 28. The Great McGinty (1940) still the funniest American movie about politics with Brian Donlevy Akim Tamiroff Muriel Angelus and the omnipresent William Demarest is on July 29 and 30 along with Christmas in July (1940) one of the lesser-known of the Sturges classics but one of the emotionally richest and sweetest with Dick Powell and Ellen Drew on the roller coaster of the American success story. Sullivans Travels (1941) with Joel McCrea Veronica Lake and the whole Sturges stock company and then some is the closest thing on film to the directors self-portrait and is one of Hollywoods biggest laughs on itself will run July 31 through Aug. 3 along with Hail the Conquering Hero  a complex satire of hero-worship that took more guts to make in 1944 than it took to make Saving Private Ryan in 1998 with Eddie Bracken Ella Raines and a whole small town full of townsfolk and United States Marines courtesy of the Sturges stock company. Later in August will come Mad Wednesday (1946) with Eddie Bracken and the sadly forgotten Frances Ramsden; The Miracle of Morgans Creek (1944) with Eddie Bracken Betty Hutton and Diana Lynn; and Unfaithfully Yours (1948) with Rex Harrison Linda Darnell and Rudy Vallee.

"Soldiers of Misfortune - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Soldiers of MisfortuneSaving Private Ryan is a raw and powerful work from Steven Spielberg that overcomes a conventional script.July 24 1998|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC More than any of his other films and that includes ""Schindlers List"" Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan"" wont leave you alone. To see it is to need to talk about it to wrestle both with the formidable impact of its unprecedented strengths and the surprising resilience of its niggling weaknesses. A powerful and impressive milestone in the realistic depiction of combat ""Saving Private Ryan"" is as much an experience we live through as a film we watch on screen.No one needs to be told about Spielbergs ability as a popular culture taste-maker Seven of Hollywoods 20 top-grossing films bear his mark as either director producer or executive producer. But because his skills as a filmmaker are so great because he can and often does get away with working at a fraction of his capabilities ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a startling reminder of exactly how spectacular a director Spielberg can be when he allows himself to be challenged by a subject (in this case World War II) that pushes against his limits.The son of a combat veteran Spielberg says the first movies he made as a child dealt with that war and many critics feel that the 40 minutes showing 1941 Shanghai under Japanese attack that open ""Empire of the Sun"" rank among the best footage hes ever shot. Spielberg is most effective when he doesnt flinch when his respect for the material compels him to be as honest as he can and that is largely the case here.Its not that ""Private Ryans"" story (written by Robert Rodat) of an eight-man squad detailed to find and rescue a soldier in just-invaded Normandy doesnt provide opportunities for conventional movie heroism. It does and Tom Hanks as laconic squad leader Capt. John Miller gives an indelible performance as an elevated everyman our ideal vision of how we all hope wed act under the duress of combat.But Capt. Miller is not a casually heroic John Wayne knockoff. Hes despairing about his role in leading men to slaughter troubled at the person the war has turned him into and the periodic trembling of one of his hands reveals hes dangerously close to coming apart.In this determination not to trivialize the nature of war and what it does to people ""Private Ryan"" is often a darker and more pessimistic look at combat and reality than we are used to from either Hollywood or Spielberg. This is a war where American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal where death is random stupid and redeems hardly anything at all. Even the usually vivid American flag is in Janusz Kaminskis remarkable cinematography bleached out and desaturated.More than in its attitudes more even than in its surprising focus on the nature of cowardice ""Saving Private Ryan"" reveals its determination to be accurate in the way it presents combat action. Using a trio of superlative operators (Mitch Dubin Chris Haarhoff Seamus Corcoran) and relying on the newsreel look of hand-held cameras ""Private Ryan"" gets as close to the unimaginable horror and chaos of battle as fiction film ever has closer in fact than some audience members may want to experience.After a brief prelude depicting an old veteran were not sure exactly who returning with his family to the American cemetery at Normandy we flash immediately back to that beach and a shot of Capt. Miller in his landing craft on D-day June 6 1944. During the next 20 or so minutes we are shown the invasion of France with a violence and an intensity that is almost beyond describing.The slaughter starts immediately and does not let up. Men are enveloped in flames ripped to shreds by bullets dead as soon as they set foot on the beach or in an agonizing mixture of horror and beauty dying in slow-motion as they are dragged underwater. One mans leg is blown off another loses an arm and tries awkwardly to pick it up with the other a third lies in agony as his intestines graphically spill on the ground. Panic pitiless fear and bloody pandemonium are everywhere; we see the raw terror on everyones face and for once we know exactly why its there.A great deal has been made about the violence level in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and though it is horrific its a world apart from the pandering anything-for-a-rush blood sports that characterize business-as-usual Hollywood. Theres no attempt to make the violence fun and games and special pleading is completely absent. Instead the visual tone is the dispassionate pitiless one of an all-seeing but uninvolved deity inviting us to look on this awful destruction and despair.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESPrivate Ryan UnsavedNovember 13 2004Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/24/entertainment/ca-6540,200,savingprivateryan20,savingprivateryan,latimes

Comments (3) Saving Private Ryan Steven Spielbergs 1998 exercise in Oscar-mongering is a compilation of effects and impressions from all the war movies hes ever seen decked out with precise instructions about what to think in Robert Rodats script and how to feel in John Williamss hokey music. Theres something here for everybody--war is hell (Sam Fuller) war is father figures (Oliver Stone) war is absurd (David Lean Stanley Kubrick) war is necessary (John Ford) war is surreal (Francis Coppola) war is exciting (Robert Aldrich) war is upsetting (all of the preceding and Lewis Milestone) war is uplifting (ditto)--and nothing that suggests an independent vision unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual (the visceral opening sequence showing Omaha Beach on June 6 1944) or someone getting graphically shot underwater. The story is about a squad trying to find and send home a private whose three older brothers have already been killed in World War II; its a mission ordered by General George C. Marshall (backed by the authority of Abraham Lincoln whos backed in turn by Spielberg) and executed by Tom Hanks a captain named John instead of Joe. It has a few pretty good action moments (including a climax straight out of the Indiana Jones trilogy) a lot of spilled guts a few moments of drama that dont seem phony or hollow some fairly strained period ambience and a bit of sentimental morphing that reminds me of Forrest Gump; it also lasts the better part of three hours.

Starring Tom Hanks Edward Burns Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (R. 168 minutes.) ""Dont look at it"" a soldier says to a horribly wounded buddy in one of the gruesome battle scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But we do look at it and are better for it. There are not many movies about which that can be said. Steven Spielbergs magnificent tribute to the memory now fading of the American effort in World War II is an overwhelming experience. ""Saving Private Ryan"" begins and ends with two of the greatest extended battle sequences put on film. The first evokes the horror of the Normandy invasion and the last is an extraordinary account of pitched battle. Captain John Miller played by Tom Hanks must lead a squad across Normandy on what seems a wild-goose chase. Their orders are to find a Private Ryan the only surviving brother of four soldiers from one family and bring him home alive. In an honest foursquare performance Hanks embodies the spirit of simple decency one of the reasons for which the war was fought. The D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach on June 6 1944 is presented as a prologue to the story. In a 20-minute sequence Spielberg is unrelenting in showing the horror of the event. The soldiers pray they shake with fear they scream in rage and dying they cry out for their mothers. As a kind of elegy the camera slowly scans across bodies bobbing in the bloody surf amid dead fish. The long walk across Normandy takes the squad into skirmishes in the countryside to a half-standing farmhouse a bivouac of paratroopers and finally to a do-or-die confrontation with the Germans at a bridge in a bombed-out village. There are extraordinary performances throughout. Most impressively Barry Pepper is the sharpshooter Private Jackson who prays out loud as he takes uncanny aim. Blockbusters come and go. ""Saving Private Ryan"" will stick with us.

We are all creatures who blindly run until something big and hard hits us and our torn insides spill out and we die. ""It was easy to read the message in his entrails"" Yossarian thinks in ""Catch-22 as he stoops overthe whimpering dying Snowden (""Im so cold"") his liver lungs kidneys ribs and stomach blasted apart by a three-inch piece of flak. ""Man was matter that was Snowdens secret ... Bury him and hell rot like other kinds of garbage."" For those of us who never went to war and learned of its horrors only through the reports of those who did or the representations of artists it is easy to keep the nightmare hidden away. Maybe not so easy with the war closest to many of us Vietnam. Thanks to our disillusionment with it and the work of journalists like Michael Herr and filmmakers like Oliver Stone and Francis Ford Coppola Vietnam flickers in and out of our imaginations as a minor piece of hell a torn-out fragment from a Bosch painting. But World War II the Good War the Heroic War the war that saved the world is different. Yes we know it was dreadful but we dont really want to know Wed rather cling to the image of jutting-jawed John Wayne firing his machine gun at a collapsing line of Axis dummies. After ""Saving Private Ryan"" the myth of World War II will never be the same. Using the overpowering techniques of modern film Steven Spielberg has cut through the glory-tinged gauze that shrouds World War II to reveal its brutal reality creating a phenomenology of violence unsurpassed in the history of cinema. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a very good film not a great one but it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history. That is no small achievement. The films most extraordinary sequence is its depiction of the landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day. It begins with a shot of troops huddled on a landing craft. The swells rock the boat up and down the air is gray and heavy. No one says anything. A man leans forward and vomits then another. There is no gunfire. The camera pans over the mens faces and the fear that burns in their eyes is made more terrible by the realization that we are not going to be playing by Hollywood rules here but by the more arbitrary laws of chance that actually govern war. That man there clutching his rifle and trembling is not going to be saved because he is praying or thinking of his children or because he has been singled out by the camera; he is going to jump into the water take two steps be hit by three .50-caliber gun bullets in the chest fall into the water and drown before he can bleed to death. The man next to him is going to duck down behind an anti-tank obstacle and have his legs cut off by shrapnel. The camera keeps looking at the faces. Fish in a restaurant tank. The landing craft pulls into the shallows the door drops down. The men move forward and suddenly there is shattering sound A German machine gun opens up. Everyone in the front line of the boat is killed. Men jump desperately into the water off the sides. We see one man drop into eight feet of water struggle desperately for a moment with his 60 pounds of gear then drown. Now the camera (masterfully handled by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) is running twisting on the beach chaotic flashes of light coming from half-seen points on the cliffs the ground rising up and coming down explosions going off like dice rolls. Men are shouting out orders but we cant make out what theyre saying. Were surrounded by death jiggled gently in the palm of his hand. Out of the corner of our eye -- everything seems to happen just beyond where we can quite see it clearly -- we see a man stumbling along without his arm; he stoops down and insanely picks it up vanishes. Now were back underwater and everything is silent -- has it all stopped? -- and then suddenly were back on the beach the sky is screaming invisible pieces of metal are hurtling in from all directions hitting sand metal water hitting human bodies that scream cry for medics howl die. As if in a hallucination we keep thinking theres some kind of logic here some master key. Over there its safe over there. Then over there blows up. For an incredible endless half hour Spielberg hurls the viewer into the midst of this inconceivable inferno of twisted metal shrieking shells and human agony. It is a tour de force probably the most vivid and visceral war scene ever filmed.In some ways in fact it blows up the rest of the movie. For this shattering vision is so corrosive so subversive of all logic all morality all stories that it devours the story that follows. What ""Saving Private Ryan"" is really about is war itself and war eats everything up. Nor is Spielberg equipped to tell a story that might somehow flow out of or illuminate this void. Spielberg is essentially a first-rate conventional realist the cinematic version of a skilled 19th century landscape artist. But by using his masterful brush strokes to capture the heart of darkness he has willy-nilly become a modernist -- entered a world of absolutes of metaphysical extremes that requires a more audacious formal and narrative vocabulary than he possesses.""Saving Private Ryan"" is like a Francis Bacon painting executed by Norman Rockwell. Thats not necessarily a criticism Maybe you need both visions to capture the experience of war. If Spielberg had made a more experimental film the gut-wrenching terror of the battle scenes would probably dissolve into symbolism subjectivity and ""artistic meaning."" Still theres something jarring about the films movement from nightmare realism to character-centered realism and back.The story line is pure Hollywood but its presented as morally ambiguous. After they finally secure the beach a platoon of eight soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) receives top-brass orders to find and rescue one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) a paratrooper with the 101st Airborne missing somewhere in Normandy. All of his three brothers have been killed and the military doesnt want another debacle like the one that inspired Abraham Lincolns famous letter to the mother of five Union soldiers killed in the Civil War. So Miller and his men set off to find Ryan knowing that their mission will probably mean that several men will die to save one. You Might Also Like Hanks is brilliant as Miller. In the finest performance of his career he plays him with a gentleness a weariness that is nonetheless rooted not just in decency but in the deep unknowable soil of courage a courage made awe-inspiring by our knowledge of what it confronts. He has his own negotiations with fear and madness but you know that he knows he wont break. With his trembling hands -- the result of too much combat -- and haunted eyes he is Everyman and his quiet presence stands as a majestic rebuke -- at once invincible and utterly vulnerable -- to the inhuman forces that surround him.Its almost impossible to depict a platoon of soldiers without falling into tough-bonding clichis but Spielberg and his fine cast manage to suggest the distance between the men as well as the camaraderie that holds them together. His soldiers are clearly delineated characters played with concision and authority. Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) is the John Wayne character gruff and implacable; Jeremy Davies plays the quavering Emerson-quoting translator Corporal Upham whose paralyzed terror in the climactic battle scene is at once comic and hideous; Ed Burns is the hotheaded guy from Brooklyn who threatens to abandon the expedition Adam Goldberg the bitter-eyed grunt who mocks German POWs saying ""Juden Juden"" as he holds out his Star of David.When they finally locate Ryan he stubbornly refuses to leave his platoon saying ""These are my brothers now."" Damons presence however is jarring His Harvard-jock look seems cinematic as does his big set speech in which he remembers a ridiculous sexual escapade involving his brothers. Its one of the movies few moments of artificiality.The platoon decides to stay with Ryan and his comrades to defend a vital bridge against the approaching Germans. (Its never made quite clear why they dont just blow up the bridge which seems to be mostly of use to the Germans and flee.) The climactic battle is even more horrifically violent than the D-Day sequence -- the scene in which a German soldier slowly stabs one of the Americans through the heart while whispering gently in his ear is completely unwatchable. And its use of sound is even more ominous The rumble of the approaching Panzers sounds like the gates of hell yawning open and when a tank suddenly rears up above the Americans with a metallic roar you almost have to laugh Its right out of ""Jurassic Park.""Its beautifully choreographed stuff and it again captures the mayhem of combat with unparalleled vividness (although the Gunfight at the OK Corral-like setting and the deus ex machina -- or Mustang -- ending make it marginally more Hollywood-y than the first one). The problem is the pornographic allure of combat overshadows our interest in or concern for the characters or the storys outcome. And since the movie has by now lost the hallucinatory free-floating quality that made the D-Day sequence so compelling and become a conventional narrative theres something unsatisfying about the lack of emotional identification and catharsis. Spielberg could have avoided this by giving his characters and Ryan in particular more depth creating backstories for them perhaps weaving other plot elements into his story. This of course would have made the film much more conventional and potentially sentimental and it would have taken away from its quasi-documentary quality but it would have had the virtue of heightening our identification with the human beings fighting and dying in front of us. In a peculiar way though you have to give Spielberg credit for not making his film more conventionally gripping. If he had made Ryan a more compelling character we would have cared about the mission to rescue him -- which is what youd expect from the master manipulator of emotions. No doubt out of a salutary realist impulse he chose not to -- but as a result the whole dramatic thrust of the story is vitiated.(Warning If you dont want to know how the movie turns out dont read the next paragraph.)Yet Spielberg does hit a high emotional note at the end. In a powerful framing device that recalls the ending of ""Schindlers List"" the aged Ryan revisiting with his family the place where other men died to save him falls to his knees shattered by grief and memory and shame and asks his wife to justify their sacrifice ""Tell me Ive had a good life. Tell me Im a good man"" he pleads. His refusal to forget the debt he owes the humility of his memory is not only enormously moving it serves as a kind of redemption a necessary if eternally fragile answer to the hell he witnessed. War may mock humanity snuff out life and hope but human beings can still remember and they can still love. The fragments we shore against our ruins.With ""Schindlers List"" and now ""Saving Private Ryan"" Spielberg has become a powerful chronicler of the central event of our century. Despite its harrowing vision of war and despite certain dark revisionist elements -- like its portrayal of the summary execution of surrendering Germans -- ""Saving Private Ryan"" does not diminish the blood sweat and tears of those who fought and died in Anzio and Bastogne and Guadalcanal. In fact it heightens ones sense of their heroism. No one who sees this movie would ever want to go to war -- but no one with a conscience could feel anything other than immense gratitude for those who did. The next time I stand in front of a field of white crosses I will have a little clearer sense of just what I am trying to remember. Gary Kamiya is a Salon contributing writer. More Gary Kamiya.

"Saving Private Ryan | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; saving-private-ryan ) Saving Private Ryan (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli Devastating. If for some reason I was asked to write a one-word review of Saving Private Ryan that would be the term I would use. As was true of director Steven Spielbergs other masterpiece Schindlers List the impact of this motion picture must be experienced; it cannot be adequately described. No film since last years The Sweet Hereafter has left such a searing and indelible imprint on my mind and soul. This movie did not need to be released at the end of the year to be considered for a flood of Oscar nominations; its so forceful that no one who sees it will be able to forget it -- not even Academy members with two-month memory spans. Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence a soldiers-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent gory visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets limbs blown off entrails spilling out and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of Saving Private Ryan unbearable. This aspect of the film almost earned it an NC-17 rating; only the fact that Spielberg rigorously avoids even a hint of exploitation convinced the MPAA to award an R. In addition to showing what happens when projectiles rip into the soft flesh of the human body the director employs other methods to capture the essence of battle - hand-held cameras a slight speeding up of the images muted colors and several different kinds of film stock. Put it all together and it adds up to a dizzying exhausting assault on the senses. As good as the rest of Saving Private Ryan is and its very good the D-Day attack on Omaha Beach is the sequence that everyone will remember most clearly. Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics (my all-time favorite film Patton falls in the latter camp). Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead its a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. In many ways the picture painted by this movie is more grim than the one Oliver Stone presented in Platoon which has often been cited as the most daring anti-war film to come out of Hollywood. Saving Private Ryan quickly and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious demoralizing violence that makes a cruel joke out of the human body and spirit. Although the film is only loosely based on a true incident its hard not to accept these characters and events as real. Saving Private Ryan begins with a short sequence in modern-day France that shows one man visiting a particular grave in the sea of white crosses that marks the memorial to those who died liberating the country. From there the film slips more than five decades back in time to June 6 1944. The D-Day invasion at ""Bloody Omaha"" Beach forms a prologue to the main story. Following the opening half-hour sequence we learn that two of the four Ryan brothers died in this action while a third perished elsewhere. The mother is receiving all three telegrams on the same day. The U.S. army chief of staff General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) is stirred by the grief-stricken womans plight and decides to send a group of men into the French countryside to find and rescue the fourth son paratrooper Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) a hero and survivor of the Omaha Beach battle is chosen to lead the team of eight men whose goal is in Millers words like finding ""a needle in a stack of needles."" His hand-picked team includes six men who have served with him throughout the war and one newcomer Upham (Jeremy Davies) a French/German/English translator who has never seen active combat. Together they strike out across the French countryside heading in the general direction of Cherbourg. Along the way they learn that skirmishes in small towns can be as deadly as the attack on the beach. Theres nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film which runs nearly three hours is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between smaller fights alternate with quiet character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. They are ""citizen soldiers"" -- ordinary men caught in the teeth of extraordinary circumstances. With the exception of a little manipulation at the end (when tears are actually a welcome source of relief from the films intensity) Saving Private Ryan rigorously avoids toying with our emotions. Although this is not Tom Hanks highest-profile role it is one of his best performances. His portrayal of John Miller is the perfect mix of war-weariness resignation and a devotion to duty. The teacher-turned-killer who has lost 94 men in assorted battles from Africa to France survives the madness by recalling special memories of his wife pruning rose bushes while worrying that she will not recognize the husband who returns to her because ""With every man I kill the farther away from home I feel."" The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Edward Burns Reiben uses cynicism and sarcasm to hide his uncertainty about the validity of his latest mission. Like the others in the group he isnt sure whether saving one mans life is worth risking eight others. Burns the actor/director who entered the publics awareness after making The Brothers McMullen turns in a fine performance. Jeremy Davies (Spanking the Monkey) makes Upham a believable figure whose horror at the sudden onslaught of trauma and violence is something almost everyone in the audience will relate to. Matt Damon who exploded into the spotlight with The Rainmaker and Good Will Hunting is solid in a role that calls for the character to be as much a symbol as an individual. Finally perhaps the best secondary performance is given by Tom Sizemore (The Relic) whose portrayal of Millers faithful friend and sergeant is vivid and engaging. Spielbergs meticulous period detail effectively re-creates the war-torn countryside of occupied France. The American soldiers visit two bombed-out towns where all that remains standing are the half-shattered husks of once-impressive structures. Many of the weapons that appear in Saving Private Ryan are authentic period pieces bought from collectors. And following the successful landing at Normandy we are treated to a spectacular panorama of the beach with a variety of mighty ships anchored offshore and the sky thick with blimps. Even though the Omaha Beach sequences were filmed in Ireland they nevertheless offer a sense of verisimilitude that those familiar with the actual place on the English Channel shore will find hard to dispel. With Saving Private Ryan set alongside Schindlers List Steven Spielberg once known as a purveyor of well-crafted-but-lightweight feel-good fare has given us two of the decades most gripping disturbing and powerful motion pictures. I consider Schindlers List to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever experienced and in many ways Saving Private Ryan is its equal. Although both films take place during the same time period they focus on different ideas. Schindlers List personifies good (Schindler) and evil (Amon Goeth) and plays out the struggle against a tragic backdrop. In Saving Private Ryan there are no human villains and the enemy isnt so much the Germans as it is the implacable destructive specter of war. The films central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movies shocking and unforgettable images Saving Private Ryan offers a singular motion picture experience. I will be surprised if another film tops it for the best of 1998.

Directed by Steven Spielberg from a script by Robert Rodat. 169 minutes. Several theaters. ""R"" - Restricted because of intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war violence and for language. Steven Spielbergs magnificent new film ""Saving Private Ryan"" redefines the World War II movie. Despite nearly six decades of filmmakers trying to come to grips with the subject it feels like the first truly honest attempt to deal with the horrors of combat - and the terrible responsibility shared by all survivors. The picture is already famous for its terrifying opening sequence a brutal account of the slaughter of American soldiers by German machine guns at the disastrous Omaha Beach landing during D-Day. The men shake vomit lose limbs watch their best friends bleed to death and much much worse. The chaos is complete yet all over the beach the survivors are trying to make sense of what theyre experiencing. ""What do we do now sir?"" asks one. ""Whos in command here?"" asks another. Gradually they find a way of fighting back and theyre not above making the enemy suffer. ""Dont shoot let em burn"" says one soldier after the Germans are routed with a flame thrower. Surrendering Germans are mocked and casually shot; the ""rules"" of war are abandoned. Back on the beach human corpses share the cold red waves with hundreds of dead fish. The sequence is a masterpiece of cinematography editing stunt choreography sound effects and special effects and so is the final confrontation between D-Day survivors and German tanks in a bombed-out French village. Nothing like this has been seen since the shattering opening and closing episodes of Sam Peckinpahs ""The Wild Bunch"" nearly 30 years ago; ""Saving Private Ryan"" will be studied by film students for years. Yet Spielberg doesnt just want to shock us with the undiscriminating violence of these events. As the film moves past Omaha Beach and into the French countryside as eight soldiers are given the absurd mission of risking their lives to save a paratrooper trapped behind enemy lines were confronted repeatedly with questions about the value of a single life in wartime. ""We have crossed over some strange border here"" says Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks perfectly cast) quietly recognizing the surreal nature of the task his squad has been assigned. Theyve been ordered to rescue Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) the sole remaining son of a family that has lost three young men in battle. Although we see him crying and shaking at times Miller is an enigma a thoughtful man who can appreciate Ralph Waldo Emersons belief that ""war educates the senses"" while ruefully counting up the number of men who have died under his command - and trying to make sense of the math. Given several opportunities to open up about his past he turns instead to the task at hand. Hes accompanied on his mission by an experienced comrade (Tom Sizemore) a Jewish soldier who angrily provokes German prisoners (Adam Goldberg) a talented sniper (Barry Pepper) a soulful medic (Giovanni Ribisi) a resentful New Yorker (Edward Burns) an easygoing Italian-American (Vin Diesel) and a bookish frightened translator with no battle experience (Jeremy Davies in a riveting performance that dominates the films final set piece). The first Pvt. Ryan they meet is the wrong one; the mistake provides the most darkly comic moment in the movie. When they find the right one the camera passes over Damons famous face as if he were just another soldier. Which Ryan insists he is. The prologue and epilogue of ""Saving Private Ryan"" take place decades after these events at a D-Day cemetery dominated by rows of crosses. These scenes like the ones in which Gen. Marshall (Harve Presnell) singles out Ryan for rescue may strike some as maudlin and occasionally John Williams score pushes too hard. But these are tiny objections to a film that is otherwise so brilliantly realized. Copyright (c) 1998 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Dreamworks ) A Saving Private Ryan Genre War Action/Adventure Historical Drama; Starring Tom Hanks Matt Damon Tom Sizemore Ed Burns Ted Danson Vin Diesel Dennis Farina Paul Giamatti Adam Goldberg Barry Pepper Giovanni Ribisi Tom Sizemore; Director Steven Spielberg; Author Robert Rodat; Runtime (in minutes) 170; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Dreamworks Distribution L.L.C. Posted July 24 1998 -- 1200 AM EDT A decade ago who could have guessed that Steven Spielberg would become our most spectacular poet of war? Saving Private Ryan (DreamWorks) his World War II epic about the invasion of Normandy and its aftermath is a movie of staggering virtuosity and raw lyric power a masterpiece of terror chaos blood and courage. More than Coppola Stone or Kubrick all of whom apotheosized the druggy morass of Vietnam Spielberg has captured the hair-trigger instability of modern combat. He puts us directly inside the consciousness of men in battle and he does it from the outset using the famous attack at Omaha beach on June 6 1944 as an occasion to stage one of the most brutal and revolutionary sequences ever filmed. As Higgins boats pull up under blue-black skies the American soldiers stare silently occasionally vomiting with seasick fear. The fronts of the boats drop open and the enemy gunfire explodes with a sickeningly dense and relentless cracking the camera trembling as if the earth itself were coming apart. Red bullet holes appear on the mens helmets and bodies drop like rag dolls. This may be D-Day but it looks more like a mass suicide and the profound shock and horror is that it doesnt stop. For nearly half an hour Spielberg uses his unparalleled kinetic genius to create an excruciatingly sustained cataclysm of carnage nausea and death. Spielberg is making a perceptual statement about World War II Hes saying that it was every bit as merciless and agonizing as ""insane"" as Vietnam. Still among the anonymous faces of the soldiers we cant help but cleave to a familiar one -- the calm somber visage of Tom Hanks as platoon captain Miller who wriggles to a safe spot on the beach and lies like a trapped animal then starts to cobble together a survival strategy. Saving Private Ryan is Spielbergs vision of what war is -- all war even Americas fabled Good War. Yet the film is no pacifist tract. Its a portrait of nobility and grace amid the madness of technological slaughter and it melds these elements together with an organic intensity that Schindlers List for all its brilliance didnt. Spielberg records what the sacrifice of World War II actually entailed ordinary men diving into an existential inferno. Captain Miller receives an assignment to locate a certain Private Ryan the only one of four enlisted brothers who is still alive. As Miller leads his squad into the French countryside the dread of that opening massacre haunts their every move and in a sense it recurs every time the film erupts back into violence. We get to know the soldiers slowly eavesdropping on their wary camaraderie so that when one takes a bullet the platoons loss is ours. Among the sterling cast Tom Sizemore as the rumpled devoted Sergeant Horvath Barry Pepper as the stoic marksman-sniper Private Jackson and Giovanni Ribisi as the ghostly haunted medic Wade all have indelible presences and the scrawny pale slit-eyed Jeremy Davies from Spanking the Monkey has more. He shows you the creepy-crawly anguish of the cowardly Corporal Upham who has barely fired a shot in his life and is like a stricken angel struggling to stay aloft. The platoon finally stumbles onto Ryan (Matt Damon) who turns out to be a likably stubborn kid who refuses to leave his platoon behind. Theyre set to defend a bridge in the middle of a bombed-out village and as Miller and his men join forces with them and the Germans roll up in their jeeps and tanks the film becomes a true Armageddon with Spielbergs camera seemingly everywhere at once. The epic battle that concludes Saving Private Ryan may be the greatest episode in any war film. Saving Private Ryan says that only by confronting the pitiless horror of World War II can we truly know its heroism. For the first time a movie has shown us both.
