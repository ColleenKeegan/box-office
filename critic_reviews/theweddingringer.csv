Slicing and dicing the plots of Hitch I Love You Man and The Hangover it stars US comic Kevin Hart as Jimmy a wisecracking entrepreneur who makes a living hiring himself out as best man to friendless dorks like Doug (Josh Gad). Its not long before the pair begin to bond but the course of man-love doesnt run smooth old ladies are hilariously set on fire gay men hilariously camp it up and hapless guys get hilariously blown by dogs (seriously). But while there are few social groupings The Wedding Ringer wont go out of its way to offend women come under the greatest fire proving themselves (yet again) to be nagging harridans up-for-it whores or if theyre lucky reliable motherly types. Its all very slick and competent and there is one genuinely funny joke about The Goonies. But this is seriously outdated.

Comments click to enlarge The Wedding Ringer Video Rated R  101 minutes  2015 Fast-talking stand-up Kevin Hart and schlubby character actor Josh Gad make an entertaining duo in this lowbrow buddy comedy playing off each others delivery styles to lively effect. Gad plays a rich loser who hires ""professional best man"" Hart to pose as his old friend in the week leading up to his nuptials failing to mention that hes told his future in-laws his ""friend"" is a priest. Screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender dont even try to make the premise seem plausible; rather they use it as a springboard for screwball complications and verbal humor. The filmmakers also have good fun subverting gay Jewish and Latino stereotypes though the female characters tend to be one-dimensional shrews or bimbos. Garelick directed.

Photo Credit AP / Matt Kennedy advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW Doug Harris is the schlubby but likable hero of ""The Wedding Ringer"" a comedy built on a seemingly implausible premise. Doug played by Josh Gad is facing his wedding day without a single person to put on his guest list. How can that be at a time when weve never had so many followers likes and ""friends?"" Enter Kevin Hart as Jimmy Callahan the best-man-for-hire who reassures Doug that the average persons friends have dwindled in number from 3 to 2 since 1985. That may be a sales pitch but it somehow rings true. Its a nice line and an indication that ""The Wedding Ringer"" despite much R-rated humor is a comedy with heart. advertisement | advertise on newsday It also has the on-screen chemistry of Gad and Hart who make an endearing team as the friendless Doug and the money-minded Jimmy. ""No contact after payment"" is Jimmys retort to grooms who think the act was real -- though clearly Dougs case will be different. Jimmy has to hire a whole crew of miscreants (one is played by Jorge Garcia of ""Lost"") to pose as Dougs pals. We know that by the time theyre done memorizing facts and falsifying photos the fake feelings will turn real. ""The Wedding Ringer"" began life more than a decade ago as ""The Golden Tux"" a screenplay by Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender but sat neglected while similar concepts (""Wedding Crashers"" ""I Love You Man"") made it to the screen. Garelick directs the movie and you can almost sense his joy at seeing it realized. The jokes are crass -- strippers dogs peanut butter -- but never mean-spirited. Even Dougs bossy fiancee Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) gets treated humanely. ""The Wedding Ringer"" is hit and miss. Some ideas come out of nowhere -- a football game with Joe Namath for instance -- and the film often ignores its own logic for the sake of a joke (Doug turns out to be a phenomenal dancer). What saves the film are its two leads who arent afraid to show their sensitive sides -- along with other parts of themselves. 256 MoviesThe Wedding Ringer trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer Universal Pictures Movies January 16 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Michael Manns Blackhat is a paranoia thriller that treats computer code the way most movies treat serial killers. In the opening minutes the camera surfs along cables weaves between chips pinballs amid circuitry. Its interested in everything screens of numbers blips pulses and lasers. Mann is trying to personify information to give it a point of view the way The Silence of the Lambs plunked you down in the basement lair of Buffalo Bill. The movie isnt as visually or psychologically arresting but it has a decent ludicrousness and Manns one-of-a-kind talent for using digital photography and naturalistic light to complicate and invigorate anonymous spaces. Lots of non-science fiction thrillers are ultimately about the fear of advancing technology. Theyre not sci-fi because science has already run amok. There are hackers. There is government and corporate spying. And it doesnt take much for computer networks and surveillance systems (or their anonymous human exponents) to come chasing after you. That was the sickening allure of everything from Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation (with Gene Hackman as a genius eavesdropper) and John Badhams WarGames to Tony Scotts Enemy of the State and Laura Poitrass Citizenfour It might already be too late. For about 10 minutes Blackhat generates intrigue in part by showing us the technology doing its psychotic thing. All that fiber-optic coursing culminates in an explosion at a Chinese nuclear reactor. Then we see the blips and cables and pulses reach the claw of a chip and soy futures soar through the roof. Soon were hopscotching between a pair of FBI agents Barrett and Pollack (played by Viola Davis and John Ortiz respectively); and Chen (Wang Leehom) an MIT-educated Chinese cyber-criminologist and his old classmate Nick (Chris Hemsworth) who for reasons known only to a Hollywood movie needs to be sprung from prison to help solve this case. ""So good to see you bro"" says Chen during a long embrace with Nick that Agent Barrett and Chens hacker sister (Tang Wei) are parked outside the prison to witness. Nick had been in the middle of serving a 15-year sentence for stealing millions from four big banks. But someones using a sloppy version of code he wrote to commit seemingly unrelated acts of terrorism and sabotage. As a deal to help solve the case he wants his sentence commuted. The script is credited to Morgan Davis Foehl and at this point he had me. Wheres this going? For one thing into the land of compujargon. Theres talk of edge routers and optical overlay networks. Among the Chinese theres bad dubbing and elsewhere dull exploratory excursions. And while Barrett and Chen work angles on their side of the film Nick and the sister wind up working each others angles. (To be fair hed been in prison for a minute.) But this of course turns a film about cybercrime into a film at least partially about fucking hackers. What you realize as theyre gazing at each other and as you watch their lovemaking is that these two are terrible together. Tang is lost in her many English-speaking scenes presumably having been hired for the sex she had in Ang Lees Lust Caution. Theres often little more for her to do than stare at the top of Hemsworths head as he hacks hunkily away in a dingy flat. But you start to doubt a movie that gives this much screen time to an actress whos that in over her head when in Davis theres a star on the other side of the movie exuding cool control. And what if she and Hemsworth had switched parts? Because while the movies -- and People magazine -- believe in Hemsworths sexiness falling for it is a kind of false worship. He walks around with shirts open to the middle of his chest as though he were James Caan in 1973. But Caan had the cockiness (OK gall) to open his to his navel. Hemsworth is missing that kind of gumption. Hes got an empty smolder like a grill after youve dumped out the coals. But it turns out that when he isnt forced to be concerned with sex when the movie lets him charge ahead with the narrative he becomes sexy in a young Jan-Michael Vincent sort of way. When Hemsworth finally puts all the plot pieces together (thank you screenplay) hes standing well above sea level speaking to no one in whatever accent hes decided to give himself ""Thats what youre doing isnt it you son of a bitch?"" By this point the movie has turned into something ripe and pulpy. Nick breaks into the NSAs system. And later when he does more pivotal hacking youll never guess the color of his baseball cap. You come to appreciate the films fondness for Nicks criminality even as it baffles (if the hat fits I guess). By that point Mann has already staged one shootout at a dockyard among shipping containers and another on an empty street at night (the veteran Holt McCallany plays the U.S. Marshal on the FBIs team; hes got the sort of unfussy masculinity Manns movies thrive on). These sequences arent Heat-caliber. But Mann puts his foot in them anyway lingering with love over the face of one dead character and letting the sound guys leave you feeling as though youve been riddled with bullets too. The whole thing culminates in an excitingly done increasingly despicable nighttime showdown at a Jakarta street festival whose vastness seems meant to hide its participants from each other. We never see the faces of the marchers but when a melee inevitably erupts and the knives and guns come out the marchers are shoved in and out of the way. Theyre made disposable for our entertainment. The movie has long given up on giving technology a point of view and turns rather suddenly into another asinine occasion to bulldoze a culture that has no point of view in Hollywood.  Sam Urdank/Europacorp I guess theres no point in asking who wants another Taken sequel. By a wide margin the latest and allegedly last installment -- Taken 3 -- is no. 1 at the box office. Volume 2 set largely in Istanbul made a wishful rooftop leap into the Bourne movies but crashed through a window into a bad 24 plot. Having Liam Neesons CIA operative hell-bent on revenge Bryan Mills team up with a blonde nincompoop daughter named Kim (Maggie Grace) only enhanced the TV comparison. But oh the magical shenanigans of Taken 2 It warranted a space in the dumb action hall of fame. (Heres an incomplete transcript of a jailed Mills stealing a cell-phone call to Kim ""Take a shoelace from one of my shoes in the closet ... Draw another circle with the market in the center ... I want you to go to the parking lot with the grenade ... I want you to pull the pin on the grenade ... Now I want you to draw a circle on the map ... I want you to take one of the guns and two of the grenades and go up to the roof ... Set off another grenade ... Drop the gun down the vent Kim and run ... "") Well Kim runs into part three a movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for 35 minutes then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate. But you yawn through that too. Its all brought to you by the same outfit that made the first two Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen on script with Olivier Megaton directing. This being a Besson production it attains some lunacy but hardly anything comparable to Taken 2 which had lost the antsy defensiveness of the ludicrous first movie a story of a divorced dad trying to reassert his fatherly primacy with karate chops swinging kicks and action doubles. After all that its honestly surprising theres anything left to take. Alas however he arrives from a jog to his Los Angeles apartment one morning only to find the dead body of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). But she just texted him a bagel order Of course the cops think Bryan did it. Of course Bryan runs. Of course the detective on the case is Forest Whitaker who fiddles with such props as rubber bands and discarded chess pieces (its a knight and it takes nothing). Whenever Bryan gets close to Kim whos distraught over her mother worried for her father and expecting Whitaker gets a feeling and goes nuts and orders the officers hes got surveilling Kim to get after her. At this point you could stay home and fire up The Fugitive. The plot hides amid a bonanza of convenience-store trips diner scenes and lots of shots of bagels. It does so while climbing a ladder of nonsense that leads to the sort of ugly-looking Russian goon who in anticipation of a business deal actually makes time for gross hot-tub nuzzling with two ladies. Never fear -- with these movies the ladder always has another rung. But its also the kind of film that telegraphs what that rung is long before any sort of climax gets going. All the exceptional stunt work of the first movie and action orchestration of the second are an uninspired mess of visual incoherence. When Bryan and his car are run over the side of a cliff you can set your watch for the flashback that explains his escape. Neeson owns these movies and this new bad-ass phase of his career. Other middle-aged stars have followed suit with suave turns in kill-everybody action thrillers -- Kevin Costner Denzel Washington and soon Sean Penn. Neeson gives his incarnation heartache and loneliness. He performs. His intolerance for the execrable extends from the characters to the actors playing them. Dougray Scott plays Lenores husband Stuart and before getting to the Russians Bryan leaves himself no choice but to waterboard Stuart. As bad as Scott is (hes not even winking) this is excessive and as the Senate Intelligence Committees recent torture report confirmed not terribly effective. (Again so many rungs.) Neeson looks good. He just doesnt look fast. Bryans escape from the LAPD by foot and by fence-scaling constitutes satire. This is one of the most hectically edited movies Ive ever seen (I dont think theres an action shot that exceeds three seconds). But the cutting cant disguise Neesons slowness. American law enforcement has been under a lot of stress and scrutiny lately. But failing to catch a big-ass 62-year-old Irish dude running through alleyways and living rooms will only add insult to injury.  Matt Kennedy/Screen Gems A reliable authority swears to me that an algorithm didnt write the new Kevin Hart movie; humans did. But The Wedding Ringer feels spat out for people who love Katherine Heigl movies but wish that Eddie Murphy were in her role instead. Instead of mid-1980s Murphy though they get Hart who tries to do for this movie what Will Smith did for a similar matchmaking scenario in Hitch make it fizzy. Like Hitch The Wedding Ringer is all but stolen by the corpulent costar who needs a smooth black male to save him from haplessness (its Josh Gad now; then it was Kevin James). There are slabs of Wedding Crashers stabs at the painfully funny physicality of the Farrelly brothers something like the finale of The Graduate and the sort of approach to bromance that errs relentlessly -- though neither insultingly nor all that cluelessly -- on the side of gay. Harts Jimmy Callahan runs a business specializing in providing best-man services to friendless grooms. Gads character Doug calls on him 10 days before his wedding to a woman (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) who he feels is too hot for him. He has fewer friends than he has let on to her. But for 50000 (plus expenses) Jimmy pulls together a team of groomsmen and throws him a bachelor party. The short notice means the groomsmen are largely idiots and weirdos. One is a fat loser (Jorge Garcia). The Asian American one has a third testicle. Anothers a white sleazed-up ex-con (Colin Kane) who preys on women and has raped men. Doug is appalled but maybe these misfits (and criminals) are the bros hes always wanted. The number of soundtracked montages Doug and Jimmy share makes the average Heigl movie seem like Birdman. In the meantime they find themselves drawn to one other and each time they have a moment Jimmy has to redraw a professional line the way Julia Roberts kept telling Richard Gere she doesnt kiss johns on the mouth. Jeremy Garelick directed The Wedding Ringer from a script credited to him and to Jay Lavender and they seem scared of how much smarter this movie couldve been. The filmmakers unleash noisy party scenes sequences that appear to have been edited with a Vitamix and a basset hound that comes down with lockjaw while licking Gads penis. That last bit -- along with a couple of other nominally funny asides -- are intended to bring down the house. The wedding planner is an over-the-top gay queen (Ignacio Serricchio). At some point Dougs grandmother (Cloris Leachman) catches fire at a dinner table and nearly burns down the house. And Dougs coarse macho future father-in-law (Ken Howard) challenges Dougs masculinity by assembling a football team that includes Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones and a mad-dog Joe Namath. This is drive-thru comedy. The sugar grease and salt will make it a hit. But theres a far more interesting sophisticated work of cynical farce between the films two sesame-seeded buns. Olivia Thirlby plays the potential sister-in-law and the movie almost lets her do more than smell a rat in Jimmy. The same is true of Cuoco-Sweeting whose sense of comedic sharpness the film just gives up on. More than once this sham world that Jimmy inhabits keeps revealing funny new layers of fraud. The gay wedding planner pivots from one cliche to the invention of another because he surmises the clientele for his line of work demands it. The movie understands the lucrative value of stereotypes so thats all it peddles. Its all the producer Will Packer peddles too usually with Hart. The only moments that dont feel like a sham are the ones in which Hart and Gad are holding each other on the dance floor reclined in beach chairs reminiscing gently as water from a swimming pool shimmers over them or tongue-tied at the mutual intensity of their connection. I at least felt something. Harts best with a skeptical sparring partner -- like Alan Arkin or Regina Hall -- rather than on his own or with someone he can run all over. His comedy needs a speed limit and often a Kleenex. In song or in motion Gad could be a star. He and Hart are persuasively vulnerable together. This movie isnt uncomfortable with that but it interrupts the awwws -- or the ewwws if youre inclined to be that way -- with a lot of crassness. Maybe the hope is that you dont notice that the ""if you liked blank then youll like blank"" algorithm is sputtering as it attains a version of derivative untapped humanity If you liked Pretty Woman youll love when it pretends to be Bridesmaids.

Heas an intense presence but he often floats above his movies. So itas interesting to see him so dedicated in The Wedding Ringer a mostly disposable occasionally quite funny bromance distinguished at times by its earnestness. Hart plays Jimmy Callahan a professional who for a price will come to the aid of mostly friendless soon-to-be-wed men and pretend to be their lifelong buddy and best man for a weekend. He swoops in gives soulful wedding speeches charms everyone (including a bridesmaid or two) and then heas off a though for an additional fee heall keep sending cards on your birthday and if necessary speak at your funeral too. Itas an imaginative idea one full of satirical possibilities a just typing that above description made me think of all the intriguing directions The Wedding Ringer could have gone in. But Jeremy Garelickas occasionally very funny film sticks to the high-concept logline Itas I Love You Man meets Wedding Crashers. Josh Gad plays Doug a schlubby well-to-do lawyer whoas due to be married to lovely but potentially Bridezilla-ish Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting). He not only needs a best man he actually needs friends in general. Hart as Jimmy talks fast and has an answer for everything a he rattles off different best-man package options like aBasic Single Ring Wing Mana and aThe Bronze Bow Tiea like they were familiar menu items a but what Doug is asking for is mythical nearly impossible a aThe Golden Tuxa a best man and an entire set of groomsmen. So Doug and Jimmy set about auditioning a bunch of Jimmyas go-to guys to be Dougas set of bros and theyare a predictably odd bunch in it for both the money and for the potential of hooking up with bridesmaids. (aI want seven vaginas in my facea one of them demands.) Anyway thereas some chuckle-worthy stuff here some of it having to do with the Hangover/Bridesmaids-style hedonism of Jimmy (now named Bic Mitchum) and Dougas pre-wedding antics. Thereas a funny way-too-intense Wedding Crashersastyle pickup-football game involving Dougas wedding party Gretchenas domineering father and a bunch of NFL veterans including Joe Namath and John Riggins. Thereas also a solid slapstick bit about accidentally setting Cloris Leachman on fire (if youave seen the trailers youave basically seen the entire gag) which could have easily come from a Farrelly Brothers comedy. In other words just about everything in The Wedding Ringer feels like something youave seen in another movie before. (Including of course the bad stuff; can we just set a moratorium on gay-wedding-planner jokes?) But unlike the freewheeling see-what-sticks style of most comedies today The Wedding Ringer veers between broad foulmouthed schtick and deeply earnest philosophizing. Thereas a lot of discussion of why Doug doesnat have any friends which in turn prompts Jimmy to do some soul-seeking on his own. He looks down on his customers because he sees them as losers who need a professional transaction in order to have or pretend to have any friends. But then again isnat he in basically the same situation a guy who gets paid to pretend to have a life? In any other movie all this sincerity would be treated as a halfhearted contrivance a weak stab at an emotional through-line to keep the plot moving along. Apparently the script for The Wedding Ringer has been kicking around for more than a decade and it was originally intended to be a vehicle for Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson; you can see how in their hands it might have had that easygoing we-kind-of-care-but-not-really quality. But aeasygoinga is not in Hartas repertoire. He has a more extreme energetic persona. And this time he commits to the heart of this jarring occasionally funny and surprisingly sentimental film.

Heres the comic whos boundlessly inventive in his swearing but also suave and commanding in pursuit of love the motormouth horndog who yawps about like a puppy on fire but can melt your mothers heart with his warmth and sincerity. Kevin Hart is the ranter the lover the best friend the short-fuse firecracker always just a spark away from exploding. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Hes not just one of the best and most bankable of Hollywoods comedy stars. Hes the rare go-for-broke movie comic to master the incompatible demands of movie comedy itself. He goes too far works blue as hell rants in that scraping outraged shout of his the syllables spat with a rappers force and bounce. But then when the professionally plotted studio features he stars in need us to feel good at the end he can move and charm us somehow without betraying the spirit of the dirty/funny/truth-spewing marvel we paid to see.Contrast that with a Will Ferrell a Melissa McCarthy a Groucho. These performers scorch through the reality of any movie that holds them which would be great if those movies endings didnt then insist that these comics society-destroying characters were actually goodhearted everyday mensches. The monstrous Ron Burgundy suddenly deserves Veronica Corningstones love? Larcenous idiot Tammy has somehow gotten her life together? Anarchist Otis P. Driftwood gives a shit about those boring lovers?Film Details The Wedding Ringer RatingR GenreComedy Running Time101 More Info Trailer Harts conman at the end of The Wedding Ringer learns all the usual lessons. Friendship matters. Honesty matters. That he should open up to that nice girl who sees through his ruses. But Hart the actor who always seems twice as smart as anyone else on the screen with him actually sells all this makes us feel the truths beneath the cliches. He never undercuts the material or suggests he knows its hokey. More importantly he makes all this funny -- the imp of the first reels doesnt seem housebroken by the rediscovery of his decency in the last ones.The Wedding Ringer is a farce predicated on his characters dazzling deceptions but Harts performance at the climax when those lies collapse corresponds to everything that audiences loved at the start as he first spun them. Theres that same put-on cocksureness the linguistic fireworks the fast talk he hides behind like the fleshy necks those lizards flare up to confound predators the sense that his character however collected is always just barely swallowing back the impulse to shout ""Tittays"" Harts conmans heart gets laid bare and Hart gets funnier.The movie itselfs not masterful. In the first scenes the rhythm of Harts ravings seems dictated by quick cuts rather than the comics timing. Also disappointing The filthiest set piece involving a dog licking peanut butter off a penis is too filthy for the R rating so the film haplessly suggests the act and its vague complications leaving us to guess at whats happening as the scene descends into something like shock horror. But Harts great and the premise is the best for a crowd-pleasing comedy since The To-Do List. Hart plays Jimmy Callahan whose cynical hustle makes the best possible use of the stars charisma Jimmy rents himself out as a best man for grooms who cant find one offering a glittering toast a brilliant charm offensive and -- this goes unstated in the film -- the chance for well-heeled white guys to be honored in public by the coolest of black BFFs.The script airs some notions about the rarity of close male friendships and of many mens reluctance to speak with intimacy about each others lives but it shies away from the richer subtext the idea of black hipness -- and black approval -- as a high-dollar commodity.Josh Gad stars as the friendless stiff betrothed to a beautiful non-entity embodied by Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting. (Her roles about three basements below thankless.) Gads wealthy schmoe starts as the sorriest case Callahan has ever seen He needs not just a best man but seven groomsmen all for a wedding coming up in a week. Cue up much amusing jabber about the rules of faking camaraderie about the lies people tell in speeches at weddings about how to change the subject when talking to family. Hart rattles on part entrepreneur part devilish huckster part parody of Will Smiths magic Bagger Vance caddie. Hes not teaching Gads groom how to love or live or anything -- if anything the two men slowly teach that to each other.Gads funny and dignified despite a pre-credits gag about him being so fat he shatters the desk he sits on. He and Hart get run through the bromance paces with fewer of the no-homo hangups than you might expect. An extended sequence of them dancing at a practice wedding theyve crashed is a highlight as full of grace as laughs big ol Gad leading bite-sized Hart. The script by director Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender upends some stereotypes and lets Gads character be a dance floor dynamo. Less appealingly the writers try to get away with some dimwitted gay jokes -- and then trapdoor out of the responsibility of having thrown them in. An old man calls wedding prep ""gay"" early on but hes later proven to be a horrible person. More miserable than that is the swishy wedding planner who of course turns out not to be so swishy after all -- like Callahan hes playing a part but his real self beneath the mincing is every bit a stereotype too. Almost as miserable time-killing mood-shattering sequences involving a police chase and a muddy brawling football game against Joe Namath and other old-timers.Still the grooms dumb lies to his fiancee afford Harts wedding ringer some wonderful moments my favorite being his bursts of fury upon discovering hell have to pretend to be a man named Bic Mitchum a priest no less. Hart rants Gad fidgets and together this pair barrels through the plot shaping between them a surprisingly potent friendship. On top of everything else Hart knows how to share the screen. This March hes paired up with Ferrell a great opportunity and an even greater challenge -- can he summon up such a satisfying connection with a partner who has no interest in coherence? An even better question Does Hart really need to be in a Ferrell movie or is Ferrell buying himself a ringer?

Or some awful cover band doing Kool and the Gang songs. The same is true for ""The Wedding Ringer."" Theres a fun movie in here one with a smart idea and a lot of twisted characters. There are even a couple of true catch-your-breath surprises. But then theres all this other stuff they must have felt they had to put in like a car chase a football game and a gross-out sex scene. And what could have been real starts to get by-the-numbers. Josh Gad stars as a chubby nebbish whos shocked to find his wedding to Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting fast approaching. (Shocked? Consider me flabbergasted.) The problem is he doesnt have a best man. In fact he doesnt even have a best friend. So enter Kevin Hart as his best-man-for-hire -- a smooth operator who rents himself out to friendless grooms as their chum for the ceremony. Except in this case hes going to have to be there for the whole weekend -- and provide seven rented groomsmen as well. This is a pretty good idea for a comedy and it has even more promise coming from Jeremy Garelick. He wrote ""The Break-Up"" one of the few smart surprising romantic comedies of the last 10 years; you have to think hell pull it off again here. Or at least you have to hope. But the movie keeps getting off track. Theres a pretty funny bad-taste brunch scene -- followed by a pretty unfunny bachelor party (complete with bestiality). Some good strange comedy from the motley crew of groomsmen -- and then a tired downtown car chase. Its as if every 20 pages or so someone from the studio stuck another Post-It note on the script. ""Hey you know what would be funnier here? More Hangover type stuff"" Except no it wouldnt. What would be funnier is to see more of Cuoco-Sweetings character (who instead gets a third-act revelation that comes out of nowhere). Or more barbs aimed at mating rituals. Or more fresh ideas like setting up this awful stereotyped character of a gay Latino wedding planner -- and then completely subverting it. In what used to be called ""the Jonah Hill role"" Gad is amusing and (mostly) free of the usual fat-joke grotesqueries (he even gets a scene where he gets to show off his dance moves). And Kevin Hart still one of the hardest working comics in the movies typically does whatever he can to sell a joke. But this isnt something anyone really needs to buy. Its OK itll do but -- like Harts character -- its strictly a rental. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations substance abuse strong language violence and Josh Gads stunt phallus.

KIVA REARDON Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 16 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 16 2015 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Jeremy Garelick Written by Jeremy Garelick Jay Lavender Starring Kevin Hart Josh Gad Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting Classification R Country USA Language English Love hurts but Jeremy Garelicks The Wedding Ringer is truly painful. Part of the bromance-dramedy genre (where impending heterosexual nuptials are the means for two men to fall platonically for each other) this so-called comedy unfolds with embarrassing desperation and mind-numbing vulgarity. From the writers of The Break-Up its perhaps no surprise but the real shame is how Garelick and co-writer Jay Lavender leave Kevin Hart an undeniable comedic talent in the lurch. Star of new Sony comedy The Wedding Ringer Kevin Hart gives his thoughts on the cyber-attack on the company. (Jan. 6) AP Video Video Video Kevin Hart shares his thoughts on Sony Hack Video Video Globe Styles hits and misses from the Golden Globes red carpet Katy Perry reveals that she wants to create one giant sing-along as she prepares for her performance at the Super Bowl halftime show. (Jan. 13) AP Video Video Video Katy Perry promises fun at Super Bowl halftime show The conceit of The Wedding Ringer is a probable one for Hollywood An underwhelming schlub of man Doug (Josh Gad) is marrying a svelte blonde Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting). Awestruck that a ""girl who looks like her"" even talked to him Doug is too embarrassed to confess to his fiancee that he has no friends. With only 10 days left until the big day - and Gretchens WASP parents bearing down on him to pick his wedding party - Doug decides to hire a best man. Enter Jimmy (Hart) sole proprietor of The Best Man Inc. a full-service stop for insecure man-children who cant express the realities of their personal lives to their future spouses. Or as The Wedding Ringer would put it just regular guys.Even to an expert in falsifying friendships Doug presents a challenge and requires ""the Golden Tux"" package In just more than a week Jimmy will have to train seven strangers to pass as the grooms best boyhood pals. Many exhausting dick jokes and one mud-wrestling match later the motley crew rallies behind Doug on the day of his union.But the line between friendship and business has become blurred. Jimmy is insistent his relationship with Doug should remain purely financial but pesky man-feelings start getting in the way. And what of Gretchen in all this? Naturally being a human woman whos about to become a bride shes too preoccupied with losing 4.3 pounds withholding sex from Doug and taste-testing salad dressing to note any changes in her husband-to-bes demeanour.Compensating for this lacklustre premise Garelick and Lavender pad their script with lame stunts including but not limited to accidental octogenarian immolation and sex with pets. They then pepper these ever-so-scintillating scenes with outright homophobia.In all this lowest-common-denominator humour Hart is the only cast member who elevates the material. Garelick wisely gives Hart room to take control of most scenes allowing the comedian to employ his staple breakneck pacing. At one point Hart ad libs a riff on Jimmys new alias Bic Mitchum exuding more energy than the rest of the cast combined. In another scene Jimmy gives a eulogy in character for a past client spinning a story about the trials of being the only Ethiopian Jew at Hebrew school. Delivered with deadpan seriousness Hart makes the less-than-nuanced joke funny. No one else least of all Gad who shares most scenes with Hart can keep up with the stars straight-faced and fast-paced comedy.But while Hart injects occasional life into the movie its not enough to maintain a discernible pulse. Just as Doug and Gretchen rush to the altar The Wedding Ringer rushes to its conclusion seeing Doug and Jimmy off on a ""boys trip."" As their party plane takes off for a place where male fun is predicated on causal misogyny the only thing to celebrate is that the credits are rolling.

""The Wedding Ringer"" is charmless and crass a shallow misfire that wastes the many talents of its star Kevin Hart.Hart stars as Jimmy Callahan a best-man-for-hire whose services are called upon by Doug Harris (Josh Gad). Harris is getting married in 10 days and the fact that his bride-to-be (a shrill Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) has never met a single friend of his during the course of their relationship has apparently never raised a red flag.Harris needs not only a best man but an entire wedding party a full-service package Callahan refers to as the ""Golden Tux."" So he rounds up a crew of misfits that looks like ""the cast of Goonies grew up and became rapists"" as theyre described in one of the movies few good lines. Hamhanded lessons about friendship and male bonding ensue passed on with the grace of a grandmother being set on fire one example of the movies attempts at humor.Even as the movie sputters out of control -- theres a police chase an overly aggressive football sequence and a gross-out sex gag involving a Basset Hound -- Hart is laser-focused and in-the-moment and is consistently better than everything around him.

(Matt Kennedy) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday January 16 2015 200 AM Title The Wedding Ringer Film Info With Kevin Hart Josh Gad A guy hires a rent-a-pal to be best man at his wedding. Director Jeremy Garelick (141). R Language sexuality. Area theaters. The manic energy of Kevin Hart is surprisingly toned down in ""The Wedding Ringer."" Which may account for almost the entire first half of this wannabe-raucous buddy movie being laugh-free. By the time Jeremy Garelicks movie gets to the altar it does hit a groove. But by then the humor feels like stale champagne. Hart plays Jimmy Callahan a slickster who runs a business that sets Jimmy up pretending to be the lifelong bud of a ""loser with no friends"" as he says. A sneaky wedding planner brings Callahan to the attention of doughy Doug (Josh Gad) a schlub who must make seven groomsmen and a best man materialize before his wedding one week later. That kind of oomph is a ""golden tux package"" requiring bachelor party fake slide show of the friends years of buddyhood and wedding weekend activities. Jimmy recruits some of his sketchy friends to come to Dougs rescue. As Jimmy hangs out with Doug learning all about him in order to make the toast of a lifetime he breaks one of his own rules he really becomes friends with a client. But in between teaching Doug how to be a man Jimmy has to portray a military priest named ""Bic Mitchum"" -- Doug gave his fiancee Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) that name for his best man. The lies keep on building right up to the reception. Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart) and Doug Harris (Josh Gad) in Screen Gems The Wedding Ringer a generally predictable buddy movie. (Matt Kennedy) Almost every beat of ""The Wedding Ringer"" is telegraphed including the dips into gross-out humor and the Adam Sandler-esque celeb cameos. Theres a football game with Gretchens dads pals played by Joe Namath and a team of ex-athletes. Within such a preprogrammed event Harts funny dervish energy is mostly wasted. But within the movies way-too-long running time are a few good riffs including a bachelors-day ""abduction"" of Doug that goes awry and an impromptu dance lesson Doug gives Jimmy while they crash a strangers wedding. Gad is an appealing comic actor here forced to up the irritating factor but thats also because hes straight man to Hart. The goofy dance moment gives the stocky comic actor a chance to show Belushi-esque grace. But Hart knows the movies all on his tiny shoulders and like his character he delivers in a clutch. Theres just not enough for him to do here. Still if Garelick and his cowriter Jay Lavender (""The Break-Up"") want to turn this into a franchise -- there are after all lots of social rituals that need puncturing -- they could do worse than call Hart to the mic. Here at least hes the smartest most winning guy in the room .

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr THE WEDDING RINGER Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting Kevin Hart and Josh Gad (Everett Collection) D The Wedding Ringer Genre Comedy; Starring Kaley Cuoco Josh Gad Kevin Hart; Release Date Wide 01/16/2015; Runtime (in minutes) 101; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted January 27 2015 -- 1200 AM EST If the Will Smith-Kevin James comedy Hitch didnt quite satisfy your itch to see a suave African-American man teach a rotund white dude how to hang The Wedding Ringer--the kind of desperate bro-burlesque lately found in January of each year (see That Awkward Moment)--seems happy to seize the dubious honor. The premise is summed up entirely in its trailer A schlubby career-focused groom-to-be (Josh Gad) is engaged to an out-of-his-league bombshell (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) whos unaware that he is utterly friendless. Professional best man and pal-for-hire (Kevin Hart) to the rescue Said rescue includes babes partying peanut butter retrieval via canine police evasion and additional fratty antics that The Hangover and Wedding Crashers covered many years earlier. True to this genres form you get to see at least one great actress stoop way below her standards--in this case Cloris Leachman as Cuoco-Sweetings unlucky grandmother who literally gets set on fire. The Wedding Ringer is such a crudely edited slapdash affair it often forgets about the characters it has introduced--especially the women. Chauvinism drips from this film more profusely than sweat from Hart and Gad as they try to force its tired material to work. Unless your idea of the ultimate screen comedy is to witness how many different ways a fat guy can fall down in one film youre probably better off breaking off this engagement.

And in fact theres little in the pedigree of The Wedding Ringer - the first big-stakes starring vehicle for comic-actor du jour Kevin Hart - to prepare you for the fact that its actually got some laughs in it. Theres a first-time director (Jeremy Garelick) whose previous writing credit was the Vince Vaughn/Jennifer Aniston alleged comedy The Break-Up. (Vaughn and Owen Wilson were originally slated to star). And theres a TV star (The Big Bang Theorys Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) looking to trade sitcom stardom for romantic comedy cred. But despite all this - and despite tone-deaf trailers that could scare away ticket-buyers - The Wedding Ringer is a soft-hearted bromance albeit one dotted with moments of surprisingly out-there bad taste. Such as? Uh well theres this party and a hooker and a dog... ah never mind. Also an old person is immolated. Blame/credit The Hangover for re-setting the bar of taste for wedding movies. What saves The Wedding Ringer is two talented leading men Hart and Broadway veteran Josh Gad (The Book of Mormon) who play off each other like longtime stage partners and a plot thats just this side of believable. Gad plays Doug a nerdy guy whos overjoyed that hes about to marry Gretchen the kind of hot babe whod have looked right through him in high school. (This is of course training-wheels acting for Cuoco-Sweeting who has spent hundreds of hours of screen time on TBBT playing the hot babe nerdy guys drool over). Trouble is Doug has no actual male friends and has been lying about it. On the verge of being exposed he is directed to the slick Jimmy Callahan (Hart) a natural hustler who has focused his skills on a singular con. He is a best-man for hire who depending on the booking can be Jewish a priest a childhood friend or a guy whose life was saved by the groom. To Jimmy Doug represents (you should pardon the expression) the great white whale. Or rather ""the Golden Tuxedo"" a complete fiction with fake best man and groomsmen and a plausible backstory for each. Considering that Jimmy is choosing his actors from among the ranks of fellow con artists and convicted criminals its clear the elaborate ruse is shaky at best. With echoes of the Will Smith movie Hitch a real friendship is forged as the ""player"" discovers his own life may be as pitiable as that of the ""losers"" he services. Gad is a puppy dog who finds his spine and their dual arcs mesh nicely (amid okay a certain amount of drug use alcohol and puking). Theres a randomness to The Wedding Ringers set pieces. Some work well (Hart and Gad dance very well together). Others like an impromptu touch football game with Joe Namath John Riggins and Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones seem utterly gratuitous but are still kind of fun. The Wedding Ringer is not award season bait and definitely not a family film. But that was real laughter I heard in the theatre and the movie doesnt drag things out until the honeymoon is over.

"Wedding Ringer The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wedding-ringer-the ) Wedding Ringer The (United States 2015) January 15 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Kevin Hart may be the next great raunchy comedian movie star - a high-energy performer capable of juggling drama and comedy while following in the footsteps of Robin Williams Eddie Murphy Jamie Foxx and others. If thats the case The Wedding Ringer isnt the best showcase for Harts capabilities - its an uninspired middle-of-the-road comedy that never challenges expectations - but it is an opportunity for him to step out of ensemble territory and play the undisputed lead. In a way its a reversal of roles from the 2014 film Ride Along in which he played the subordinate in a buddy situation with Ice Cube. Here hes the top dog and Josh Gad is the follower. The premise is mercifully uncomplicated Hart plays Jimmy Callahan a.k.a. ""The Wedding Ringer."" For a fee hell play the role of the best man for any groom. The usual package includes spending the entire day with the wedding party giving the Best Mans toast etc. For additional money he can participate in activities beyond the ceremony including arranging the Bachelors Party. Doug Harris (Josh Gad) presents a challenge for Jimmy not only does he want the works but he needs seven groomsmen. This is the holy grail of the business - the so-called ""Golden Tuxedo."" Then a couple of things happen along Jimmys road to earning 50K he comes to genuinely like Doug and Doug begins to wonder whether his intended Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) is ""the one."" As assembled by first-time director Jeremy Garelick The Wedding Ringer gets off to a rocky start. The first half-hour is dramatically inert and comedically anemic. Eventually however it hits its stride. Harts charisma begins to shine through the miasma of a less-than-stellar screenplay. The humor starting with a flare-up featuring Cloris Leachman starts to provoke the kinds of belly laughs we expect from this sort of movie. The ""bromance"" between Jimmy and Doug clicks. The Wedding Ringer never develops into a great movie but it achieves a level of entertainment few would suspect based on its inauspicious beginning. As might be expected from an R-rated comedy made in 2015 the humor is frequently profane and theres the seemingly obligatory scene of a mans (prosthetic) genitalia being exposed to something unpleasant. However although the comedy occasionally creeps close to the level of The Hangover it usually backs away stabilizing more in National Lampoons Vacations range. The Cloris Leachman incident is an example as is a football game pitting a group of old-school brutes against Dougs fake best friends. Theres some funny material and not all is unapologetically rude. It has been remarked that one differentiator of Judd Apatows comedies from those of his peers is the ""heart"" he brings to his projects. Some of that ""heart"" can be found here. Garelick Hart and Gad invest the necessary effort to establish the burgeoning friendship between Jimmy and Doug as more than a throw-away plot element and it goes a long way toward making The Wedding Ringer watchable. The scene in which Jimmy realizes hes not all that different from ""loser"" Doug is surprisingly poignant. Like most films dumped into theaters in January The Wedding Ringer is imperfect but its imperfections are tolerable because theyre accompanied by a dollop of drama a measure of laughter and an oversized helping of Kevin Hart.

Credit Matt Kennedy/Screen Gems Jimmy Callahan the professional best man of ""The Wedding Ringer"" warns his client more than once that theirs is strictly a business relationship. No actual friendship is intended or implied as Jimmy (Kevin Hart) fills the role of best bud for the self-described yutz Doug Harris (Josh Gad) before and during his wedding for whom he also assembles a team of degenerate groomsmen.The mutual obligations of a business relationship might occur to you too when you pay to see a movie that is technically a comedy with all the pointlessly foul language racial and gender stereotypes stammering and canine penis-biting that apparently were supposed to want to see in raunchy movies about pathetic grooms. Mr. Hart tells wild tales Mr. Gad is humiliated and most everyone else gets to dish out or receive abuse. But the laughs are not a sure thing.The director Jeremy Garelick who wrote the script with Jay Lavender takes the shortest route whenever possible which usually means a gratuitous insult. Theres some cynical fun in Mr. Harts faked wedding speeches though thats not exactly fresh material. Among the diligently hurried scenes the gratifyingly ordinary Mr. Gad pipes up with some well-timed mild asides.Jimmys role-playing drives home the theme that people arent always what they pretend to be especially when theres money to be made. The point is also made that rubes are only given the hackneyed fantasies they want anyway even if theyre harmful or offensive. Thats certainly one perspective but then theres no need to buy into it.Rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for crude and sexual content language throughout some drug use and brief graphic nudity.

Not since Wild Hogs perhaps has a comedy so repeatedly insisted that theres nothing funnier than the thought of two men touching each other. Over the next 100 minutes or so there will be jokes about prison rape about guys giving blowjobs for drug money and about straight dudes dancing with other straight dudes sometimes cheek to cheek. There will also be a loudly effeminate wedding planner who turns out to be ""flaming up"" to earn more business and a montage of photos from various nuptials that will end for extra amusing punctuation with an image of kissing grooms. The Wedding Ringer has so many gay jokes that some of them apparently didnt even make the final cut; one gag from the TV spots in which an old woman compliments ""those gays"" on their fancy footwork isnt actually in the movie. Dont worry there are plenty of comparable bits to fill the void.This is business as usual for the bromantic comedy a genre that believes in the transcendent power of male friendship but not so much so that it doesnt feel the need to beat the audience to the gay-panic punch. (Lest anyone mistake the platonic love between two bros as more than platonic there are tons of jokes to make the distinction clear.) The Wedding Ringer which casts Kevin Hart as a best-man-for-hire and Josh Gad as the friendless dweeb who acquires his services draws on many of the last decades worst comedy cliches. To be fair it may technically predate them The project was conceived as early as 2001 years before many of the movies it unflatteringly resembles--including Wedding Crashers Hitch and I Love You Man--hit theaters. The films attitudes about men and women however feel at least as old as early 90s sitcoms. Set aside for the moment the endless tittering about guy-on-guy contact and this is also a movie that believes that a wedding is only ""her day"" to be dutifully endured by the patient hubby.The Wedding Ringers ace in the hole is clearly Hart who signed on shortly before his career went supernova. He gets a stars introduction at least The camera follows a plate of fancy appetizers through the kitchen and out onto the dancefloor of a rooftop reception finally landing on the comedian mid-boogie like a spotlight. Hart plays Jimmy a professional faux-BFF who earns his keep as wedding-party wingmen to those lacking in close mates. One such ""loser"" as Jimmy calls them is Doug (Gad) an awkward nice guy whos been lying to his bossy wife-to-be (The Big Bang Theorys Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting tossed a thankless bridezilla role) about a best friend he doesnt have. Hired to play imaginary army priest Bic Mitchum--the name is later explained in a faintly amusing Usual Suspects spoof--Jimmy assembles a team of Sandler-esque misfits to play Dougs groomsmen schooling his team on the finer points of sustaining an enormous lie.As contrived sitcom premises go its not so awful and theres some humor to be had in the way Jimmy runs his enterprise--committing phony details to memory staging photos of old adventures using verbal misdirection to dodge a hard line of questioning. But Hart for all his inspired braggadocio doesnt really convince as a chameleon; hes just not the type of guy who could slip easily into whatever ""role"" Jimmy might be charged with occupying and so many of the gags simply hinge on the supposed hilarity of the fast-talking cut-up from Ride Along pretending to be a man of God. Rather than forcing the two stars to bluff their way through lots of high-wire social situations The Wedding Ringer just kills time with low-aiming pratfalls a bachelor-party gone wrong a pointless car chase an equally pointless football game. Gad for his part seems to be positioning himself as a millennial answer to Chris Farley or Kevin James. In other words he falls down a lot.The heart of this rancid buddy comedy should be the burgeoning friendship between Doug who has no male companions and Jimmy who has only fake ones. But the two never build much of a rapport; their inevitable bromance feels as phony as the manufactured one they present to Dougs future in-laws. That could be because Hart whos as mercenary as his character and Gad whos just going through the slapstick motions fail to generate any co-star chemistry. On the other hand maybe its just that theyre headlining a salute to male bonding thats terrified of male bonding. For the filmmakers any genuine show of affection between two men may be too close for comfort to ""really fucking gay.""

"Review Kevin Hart-Josh Gad chemistry highlights The Wedding Ringer - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Kevin Hart-Josh Gad chemistry highlights The Wedding Ringer Wedding Ringer Matt Kennedy / Sony Pictures Jimmy (Kevin Hart) right with Doug (Josh Gad) in Screen Gems ""The Wedding Ringer."" Jimmy (Kevin Hart) right with Doug (Josh Gad) in Screen Gems ""The Wedding Ringer."" (Matt Kennedy / Sony Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Kevin Hart and Josh Gad have chemistry in the otherwise stale The Wedding Ringer Its not quite a match made in heaven but there is considerable comic chemistry between the high-octane Kevin Hart and the energy-conserving Josh Gad. A good thing since theirs is the only relationship worth watching in ""The Wedding Ringer.""There sure isnt much going on between Doug (Gad) and his intended Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting). Doug readily admits shes out of his league. She seems to agree as does Ed (Ken Howard) her domineering dad. End of story. Making matters worse Doug is a prickly blend of loser and loner and the bride has a bevy of maids in need of groomsmen. His pockets however are lined. Enter Jimmy Callahan/Bic (Hart) the entrepreneurial wedding solver and his booming business Best Man Inc.In very short order Jimmy promises Doug the wedding of his dreams. It does however require pulling off a complicated maneuver dubbed ""the golden tux."" Eight faux groomsmen each with their own identity and back story head into Jimmys boot camp for training. Meanwhile the best man must become ""Bic"" the best friend Dougs been telling Gretchen about an Army priest stationed in the Middle East whos flying back for the wedding. Its a crazy conceit and Hart tackles it with his signature style a kind of comic scatting delivered at lightning speed. Watching him sweet-talk his way out of one dilemma after another offers a little redemption. But too often the ""Wedding Ringer"" looks like a hodgepodge of ""Hitch"" ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Bridesmaids"" -- something borrowed something blue and all of it half-baked. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Director Jeremy Garelick and co-writer Jay Lavender the duo who penned the more engaging Vince Vaughn-Jennifer Aniston comedy ""The Break-Up"" a few years ago do have good instincts when it comes to playing the relationship card. It makes for some good moments between Doug and Jimmy as their business relationship becomes increasingly personal.But too often the filmmakers go for cheap shots. Cuoco-Sweeting who plays dimwitted but street smart adorable in the long-running CBS hit ""The Big Bang Theory"" is really unlikable in ""Wedding."" The bride is clearly supposed to be the villain. But borderline boring is a waste of her time and ours. Trailer The Wedding Ringer | Jan. 16 A successful but socially awkward groom-to-be enlists a best-man-for-hire to fill out his half of the bridal party. With Kevin Hart Josh Gad and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting. A successful but socially awkward groom-to-be enlists a best-man-for-hire to fill out his half of the bridal party. With Kevin Hart Josh Gad and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting. See more videos Its nice however to see Hart given a character with a little more heart. And a relief to see his frenzy dialed down. Gads silly self-deprecating slowness a comic style that helped make ""Frozens"" Olaf such a snowy superstar encourages Hart to take a breath too. His comedy is better for it. Before the bromance begins in earnest the filmmakers want us to see what Jimmy does best. His wedding toast at one event after another is flawless -- tear-jerking personal heartfelt. It basically serves to give the comic a range of disguises to toy with.The crew of guys Jimmy rounds up to play Dougs friends all have dual names and identities. The lineup includes Reggie/Drysdale (Affion Crockett) Lurch/Garvey (Jorge Garcia) Bronstein/Dickerson (Dan Gill) Otis/Alzado (Corey Holcomb) Fitzgibbons/Plunkett (Colin Kane) Kip/Carew (Alan Ritchson) Endo/Rambis (Aaron Takahashi) Edmundo/Dirty Eddie Sanchez (Ignacio Serricchio). It doesnt take long before the lines between them begin to blur.The more Doug hangs with the guys the more he likes them. And the less he likes Gretchens dad. The tension comes to a head during a muddy and brutal touch football game between Dougs pretend posse and Eds old cronies. Its only reason for being is one fun cameo and that is not reason enough.The film lives in two worlds -- the buttoned up one of the proper Gretchen and the fun house ride of Jimmys. He works out of a basement room at the back of a carnival the locale providing a surreal and slightly wacky backdrop of batting cages and bumper cars. To keep up with the ongoing antics requires director of photography Bradford Lipson to be constantly on the move.Meanwhile the soundtrack has to work overtime to fill up the dead spaces when a scene goes stale. Christopher Lennertz who oversaw music created a kitschy mix of old standards like ""Its Only a Paper Moon"" wedding staples like ""Titanics"" ""My Heart Will Go On"" and wild dance jams like Kid Rocks ""Bawitdaba."" Its a keeper; little else about ""The Wedding Ringer"" is.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------The Wedding RingerMPAA rating R for crude and sexual content language throughout some drug use and brief graphic nudityRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Marriage Weddings Josh Gad Kevin Hart The Wedding Ringer Kevin Hart Five movie roles you probably forgot about Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-wedding-ringer-20150116-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,theweddingringer17,theweddingringer,latimes
The Wedding Ringer bromance deserves no love review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Wedding Ringer bromance deserves no love review Kevin Hart and Josh Gad team for disjointed bromantic comedy The Wedding Ringer.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 15 2015The Wedding RingerStarring Kevin Hart Josh Gad and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting. Directed by Jeremy Garelick. 101 minutes. Opening Friday Jan. 15 at major theatres. 14A Kevin Hart (Top Five) and Josh Gad (Frozen) team for disjointed bromantic comedy The Wedding Ringer which squeezes out some weak laughs amid alternating scenes of gross behaviour and sickly sweet male bonding confessionals.Hart pulling back from his typical frantic delivery is slick operator Jimmy Callahan CEO of Best Man Inc. a company that provides wedding day wingman services for the friendless.Article Continued BelowGads portly sad sack Doug Harris certainly fits the bill. He hires Callahan to fill out his side of the wedding party and play Bic Mitchum his imaginary best friend from college. Jimmy constantly reminds Doug that there can be no ongoing relationship with this man for hire no matter how sincere his public speeches about their friendship sound.Josh Gad left and Kevin Hart play groom and fake best man in The Wedding Ringer.The search for a best man concept which worked so well with 2009s sharp and funny I Love You Man falls into lesser hands with writing team Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender (Garelick also directs). The resulting grab bag of gags including setting grandma on fire (poor Cloris Leachman has it come to this?) and one involving a Basset Hound a hooker and peanut butter signal increasing desperation.Bride-to-be Gretchen (The Big Bang Theorys Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) gets slotted into the Bridezilla role while Jenifer Lewis fares much better onscreen as Jimmys tart-tongued assistant Doris.Still theres a glimmer of chemistry between the two leads. Gad (co-star of Broadways Book of Mormon) is the better actor of the two but makes room for Hart in an appealing dance floor mash-up that shows what The Wedding Ringer could have been.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Matt Kennedy (c) 2014 Screen Gems Inc. MOVIE REVIEW The Wedding Ringer Running time 121 minutes. Rated R (nudity language drugs). Now playing. ""The Wedding Ringer"" is not so much a rom-com as an anatomy lesson. And the lesson is this Men have balls. They must have them or grow them otherwise they are not men. They are little girls. And little girls are stupid. They grow up into women who subsist primarily on disingenuous compliments from men and fantasies about the perfect wedding day. Chief ball-haver in this pandering flick from first-time feature director Jeremy Garelick is Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart) a smooth talker whos managed to parlay his skill at giving a toast into a business Best Man Inc. For a steep fee hell pretend hes your long-lost best friend and deliver a wedding reception speech thatll have your bride and all her gullible friends and family members shedding tears of joy. His new client is Doug (Josh Gad) a sweaty beta male whos just realizing after proposing to his shallow but hot girlfriend (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) that he doesnt have a single friend he can ask to be a groomsman. So hell pay Jimmy big bucks for his premiere package the Golden Tux. Cue the assembly of Jimmys low-life buddies to play the part of Dougs group of friends; theyre a motley bunch who reminded me a bit of the comedy ""Old School"" except with lots of gags about prison rape and stuttering (the one guy with model-good looks has a speech impediment which is played for laughs ad nauseam). Photo Matt Kennedy (c) 2014 Screen Gems Inc.Meanwhile Jimmy -- his best-man persona named ""Bic Mitchum"" after random objects in Dougs medicine cabinet -- meets the brides family whose patriarch (Ken Howard) is introduced delivering this bon mot ""Does anyone else feel really f - - king gay right now?"" His skin is crawling you see because of the proximity of the brides flamboyant wedding planner (Ignacio Serricchio) who is clearly a fan of balls but not in the right way. The get-to-know-you brunch with the brides family ends with Grandma (poor Cloris Leachman) getting set on fire. And later Doug gets an intimate tongue bath from a basset hound at his bachelor party. Gad and Hart have one brief moment of transcending this film when they take to the dance floor on a practice run for the wedding. Doug may not have balls but he does have dance moves -- and in a weird counterweight to the many gay slurs in this movie this couple lights up the screen as they tango. Hart is such a skilled comic -- his lightning-fast riffs are almost always funny even when theyre in the midst of hateful dreck like this -- that I cant believe he cant talk his way into better material. Forget weddings. This guy needs an Agent Ringer.

On the scale of Kevin Hart vehicles its not up to the standards of ""Think Like a Man"" and ""About Last Night"" -- but hey at least its better than ""Ride Along"" or ""Think Like a Man Too."" The screenplay by Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender offers up an intriguing premise and some truly unpredictable comedy misdirects but you can feel the gears grinding in the third act when characters start doing 180s so the story can go in one particular direction. ""Ringer"" sets you up to expect a comedy thats homophobic but not misogynistic; that it delivers the opposite counts as a surprise albeit not an entirely satisfying one. See Video Kevin Hart Is the Best Thing to Happen to Josh Gad in The Wedding Ringer Trailer (Video) Hart stars as Jimmy Callahan a professional best man who offers his services up to friendless grooms who need a surrogate pal to schmooze the in-laws make a killer toast and generally fulfill the duties that would ordinarily be handled by an actual buddy. (Is this a thing? Who are all these adult men with no friends and how are they finding spouses? And doesnt this whole plot smack of ""I Love You Man""?) Jimmys latest client is tax attorney Doug (Josh Gad ""Frozen"") whos marrying Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting ""The Big Bang Theory"") in a week and a half. Between familial obligations and a need for seven groomsmen Jimmy must pull off his first-ever ""Golden Tux"" package. Jimmy frequently reminds Doug that they arent really friends and that their relationship will end when the honeymoon starts but naturally bro-for-hire Jimmy turns out to be just as lonely as Doug; whether or not these two will stay chums after Dougs final payment turns out to be the real dramatic thrust of ""The Wedding Ringer."" And that would be fine except that its hard to take this one relationship seriously when everything else in the movie is such a cartoon -- which in turn would be fine if said cartoon were funnier. There are definitely some gags that land including a visit Jimmy and Doug pay to another wedding thats so hilarious it wont be spoiled here but much of the humor lacks inspiration or zest. See Video Kevin Hart Falls in Love With Aidy Bryant During SNL Promos (Video) First-time director Garelick sometimes undercuts promising ideas through his lack of skill; for instance theres a scene where Gretchens blowhard father Ed (Ken Howard) challenges Doug and the groomsmen to a friendly game of touch football which turns out to be a ruthless muddy throwdown because Eds friends happen to be NFL alums like Joe Namath. After getting creamed by the old guys Jimmy rallies the ersatz groomsmen to fight back but the sequence is filmed and edited so haphazardly that we never see much of what could have been outrageous physical comedy. Hart once again outshines his material; hes too often funnier and smarter than the scripts he accepts and one can only wonder what acting heights hed hit if paired with filmmakers at his level. Even with what hes working with here however he brings his A-game often apparently creating moments out of thin air. (The scene in which Jimmy tries his fake name ""Bic Mitchum"" on for size has a just-keep-the-camera-rolling feel to it and while that kind of improv can be deadly in some comedies here it provides a needed jolt.) See Video Wedding Ringer Stars Kevin Hart Josh Gad Crash Real Wedding Give Awesome Speech (Video) Gad is game if a bit one-note and its fun to see old pros like Howard Cloris Leachman and Jenifer Lewis even if theyre barely given anything to do. Also criminally underused is Olivia Thirlby as Gretchens sister who figures out that Jimmy isnt who he claims to be even if that revelation never leads anywhere interesting. Ultimately the movie feels like the kind of wedding band that can play a handful of tunes pretty well but by the end you wish theyd just leave the stage already. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Jimmy (Kevin Hart left) plays the best-man-for-hire for groom Doug (Josh Gad) in the raunchy and very funny ""The Wedding Ringer."" Photo Matt Kennedy / McClatchy-Tribune News Service Wedding Ringer review A bromantic comedy that goes there 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""The Wedding Ringer"" is a raunchy rude bromance in which pretty much every character is putting up a front. The film is so wildly un-PC its sure to annoy many some with reasonable arguments. But whether gleefully treading where fools rush in or subjecting characters to surprising harm for laughs the thing is funny at times very funny. Josh Gads Doug is an everyman with no friends who hires Kevin Harts professional best man Jimmy to make him look good at his wedding unbeknownst to his ultra-high-maintenance bride-to-be. The usual farcical complications follow but the movie has fun with those conventions rather than getting trapped by them. The films delight in playing with stereotypes and calling out genre tropes is downright refreshing. Thats not to make ""Ringer"" out to be revolutionary (although director and co-writer Jeremy Garelick did do an uncredited rewrite on the breath-of-fresh-air first ""Hangover""). The major plot movements are clearly telegraphed and the whole wedding con-job thing has been touched on in such films as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""My Best Friends Wedding."" In ""Ringer"" the absurd behavior unexpectedly savage stunts and one of the better bonding dance sequences youll see elevate the film. The hot name is Hart and the rising star delivers slickly fabricating on a dime. Gad is more than a straight man fearlessly throwing his body around and fretting his way to an awakening. The film is unabashedly guy-centric so Dougs fiancee played by Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting is written into a corner with a one-dimensional part. The great Cloris Leachman may seem wasted in a tiny role but as one would expect she gets the most out of every take. ""Ringers"" secret weapon is the Screw-Up Squad that makes up the groomsmen hired for the hoity-toity nuptials. The scenes of recruiting the motley bag of weirdos call to mind a dirtbag ""Oceans 11."" ""It looks like the entire cast of Goonies grew up and became"" criminals says a mortified Doug. That bunch of bananas includes one who looks like Peter Sarsgaards even sketchier brother (Dan Gill) and a handsome dim explosive stutterer (Alan Ritchson). Aaron Takahashi and Jorge Garcia of ""Lost"" even re-enact a sliver of a scene from ""Titanic."" Respect is not something viewers will find much of in ""The Wedding Ringer"" nor propriety nor any of those things that make for respectable family viewing. Its just a funny impolite very not-for-kids romp that goes there. Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer. Twitter michaelordona The Wedding Ringer Comedy. Stars Kevin Hart and Josh Gad.

Daily Edition Login to download The Wedding Ringer Film Review 900 AM PST 1/15/2015 by Jon Frosch FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Been there done that (better before) TWITTER Kevin Hart and Josh Gad play a best-man-for-hire and a groom in need in this bawdy bromance The first version of the script for The Wedding Ringer a new comedy about a friendless schlub who rents a best man for his big day was written back in 2002 -- a fact that partly accounts for the whiff of stale leftovers that hangs over the movie from start to finish. Several films have indeed been there done that -- or variations of that -- in the 12 years since. Bridesmaids and The Hangover all but redefined the pre-marriage debauchery sub-genre the former with its sharply drawn characters and refreshing all-female twist the latter with its anarchic bravado and (sometimes) winning shamelessness. I Love You Man was a knowing and ripely funny take on platonic man love. And in Hitch Will Smith played a smooth-talking dating guru who helps a hapless white guy get the girl. But a certain derivative deja-vu quality isnt the only sin this lazy numbingly routine very occasionally amusing comedy commits. An odd-couple bromance spiked with gross-out humor of a mainly unimaginative sort The Wedding Ringer largely fails to accomplish its most basic mission making us laugh. Still a welcoming release slot over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend coupled with the presence of stand-up star Kevin Hart (most recently seen as Chris Rocks agent in Top Five) could give the movie a big boost at the box office. Read more Kevin Hart on Bill Cosby Avoiding Controversy and How Sony Apologized for ""Whore"" Comment Directed by Jeremy Garelick from a screenplay he wrote with Jay Lavender (the two formerly penned Jennifer Aniston-Vince Vaughn rom com The Break-Up) The Wedding Ringer opens with Doug (Josh Gad) nervously cold calling potential best men in preparation for his upcoming nuptials to Gretchen (The Big Bang Theorys Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting). Alas Doug is soft-spoken and overweight which in testosterone-drunk comedies like this one means that he has no friends. Soon enough hes employing professional best man Jimmy Callahan (Hart) and a rag-tag team of groomsmen each of whom is an ostensibly yuk-worthy ""type"" the Fat Guy (played by Jorge Garcia of Lost fame) the Asian (Aaron Takahashi) the Redneck the Beefcake (with a stutter -- even funnier) etc. etc. As Doug and his homies-for-hire get acquainted were treated to a variety of gags including a boy getting hit in the gut with a baseball and a man breaking his own arm for show as well as jokes about rape child molestation and testicular deformities. Politically incorrect lowest-common-denominator comedy and body horror humor can be sublime -- see the best of those wildly erratic Farrelly brothers -- when the timing is sharp and the staging inspired. But here almost everything feels anemic. Dumb and Dumber To to cite the brothers most recent (and overzealously maligned) film for all its shortcomings committed much more fully to its forehead-slapping idiocy earning heartier laughs than anything in The Wedding Ringer. Garelick and Lavender consistently flirt with outrageousness without ever going all the way. Even a bachelor party set piece in which the term ""service dog"" is given stomach-turning new meaning (peanut butter lovers be warned) feels half-hearted and half-thought-out; you giggle because of the situations bullying perversity not because the execution is actually funny. Slightly more amusing are some of the interactions between Doug and his future in-laws thanks in large part to the skill of good actors slumming for a paycheck Ken Howard as Gretchens macho dad Mimi Rogers as her tightly wound mom Olivia Thirlby as her too-cool-for-school younger sister and a sadly underused Cloris Leachman as her loopy grandma. If the movie has a high point its surely the family dinner sequence that devolves into total chaos culminating in Granny going up in flames. Moments like that one as well as another that finds Doug and Jimmy hitting the dance floor at a wedding -- breaking out moves ranging from hip hop to disco to Charleston with incongruous flair -- momentarily breathe some much-needed comic life into The Wedding Ringer. Too bad its not enough for Doug and Jimmy to have fun; theyre forced to learn something in the process too as suggested by the perfunctory heart-to-hearts the two have in the films third act acoustic guitars strumming in the background. Hart offers a more restrained spin on his usual high-pitched high-strung persona but the role is essentially watered-down shtick; the manic swagger he brought to last years About Last Night remake and even his endearingly yappy wannabe cop in another slapdash buddy flick Ride Along were more compelling. Meanwhile Gad (who voiced Olaf in Frozen played a sex addict in Thanks for Sharing and Zach Braffs neer-do-well brother in Wish I Was Here) isnt given much to do except look dim and dejected the neutered straight man to Harts neutered real-life cartoon. Some of the supporting players like Ignacio Serricchio as a gay wedding planner who isnt quite what he seems and Jenifer Lewis as Harts assistant add some oomph to the proceedings. Visually Garelick doesnt attempt much -- graceless shot/reverse-shots abound -- though an opening sequence in which the camera snakes its way through a crowd of wedding guests dancing with diligent enthusiasm has some panache. The filmmakers also insert winks at E.T. Rudy and The Usual Suspects -- futile flourishes that only serve to remind us of better movies. The rather obvious lesson here is that in the age of Apatow and his cronies it takes more than fat dudes dick jokes and dogs with wandering tongues to make us guffaw in spite of ourselves. Frankly weve seen it all before.

The sweet-and-salty chemistry of Josh Gad and Kevin Hart is good for a few yuks in ""The Wedding Ringer"" a well-cast but clumsily assembled buddy-for-hire comedy that increasingly smacks of desperation as it approaches its big-day climax. Its not that theres anything wrong in theory with setting Cloris Leachman on fire or showing a guy getting fellated by a dog but these and other sub-""Hangover"" hijinks feel like over-the-top distractions from an otherwise predictably earnest tale of a big-hearted loner in need of some bromance en route to the altar. The ever-popular Hart scored a January 2014 smash with ""Ride Along"" and if this Screen Gems item doesnt hit quite the same box-office sweet spot it could nevertheless pop a few champagne corks in Sonys beleaguered executive suites. Hart previously played a best man in last summers ""Think Like a Man Too"" and he mercifully embodies a less manic more toned-down version of that role here. Thats because his Jimmy Callahan is a consummate professional -- a last resort for those socially inept testosterone-deficient grooms who dont have enough close guy friends to round out a proper bridal party. Pay Jimmy handsomely enough and hell throw you a crazy Vegas weekend find you a few groomsmen and give you a best-man toast to remember crammed with fake tears and made-up memories -- all before making off into the night with your money in his pocket and one of the more attractive wedding guests on his arm. His latest and most difficult client is the nice likable but improbably friendless Doug Harris (Gad) whos desperate to find a best man just 10 days before his marriage to Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting). Enter Jimmy -- or rather enter Bic Mitchum Dougs fictitious best friend a U.S. military priest whos been ministering overseas and has just flown in for the impending nuptials. Gretchen being a spoiled blonde princess with hard-to-please parents (Ken Howard Mimi Rogers) and no fewer than seven bridesmaids Jimmy/Bic is also tasked with pulling off what is referred to in best-man-industry parlance as a ""Golden Tux."" Basically that means hiring a bunch of losers and layabouts -- including an ex-con (Colin Kane) a hunky doofus (Alan Ritchson) and a guy with three testicles (Aaron Takahashi) -- and training them to masquerade as Dougs groomsmen all without giving the game away. The usual adolescent-horndog shenanigans ensue involving all manner of random highly exaggerated comic violence Not surprisingly canine sex act turns out to be the most ill-advised of Dougs bachelor-party highlights (dogs have teeth after all) while the fate of Gretchens grandmother (Leachman) seems to emerge from no particular comic motivation beyond ""Old people are funny And flammable"" In perhaps the most vigorous sequence attempted by debuting feature helmer Jeremy Garelick (who co-wrote the script with Jay Lavender) Dougs future father-in-law challenges the groom-to-be and his ""friends"" to an epically muddy football game shot and edited in only slightly more incoherent slammed-together fashion than the rest of the movie. The modest pleasures of ""The Wedding Ringer"" come from seeing Hart not just run his always-impressive motormouth but deftly maneuver his way through a minefield of potential giveaways -- a challenge that forces the actor-comedian to focus and deliver a shrewder less obnoxious more slyly modulated performance than usual. Gad best known in movies for his delightful vocal turn as Olaf the snowman in ""Frozen"" proves a similarly endearing live-action screen presence and doesnt let the top-billed Hart monopolize all the gags. Its an inspired if not combustible screen pairing partly because of the duos amusingly mismatched body types -- its fun to see the heavy-set Gad dipping the diminutive Hart on the dance floor -- but also because of the movies unforced but unmistakable subtext predicated on the spectacle of a Jewish guy and his black sidekick charming their way into a lofty WASP enclave. That reading is compounded by the casting of Argentine-American actor Ignacio Serricchio as Edmundo the wedding planner a mincing gay stereotype whos like a Latino version of Martin Short in ""Father of the Bride"" -- but who in one of the scripts better gags turns out to be more complicated than he appears. That revelation dovetails nicely with the films eminently sensible message that its silly to try and impress people by putting on an elaborate masquerade -- which is in a sense what too many weddings (and the industry that supports them) have become. For all these assets ""The Wedding Ringer"" ultimately flattens out in all-too-familiar ways as it tries to convince us that Jimmy/Bic is a needy sensitive guy underneath it all relegating the Doug-Gretchen romance to an afterthought. Unsurprisingly this rowdy male-bonding exercise doesnt encourage the most enlightened view of women -- who with the exception of the always-welcome Olivia Thirlby as Gretchens shrewd sister exist mainly to be ogled abandoned or immolated as the situation demands.
