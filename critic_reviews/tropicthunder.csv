"Review Tropic Thunder has some strong laughs - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Tropic Thunder has some strong laughsStory Highlights Tom Charity ""Tropic Thunder"" doesnt always hit but when it does pow Robert Downey Jr. particularly good in Hollywood satire Films first half particularly strong though it gets repetitive Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Truly its been a summer for jokers -- and Im not just talking about ""The Dark Knight."" ""Tropic Thunder"" stars Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. as self-absorbed actors. When the bats been away Steve Carell (""Get Smart"") Will Ferrell (""Step Brothers"") and Seth Rogen (""Pineapple Express"") have all come out to play and notched up lucrative returns too. Ben Stillers sometimes hilarious ""Tropic Thunder"" is easily the biggest of the summers blockbuster comedies -- and certainly the goriest. Its a high-concept meta-movie about an all-star Vietnam War picture (also called ""Tropic Thunder"") that goes very very wrong. Stillers ""Tropic Thunder"" on the other hand gets it mostly right. Which is just as well because it looks like it cost an arm and a leg to make. The movie-within-a-movie is directed by Damian Cockburn (Steve Coogan) and stars chubby clown Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) action beefcake Tugg Speedman (Stiller) and Aussie method man Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.). The latter is a temperamental chameleon who takes his craft so seriously he has undergone skin pigmentation treatment for his role as a black GI. (Any resemblance to Russell Crowe is entirely superficial but can hardly be coincidental.) Cockburn quickly loses the trust of his ferocious potty-mouthed studio boss (in one of the films more inspired insider gags hes played by a real-life studio boss you may just recognize as Tom Cruise). So when disabled Vietnam vet ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte) -- the inspiration for the movie -- suggests dropping them into the jungle and shooting the picture with hidden digital cameras ""guerrilla-style"" it seems like a stroke of genius. That is until the stars lose contact with the outside world and find themselves in a firefight with Golden Triangle drug lords. ""Tropic Thunder"" is willing to push its gags right to the edge -- and sometimes over it. In the most famous example the film has run into flak from disabled advocates for its repeated use of the word ""retard"" referring to Speedmans previous bid for artistic respectability a sentimental ""Forrest Gump""-style Oscar bid by the name of ""Simple Jack."" Watch why several groups want to boycott the film >> Stiller does milk it but the protesters are missing the point. If theres one group who should be protesting this movie its the Screen Actors Guild. The heart-rending soul-searching consciousness-raising commitment we prize in our movie stars particularly around Oscar time -- its all beautifully travestied and lampooned. Dont Miss Tropic Thunder pushes envelope and then some An early bad-taste highlight has Tugg messing with his directors head. Literally. And the strained relationship between Alpa and Kirk -- who proves incapable of breaking out of his African-American character -- is terrifically juicy. Downeys blackface performance is an appalling mixture of Mr. T and Uncle Remus but at the same time he endows the actor with enough straight critical intelligence to appreciate the severity of their situation. The effect is simultaneously funny and a little disturbing. Lazarus is the one character who leaves an indelible impression among some overly familiar caricatures. The Asian characters in particular rightfully belong in some third-rate ""Deer Hunter"" knock-off. Which doesnt mean that ""Tropic Thunder"" -- which was written by Stiller Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen -- isnt funny. It can be scattershot even with its fairly safe targets but when it hits it hits dead-on. (Its not wildly original and outrageous though to anyone whos seen Coogan in ""Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story"" or watched the Ricky Gervais series ""Extras"" in which Stiller played himself in one episode.) iReport.com Share your thoughts on Tropic Thunder But after an hour or so the movies one big joke starts wandering around in circles and were stuck watching a painfully unfunny Jack Black flailing about in mock heroin withdrawal; Tugg reprising Simple Jack yet again; and a silly authentically B-movie climax which involves everyone shooting blanks. Still if it doesnt live up to its full potential there is more than enough to keep you smiling not least its production values. The film was photographed by John Toll who shot ""The Thin Red Line"" and he gives it a look to compete with the Vietnam movies it has in its sights (""Platoon"" especially gets a ribbing). Theres also the now-cliched 60s jukebox soundtrack to go with it. And though some of the caricatures wear thin some of the acting rises to a high level. Theres Downey of course but also Jackson and Jay Baruchels nicely gauged supporting turns and a blitzkrieg of celebrity cameos including Tobey Maguire Matthew McConaughey and Jon Voight. As for Mr. Cruise hes still the best mover and shaker in Hollywood. He should try this stuff more often. ""Tropic Thunder"" is rated R and runs 106 minutes.

By Anthony Lane Black Stiller and Downey Jr. as actors playing soldiers in ""Tropic Thunder.""   Credit ROBERT RISKO Make sure that you take your seat for ""Tropic Thunder"" in good time because all the best jokes are at the start. Before it gets under way you have to sit through the usual slew of previews and commercials and there is a delectable moment when you realize that these particular previews are not quite as usual as usual. There is one for ""Scorcher VI Global Meltdown"" and one for an immensely solemn gay-monk drama ""winner of the Beijing Film Festivals coveted Crying Monkey Award"" with a closeup of fingers interlacing around a rosary. (Its title is much too droll to give away.) The sleight of hand survives into the main feature a searing tale of courage from the Vietnam War and it goes on searing right up to the moment at which one of the actors says ""Can we cut?"" We have been here before many times. Fans of ""Day for Night"" (1973) will remember the brisk cheery ""Coupez"" with which Francois Truffaut--the director of the work but also an actor playing a director--interrupted the flow of the action. And so it is with ""Tropic Thunder"" which is one film scrunched inside another. The Vietnam movie is supposed to be a savage spectacular with a bulging budget and a trio of major stars depleted tough guy Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and drug-hazed comic lardass Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black). Viewers should enjoy themselves placing bets as to the actual Hollywood performers on whom these nightmarish figures are based; if for example the trailer that we see for Portnoys latest vehicle ""The Fatties"" brings to mind Eddie Murphys wilder excursions into fleshly humor so much the better. Also on set with them and trying in vain to corral their stampeding egos is a hapless British director named Damien (Steve Coogan). With a TV show reporting that the production is ""one month behind schedule just five days into shooting"" the head of the studio hosts a video conference to whip the film back in line. He is a doughy balding monster with big spectacles and even wider hand gestures all his power distilled into profanity a grotesque update if you will on the movie executive with the shock of white-hot hair brought to life by Rod Steiger in ""The Big Knife"" more than fifty years ago. It took me half the running time to realize who was playing this new beast and it was only his voice that triggered the recognition; I suspect that there will be gasps during the end credits as people see his name and find themselves rethinking the whole movie marvelling at what could have inspired so stiff an actor to unfurl and bounce around. Whether his performance is a success as opposed to a coup is hard to gauge so closely does it skirt embarrassment. But then wriggles of unease and the natural awkwardness of vanity at risk are very close to this movies heart. For every laugh there are two or three winces--the standard ratio for Ben Stiller who not only stars in the film but also directed it and wrote the script with Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux. These guys come from the post-punch-line generation using words not to wrap and polish a sentiment but to file a stream of reports from the borders of taste; their deepest dread is to stay in the comfort zone. At times this lures them into basic indolence as when Jack Black--the least well served of the leads in ""Tropic Thunder""--vents his exasperation by declaiming the word ""shit"" plus some of its variants over and over. It is as though modern screenwriters were minded to kill off any lingering idea that comedy bears a logical connection to elegance good riddance to Ernst Lubitsch. More vexing is the case of Robert Downey Jr. whose performance is conducted almost entirely in blackface. This is to say the least a controversial move but Stiller and his team are wise to any accusations carefully framing the insult in cooling ironies. First this is Downey the smartest actor on the block right now never holding still long enough to warrant a charge of dramatic malice. Second he is playing another actor a blond Australian narcissist and it is his decision to black up by way of thespian dedication. (""I dont drop character until I done the DVD commentary"" he says adding later ""I dont read the script the script reads me."" He sounds like Harold Bloom discussing Shakespeare.) Third his efforts complete with deep bass outbursts of what he takes to be ethnically correct cursing (""Hot damn"") are witnessed and rebuked by a genuine black actor (Brandon T. Jackson) in the troop. The over-all effect is bizarre daring you to be amused by something both brilliant and bristling with offense; if you sidle out at the end feeling half guilty at what you just conspired in then Stiller has trapped you precisely where he wants you. The one thing I am sure of amid so much uncertainty is that I wouldnt watch this movie sitting next to Spike Lee. After the dazzle of the early scenes something droops and flags in ""Tropic Thunder."" The British director is blown up by a land mine leaving his stars to fend for themselves in the jungle whereupon they are beset by real enemies--a horde of drug dealers--and forced to fight back. (Beneath the gags thats a pretty hokey development familiar from any fable of personal growth the discovery of your inner stronger self.) For a while Tugg Speedman keeps believing that he is still in character performing for hidden cameras but that conceit I noticed was quietly dropped as if the film had better things to do than fool around on the fault lines between fantasy and truth. So what are those better things? We know what kind of work the war epic tucked inside the farce was trying and failing to be but what kind of outer shell did Ben Stiller and his fellow-farceurs have in mind? As a jab at the movie business ""Tropic Thunder"" is flailing and unfocussed hardly in the league of ""The Player"" and if you want an expose of the combat movie strewn with compromise and creative sacrifice watch ""Hearts of Darkness"" (1991) about the making of ""Apocalypse Now."" The Stiller of ""Dodgeball"" left the genre of the sports melodrama in tatters but we can safely assume that the war film after this assault will live to fight another day. All that is left then for ""Tropic Thunder"" to revel in is mania. The caterwauling of the characters and the nastiness (at once silly and bloody) of the special effects leave you feeling more embattled than entertained yet no amount of gunfire and explosions in the final reel can give the film the guts of a proper action flick. Its every man for himself in every sequence as though Stiller needed to prove that movie stars--these few these unhappy few this band of bastards--were the opposite of noble warriors. If he wants to win a Crying Monkey Award hell have to do better than that. After the assault of ""Tropic Thunder"" the new Claude Chabrol movie ""A Girl Cut in Two"" looks impeccably calm and composed. Do not be deceived. This is Chabrol country where looks are no guarantee of anything and can easily kill. The girl of the title is a TV weather presenter called Gabrielle Deneige (Ludivine Sagnier). Though not always as pure as her snowy name she is innocent enough to drift into the arms of two besmirching men and end up split between them. There is Charles Saint-Denis (Francois Berleand) a respected author decades her senior who summons and savors her as he would a fine Burgundy and then leaves her drained and distraught. Then there is Paul Gaudens (Benoit Magimel) heir to a chemicals fortune and an unsavory compound of dandy cad and wacko; he has a jacket apparently woven from floral carpeting and a hair style borrowed from a British New Romantic band of the nineteen-eighties. Gabrielle is no fortune hunter so what does she see in this pair? In a way that is not Chabrols business. The heart has its reasons the reasons drive us mad and his task is to forge a style from the result. His trademarks are all there the quick elliptical scenes the unfussy fades to black and the pulse of interest that can bring a camera hastening smoothly to inspect the characters up close and personal as their feelings ignite--anger on Pauls face as he sits with a drink or despair on that of his mother (Caroline Silhol) as her immaculate manners start to crack. If anything the older people seem to attract Chabrol more despite his Charles-like fondness for young flesh; age has made them not wiser but more civilized and therefore from his point of view more corrupt. The director is seventy-eight now with almost seventy films under his belt. He remains as committed as ever to his twin duties of scourge and hedonist yet I cant help wishing that he would just once cast off his own good narrative manners--do away with the irritations of a film like ""A Girl Cut in Two"" which is never more than semi-plausible and arrange his passions as the elderly Bunuel did in ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" into shameless surreal anagrams of wit and lust. We get a welcome glimpse of them at the close of Chabrols movie when its title comes true Gabrielle really is sawn in half but only by a magician. The first cut to her soul was much the deeper.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 16 2008 Save for later Saved ""Tropic Thunder"" is a satire or to be exact a spoof about the movie business. Of course Hollywood does a pretty good job of satirizing itself even when playing it straight.The premise behind ""Tropic Thunder"" which was directed and co-written by Ben Stiller who also stars is promising. A Vietnam war epic shot in Southeast Asia spins out of control when its harried director (Steve Coogan) trying for guerrilla-style ""realism"" leads his cast and crew deep into the jungles and ends up confronting some unamused drug lords.The war movies cast includes a prime crop of prima donnas. Stillers Tugg Speedman is an action-movie superstar who is just coming off a colossal flop in which he played a mentally challenged hayseed named Simple Jack. Jeff Portnoy (a blond Jack Black) is the star of a gross-out comedy franchise called ""The Fatties."" Now he wants to be taken seriously as an actor. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) an Aussie with five Oscar wins to his credit is playing a black sergeant. In true Method fashion he dyes his skin black kinks his hair and goes full out for Ebonics. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Back in Hollywood the studio chief in charge of the production - played by Tom Cruise in prosthetic makeup that makes him look like a refugee from ""The Fatties"" - is in perpetual high dudgeon. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Tropic Thunder The motivating idea behind ""Tropic Thunder"" is simple Being in a war film is not the same thing as being in a real war. At its simplest level then ""Tropic Thunder"" is about the silliness of performers who complain about movie boot camp. So far so good. But when the soldier-actors face a real drug-manufacturing army in the Golden Triangle Stillers high concept dips low.Biting as it tries to be ""Tropic Thunder"" is mostly toothless. Its targets - Hollywood vanity Hollywood tantrums - are easy hits. Imagine if for example Stiller had staged his war epic not in Vietnam but in say Iraq or Afghanistan. The ghastliness of playacting a real-war scenario would have been brought out in full force.By making fun of the histrionics of movies like ""Platoon"" Stiller comes dangerously close to making fun of actual soldiers from an actual war. When we watch an over-the-top performer being blown up in ""Tropic Thunder"" we may want to laugh but - and this is an unintended consequence - the laughter catches in our throat. Or at least it did in mine. Stiller doesnt have the ability or perhaps ambition to make the kind of black comedy that would turn our laughter back upon itself.The one exception to this is Downeys performance as Kirk Lazarus. Can it really be that with Obamamania in full cry we now have the hottest actor of the hour in blackface? Relax. What Downey is doing is making fun of actors who go to absurd lengths to achieve ""realism."" (My favorite anecdote along these lines is from the set of ""Marathon Man"" where upon learning that his costar Dustin Hoffman went sleepless for days to prepare for a scene Laurence Olivier responded ""Dear boy have you tried acting?"")Kirks hip-hop patois makes him seem doubly foolish. Stiller includes an actual black actor in the troupe (Brandon T. Jackson) to deride Kirk but this reads like a cop-out. The film would have been more daring if we had been allowed to supply our own derision. Downey throws the black stereotypes of pop culture in our face and makes us see them once again for what they are. And yet theres great affection in his portrayal. Kirk is first and last an actor and his follies however misguided are part of the craft. Downeys performance isnt just a slam at his profession its a valentine.The same cannot really be said for the sequences in which Stiller is shown playing Simple Jack described in the film as a ""retard."" Disabilities groups have threatened a boycott over this characterization and while I think thats going too far its understandable there would be outrage. Unlike the blackface portrayal this one has no reason for being except goofball yucks.""Tropic Thunder"" passes for ""daring"" in a movie era notably short on risk-taking. In the case of Downey that daring is earned. Otherwise were watching a Hollywood satire that in the end is more Hollywood than satire.

Now in the beautiful if insubstantial pastel ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" its Woody Allens turn as he chronicles the sentimental education of two young women on a summer idyll in Barcelona. ENLARGE The gravely beautiful Vicky (Rebecca Hall with Mia Farrows intonations down pat) is doing graduate work in Catalan identity -- its a measure of her touching earnestness that she sees nothing even faintly amusing about this recondite academic pursuit -- and taking a breather before her imminent marriage to a solid dependable (read dull) corporate attorney (Chris Messina). Her friend Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who looks like a police sketch of a blonde is far less directed but also far more adventuresome when it comes to sampling the goods of life. Vicky is all caution Cristina all nerve endings. The voice-over by Christopher Evan Welch that sets up the movie -- Mr. Allens most endearing in years -- and sketches in the characters is slightly off-putting doing work that by rights should be handled by the dialogue and action. Still the narration aided by a terrific score does streamline the storytelling and adds to it a faintly sardonic top note. At an art opening that the two young women attend with Vickys cousin their host for the summer (the indispensable Patricia Clarkson) Cristina gets a load of a gorgeous painter and recent divorce Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). She is immediately captivated more so when she learns the deliciously sordid details of his marriage to a tempestuous fellow artist (Penelope Cruz in full flush) all the more so when later in the evening Juan Antonio baldly invites her and Vicky on a weekend jaunt to picturesque Oviedo to see the sights drink good wine and make love -- just the three of them. Vickys reaction What a boor. Cristinas reaction What time do we leave? For the record Mr. Bardem makes the latter response completely understandable. A psychopathic killer in ""No Country for Old Men"" hes all killer charm here. What happens in Oviedo doesnt exactly stay in Oviedo. The consequences of that lost weekend reverberate through Mr. Allens film a sexual roundelay and a bittersweet meditation on art and passion and on love in its many guises. Tropic Thunder The word is out war is hell. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is praying that war is hell-o Academy Award. The star (if you can believe it) of a series of highly successful Rambo-style action movies Tugg has high hopes for his current project a prestige Vietnam epic based on the memoir -- wholly unreliable as it turns out -- of a legendary Nam vet (Nick Nolte). ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder. DreamWorks Heres hoping it will help Tugg regain the status he lost in his most recent cinematic outing a brazen Oscar bid the title role in ""Simple Jack"" the tale of a mentally impaired lad with a desperate need for orthodontic intervention and the ability to talk to animals. This blot on Tuggs resume is a frequently recycled joke in ""Tropic Thunder"" a gleeful bumptious send-up of big-budget movies big Hollywood egos -- and those who enable them. Tugg isnt the only one with a lot riding on the movie also called ""Tropic Thunder."" Consider his co-stars and comrades-in-battle Brandon T. Jacksons Alpa Chino (get it?) a hip-hop star looking for crossover fame; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) king of the gross-out comedies who wants to show hes more than the sum of his belches. Then of course theres Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr. in a knockout performance) a pompous multi-Oscar winner who is always eager to show audiences just how far hell go for the sake of art. With the movie within the movie wildly behind schedule and hemorrhaging money the beleaguered director (Steve Coogan) orders the actors into the jungle of Southeast Asia to improvise. Theyre poorly armed in every possible way. Soon unwittingly theyre trading fire with real life bad guys -- thus the true meaning of shooting without a script. ""Tropic Thunder"" which was co-written and directed by Mr. Stiller is like a dinner whose hors doeuvres are far more satisfying and well-composed than the slightly warmed-over main course. Among them are the inspired mock movie trailers and the fake ad that precede ""Thunders"" opening credits. They also include Matthew McConaughey who in the small role of a talent agent obsessed with providing TiVo to his client all but walks off with the picture and an uncredited wholly unrecognizable Tom Cruise playing a large bald obscenity-spewing studio head who in the privacy of his very large office shows himself to be lord of the funk. Politicians intent on repairing their image have a sit-down with Larry King or Matt Lauer. In Hollywood there is no shorter road to career or personal redemption or reconsideration than a willingness to appear on screen looking foolish. Advocacy groups have urged a boycott of ""Tropic Thunder"" because of the repeated use of the word ""retard"" when Mr. Downeys character gives Tugg an acting tutorial. Politically incorrect? Of course. Solid career advice? There can be no doubt. Star Wars The Clone Wars To borrow the fractured syntax of gnomic Jedi master Yoda a video game this movie is like. Meant to fit in between ""Star Wars"" episodes two and three ""Star Wars The Clone Wars"" the first full-length animated feature of the franchise -- already stretched to the breaking point -- is a Saturday-morning cartoon that has been pulled and padded into a patience-snapping 99 minutes. Visually busy and visually forgettable with a less than engaging story line and characters who look like anime figures and move like the denizens of Geppettos workshop ""Clone Wars"" will appeal only to the most tolerant galactically minded children and their parents. Centering on Anakin Skywalker (the voice of Matt Lanter) and his importunate protege Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) -- he calls her Snips; she calls him Sky Guy -- ""The Clone Wars"" is a welter of repetitive combat scenes images of droids on the move and double-dealing. After arranging for the kidnapping of Jabba the Hutts baby -- cute if you like slugs -- Count Dooku (the voice of Christopher Lee) the cunning leader of the evil Separatists has framed the Jedi for the nefarious deed. Now Anakin and Ahsoka must find the baby and bring him back safe and sound to dear old crime lord dad. The movies last few lines of dialogue make it clear that the war between good and evil is far from over in the galaxy far far away. The Separatists are a potent force; the lure of a sequel even more so. Send in the clones.    Find television listings for Woody Allen Penelope Cruz Ben Stiller and more at LocateTV. DVD TIP In Whit Stillmans entertaining Cultureclash comedy ""Barcelona"" (1994) two stuffy American cousins (Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigeman) are constantly at odds about politics life goals and women among Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

Comments Tropic Thunder Rated R  107 minutes This movieland farce Ben Stillers first writing and directing project since Zoolander (2001) gets off to a rousing start with fake coming attractions for a horrid fat-suit-and-flatulence comedy a mawkish Oscar-bait drama about a mentally disabled man (""Simple Jack"") and a Brokeback Mountain knockoff set in a medieval monastery (in a waist-level close-up one monk suggestively fingers the others beaded belt). The rest of the movie in which a small crew of spoiled actors and inept filmmakers struggle to shoot a Vietnam epic in the jungle never lives up to the hilarity of the opening partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easily smothered. With Stiller Jack Black Robert Downey Jr. Steve Coogan and Nick Nolte all of them upstaged by Tom Cruise in a spellbindingly grotesque cameo as a bald pudgy studio executive. By J.R.

SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Tom Cruise seems to have regained his cool in Tropic Thunder (   out of four). Cruises paunchy studio exec is easily the funniest role of his fairly straight-faced career. Whether barking outlandish orders or gyrating ridiculously Cruises bald-pated hairy-knuckled movie mogul is outrageously amusing. His boyishly eager businessman from Risky Business has grown into a cynical jerk of a studio chief -- but he has updated his dance moves. Though it cant be an easy feat to go up against such comedic powerhouses as Robert Downey Jr. Jack Black or Ben Stiller Cruise proves a formidable co-conspirator in this send-up of Hollywood egos. This action film parody is surely going to divide people. Not only is it unabashedly politically incorrect but it is almost a textbook definition of an uneven comedy. There are some wildly funny scenes a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still when its funny its really funny. Stiller flexes his muscles as action star Tugg Speedman who routinely saves the world as the star of the Scorcher series. Black plays Jeff Portnoy who is tired of being celebrated for his girth and prodigious flatulence and wants to try something serious. But serious drama is all Kirk Lazarus the five-time Oscar winner from Australia has ever known. Downey plays the blond blue-eyed Lazarus as a black man for most of the movie. These men come together in Southeast Asia to film a Vietnam War movie under the direction of a first-time filmmaker (Steve Coogan) a trigger-happy explosions expert (Danny McBride) and an enigmatic military consultant (Nick Nolte). But things go horribly wrong. Back in Hollywood Cruise as studio chief Les Grossman threatens to pull the plug on the runaway production and Speedmans agent (Matthew McConaughey) wheedles to keep his client happy. Downey is absurdly funny and Stiller who directed and co-wrote the film has some good farcical moments. The entire cast effectively lampoons cinematic cliches. An exchange between Downey and Stiller about playing disabled characters has spawned real-life protests. Though perhaps insensitive neither the dialogue nor the plot is truly mean-spirited. The only target Tropic Thunder seems intent on ridiculing -- bitingly and with abandon -- is the movie industry. (Rated R for pervasive language sexual references violent content and drug material.

"Tropic Thunder Hollywood parody comes alive with action | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTropic Thunder Hollywood parody comes alive with actionTropic Thunder is one of the better Hollywood parodies but that praise is dimmed by the rude reality that most such movies are misfires.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Aug. 13 2008Starring Robert Downey Jr. Ben Stiller Jack Black Tom Cruise Matthew McConaughey and Nick Nolte. Directed by Ben Stiller. 107 minutes. At major theatres. 14ATropic Thunder is one of the better Hollywood parodies but that praise is dimmed by the rude reality that most such movies are misfires.For every direct hit like Robert Altmans The Player there are at least three fizzles on the order of An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn a movie so lame no director wanted his name on it.Making fun of Tinseltown vanities is like a clown making faces in the mirror. How do you lampoon something that is already ludicrous?Tropic Thunder solves this problem by tacking a real action story onto the parody or at least one that is real enough to keep the movie going when the shtick doesnt quite stick. If the jokes dont rock you the explosions might.Article Continued BelowThe high concept here not exactly a triumph of originality is the intrusion of real life into a pampered preserve a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam war epic in the jungles of Southeast Asia suddenly find themselves in a real war courtesy of drug-smuggling guerrillas who dont appreciate the visit. Hilarity ensues and so does an incredible amount of profanity.The actors are all trying to one-up each other for outrageous characterizations both for fun and for real and heres where Tropic Thunder really gets interesting. You can view this movie on several levels. At its most basic its rude war satire. At its most cerebral its group therapy for actors who really are prima donnas. In between its a gross-out contest involving fart gags drug abuse and cruel humour about ""homos"" and ""retards.""Ben Stiller directs it and takes the lead acting role with the same blunt force he exhibited in Zoolander his fashion-industry takedown. Hes Tugg Speedman an action star whose Rambo-esque franchise has had a few sequels too many. As his career circles the toilet hes been attempting to revive it by playing an endearing mentally challenged man in Simple Jack a movie cynically calculated to melt the hearts of Oscar voters.At the same time hes keeping his hand in the action genre by making Tropic Thunder which is based on the Vietnam memoirs of John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte) a grizzled war hero who now has hooks instead of hands.For Tropic Thunder Speedman is playing opposite his Australian rival Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) the implausible winner of five Oscars and a man so devoted to method acting hes had his skin darkened so he can play in the style of a 1970s blaxploitation badass.Then theres Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) king of fart comedy and fat suits who is looking for some dramatic cred and also as many drugs as he can stuff into his bloated body.Rounding out the team are rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) who resents playing second fiddle to Lazaruss fake brotha; and Kevin Sandusky (Canadas Jay Baruchel) the nervous four-eyed rookie that every war movie has to have.Crowding the screen and attempting to raid every scene are a Whos Who of celebrity cut-ups Tom Cruise as a megalomaniac producer whose every utterance is a gross sexual reference; Matthew McConaughey as an agent who will literally cross the jungle to get his client a good deal and a contractually mandated TiVo; Steve Coogan as a twit Brit director with delusions of Blair Witch woodlands terror; Tobey Maguire as a gay priest in one of the four hilarious fake trailers that open the movie and set the tone; and Danny McBride as a pyro expert who lives to blow things up yet who lost a finger on the set of Driving Miss Daisy. And meet Brandon Soo Hoo as a 12-year-old drug kingpin who could give Brandos Apocalypse Now warlord a lesson in maniacal behaviour.The script by Stiller and co-writers Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen is so packed with in-jokes and crude yuks its amazing that anything of coherence emerges from it. What keeps everything from imploding are Downey and Cruise who are willing to push every audience button and damn the politically correct torpedoes. It does get awfully weird at times though as you try to suss out whether theyre making fun of other people or of their own tabloid images.If youre offended by Tropic Thunder well youre supposed to be. But youre also supposed to laugh at how shrewd it is about being offensive. Dont worry if thats confusing; theres plenty of company up there on the screen.

If you go see Tropic Thunder this weekend dont be late. The four fake ads that open the movie are perhaps the apex of its considerable comic invention. After a sleazy pitch for an energy drink called Alpa Chinos Booty Sweat were treated or subjected to trailers for three abysmal-looking upcoming movies titled Scorcher VI Global Meltdown The Fatties Fart 2 and Satans Alley (that last being a kind of medieval remake of Brokeback Mountain in which closeted monks played by Robert Downey Jr. and Tobey Maguire furtively fondle each others rosaries). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. These trailers are not only uproarious in their own right; they serve as nifty exposition tools for Ben Stiller (directing for the first time since the 2001 Zoolander) who can now plunge us into his deranged universe without needing to provide back stories for the four main characters. We learn that Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) purveyor of Booty Sweat is a rapper trying to break into acting. Tugg Speedman (Stiller) aka the Scorcher is a fading action star hoping to move into serious roles. The flatulent star of the Fatties franchise Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is also in quest of acting cred though his heroin habit stands in his way. And Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) is an Australian method actor who submerges himself in his characters to a disturbing degree. Advertisement As the real movie (or is it?) opens these four Hollywood brats find themselves in a Southeast Asian jungle shooting a war epic under the direction of Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) who in turn is subject to the whims of tyrannical studio head Les Grossman (Tom Cruise oh my God Tom Cruise--but more on that later). The project is quickly going south--four days into shooting report the tabloids its already a month behind schedule--and Grossman is threatening to shut the whole thing down. In a desperate meeting with Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) the Vietnam vet whose memoir inspired the film Cockburn agrees to try shooting ""guerilla-style"" Hell strand his actors in the jungle with hidden cameras terrify them with faked explosions (rigged by the movies tech guru Cody played brilliantly by Danny McBride) and film them as they make their way back to civilization without cell phones assistants masseuses or other perks of the trade. In addition to the fake perils Cody has set out for them the actors fall prey to some real ones A local drug gang led by a teenage warlord (Brandon Soo Hoo) mistakes the Americans for DEA agents and starts hunting them through the jungle. Internecine struggle begins among the team of thespians as the credulous Speedman insists this is all part of the filmmakers plan while the marginally smarter Lazarus tries to lead the group to safety. Did I mention that Downeys character is in blackface this entire time? Well not exactly blackface; with DeNiro-like intensity Lazarus has undergone a surgical skin-darkening procedure to prepare himself for the plum role of an African-American soldier. The fact that his fellow cast member Jacksons Alpa Chino is an actual black man in a much smaller role bothers Lazarus not at all. In one of the movies funniest scenes he enfolds the younger actor in a brotherly embrace while intoning a speech about race relations that begins ""Over 400 years ago ..."" and culminates in a solemn recitation of the lyrics from The Jeffersonstheme song. Anyone walking into Tropic Thunder looking to be offended by Downeys minstrel turn will soon find that the movie is two steps ahead. His role is no one-note lets-shock-the-audience race joke--its a densely layered little study of American racial anxiety. In an ongoing gag Lazarus never breaks character; even when his life is in peril he maintains his soul-brother voice and tone of mau-mauing self-pity. Obsessed with authenticity hes the biggest phony there is. Robert Downey Jr. knocking a role like this out of the park is no surprise. But who could have foreseen Tom Cruise nearly stealing the movie in a fat suit a prosthetic nose a skinhead wig and an Austin Powers-style mat of chest fur? Cruise is always at his best when hes skewering some unpleasant aspect of his own persona; thus the crazed motivational speaker he played in Magnolia was a career high point and the supremely crude Les Grossman is another. Maybe as the head of United Artists Cruise really does spew vicious obscenities on the phone and engage in triumphant hip-hop dances in an underground bunker of an office. At any rate never has a role so cannily taken advantage of Cruises compact thumblike body shape--that is his physical resemblance to a penis. As Les Grossman hes a literal and figurative dick and its the role of a lifetime. Slate V Why Blackface? Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Bold and brash with the potential for boffo B.O. noted Hollywood trade and all-access websites that skewer execs with a Q-Tip on a bad day; ""savvy"" and ""authentic"" were but two of the kind words whispered by The Hollywood Reporter among the myriad insiders who like this Thunders roar. Apparently theyve never seen an episode of Entourage which Tropic Thunder makes look like a Robert Drew documentary.Movies about movies date back to the birth of the movie business and theyre all more or less the same Actors are petulant entitled neurotic narcissists (unless theyre sweet sincere baby-faced newbies on their way to becoming petulant entitled neurotic narcissists); directors are visionaries easily corrupted or imbeciles easily distracted; and studio bosses are loutish buffoons whove always looked like sounded like and acted like Harvey Weinstein. Hollywoods easy pickings and making fun of it is what insiders do when theyve emptied their arsenal. Tropic Thunder--which drops a bunch of actors into the wilds of Southeast Asia and shouts ""Action""--doesnt stray far from convention save for a little added gore firepower and star power worthy of its nearly 100 million budget.Stiller who hasnt directed a feature since striking a pose as Zoolander in 2001 is back in the send-up business nibbling gently at the soft manicured hands that feed him and co-stars Robert Downey Jr. Jack Black (wasted here) Matthew McConaughey (doing Matthew McConaughey) and of course Cruise. It even opens with some short-form satire in the guise of phony movie trailers for an action franchises latest installment (Scorcher VI Global Meltdown starring Stillers Tugg Speedman) a gross-out comedy (The Fatties Fart 2 with Blacks Jeff Portnoy) and overwrought art-house erotica (Satans Alley featuring Downeys Kirk Lazarus and Tobey Maguire as himself). All of it resides in the land of the obvious easy chuckle.When it isnt tossing softballs at the studios Tropic Thunder is the very thing it parodies a wall of noise engulfed in flame. The actors are supposed to be making the archetypal Vietnam War movie based on the memoirs of an aging hero (played by Nick Nolte almost as grizzled as his infamous mug shot). Its Apocalypse Now meets Platoon times The Dirty Dozen. But days into shooting rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is already weeks behind so he drops his cast which also includes Jay Baruchel as a can-do kid and Brandon T. Jackson as a pitchman for an energy drink called Booty Juice into the jungle in order to achieve verite. Things go awry when Tuggs taken prisoner by armed thugs farming poppy and life suddenly imitates art blah blah blah.Stiller having long moved on from sitcom social commentary (Reality Bites) and grim irritainment (The Cable Guy) is back doing the affable well-heeled snark of his short-lived 1992 Fox sketch series and relying on the in-joke thats been out in the open since Charlie Chaplin was making short films about movie sets in 1916. This years model a little too eerily sculpted is really just another action movie pretending its not just another action movie. Hence the ""parody"" angle which more or less boils down to an agent (McConaughey) with a moral dilemma (a private plane or his clients life?) Downeys Kirk Lazarus going surgical-procedure blackface as the final frontier in Method acting and the studio boss who pays surrogates to punch directors when he cant actually be on set to lift his own meaty fists.The film isnt without its occasional pleasures but theyre fleeting and forgettable and buried in debris and drowned out by the inevitable big bang. Kirk who refuses to drop character till he does the DVD commentary delivers a perfectly clever speech about how Tugg went ""too retarded"" in his sole stab at respectability a movie called Simple Jack in which he stammered through crooked buck teeth. ""Everybody knows you never go full retard"" Kirk says pointing to Rain Man and Forrest Gump as proof that you gotta rein it in. ""Infantile yes. Retarded no."" But even that joke about actors playing developmentally challenged in order to win Oscars made its first appearance in the Dead Sea Scrolls; things musty man.And thats the thing about satire It doesnt play past its expiration date. And everything about Tropic Thunder already feels antiquated. Its just another so-so Ben Stiller movie this time with Robert Downey Jr. in blackface which youd think would be enough but its not.

Movies within movies. A reel suicide mission that turns into a real one.Ben Stillers Tropic Thunder is raunchy raucous and riotously funny. But so acutely self-conscious that the effect is one of a stand-up comedian furnishing color commentary on his own act. Written by Stiller Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen the movie about the making of a Vietnam War movie called Tropic Thunder is a self-mocking comedy tweaking showbiz self-importance. And an action flick chronicling a studios bungle in the jungle. And an excessive inventory of Hollywood excesses. On the desert-island location of Tropic Thunder a milquetoast director(Steve Coogan) endeavors to film the muscular memoirof a macho paraplegic (Nick Nolte). The filmmaker is saddled with wimpy actors who go together about as well as chalk and chowder. In general they represent the band-of-brothers population of war movies. In particular types that appeal to reliable moviegoing demographics the action guy with the bulging biceps the serious actor with the bulging cranium and the hip-hop impresario with the bulging pockets. Action lug Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is a Stallone-esque grunter in a sweatband out to redeem his career. Speedmans one-note emoting appalls thespian Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) a Russell Crowe-like Aussie perfectionist who resorts to ""pigment augmentation"" (read blackface) to play an African American. Lazarus hubris appalls African American entrepreneur Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) a P. Diddy-like businessman who views acting in movies as an extension of the brand. Then there are the druggie (Jack Black as Eddie Murphy-ish comic Jeff Portnoy eager for dramatic cred) and the male ingenue (Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky eager to survive) respectively out of it and new to it. Kevin is appalled that seasoned filmmakers and actors cant tell the difference between prop grenades and the type that sever limbs. Like the explosives detonated by Tropic Thunders overzealous technician (Danny McBride) Stillers film carpet-bombs for laughs when it would be more joke-effective to go for the surgical strike. While aiming for the funnybone the filmmakers bruise other body parts. Three performances survive the bombs and the blood and the viscera two of them cameos. As Tuggs agent Rick Peck a role originally written for Owen Wilson the uncredited Matthew McConaughey is hilarious playing a guy in the Hollywood bubble that bursts when he learns that his client is in mortal danger. Wearing fatsuit and bald cap unrecognizable in the role of the films vulgarian producer Les Grossman Tom Cruise as his characters name suggests cares more about grosses than human lives. Best of all is Downey whose rumbling dialogue has the wah-wah sound of an Ramp;B guitar and the authority of the late Isaac Hayes. As usual Downey is sublime lightly funny in a screenplay where the humor is often heavy-handed. Stiller is more effective behind the camera than on screen as Tugg a role reportedly written for Keanu Reeves. Tugg spends the movie trying to live down the ignominy of having played a Forrest Gump-like character in a box-office failure. Are the films caricatures insulting or offensive to African Americans and the mentally disabled? As its targets are not blacks or the mentally disadvantaged but actors who would do anything for awards I think not. (That said the films depiction of cartoony Asian druglords did seem like an anachronism from 1940s war films.) With its repetitious passages of stumble-in-the-jungle slapstick and geysers of in-jokes Tropic Thunder finally is more successful as a critique of Hollywood movies than as a Hollywood comedy. But it has just enough surprise laughs to guarantee a freak meteorological event. This Thunder will precede box-office lightning.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Tropic Thunder (R) Paramount/DreamWorks (106 min.) Directed by Ben Stiller. With Stiller Jack Black Robert Downey Jr. Opens Wednesday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS Jack Black is a childish out-of-control comic. Robert Downey Jr. is an actor with a madness to his Method. Ben Stiller is a pampered hack with an undeserved ego. Nick Nolte is sweaty nasty and about four eggs short of a dozen. And Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise is insane. In ""Tropic Thunder"" that is -- a new comedy about a group of self-important stars shooting a Vietnam War movie that both plays off reality and beats folks to the punch. First though be warned Stiller and Black whove built a PG-sanctioned image lately go defiantly back to blue here. Blacks drug-addicted actor talks elaborately filthy trash. And Stiller -- who also directed -- fills the movie with all the disembowelments that were too graphic even for ""Saving Private Ryan."" And if thats already making you queasy -- well maybe youre better off waiting for the next ""Madagascar."" Frankly sometimes it is too much -- but Stiller declares his sarcastic intentions early starting the film with commercials for these fake actors previous projects. Best is the one for Downeys character -- an Aussie thespian called Kirk Lazarus -- last seen as a gay monk in the medieval drama ""Satans Alley."" Then the story pushes the comfort level even further. Because Lazarus -- who has clearly decided he can play any part -- is set to star in the new war movie ""Tropic Thunder"" as an African-American. Blackface? Dont insult him. The man undergoes a surgical procedure to dye his skin. At a time when even the New Yorker is having trouble selling irony this is dangerous comedy. But Stiller and Downey clearly make the joke not about the impersonation but the impersonators cluelessness. And then wisely have Lazarus called on it by the casts real African-American (a gangsta rapper whos playing with stereotypes as well). Things really get started when Steve Coogan as the beleaguered director gets a shut-it-down call from studio chief Tom Cruise. So with technical advisor Nolte in tow Coogan brings his actors out into the jungle planning to improvise the entire thing ""Blair Witch"" style -- and leading them straight into a firefight with some real-life bad guys. Some of the jokes work wonderfully; sometimes the movie feels nearly as deluded as its actors. (Eventually it seems to think its a real war movie too - and pads out its time with sub-""Rambo"" raids and deliberately cliched music.) Theres a range of tasteless jokes (the Asian characters are nearly subhuman and the film-within-a-film about a mentally disabled character has already drawn fire) and Stiller remains a forced and obvious performer. But there are two wonderfully comic jobs in the movie -- and both come from ""serious"" actors. The first is courtesy of Cruise who -- outfitted in a padded belly fake chest hair and bald cap -- plays the defiantly crude studio head. Luxuriating in his own foul-mouthed aggressiveness bumping and grinding to ear-bleeding rap hes a gleeful monster -- and Cruises best performance since YouTube if not ""Magnolia."" The second comes from Downey. Never raising his voice from what hes convinced is an authentically ""black"" register making every bit play like an inspired improvisation he delivers the kind of comic turn that revived Johnny Depps career in the first ""Pirates."" ""Iron Man"" was nice but dont be surprised if this one wins Downey a nomination. ""Tropic Thunder"" wont win any itself (apart perhaps from sound editing -- this picture is loud). But it is often very funny and wittily on-target about the fine madness of moviemaking. And if it tempts you to laugh at the manic Black or the intense Downey or the nerdish Stiller dont worry. Theyre laughing first. Rating note The film contains nonstop profanity violence gore and substance abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Running time 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense situations of peril). At the AMC Empire the Ziegfeld the Kips Bay others. THE forecast A few sticky patches but generally pretty cool. Like the tidal wave that swallows New York in the second act the jaw-dropping special effects in the weather-gone-wild doomsday film ""The Day After Tomorrow"" sweep all else away - including quibbles about bland characterization and dead-in-the-water dialogue. And despite the perfect storm of political controversy thats swirled around the movies central conceit of a global warming-induced Ice Age environmental sermonizing also takes a back seat to the fantastical science and computer-generated havoc. German-born director Roland Emmerich gets in some partisan digs - the villain of the piece is a U.S. vice president who bears more than a passing resemblance to Dick Cheney and the silver-haired president is a blank-eyed dolt. But Emmerichs forte is big-bang escapism (""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"") and here too he is bent on wreaking mayhem and destruction in the most spectacular way. This is mindless popcorn fun for moviegoers who get a vicarious thrill from seeing stuff get wrecked - and have a high pain threshold for tin-eared dialogue. Two generations of hotties provide the films emotional core such as it is. Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall a science whiz who sets off an early warning about polar ice caps melting ocean currents being altered and temperatures plummeting. His doomsday theory is backed up by Professor Rapson (Ian Holm) a fellow climatologist stationed in Scotland but these two men seem to be the only ones on the planet talking sense. Hall tries to warn global leaders but is given the brushoff; the U.S. veep (Kenneth Welsh) is particularly dismissive ""Our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment"" he barks. In no time at all however the skeptics are eating their words as snow starts falling on New Delhi grapefruit-size hail decimates Tokyo tornadoes lash Los Angeles and a wall of water surges across Manhattan drowning the Statue of Liberty in an oblique nod to the iconic image from the original ""Planet of the Apes."" These scenes of grand-scale annihilation are where Emmerich really razzle-dazzles milking current computer wizardry for all its worth. From the Russian supertanker floating up Fifth Avenue to the brittle flash-freezing of New Yorks skyscrapers to the thundering beauty of the gathering storm clouds these are wow-worthy visuals on a grand scale. (The effects budget seems to have run out about two-thirds of the way through the movie - a roaming pack of CGI wolves look like they leaped out of a video game.) With most of the nations population fleeing south - cue some funny scenes of U.S. ""refugees"" illegally crossing the Rio Grande after Mexico closes its borders - Hall slaps on some snowshoes and heads north to assuage his absentee-father guilt. His son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in the New York Public Library where hes been taking part in something called a ""scholastic decathlon"" and flirting shyly with a dewy limpid-eyed classmate (Emmy Rossum). Emmerich has long been criticized for peopling his movies with cardboard cutout figures and the cliched characters in ""Day"" are no exception. But indie it boy Gyllenhaal sensibly offsets the big-budget hoopla with a low-key performance his deadpan half-smirk giving his character a nice comic edge and the talented Quaid manages to lend a sense of gravitas to his everyday-hero role. Neither however can surmount the films central absurdity - Halls death-defying trek from Washington to New York to somehow ""rescue"" his son implausibly outpacing the encroaching cold while Sam fends off a minus-150-degree deep freeze by making a little fire. The cost to life of this cataclysmic climate shift is incalculable of course but Emmerich steers clear of scenes of mass carnage; there are only a handful of on-screen deaths and moments of levity punctuate the destruction. Disaster movies from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Towering Inferno"" are impossible to take seriously and ""Day"" is no exception - its simply a fast-moving pageant of end-of-the-world eye candy.

Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday August 13 2008 1132 AM A decade ago could anyone have guessed that Robert Downey Jr. would be the action hero of 2008? Ben Stiller directed co-wrote and cast himself in ""Tropic Thunder"" but from the opening scenes its clear this movie belongs to his wickedly brilliant castmate. No one but Downey could possibly embody a white man playing a black man who keeps forgetting hes an Australian while making the audience feel ridiculous for even wondering if the whole conceit is offensive. And if your head is spinning just trying to figure out where hes going with such a risky notion well wait till you watch it in person. CLICK FOR ""TROPIC THUNDER"" MOVIE PREMIERE PHOTOS.Although this satire of Hollywood inanity isnt the comic classic it could have been Downeys gonzo performance is a must-see. He plays Kirk Lazarus an Oscar-winning Aussie actor whose obscenely self-righteous dedication to his ""craft"" reaches a head when he starts shooting a big-budget Vietnam War flick. For this and a thousand other reasons Lazarus isnt the most popular guy with his co-stars including fading A-lister Tugg Speedman (Stiller) rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) and heroin-addicted comic Jeff Portnoy (an unusually off-key Jack Black). Fed up with so many bickering egos director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) drops his cast in remotest Southeast Asia for added inspiration. Unfortunately things prove too real for comfort when the jungle turns out to be teeming with soldiers who think the actors are ready for an actual war. Theres always something self-congratulatory about celebrities lampooning their own industry and occasionally you catch Stiller patting himself a little too enthusiastically on the back. But he draws inspired supporting performances from Nick Nolte Matthew McConaughey and a going-for-broke Tom Cruise. And the steady spray of jokes ricochets with machine-gun force hitting dozens of worthy targets. (Itll be a long time before anyone dares to woo Oscar by pretending to be mentally challenged.)Then of course theres Downey who pushes Stillers conceit all the way to the edge stealing everyones thunder in the process. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo MERIE WEISMILLER WALLACE PARAMOUNT PICTURES Tropic Thunder 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Before Tropic Thunder begins its vulgar business we must sit through a bunch of ads. First the spot for a drink called Booty Sweat. Then the previews for Scorcher VI Global Meltdown featuring the virile sweat of A-list action star Tugg Speedman; The Fatties Fart 2 with comedian Jeff Portnoy in Eddie Murphy-ish fat suits; lastly Satans Alley an art-house release with Tobey Maguire and five-time-Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus as yearning gay monks. I was 15 seconds into the ad for Scorcher VI before I realized Id been punkd. (All together now Duh.) But the main target is Hollywood itself which gets torn to shreds in this outrageous and violently comic send-up of film-biz puffery. At its best Tropic Thunder skewers impotent directors fascist producers prima donna stars and classic scenes from the camo-fatigues genre (think loony Brando from Apocalypse Now or Willem Dafoe in Platoon). At its worst it exploits them The ending is unusually corny for a satire. No Slim Pickens here. Otherwise this is mostly diverting lunacy. Directed by Ben Stiller (his first stint at the helm since Zoolander) from a script he co-wrote with Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux Tropic Thunder tracks the troubled shoot of a movie that turns a bit too verite for comfort. It opens on location as choppers thud Viet Cong attack and heroic American viscera spill spill spill. Set in 1969 this movie-within-the-movie is based on the war memoir of Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte doing a fine spin on demented) a growly veteran who survived a hellish rescue mission. As Tayback Speedman (Stiller) sports Rambo-era biceps and a meathead ego. His co-stars are Portnoy (Jack Black) a frazzled heroin addict and Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) a blonde blue-eyed Australian Ac-Tor who underwent skin-darkening surgery to portray African-American Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Out of character Lazarus sounds like Russell Crowe; in character hes Rosie Grier. Speedman is hissy-fitting one day when an explosives mishap puts Tropic Thunder into the hole delaying production for a month. The solution Take the actors on a helicopter ride plop them in the jungle rig the trees with firepower and capture the resultant terror on hidden cameras. The director (Steve Coogan) gets as far as that touchdown in the jungle at which point he steps on an old land mine and scatters to the wind. (The scene that follows this sudden dismemberment is hilarious beyond description and gross beyond gross.) Stranded in the thicket are Method-man Lazarus star-boob Speedman frazzled Portnoy a rapper named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and a smart kid named Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Unlucky for them heroin suppliers are camped nearby. Kidnappings ensue together with D.T.s bouts of thespian navel-contemplation and other infantile nuttiness from actors who dont have a clue. Not since The Player has the American film industry endured such vicious caricature. But Tropic Thunder draws literal blood too. Like Pineapple Express its a comedy that kills climaxing with a violent show-down at a drug-manufacturing hideout. (Another similarity Danny McBride plays a doofus.) It also shreds any and all semblance of political correctness employing oafish develop- mental-disability humor -- the R-word gets a workout -- and oh yeah blackface. Is Stiller employing cliches or is he ridiculing the actors who exploit them -- the vainglory of precious Hollywood stardom? Maybe both. But Downey sly as ever has the time of his life mocking a guy called Downey. ""Im a dude playin a dude disguised as another dude"" Lazarus confesses (while dressed as a Vietnamese farmer) and darned if he doesnt look mystified by himself. Finally two words Tom Cruise. I wont spill the beans on his propulsive demonic and garbage-mouthed little part but Tropic Thunder confirms my long-held suspicion that hes a character actor trapped in a leading mans body. Other than that Ill only say it belongs on a double bill with Risky Business.

Still that accident of showbiz genetics doesnt do credit to Ben Stillers unique powers of ruthless insight into the Homo thespianus and to his talents for a hilarious conjuring of the species. A good Stiller project from Zoolander to Dodgeball is likely to be about a voluble extrovert of exquisite short-guy egotism with insecurity nipping at his shoes and fury goading him on to fine eruptions of pomposity as delightful for the audience as they are blood-pressure-raising for the blusterer. Now comes Tropic Thunder the very best and funniest of them about a small army of such strutting peacocks a cast of actors off on an acting adventure on the set of a war picture in the jungles of Southeast Asia. How up their own tushies are these paragons of overpaid Hollywood privilege? They wander into the middle of a real drug war that doesnt conform to the rules of on-location productions -- no assistants nearby with bottled water no fake bullets -- and they dont even know it. This is Stillers Hellzapoppin Apocalypse Now -- the ultimate fighting machine of comedies-about-the-making-of-movies. Its raunchy outspoken -- and also a smart and agile dissection of art fame and the chutzpah of big-budget productions that just so happens to include a naked bleach-blond Jack Black as a drug-addled movie star draped over the back of a water buffalo. About that eyeball-searing image Black plays Jeff Portnoy a John Candy-like performer trying to show he can embody more than a flatulent fatty in the gas-passing comedy franchise that earned him his fortune. Stiller who directed and co-wrote the script with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen plays Tugg Speedman an action superstar no longer so super. (His Scorcher series has begun to die hard; his big attempt to stretch his range playing the mentally handicapped title role in Simple Jack was a failed attempt at prestige and yet undoubtedly more watchable than I Am Sam.) And in a virtuoso turn from everyones favorite redeemed virtuoso Robert Downey Jr. elegantly dispatches the mishegoss of Method acting with his double-difficulty feat of playing Kirk Lazarus an Oscar-loaded Australian artiste who commits to the role of an African-American soldier by undergoing skin pigmentation and speaking in a Shaft-meets-Uncle Ben patois even when the camera is off. Such shtick wears thin on the real African-American in the cast a rapper-turned-actor played by Brandon T. Jackson. Theres not even room here to linger on Tom Cruises eye-catching image-salvaging romp as a puffy crude bald hairy-chested Jewish producer; Nick Noltes authoritative turn as the grizzled technical adviser John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback whose Vietnam memoir is herein being dramatized; the maniacal antics of Pineapple Express Danny McBride as an explosives expert; or the crucial Brit-twit-comes-to-La-La-Land machinations of Steve Coogan (soon to be seen in Hamlet 2) as the overmatched British director of the bedeviled behind-schedule over-budget movie-within-the-movie (also called Tropic Thunder). The point is that with every character and with every believably outrageous turn of the plot (beginning with fictional promotional movie trailers preceding the actual feature -- each one a perfect comedy haiku) Stiller brings real insider knowledge of -- and compassion for -- the big business of Hollywood make-believe to bear on a comedy that is itself a superior factory creation of make-believe. Like a postmodern magician Downey shows how its really done -- without detracting from the pleasures available to those who dont care at all how its done just that the entertainment includes explosions. Even an outsider with no obsessive interest in say how to rig the fake blood and severed limbs of movie battle will love Downeys mid-gore Method struggle for character motivation. And all it takes to marvel through non-PC tears of laughter at the wisdom delivered by Downey about how to win an Oscar for portraying a handicap is a pulse.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Tropic Thunder"" has been hailed by some as a satire of war flicks. If only that were so. Starring Ben Stiller Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. the action comedy about a group of spoiled actors who find themselves in the thick of it after things go awry on location is never quite deft enough for that distinction. But ""Tropic Thunder"" is an above- par parody film. It has a higher IQ and deeper talent than ""Superhero Movie"" ""Meet the Spartans"" and the like. Still it remains kin to all those half-baked spoofs in which the filmmakers go for the easy and familiar. At its best mouth-agape moments however ""Tropic Thunder"" (co-written and directed by Ben Stiller) offers some insanely incandescent riffs on performance. For a nation figuring its ways in a ""race/post-race"" world the tensions between the white character playing a black man and the African-American rapper- turned-movie star are rich and resonant. Onscreen things have turned unpleasant in the blink of an eye for director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) who suddenly finds he is making the most expensive war film. On-location pyrotechnics expert Cody (Danny McBride so confoundingly funny in ""Pineapple Express"") has an itchy finger. The crescendo of flame that burns across the foliage evokes nearly every Vietnam flick weve ever seen from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Platoon."" Thats the idea of course. Nick Noltes gruff presence as John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback reiterates the point. Four Leaf who lost both hands in Vietnam haunts the set like a contemptuous ghost. His memoir is the basis for ""Tropic Thunder"" the name of the action movie within the parody flick of the same name. Its Four Leafs taunting that leads Damien to abandon his spoiled ensemble in the jungle letting them fend for themselves. The five actors each resemble a type Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is a waning action hero; Kirk Lazurus (Downey) is a paragon of method; Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) is the rapper more sensitive than he lets on; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a drug-addled comic; and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) well hes the character actor most likely to get offed. In the jungle they encounter a Golden Triangle drug gang. The actors think the cameras are still rolling contrary to harsh evidence. The gun-toting gangsters who work for a child drug lord believe the ragtag unit is DEA. Theres much doubling and plenty of double-entendres in ""Tropic Thunder."" ""Im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude"" says Downey as Kirk portraying a five-time Oscar winner who has undergone a radical procedure that tints his skin to make him appear black. Downey is the only lead actor who trusts the comedic (and more) possibilities of Stiller Justin Theroux and Etan Cohens script. Or maybe its that he trusts audiences more than Stiller does. Kirk and Alpa Chinos verbal showdowns force new questions about Hollywoods insulting blackface traditions. A fine parody has to begin with a modicum of the authentic. As fit as Stiller is hes not believable as an action star either A-class (Bruce Willis) or B (Steven Seagal). Cinematographer John Toll lends this ""the unmaking of the making of"" -- or is it vice versa? -- comedy visual credence. A shot of the hapless five wandering the claustrophobic terrain recalls his work for Terrence Malicks WWII film ""The Thin Red Line."" As war pics go ""Tropic Thunder"" is as insulated from reality as its spoiled stars. The start of the film is disquieting for its silly but graphic depiction of battlefield injuries. Sure its referencing other movies but at least those war flicks gave a nod to the world outside the 902 ZIP codes. Tom Cruises arrival onscreen has already -- rightly -- become legend. His nasty-funny turn is as disturbing for its gleeful depiction of power as the actors role in ""Magnolia."" Hirsute and balding hes nearly unrecognizable and yet. . . . Come awards season there is at least one aspect of ""Tropic Thunder"" worthy of kudos The freedom the makeup artists gave Cruise and Downey to act beyond the bounds.

"A big-budget journey into the jungle of Hollywood - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A big-budget journey into the jungle of Hollywood From left Ben Stiller Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. (Merie Weismiller Wallace) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / August 13 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Tropic Thunder"" only sounds like a Thai porno. Its actually American porn set in the jungles of Vietnam. The non-jungle parts of this crude showbiz circus usually have something to do with a character called Les Grossman a sleazy Hollywood movie executive with giant forearms thinning gray hair psoriasis on his fingertips and an imbecilic over-budget Vietnam-era blockbuster called ""Tropic Thunder"" on his hands.The makers and marketers of this movie - the one youre paying to see not the one Grossman is paying to produce - have done an admirable job of keeping to themselves the amusement that beneath Les Grossmans furry chest and thick padding is Tom Cruise. Of course its hard to ignore a character whos the keystone of one of the most outlandish American farces since Alexander Paynes ""Election."" This movie written by Ben Stiller Etan Cohen and the actor Justin Theroux and directed by Stiller will certainly make more money which will tickle the executives like Grossman that ""Tropic Thunder"" wants to send up.The movie also wants to laugh at the hubristic spectaculars that men like Grossman love to make money from. The ""Tropic Thunder"" within ""Tropic Thunder"" is based on a memoir by a craggy Vietnam veteran (Nick Nolte) with two hooked arms. Its director (Steve Coogan) has dragged a huge crew to Southeast Asia with the intent of filming a movie about five army men behind enemy lines. When an attempt to add grit and spontaneity to the proceedings adds too much of both the actors playing the soldiers are on their own but still think theyre being filmed.Stiller casts himself as a fading action star desperate to be taken seriously as an actor (he just made a bomb in which he played a severely mentally disabled man). Robert Downey Jr. plays an Australian with five Oscars desperate to be taken seriously as black (hes undergone an improbable Negrofying procedure). Jack Black waist deep in his most interesting assignment plays a comedy star and junkie. Theyre paired with two kids who hold their own on the movies all-star team Jay Baruchel as the young nobody actor playing a nerd soldier and Brandon T. Jackson playing a raunchy hip-hop star named Alpa Chino who can be seen in the uproarious spoof ads that precede the film selling a soft drink called Booty Sweat.They too wind up behind enemy lines in a jungle where the locals are in the middle of some kind of drug war. (One sides leader is an exuberantly nasty kid played by Brandon Soo Hoo.) And so art and life begin to cannibalize each other. In some future time we may look back on ""Tropic Thunder"" and ask ""What were we thinking?"" But a movie that asks Cruise to slap the air as part of a horse-riding dance popularized by the Ramp;B singer Ginuwine takes some time to recover from. So does one in which Downey appears to be playing Jude Law playing Kirk Douglas playing the late Bernie Mac. Black at some point finds himself tied mostly naked to a tree promising sex to the first man wholl help him get high. As a director Stiller gives us too much. There are stretches during the middle where we might be the prisoners of war. Watching actors trudge through the jungle is a lot more fun in early Werner Herzog than mid-period Stiller. But the movie is guided up to a point by the sort of insanity you rarely find in a comedy where the stars and the material are reaching for the comic versions of the crazy demons that possessed Francis Ford Coppola and his production of ""Apocalypse Now."" Blacks running through the entire picture in a cold-turkey sweat simultaneously confirms that the actor is best left on a movies back burner and captures how Chris Farley might have played Judy Garland. Nobody in the movie acts. They just do drag.Of course the satirical aims of ""Tropic Thunder"" arent the great modern war movies per se. (Thank goodness since Stiller comes much closer to making ""Delta Force 3"" than ""Apocalypse Now."") His ""Tropic Thunder"" cost close to 100 million to produce and it seems like a movie made while no one at Paramount was paying much attention. Its an illusion of course. The movie feels like a consciously happy accident whose offenses (mocking a people whod worship a turkey about mental illness) are roughly balanced by actors gouging out their own narcissism. And yet this is a movie that still includes a feel-good Oscar ceremony as part of its coda and the most affectionate depiction of a Hollywood agent ever filmed.And so ""Tropic Thunder"" is a satire of the Hollywood industrial complex that also feels very much a product of that complex. The jokes are cheap the big action set pieces are not. Things explode - including cliches. But ultimately those are reassembled and embraced. The movies Stiller has directed (""Reality Bites"" and ""Zoolander"") and a lot of the acting hes done mock vanity and selling out while admiring themselves in the mirror sending up stars like Cruise while very much wanting to emulate his success. In ""Tropic Thunder"" Stillers toned muscles arent part of the joke.Despite its contradictions the film stayed with me after I left the theater. Its frivolous. But its also powerfully surreal. ""Tropic Thunder"" isnt about the morality of war. Its about the bad taste of producing certain war movies the hubris not to take us to war per se but to repackage it as adventure. The studio chiefs the directors the talent even the effects guys are tyrants slobs creeps frauds and wimps.Thanks to Cruises indelibly unembarrassed performance the films heart of darkness is Les Grossman. The actor isnt funny per se. Weve seen him curse people out before. He is fascinating though. Were supposed to find him villainous. But Grossman is the only person in the movie who knows who he is. Hes rich. Hes ruthless. And hes the one really making our movies. Watching him kiss a gold chain and do a little dance during the final credits is chilling and weird. Were seeing a movie star have the time of his life playing a war criminal.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

I say that having seen plenty of others that werent nearly as funny and I say that with full knowledge of the grumbling about how exactly Tropic Thunder gets there. The problem seems to be that this movie is an intelligent comedy. One where the jokes arent telegraphed to hell and back. This just wont do. Evidently no one minds when fart-joke films are foisted upon an unsuspecting public or when the studios steal from us with the latest Myers Ferrell Murphy or Sandler travesty. Nope that behavior is fine and dandy. Its the satire that really pisses folks off. I weep for our future. The premise is the making of a war film. Ben Stiller Robert Downey Jr. Jack Black Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel are dropped off in the jungle to get some footage that faux-director Steve Coogan needs. Matt McConaughey plays Stillers over-the-top agent and Tom Cruise does an amazing job as the studio chief. Throw in Nick Nolte as the war films source material and Danny McBride as the overeager pyrotechnics man and youve got your actor stew. They all have very solid laughs attached to their characters and the films pacing and balance is worthy of some love. As I said funniest film of the year. See it. Take a friend. Pay money. You wont be disappointed. So what then are we to make of the controversy that surrounds Tropic Thunder? Ridiculous. People who either havent seen the movie or dont get the joke. Their complaint lies with Ben Stillers portrayal of a character called ""Simple Jack."" The ""retarded"" role was one he took in an attempt to win acting accolades a classic and idiotic Hollywood move. This element is crucial to the back story of the movie as Stiller is known as the ""action guy"" who will do anything to prove hes a real actor. This is set up against Downey Jr.s crazy portrayal of an African-American. Downey is a real actor (in real life too) but he takes it to the extreme for authenticitys sake. But heres the thing people They are opposing sides of the same joke spectrum What is that joke? Ready for it? Ready to be crazy offended? Hollywood is full of delusional self-absorbed spoiled idiots. Thats it. Thats the joke. And Stillers portrayal of ""Simple Jack"" isnt a knock on the learning disabled. Its a knock on the system that rewards manipulative and pandering schlock. No one is left unscathed here. Studios agents actors directors they are all held up to the light and mocked. Relentlessly mocked. This is a good thing. This is comedy. Work with me here. This is why you should see Tropic Thunder. Because its damned funny because it takes chances and because its innovative. This is how comedy evolves. Please dont let our culture become one that lauds fecal-matter comedy. Please tell me were better than that with your box-office dollars. We must make a stand as a society. Weve got to choose our course. The paths ahead of us are as follows we can lay down and let people without a firm grasp of what theyre talking about run roughshod over progress. Or we can fight. We can fight back against the uninformed and the ignorant protesting a comedy that they either havent seen or didnt fully understand. F. Scott Fitzgerald once said that the test of a first-rate intelligence is ""the ability to hold two opposing ideas at the same time."" Yes this film will be offensive to the people who dont get the joke. Yes it is also a very well made and humorous movie. These may seem like opposing views but there is room for everyone in this big tent. But dont you dare try to take away an artists right to create. The place where vanilla comedy and themes roam free and cash in is not the place I want to live. Actually now that I think about it perhaps a Ludacris lyric used in the film might is more appropriate. He opines quite learnedly ""Get back You dont know me like that"" Grade A Movies Tropic Thunder News about FAQ/Help Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy/Privacy Rights Copyright Closed Captioning Eventful Partners Ad Choices (c)2016 Viacom International Inc.

Photo Merie Weismiller Wallace DreamWorks Movie review Tropic Thunder offensive funny 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Tropic Thunder Comedy. Starring Ben Stiller Jack Black Robert Downey Jr. and Nick Nolte. Directed by Ben Stiller. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) If youre part of the group thats protesting ""Tropic Thunder"" claiming that the movies humor comes at the expense of the mentally disabled then you may have lots of company in your picket line. The new comedy directed by Ben Stiller desecrates pretty much all that is holy including Vietnam veterans who write books recovering drug addicts pandas Russell Crowe the overweight the flatulent small Burmese children and whoever currently owns the rights to ""Run Through the Jungle."" If youre not offended by at least one aspect of this film then youre probably not getting out enough. But ""Tropic Thunder"" has a secret weapon which gives it an all-but-free pass when dealing with the forces of political correctness The movie is laugh-until-your-stomach-hurts hilarious. Stiller and his strong cast also help their cause by delivering their most cutting lines at the expense of themselves and their brethren in Hollywood. Its the type of movie that you would expect the main players to make only if they had just a few months to live. After his characters speech about actors who dont get Oscars when they go ""full retard"" its going to be really interesting when Robert Downey Jr. runs into ""I Am Sam"" star Sean Penn at the next Vanity Fair party. ""Tropic Thunder"" introduces each main player with a trailer for his next movie. Stiller is fading action star Tugg Speedman Downey Jr. is Australian thespian Kirk Lazarus and Jack Black is Jeff Portnoy star of a Klumps-like sequel called ""The Fatties Fart II."" As the movie begins their egos are clashing on the set of ""Tropic Thunder"" a ""Platoon""-style Vietnam War movie based on a book by Sgt. Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte). When prima donna behavior threatens the production the main characters are thrown into hostile territory where they remain in character and keep complaining to their agents even as the real-life situation gets progressively more dangerous. Stiller and co-writers Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen could have stopped with that premise and had a very funny movie. Downey Jr.s work as a pretentious white actor playing a black soldier (""I dont read the script - the script reads me"") is worth the price of admission. But the writers constantly head in unexpected directions cleverly including the reaction of Hollywood power players to the stars situation. The result combines elements of ""Theres Something About Mary ..."" ""The Player"" and ""Team America World Police"" and yet almost nothing in ""Tropic Thunder"" is predictable or cliched. Minor characters including a demolitions expert played by Danny R. McBride are memorable. And as the tone changes from ""Rambo"" to an ""Apocalypse Now"" vibe its good to have a grizzled veteran like Nolte around to keep things completely insane. One of the best pieces of satire involves Speedmans ill-fated starring role in a movie called ""Simple Jack."" The jokes are clearly set up to make fun of actors who play mentally disabled characters in an attempt get Oscars not the disabled people themselves. Several advocacy groups have asked moviegoers to boycott ""Tropic Thunder."" But if anything it seems as if they should be protesting ""Forrest Gump."" If youre really into surprises even one that has been out of the bag for months dont read the next two paragraphs. Arguably the funniest part of ""Tropic Thunder"" is an over-the-top profane cameo by Tom Cruise who plays megalomaniac studio head Les Grossman. In a handful of funny scenes Cruise manages to make up for his contentious interview with Matt Lauer that annoying bottle-flipping thing he did in ""Cocktail"" all of ""Far and Away"" and whatever role he might have had in suppressing ""South Parks"" ""Trapped in the Closet"" episode. Cruise still needs to make up for that ""Top Gun"" beach volleyball scene and Katie Holmes Family Circus mom haircut but his karma is closer to even than anyone thought he could achieve. -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence gore sexual situations and multiple international incidents including a particularly gory one involving a panda. In the interest of world peace ""Tropic Thunder"" probably shouldnt open in China until the Olympics are over.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Hollywood satire meets ""Apocalypse Now"" in ""Tropic Thunder."" Surely no movie-industry comedy has ever had a bigger napalm budget more strafing helicopters or explosions on a par with this lunatic war movie satire. Every aspect of Ben Stillers new comedy is extravagant. The acting goes beyond over-the-top and into pole-vaulting territory. The physical gags are conceived on the grandest scale possible. The characterizations are sky-high caricature. The R-rated humor dances on the brink between rude audacity and true offensiveness. Each shot is designed to pin your ears back with sheer excess. Its overkill as punch line. Stiller Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black play movie stars who dont realize that theyve wandered off the set of their Southeast Asia war flick and into a dangerous nest of drug runners. The premise is as stale as week-old hot dog buns. Its ""Three Amigos"" with palm trees. Yet the sheer bombast of the 90 million production gives the idea a huge boost. The film-within-a-film scenes of battlefield carnage dwarf the intestine-strewn opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with gut wounds that flaunt more entrails than a butchers display case. Stiller plays Tugg Speedman a fading action-movie idol. Hes desperate to revive his career after a disastrous attempt at drama where he played a mentally retarded man in a heart-tugger titled ""Simple Jack"" widely considered the worst film ever made. Speedmans hoping for a comeback in a Vietnam War picture based on the memoir of hook-handed former POW Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte). Downey plays Kirk Lazarus an intense method actor who underwent a pigment transplant for the role of a black soldier and refuses to abandon his down-home baritone off camera. (""Man I dont drop character until I done the DVD commentary."") Black plays drugged-up comedy star Jeff Portnoy whose lowbrow fat-suit farces have turned him into a self-loathing heroin addict. The prima donnas overwhelm jittery director Damien Cockburn (English comedian Steve Coogan) putting the project a month behind schedule in just five days of shooting. Cockburns solution Drop the stars deep in the jungle film them with hidden cameras and create a guerrilla-style masterpiece. Their make-believe shootouts become battles of blanks and bravado vs. live bullets when they anger the local drug lord a macho violent little boy (Brandon Soo Hoo). TROPIC THUNDER  out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language including sexual references violent content and drug material. Stiller who co-wrote and directed is generous to his co-stars allowing Downey to scamper off with the acting honors. His performance as a guy playing a guy playing a guy is a layer cake of clever observation politically incorrect daring and self-mockery. Black chews up the screen as a Chris Farley/John Belushi type on a drug-fueled rampage. Jay Baruchel plays a bright nebbishy rookie actor and Brandon T. Jackson is a rapper named Alpa Chino (say it out loud) whos anxious to cross over into movies. Jacksons testy debates with Downey over the authenticity of his performance are among the movies comic treasures. The film veers between action comedy and industry in-jokes at a manic pace. The pampered neurotic actors fret about their performances while real machine-gun fire whizzes around their ears. Stillers Speedman is a dimwitted hambone whose stardom hinges more on his buffed-up physique than talent; his ripoff of ""Platoons"" iconic scene of a wounded soldier in the posture of Christ on the cross is a keen send-up of hey-look-at-me overacting. Back in Hollywood two-faced agents and vulgar studio heads get a vigorous send-up by two top stars whose identities out of respect for the spoiler-sensitive shall remain secret. Even movie trailers and elaborate promotional cardboard standees come in for their share of ridicule. The in-jokes which might have been too obscure a few years ago will ring true for anyone who has tuned in to ""Access Hollywood"" or surfed past TMZ. ""Tropic Thunder"" works double duty. Its both a sharp satire of filmlands bigger-is-better mind-set and a prime example of the heavyhanded era it stands in.

"Tropic Thunder | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tropic-thunder ) Tropic Thunder (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Just when it was starting to look like the concept of a ""funny comedy"" has gone out of vogue along comes Pineapple Express and its cinematic cousin Tropic Thunder. The latter film which has emerged from the warped mind of Ben Stiller is a little nastier than the former but no less hilarious. With a cast that many movies would die for Tropic Thunder takes no prisoners. It treks into taboo areas and emerges mostly unscathed. The film isnt perfect - its a little too long and some scenes arent as funny as the filmmakers think they are - but in an environment where things like The Love Guru and Step Brothers pass for worthwhile entertainment Tropic Thunder puts a lot of comedy pretenders to shame. This is movie that tells the story of the making of a movie based on a fake true story about a Vietnam War hero. Three of Hollywoods biggest stars are involved. Theres Speedman (Ben Stiller) a one-time box office champion whose better days as an action star are behind him. Heroin-addicted Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is best known for starring in The Fatties a movie which based on the evidence appears to be 90 minutes of flatulence jokes. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is an Oscar-decorated method actor who goes to extremes to play roles such as receiving ""pigment alteration"" in order to take on the part of an African American soldier. They are joined by Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). The director Damien (Steve Coogan) decides that a little realism couldnt hurt the production so he drops his stars in the middle of a jungle and decides to make the movie guerilla style. But some drug dealers become involved and suddenly the actors are under fire for real and not sure whats fake and what isnt. Tropic Thunder is for the most part one long rip of movie-making. If theres an aspect of the Hollywood system and how things get made that isnt put through the ringer Im not sure what it is. Stiller knows the ins-and-outs of the process and isnt afraid to shine a spotlight on them. Sure hes tweaked things to make them funny but one gets the sense that theres more than a kernel of truth in what hes presenting megalomaniacal producers self-important directors actors convinced that they are bigger than the movie agents who obsess over meaningless details and so on. The most controversial aspect of Tropic Thunder is the decision to put Robert Downey Jr. in blackface. To call this a dangerous move is to understate matters. But Stiller has intelligence to go along with his balls. First he chooses one of the best working actors to take on the part and Downey sells it. Second he puts a real African American (Jackson) opposite Downey and lets the latter tear into the former. The point of giving Downey black skin is to illustrate how shallow the Hollywood system is some producers would rather have a ""name"" actor in a totally unsuitable role than take a risk on someone more appropriate but less well-known. Its also a knock on those actors who believe that theyre so good they can play any role. Downey portrays Lazarus as a man so totally in love with himself and his ability that he cant see how his work could be deemed offensive even when Chino points out the obvious. Of the three leads Ben Stiller and Jack Black are fine but neither is in the same league as Downey when it comes to getting laughs. The films real acting intrigue lies in the list of supporting performers. At one point I think it was intended to be a secret that Tom Cruise is in the film but the cats out of the bag. The fat balding profanity-spewing mogul is the almost unrecognizable Top Gun star proving that hes not above moving beyond his comfort zone. Cruise doesnt do many comedies and hes never played a part quite like this one before. Other big actors taking small parts are Matthew McConaughey and Nick Nolte. And as one might expect from someone like Stiller who knows and is liked by nearly everyone in Hollywood there are a large number of cameos. There are similarities between Tropic Thunder and Pineapple Express beyond the fact that both films get a lot of mileage out of side-splitting R-rated humor. (It should be noted that Tropic Thunder is a rare rude crude comedy that is not in any way associated with Judd Apatow or any of his close associates.) Both films weave overblown action scenes into their less-than-serious material and neither film shrinks from gore. However where Pineapple Express derives laughs from a mangled ear Tropic Thunder takes things a step further. The film is so high energy and over-the-top that its likely to exhaust many audience members long before the closing credits roll. Thats often a problem with comedies that run longer than 90 minutes. And while McConaughey and Cruise work in their parts Nick Nolte doesnt seem to fit. His character is intended to be gruff but Nolte plays the part a little too seriously. The actor is apt at making action comedies - his 48 Hours is among the best - but hes a square peg in a round hole here. Tropic Thunder opens brilliantly with a fake soda commercial and a few real-seeming trailers that will have half the audience unsure whether the movie has begun. The actual movie isnt on par with this prologue material but it doesnt have to be. Its good enough to get laughs and the flaws arent bigger than the stuff that works. Stiller shows no fear and throws in copious pop culture references that range from Star Trek (a clip from the episode ""Arena"") to Close Encounters (a mound of heroin that looks like Devils Tower) to N Sync. Tropic Thunder understands movies understands the system in which they are created and most of all knows what it takes to make an audience roar with laughter.

A topflight cast gleefully skewering explosions-over-exposition Hollywood action films as well as the people who make them sounds like a cant-miss proposition. And at times the movie plays that way. Alas not always. There are some very good things about Tropic Thunder. Robert Downey Jr.s well-publicized turn as an Australian actor who has his skin dyed so that he can play a Black sergeant in the film within the film is as fascinating as it is funny. (""I know who I am Im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude"") The script by Ben Stiller (who also directs and stars) Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen spares no one - actors directors producers managers consultants whomever - in its deflation of ego. Best of all a surprise appearance by an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise as an amazingly profane studio executive (who is a good dancer to boot) is side-splittingly funny. But eventually the film falls prey to what its satirizing - its not quite smart enough to pull off what its attempting. A series of fake trailers establishes the actors in a new film about the Vietnam War called Tropic Thunder. Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is an action star whose signature franchise is losing steam. His one stab at legitimate acting Simple Jack in which he plays a mentally challenged character was an embarrassing mess. Kirk Lazarus (Downey) meanwhile is a five-time Oscar winner a method actor in the extreme (thus the skin dye). Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a fat comic actor best known for a series of films in which his characters go-to joke is to fart. And Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) is a rapper who wants to be taken seriously as an actor (say his rapper name aloud). They set off to make the most expensive action movie ever filmed (an inside joke; Tropic Thunder is reputedly the most-expensive R-rated film ever made). The filming in Southeast Asia goes badly and the studio is threatening to pull the movie from its director (Steve Coogan). Drunk and desperate he takes his actors into the heart of the jungle planning to film guerrilla style. This doesnt work out so well. Not only does the director run into his own problem the soldiers of a 12-year-old drug lord (Brandon Soo Hoo) mistake the actors for real troops. Of course it takes a while for the self-absorbed actors to realize this. As they wander through the jungle theyre more interested in scoring drugs and talking about acting technique. (In one hilarious scene Lazarus explains to Speedman why Speedman didnt nail the character in Simple Jack in a way the Oscars would love - ""never go full retard."") Speedman is captured and forced to perform Simple Jack and starts to drift into Apocalypse Now-like delusion. His co-stars have to rescue him which leads to much mayhem. The better parts of this segment take place back in LA where Speedmans agent (Matthew McConaughey) weighs a deal with the devil - is it worth trying to get his star client back? As good as the Hollywood-insider bits are Stiller takes the action seriously. But its as dumb and loud as it is in the films Tropic Thunder parodies. Maybe thats the problem - you cant parody something so innately ridiculous. Stiller Black and Jackson are all fine. Downey is great - no surprise. Jay Baruchel as a newcomer holds the strained plot threads together playing the only actor not so narcissistic that he cant see whats going on around him. Whatever Tropic Thunders shortcomings the scene that plays under the closing credits is so unhinged (Cruise again) and bizarrely funny that youll walk away in a forgiving mood even as you wish the film had reached the heights its grasping for.

This needs explaining. Ben Stillers movie is about a gaggle of pampered self-important Hollywood folks who go into the jungle to shoot a big-budget Vietnam War movie (called ""Tropic Thunder"") and stumble into real danger when heavily armed drug smugglers take them for the real deal. But like any ""real"" movie ""Thunder"" starts with a few trailers. The first is a frenetic ad for ""Booty Sweat"" energy drinks which turns out to be the product of rapper turned actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) who we will soon discover is one of the stars of this Southeast Asian war epic. This is followed by more priceless fake trailers of upcoming movies from ""Tropic Thunder"" stars. Tug Speedman (Stiller) is a fading action star (""Scorcher VI"") whos tried (and failed) to earn respectability by playing a retarded farm boy in ""Simple Jack."" The belligerent drug-addled comedy star Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is seen in ""The Fatties 2"" a fart-filled sendup of every lowbrow Hollywood comedy in the past flatulent decade. And the multiple-Oscar-winning Australian actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is glimpsed in his upcoming forbidden-love epic as a medieval monk making eyes at Tobey Maguire. Can the movie itself live up to this inspired warm-up? No problem. This raucous low-down commentary on Hollywood filmmaking war movies narcissistic actors and the thin line between makebelieve and reality is the most giddily entertaining wickedly smart and cinematically satisfying comedy in a season overloaded with yuk-em-ups. If theres any justice ""Thunder"" (which opens Aug. 13) should be the breakthrough moment for Stiller as a director.Stiller the director? Mention his name and the first image that probably comes to most minds is a pathetic suitor standing in a doorway facing Cameron Diaz with a gob of semen dangling from his ear. The Farrelly brothers gross-out classic ""Theres Something About Mary"" (1998) catapulted Stiller into the pantheon of comic stars. Hes become one of the 10 most highly paid actors in Hollywood and arguably one of the most powerful. But the funny thing was acting stardom was never his real dream. Stiller is now in Vancouver starring in a sequel to his popular family film ""Night at the Museum."" Sitting in a hotel room drinking coffee after a long days shoot the 42-year-old star remembers the moment he discovered his calling--to make movies. He was 20 performing in a 1986 revival of John Guares ""The House of Blue Leaves"" on Broadway when he picked up a video camera and made a little movie called ""Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man"" with the shows star John Mahoney. ""He played the most arrogant alcoholic a--hole passed out in the gutter at the Plymouth Theater with a bottle in his hand. I remember showing it at a party and people laughing. It was one of those moments where I was going Oh wow this is good. I like this feeling. This is sort of what I want to do.""Hollywood had other ideas. Not long after that Stiller snagged a job as a writer-performer on ""Saturday Night Live."" Most aspiring comics would have killed for this slot but he quit after five episodes because ""SNL"" didnt want him to direct short satiric movies for the show. He came closer to realizing his ambition with ""The Ben Stiller Show"" a 1992 Fox series that ran for 12 episodes garnered an Emmy and a cult following but was canceled when it landed near the bottom of the ratings. But in this show (which is available on DVD) you can get a true sense of his range as a performer his gifts as a satirist fluent in the cliches of our media-saturated culture. Fans of the show (which Stiller created with coproducer and writer Judd Apatow) still cherish his hilarious impersonations of Bruce Springsteen Bono Tom Cruise and self-help tycoon Tony Robbins or the ""Cops"" parody where he tries to arrest Moses for parting the Red Sea without a permit. Here was someone capable of holding up a uniquely distorted fun-house mirror to our self-conscious age. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Stiller got to direct his first movie in 1994. ""Reality Bites"" which he starred in with Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke was a funny hip Gen-X romantic comedy but it died a quick death at the box office. Two years later he made ""The Cable Guy"" a dark deliberately grating comedy of menace whose failure was magnified by the fact that Jim Carrey earned a then-unheard-of 20 million to star in it which seemed to increase the medias dislike for the movie. It would be five years before the next Stiller-directed movie ""Zoolander"" his wacky wild satire of the fashion world. Its since become a cult classic--Stiller says its the movie most people want to talk to him about--but it had the misfortune of coming out right after 9/11 and America wasnt ready to laugh.But by the time of ""Zoolander"" Stiller had already become a bona fide A-list actor. His stardom however is harder to classify than Will Ferrells or Adam Sandlers or Jim Carreys theyre comic brand names who carry their movies on the force of their trademark personas. Stiller has always been more of an ensemble player at his most popular when hes playing the brunt of the joke. Humiliation is the default mode of all of Stillers most commercially successful roles. In ""Meet the Parents"" (2000) and its wildly popular (and wildly inferior) sequel ""Meet the Fockers"" (2004) hes a psychic punching bag for Robert De Niro; in ""Night at the Museum"" he plays hapless divorced father Larry Daley reduced to taking a job as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History where the wax dummies come to life and terrorize him. Some of his funniest performances however have been playing the flip side of the bedraggled Stiller persona. The fashion model Derek Zoolander may be a dimwit but hes a supremely arrogant self-confident one. The preening pumped-up fitness guru in ""Dodgeball"" is also an idiot but hes so in love with himself he doesnt seem to notice. Stiller could do serious too playing junkie/writer Jerry Stahl in ""Permanent Midnight.""You can see his skills as a team player on the set of ""Night at the Museum 2."" Hes playing a scene with Hank Azaria whos a vengeful Egyptian mummy come to life and no two takes are alike. ""Who are you Larry Daley?"" improvises Azaria. ""And why dont you speak in complete sentences?"" Its unclear how Stiller keeps a straight face because its a dead-on critique of the way he plays the stumbling character--and so many of his tentative beleaguered heroes guys who forge through life in a defensive crouch anticipating insult.""Tropic Thunder"" is also very much an ensemble comedy but theres no doubt whose show it is Stiller not only directed it he co-wrote coproduced and stars in it. Every frame is stamped with his lifelong obsession with what Jerry Stiller and Anne Mearas son was born into the lives of actors. The four ""Thunder"" prima donnas--Stillers Speedman Downeys Lazarus Blacks Portnoy and Jacksons Alpa Chino along with the intimidated newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel)--are sent into the jungle by the films desperate in-over-his-head British director (Steve Coogan). The production has been plagued by disasters. Back in Hollywood the obscenity-spewing studio head Lee Grossman (a bald hilariously repulsive Tom Cruise) is threatening to fire the director unless he gets better footage. Spurred on by the grizzled Vietnam vet (Nick Nolte) whose autobiography inspired the film the director sends his actors in country without a crew or assistants hoping to capture grittily realistic reactions. He gets more than he bargained for when real bullets start to fly and Speedman is taken hostage by the Red Dragon Army whose 12-year-old boss turns out to be a fan of one of Speedmans most unlikely movies. Downeys Lazarus is the movies most unforgettable jest. A fanatically committed method actor he surgically darkens his skin to play the part of African-American Sgt. Lincoln Osiris and refuses to go out of character even when the cameras stop rolling to the extreme annoyance of the authentically black Alpa Chino. Downey is astonishing hes so deep into this double role that when the characters ghetto accent occasionally falters it slips into an Aussie accent.Stillers movie is of course filled with in-jokes and movie quotations (look for ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""). But it doesnt have an insular inside-baseball feel because as nutty as it gets it actually works as an action movie itself. Shot by John Toll (""Legends of the Fall"") ""Thunder"" has the production values of the movies its sending up. (Its rumored to have a budget near 150 million.) In ""Zoolander"" the fashionista satire didnt quite mesh with the ""Manchurian Candidate"" plot about assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia. Here thanks to the inventive tight script by Stiller Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen you find yourself caring about the survival of these ridiculous but oddly endearing thespians. The comic momentum doesnt flag the gunfire and explosions balanced by inspired riffs. One of the best is Downey/Lazaruss memorable discourse to Stiller/Speedman on how to win an Oscar playing handicapped characters--you cant do the ""full retard"" as Speedman did in ""Simple Jack"" but only the ""half-retard"" as Dustin Hoffman did in ""Rain Man."" And Cruises blisteringly raunchy cameo (the character was his own invention) may be just the imagealtering career move he needs.The joke within the joke within the joke is that the making of the comedy ""Tropic Thunder"" has spawned its own share of war stories. ""We called it Ben Stillers Comedy Death Camp"" says Downey who actually loved working with Stiller but suggests that not everyone on the crew survived the directors take-no-prisoners perfectionism. Acting may be a team sport for Stiller but not directing. ""His process is sublime"" Downey marvels. ""The first two days we were shooting the scene within the scene where Osiris gets his head shot off. We did that setup 107000 times I thought to myself were never gonna get off that shot""Sitting down for an interview simply dressed in jeans and a blue shirt over a dark blue T shirt Stiller seems like a down-to-earth relaxed guy--until you notice that for the entire two and a half hours he never once leans back on the couch hes sitting on. Hes gun-shy about talking about his personal life going off the record even with innocuous personal stories. (Years ago he got burned when Esquire taking a joking aside seriously labeled him a manic-depressive a fake factoid that has followed him ever since.) When he talks about the making of ""Tropic Thunder"" it sounds as if he is recalling a pleasant seaside vacation ""My favorite time in life is when working on a film"" he says.His actors wouldnt necessarily agree. ""Hes incredibly knowledgeable and incredibly driven--almost sociopathic"" says Downey. ""But his divining rod is always pointing to the same thing have we given literally every ounce of energy and thought to every frame of the movie? It really is the closest thing to what it must have been like to work with Chaplin"" says Downey--who memorably played Chaplin.""Can Downey get his head any farther up Bens a--?"" roars Jack Black when he hears about the Chaplin remark. ""Ill say hes Albert Einstein"" But Black concurs with Downeys assessment of Stillers obsessive work ethic (""Its that OCD eye"") and his generosity. ""Its hard not to give yourself sweet spots when youre directing yourself"" Black says thinking of some actor-directors who will shortchange the other cast members so that they can focus on their own performances. ""Hed defer to the others. I have a bit of the perfectionist in me too and hed let me linger until I felt I nailed the scene. Hes good to his peeps.""It may be Stillers destiny as a filmmaker to make movies about the movie business. Three of the projects hes developing including one about Oscar Levant and a movie of the classic Hollywood novel ""What Makes Sammy Run?"" return to his favorite bred-in-the-bone subject. And in his own life this second-generation funnyman has recently come full circle. Though he and his family--wife Christine Taylor (who costarred with him in ""Dodgeball"" and ""Zoolander"") and their two kids--live most of the time in L.A. hes just bought an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the same building as his parents the building he grew up in. ""It just seems like my family has come together in the past 10 years. It was a pretty hectic household growing up just because of the nature of what my parents did. There was a lot of craziness--thats just actors and acting. But about a year ago we brought the whole family to New York and surprised my dad for his 80th birthday. We all went down to the playground on Riverside Park. It was this moment of feeling it all come around seeing my son playing in the sandbox that I played in. So I think its a great thing for the family that were all in a place that we want to do this. But well see. Well stick our toe in the water and see how it goes."" And if it doesnt go well dont be surprised if one day he turns it into a comedy.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Plus Woody Allens redemptive muse. By David Edelstein Published Aug 10 2008 ShareThis (Photo Merie Weismiller/Courtesy of Dreamworks Illustration by Wes Duvall) The Ben Stiller action-film parody Tropic Thunder is all over the map but its worth enduring the botched gags formula plotting and even the racism to marvel at the genius of Robert Downey Jr. The movie centers on the catastrophic making of a Southeast Asian war epic and Downey plays one of its stars Kirk Lazarus an edgy Aussie modeled on Russell Crowe who gets so deep into his characters that hes a thorough pain in ass. When we meet Kirk hes had his skin surgically darkened to embody a badass Negro circa 1971 the heyday of Richard Roundtree and Fred Williamson. This is thin ice but with Brandon T. Jackson playing a black actor who expresses constant incredulity at Kirks incessant references to his people the stunt has some irony built in. But theres a bigger reason the portrait isnt offensive As much as Downey sends up the Shafts and Super Flys he respects the beauty and weight and potency of the archetype. He drops his voice an octave (at least) and what comes out is gorgeous. He really does make a damn fine Negro. BACKSTORY Tropic Thunder has had a full blockbuster rollout with an American Idol appearance by the stars a tie-in energy drink called Booty Sweat and a USO screening for troops at Camp Pendleton. But not all of the advance press has gone as planned by DreamWorks. Disability-rights groups persuaded the studio to pull the fake movie Website simplejack.com which used the word retard to describe a Forrest Gumplike role played by Stillers character. Putting blackface on Downey Jr. has raised some hackles but black co-star Brandon T. Jackson told People he wasnt offended To be honest he played a black dude better than anybody Ive seen Downey has always had a gift for getting into supernatural synch with his material. In his early comedies he was breezy but with a dash of morbidity. (The result of his Hollywood counterculture upbringing?) When it was time to play darker roles like the self-destructive druggie in Less Than Zero all he had to do was shift the balancelessen the breeziness up the morbidity. Even at his most glibly charming he seemed haunted by self-awareness He had the best inner B.S. detector in movies. Downey is too serious about his craft to make Kirk Lazarus a second-rater. When he engages his co-star Speedman (Stiller) about the latters failed foray into Oscar-bait territory as a mentally-disabled man. Kirk says Speedmans mistake was not giving the character more stature You never go the full retard. The scenethe movies best by farisnt just a brilliant jab at Hollywoods penchant for noble fools. Its great because Kirk is from an acting perspective right. Bits like that give Tropic Thunder a wonderful postmodern satirical hook. Stiller and actor Justin Theroux devised the story and brought in Etan Coen to help polish the Method-acting gags (did he write the full retard?) and when the movie works it has a hallucinatory blend of parody and dangerwith John Tolls extraordinarily lush cinematography evoking real Vietnam War epics. When the film set collapses into prima donna bickering Nick Noltes hilariously grizzled John Four Leaf Tayback (who wrote the Vietnam memoir on which the film-within-a-film is based) tells the director (Steve Coogan) to take these pansified thespians into the jungle and turn them into real soldiers. Unfortunately they touch down near a real Thai drug-smuggling camp and it takes a while for them to realize those bullets being fired at them are real. The fizz goes out of the movie though when a character steps on a mine and chunks of his body rain downnot so funny in a world where IED victims come home in body bags every week. Jack Black makes little of a bum role as a Chris Farleylike junkie but as Speedmans agent Matthew McConaughey has lots of gonzo pep but never finds a rhythm. The show-off cameo is by Tom Cruise in a bald cap as an obscenity-spouting Jewish mogul. Hes funny but less because of anything he does than because its Tom Cruise playing gross. Watching Cruise rant and wave his arms you can see the tension he carries in his shoulders. He never loosens up enough to inhabit a characterany character. But Downey is loose as a goose His flexibilityphysical and emotionalis inspiring. His Kirk craves authenticity so deeply that you want to believe hes a black actor playing a black soldier. And Downey craves authenticity so deeply that you want to believe hes an Aussie actor playing a black actor playing a black soldier. This is a trivial movie but the performance means so much. There are two possible avenues for the artist in winter rage against the withering of the flesh or like Woody Allen in Vicky Cristina Barcelona stick with exploring youngish dilemmas from a wry-geezers vantage via flesh that is emphatically non-withered (toned hot horny). Allens latest film features a narrator (Christopher Evan Welsh) who relays in even tones the tale of dishy twentysomething American friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) with opposite philosophies of life and how their respective worldviews are tested over the course of a summer in Spain by a lusty painter (Javier Bardem) and his tempestuous gun-toting ex-wife (Penelope Cruz). Allen doesnt waste much time dramatizing those worldviews. The narrator simply announces that Vickyin Spain to study every aspect of Catalan culturebelieves in order and commitment and is poised to marry a yuppie and move to Greenwich Connecticut and that Cristina is spontaneous unruly and commitment-phobic. When Juan Antonio (Bardem) strides up to them in a restaurant and invites them to fly off with him in a private plane (Life is shit life is full of pain why not pleasure ourselves while we may?) Vicky gasps at his effrontery while Cristina puffs out her pillowy lips and eats the swarthy suitor with her eyes. Then theyre all on that plane Vicky Cristina Juan Antonio and of course the attentive narrator always spelling out whats in our heroines heads. 1 2 Next Share this story...

A smart-alecky sendup of Hollywood in general and action films in particular ""Tropic Thunder"" undeniably provokes quite a few laughs but of the most hollow kind. Ben Stillers star-laden farce makes every effort to be outrageous as it pokes knowing fun at a troupe of spoiled self-centered actors who get more than they bargained for making a ""Rambo""-like rescue drama in Southeast Asia. Apart from startling out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise however the antics here are pretty thin redundant and one-note. But that note will strike a chord with a substantial comic heat-seeking audience particularly of the fanboy and combat-ready stripes making for hefty late-summer biz. Seven years after his most recent directorial effort ""Zoolander"" Stiller who penned the script with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen is working on a bigger canvas this time but to similar effect as in his fashion-world satire; once again he goofs on a familiar creative milieu in intermittently inspired but obvious ways while himself playing a one-time superstar whose career is on the wane. Nutty tone is instantly set by four faux trailers that intro the stars of the forthcoming Vietnam epic. Along with Stillers Tugg Speedman whose ""Scorcher"" action franchise has run its course there are fart-comedy king Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) serious-aspiring hip-hop star Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and Downeys Kirk Lazarus an Oscar-enshrined Australian actor. The mock teaser for Lazarus latest a tale of illicit gay love between two Middle Ages priests (the other cameoed by Tobey Maguire) is hilariously marked by meaningful stares and exaggerated foreboding. Once in the field the film-within-the-film ""Tropic Thunder"" doesnt go well. After getting reamed by industry uber-tycoon Lee Grossman (Cruise) for not having the cameras rolling on a multimillion-dollar explosion the films crazed Brit director (Steve Coogan in predictably manic form) decides the only thing to do is to take the leads -- who also include bespectacled newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) -- deep into the jungle without crew assistants or cell phones and make them endure a trial by fire in the cause of heightened cinematic realism. The surprise which isnt much of one is that the hunters become the hunted after being attacked by drug-dealing guerrillas who use real ammo. Not unlike the pampered out-of-touch celebrities at the center of the action the film itself suffers from a lack of grounding. Wacked-out comedy with nutjob characters can certainly operate with artificial logic of its own but ""Tropic Thunder"" which is rooted to recognizable real-world points of reference is undermined by innumerable small details that dont feel right. Would a film like this have a middle-aged first-time director? Can anyone buy that surveillance cameras positioned around the jungle will yield a showable movie? Five Oscars already for fortyish Lazarus? Its actually the larger absurdities that yield real comic dividends. First and foremost Lazarus is a white actor so devoted to his art that he undergoes a pigment dye job to play a black soldier. This potentially risible stunt is put in relief by having the humorously named Alpa Chino played by an actual black thesp Jackson ride Lazarus mercilessly about having usurped a role that should have gone to another brother. Whatever political spin people will want to put on it the audacity of Downeys performance reps the best reason to see the film. Always a brilliant mimic and quicksilver vocalist Downey dons matted hair beard ghetto-spiked rasp and nearly Olivier-as-Othello makeup to play a grandly self-confident thesp who will take no crap from anyone about his impersonation. Although nowhere near as sustained or inflected Cruises extended cameo as a Hollywood Satan is the other highlight. Looking uglier than one could ever have imagined possible Cruise has been transformed into a bald-pated hirsute porcine sulfur-mouthed terrorizer who rules the roost from a high-tech bunker. At any greater length the characterization would have to be deepened or it would become tiresome but Cruise gives it an unexpected spin that makes this a wonderful match with his ferocious supporting turn in ""Magnolia."" Beyond these the performances arent anything to write home about. As in ""Zoolander"" Stiller under his own direction is mostly about facial and bodily posing the blond-tressed Blacks hyperventilating act as a drug-crazed comic wears out its welcome almost before it begins Jackson is just OK as the rapper looking for a new career dimension and Baruchel recedes into the background as things grind on. Nick Nolte is perfect casting for the grizzled truculent author of the autobiographical book that inspires the film although how this character evolves proves unsatisfying. Matthew McConaughey aces the supporting role of Speedmans slick but besieged agent. One of the films other casting coups is Brandon Soo Hoo a diminutive 12-year-old who portrays the fierce cigar-chomping commander of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon rebels. Probably the most politically incorrect detail of the film is that Speedman is renowned among these remote natives not for his action pics but for ""Simple Jack"" an embarrassing bid for Oscar glory in which he played a retarded man. Thesps captors force him to re-enact the role as live-evening entertainment and Lazarus learned recitation of famous actors who played ""retards"" reps a comic high point. Although gussied up visually to the fullest extent of ace lenser John Tolls ability Stillers direction remains prosaic. Action is sparked by no end of gunfire explosions violent action verbal eruptions and visual grossouts which keep the film bouncing along even as the characters and story become no more dimensional than they were at the outset. Tech credits are fine although some musical choices are overly familiar.
