A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Stark is garishly ""out"" as Iron Man performing a one-man air show before touching down to host his Stark Expo which transforms the Worlds Fairground at Flushing Meadows Park into Atlantic City where he performs in front of backup dancers and a plasma stars-and-stripes reminiscent of Miley Cyruss ""Party in the USA"" video. Tony works the crowd just as he does the U.S. Congress--at a Senate hearing called to question his withholding of Iron Man technology from the military Tony blows out on a crisp sound bite ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" His Q Score in other words is just as high as Robert Downey Jr. director Jon Favreau and Iron Mans was after 2008.The Iron Man conglomerate will have to overcome its undeniably murky sequel while Tony has to deal with the murderous envy created by conspicuous success. Enter Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) a rogue Russian physicist introduced in Dostoyevskian squalor blue with prison tattoos. A lifelong grudge against the Stark family inspires him to weld together his own knockoff suit and become an Underground Iron Man equipped with live-wire bullwhips. Hell find a sponsor in CEO Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) a Tony Stark imitator missing the crucial mojo whose Hammer Industries finishes a consistent second place to Stark.The screenplay by Justin Theroux trusts that More Is More. Theres techie lifestyle porn hot cars hot guns establishing shots jetting from Moscow to Malibu to Monaco (the first major set piece takes place at the Grand Prix) and three dozen comic books worth of exposition girdled into two straining hours. Tony must revisit his unresolved feelings toward his dead Captain of Industry father deal with pressure from the military (via Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard as Army liaison buddy ""Rhodey"" Rhodes) and even invent a new element which somehow involves a hidden code in the Worlds Fair Unisphere.Sam Jacksons Agent Nick Fury shows up to eat up more time. If youre not a comic-book reader these scenes may as well have been scripted in Wingdings while initiates will understand that Fury is here essentially to do press for the upcoming Avengers movie. This sub-subplot is symptomatic of the franchise-first mindset in the era of the 200M ""Episode"" where films are constructed less as freestanding edifices than as elements in superstructures (for example the transposition of the entire Marvel Universe to film). The idea is that we learn to trust that any extraneous-seeming thread will connect to something in another couple of summers and pay off assuming the movie does--and an army of True Believers whod line up if Marvel Studios offered their movies by subscription service are pretty good collateral.The elements that made the first Iron Man a rather likable blockbuster have not entirely evaporated. Favreau brings together interesting American movie stars and lets them actually play through scenes (even though Rourke and Rockwell play theirs together as if in two different--both interesting--movies). Downey Jr. gives his glibness a vulnerable twitch; his out-of-control drunk bust-up at his birthday party while wearing his heavy-ordnance suit suggests a more dangerous more interesting sequel. Stark still compulsively slips wisecracks under and between everyone elses lines bedeviling aide-de-camp ""Pepper"" Potts (Downey Jr. seems to be flirting more with himself than with Pepper actress Gwyneth Paltrow). The stealthy delivery forgives the fact that a lot of Tonys quips are lame puns. Pepper ""What are you going to Google her now?"" Tony ""I thought I was ogling her."" This is referring to Scarlett Johansson here as ""Natalie Rushman"" a Stark Industries lawyer who may not be what she seems looking fresh off a 1945 Photoplay cover with wavy auburn tresses and dresses whose engineering is more awe-inducing than any of the gadgetry.Natalie later breaks out a cat suit and commands the movies most legible action scene neutralizing about a dozen security guards in creative fashion as she sashays down a corridor. As for the actual grand finale Downey Jr. and Cheadle seem like theyre already network gaming the PS3 release instead of facing any actual threat and Rourke goes out like a chump.1 Underground Iron Man equipped with live-wire bullwhips Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Iron Man 2 Slick but unspectacular - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Iron Man 2 Slick but unspectacular By Tom Charity Special to CNN Robert Downey Jr. returns as maverick inventor-industrialist Tony Stark in ""Iron Man 2."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSIn the sequel to the 2008 blockbuster Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony StarkFilm also stars Sam Rockwell Mickey Rourke Gwyneth PaltrowWhile not as stunning as the original ""Iron Man 2"" is still a sharp snappy comic book movie (CNN) -- The first ""Iron Man"" boasted a not-so-secret weapon in Robert Downey Jr. reveling in his bad-boy rep as the maverick inventor-industrialist Tony Stark. A combination of Bill Gates Howard Hughes and Hugh Hefner Stark had more than his share of character flaws for a superhero. Unlike Bruce Wayne he couldnt keep his heroics to himself and unlike Clark Kent he knew how to party ... Beginning part two in triumphal mode as the star attraction at the Stark Expo Tony remains a loose cannon even if he prefers to think of himself as a human shield or ""an enhanced prosthetic"" as he tells the Senate committee charged with reminding Iron Man of his patriotic duty. They want an invincible army not a one-man defense system. Stark is having none of it. Hes too good for government work. ""You should thank me"" he tells them. ""Ive privatized world peace."" But the politicians arent the only ones who want a piece of him. So does rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and more pressingly Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) a Russian who has a bone to pick with the Stark family and a shortcut to the kind of technology that could prove a real threat. Add to that the realization that his new artificial ticker is slowly poisoning him and theres more than enough to bring this shooting star back down to Earth. The trouble with this sprawling scenario (credited to Justin Theroux of ""Tropic Thunder"" fame) is that it mutes Downeys cavalier charisma. Hes still what makes this show tick but Im not sure we want to see him wrestling with his own mortality when its his instinctive immorality thats his sexiest attribute. Still returning director Jon Favreau has seen to it that the supporting actors (including one Jon Favreau as chauffeur Happy Hogan) are ready to step up and take a turn in the spotlight. Theres Samuel L Jackson in an eye-patch continuing to lay the groundwork for his own Marvel vehicles ""Nick Fury"" and ""Avengers."" Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper Potts gets a well-deserved promotion. Sam Rockwell struts his stuff in a fun satire of an out-of-control CEO. And Scarlett Johansson peels on the rubber cat suit as undercover agent Natasha Romanoff. (Sadly shes restricted to just the one showpiece action sequence and even then shes eating Hit-Girls ""Kick-Ass"" dust). Video Chatting with the Iron Man 2 cast RELATED TOPICS Iron Man 2 Robert Downey Jr. Jon Favreau Gwyneth Paltrow And then theres Mickey Rourke. Covered in Russian tattoos and with a salt and pepper goatee he strides the wrong way round a Formula One Grand Prix stripped to the waist slicing racing cars in two with a crack of his supercharged whips. Rourke doesnt say much and half of what he does say is in Russian but he can sit silent and motionless and let Downey or Rockwell talk at him for a full minute and still command our rapt attention. To the extent that ""Iron Man 2"" gets its groove back Rourkes sly bad guy is the reactive core. Unlike some blockbuster directors Favreau is most comfortable with the actors making the scenes play. Hes less adept at the hydraulics. The whiz-bang stuff here -- while never less than slick -- doesnt produce anything we havent seen before. The movies biggest problem is that the fight scenes arent all that maybe because the outcome is never in question. If thats the pay-off for what remains a sharper snappier comic book movie then so be it but heres hoping the next one doesnt completely lose its edge.

BOTTOM LINE Not as fresh as the first time but a respectable popcorn movie. CAST Robert Downey Jr. Mickey Rourke Gwyneth Paltrow Scarlett Johansson LENGTH 205 World-conquering madman? Its been done. Terrorism? Too sensitive. Complicated plot to lure major countries into an apocalyptic missile exchange? No but warmer. The makers of ""Iron Man 2"" have found their plot in the Cold War an era of mutually assured destruction that felt like history until Iran began raising fresh fears. This being a superhero movie however the arms race isnt for nukes but for shiny metal suits. ""Iron Man 2"" begins not with a pyrotechnic battle but with a congressional hearing an increasingly familiar arena these days. Weapons mogul Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) now publicly known as Iron Man is refusing to share his body-armor technology with the government while competing weapons-maker Justin Hammer played by a delightfully annoying Sam Rockwell wants to be the contractor of choice. advertisement | advertise on newsday Iran actually appears in a cameo as itself a rogue state whose suits dont quite work. But one man has figured it out. His name is Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and his gold teeth and Russian accent are distinctly pre-perestroika. As in the first ""Iron Man"" the main attraction here isnt the plot but Downey who again uses snark and charm to lubricate this slightly rusty Marvel hero. But there also are pathos (Starks palladium-powered heart is poisoning him) bathos (his distant father played by John Slattery of ""Mad Men"" appears in a crucial scene) and the merest suggestion of sex (Scarlett Johansson plays the curvaceous Black Widow).

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 7 2010 Save for later Saved Iron Man 2 shown in a scene in this film publicity image opens Friday on more than 4000 screens nationwide. Industrial Light and Magic/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What would ""Iron Man 2"" be without Robert Downey Jr.? I asked the same question of ""Iron Man"" and with one exception the query still applies. That exception however is a big one. As Ivan Vanko the mad Russian physicist hellbent on eradicating His Ironness Mickey Rourke almost pumps new blood into a franchise that is already starting to show its age.The appeal of ""Iron Man 2"" as with its predecessor is having a superhero who is not quite super and not altogether heroic. Billionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark revealed at the end of the last film that he was the armor-suited Iron Man and it didnt seem to faze anybody very much least of all Tony.For such an extreme narcissist a secret identity would only represent excess baggage anyway. Without it Tony is free to be his usual hyperobnoxious self and save the world at the same time. In ""Iron Man 2"" at least for its first hour or so Tony is more blisteringly self-infatuated than ever. As he crows in front of a Senate panel grilling him about his refusal to provide the military with Iron Man technology ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" And so he has. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? RELATED Why Iron Man 2 ignores Hollywood 3D mania Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Iron Man 2 review Iron Man is often described as a pacifist warrior but the reason no wars have broken out with him around is because his armored firepower can best anybody. He doesnt manufacture weapons anymore because he doesnt need to. He makes deterrence sexy.Everything changes when Ivan who bears a humongous grudge against Tonys family arrives on the scene with a self-made armored suit of his own equipped with laserlike whips that can slice even Tonys Rolls Royce in two. Ivan also comes equipped with a pet cockatoo and so many body tattoos that hes like a living artwork. As Tony rightly says of him ""You look like you have friends in low places."" Ivan also has at least one low friend in high places - smarmy rival industrialist Justin Hammer (a very funny Sam Rockwell).Clearly this role is Mickey Rourkes meat. Musclebound and stringy-haired he doesnt look all that different from how he did in ""The Wrestler."" (Instead of mangling opponents this time he mangles the Russian language.) Rourke is a one-of-a-kind actor You may think hes doing nothing but serving up attitude here but in fact hes digging deep. Ivans furious sense of injustice is the realest thing in ""Iron Man 2"" even more so than Tonys race against the clock to survive his own blood toxicity. Rourke puts a human face albeit a bashed one on comic book villainy.Downey Jr. for his part does the same thing for comic book heroism. It may seem counterproductive for any actor to attempt a full-scale performance in one of these wingding franchise movies but Downey Jr. does it every time. It may be that hes one of those actors who is incapable of dumbing down for audiences. He gives you his best each time out whether hes wearing armor or Brooks Brothers or hand-me-downs. (Thats not to say that I want to see him playing Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes ad infinitum.)Aside from these two actors ""Iron Man 2"" isnt much of a whoop-de-do. Gwyneth Paltrow as Tonys beleaguered smitten executive assistant ""Pepper"" Potts is still fairly bland as is Don Cheadle stepping into the role of Tonys military buddy ""Rhodey"" Rhodes. Scarlett Johansson plays a Stark lawyer who doubles as the notorious Black Widow and her martial arts moves are well coordinated with her slinky outfits. Both are designed to kill.Director Jon Favreau working from a script by Justin Theroux isnt particularly adept at action. He seems much more at home with catty back-and-forth badinage than with kabooms. But hes good enough to keep the pyrotechnics on the big IMAX screen popping along. For undemanding audiences that should be good enough to hold them until the next superhero movie arrives... which should be just about any minute now. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some language.)

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr May 6 2010 Culture gt; Paramount What would happen to the Iron Man franchise if you took out all the ""iron""--the slit-eyed helmet and headlamp breastplate ruby-red gauntlets and metal mukluks repulsor rays and boot-jets--and left just the man billionaire daredevil Tony Stark armed with nothing more than his wicked goatee dagger-sharp irony and impenetrable aura of self-love? (Many superheroes have made do with less.) The question may seem perverse but surely Im not the only person to have asked it. Even the director of the franchises two installments to date Jon Favreau seems to view the heavy clanking of mechanized men as a bit of a chore the kind of well-prepared yet unremarkable meat course that must inevitably follow the delightful amuse bouche of Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal of Stark. The first Iron Man was at its very best in the early going when pre-heroic arms-dealer/impresario Stark was putting on a show for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. (""Is it better to be feared or respected?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Is it too much to hope for both?"") The unforeseen denouement of his presentation however found Stark captured by militants and stashed away in a mountain cave where he learned the somewhat equivocal lesson that its only okay to create unfathomably destructive weapons if you dont allow anyone to use them but yourself. Stark doesnt merely sing of arms and the man Suited up he is arms and the man. His campaign to remain unique in this respect (generous interpretation counter-proliferator; less generous monopolist) played a subsidiary role in the first film in which he ultimately pummeled competing cyber-capitalist Jeff Bridges so badly that he turned him into a drunken down-and-out country singer. By Iron Man 2 however the race to build a rival suit of armor is in full swing--like current corporate efforts to manufacture a viable fuel-cell car or another Megan Fox. Sam Rockwell shows up as sleazy Stark wannabe Justin Hammer out to increase his share of the military cyborg market; Gary Shandling his head as puffy as a microwaved tater tot appears as a U.S. Senator eager to subject Iron Man to eminent domain; and Mickey Rourke arrives fresh from the same tattoo-parlor-cum-Russian-accent-school recently popularized by Viggo Mortensen with an Eastern promise of his own. Even as the opening of Iron Man 2 segues directly from the conclusion of its predecessor it inverts the story gently another physicist-son watches Starks triumphal press conference announcing ""I am Iron Man"" and sets out to validate the memory of his physicist-father by building his own suit of badass body armor. In this case the manufacture takes places in a dingy Russian apartment rather than a Central Asian cave and the inventor in question Ivan Vanko (Rourke) soon to be known as Whiplash is about as far from an international playboy as one can be while still belonging to the same biological genus. Yet as is so often the case in such tales the connection is nonetheless intimate Vankos physicist-dad worked with and was eventually deported by Starks physicist-dad. So when the Sins of the Fathers later show up for a visit we all know whose doorbell theyll be ringing. In the meantime though Iron Man is the toast of pretty much every town he sets boot in from Malibu to Washington. Hes even scored himself a ""Person of the Year"" cover from Time magazine which whatever you think of it on the merits is surely an upgrade from ""You."" In the interest of science and world peace he also sponsors a belated sequel to the ""Stark Expo"" of 1974 (a light gloss on the 1964 Worlds Fair) jumping out of a cargo plane to land onstage in Flushing NY in front of a shimmying chorus of girls whose halter tops and short-shorts are in Iron Mans trademark crimson and gold. (I consider myself above commenting on their ahem headlights.) Then its off to Washington to fend off voracious bureaucrats--""I will serve this great nation at my own pleasure"" Stark explains to a congressional committee ""and one thing I have proven is that you can count on me to pleasure myself""--and to Monte Carlo to participate in the Formula One Grand Prix. At least that is until Whiplash shows up to offer his peculiar brand of auto detailing services. The resulting action sequence is among the smallest of the film and no coincidence the best with an emotional crackle that goes beyond mere F/X. From there though the movie gradually succumbs to the excesses that typically adhere to the genre too many characters too many storylines too much CGI. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Starks Girl Friday Pepper Potts and receives a substantial promotion. Don Cheadle inherits the role of Starks military liaison and sometimes-best-buddy James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes though the filmmakers cant think up much more for him to do than his predecessor in the role Terrence Howard. And there is a decidedly--though I might say characteristically--unnecessary part thrown in for Scarlett Johansson as a new Stark Industries employee who May Be More Than She Appears. The best bit of stunt-casting (apart from Rourke and Rockwell who bring their customary attractions) is Mad Mens John Slattery as Starks deceased industro-utopian dad Howard. For the most part director Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux keep the story moving forward and they have the common decency (far too uncommon these days) to have the credits rolling by the two-hour mark. (This is not praise God another Transformers.) There are clear moments of slack though as when Stark has to build a cyclotron--sorry ""prismatic accelerator""--in order to synthesize a new element whose properties were hidden by his father in a model of the 1974 Expo so that he can replace the palladium battery in his chest that is slowly killing him and--oh never mind. At least theres a cute joke about Captain Americas shield stuck in there somewhere. The film ends as it must with a confrontation among roboticized men (Stark Vanko Rhodey) and Hammers cybernetic drones (which Stark coyly dubs ""Hammeroids""). On the way to a surprisingly limp conclusion there is much flying and shooting and exploding and more metal on metal than youre likely ever to find outside an Anvil concert. And then of course there is the de rigeur coda-promo for the planned 2012 Avengers movie of which we are all likely to have grown tired long before principal photography begins Joss Whedon or no Joss Whedon. There is a touch of uncertainty injected however regarding the extent of Downeys participation in the super-group mega-movie. When in a closing scene Samuel L. Jacksons Sgt. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.--did I fail to mention he shows up too?--tells Stark that he might not be Avengers material after all and might instead be retained as a ""consultant"" Stark (or is it Downey?) laughs ""You cant afford me."" Which if true might be just as well. Iron Man 2 is a perfectly diverting action film--particularly following the extreme clunkers of last season--but its a reminder that Downey is at his best when given as he was to a substantial degree last time out a one-man show. I for one will keep my fingers crossed for ... Man 3 Tony Stark Unplugged.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

His performance is a heady mix two parts invincibility to one part vulnerability.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In case youre wondering As fascinating an actor as Mickey Rourke is he does not steal the show from Robert Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man 2."" It would be impossible to upstage the verbally nimble Downey and his sexy-yet-geeky billionaire persona Tony Stark. Back for a second round the comics-based franchise serves up the first powerful cocktail of the blockbuster season thanks to Downey whose performance -- two parts invincibility to one part vulnerability -- is just as rich as you would expect. Superhero Stark remains intriguing. Fresh from ""successfully privatizing world peace"" as he boasts he has rebooted the Stark Expo a trade show his father began. He arrives from the sky to the Worlds Fair site in Queens to deliver a welcome. A chorus line of high-kicking ladies on loan from the NFL heralds his entrance. Hes a rock star without guitar an evangelist without a creed. Hes Tony Stark man of gargantuan ego. And hes on a mission of innovation and global reinvention. Stark is a hero as huckster. Or is it the other way around? He so relishes the language of the sell that the product becomes the seller. The same can be said of this rousing franchise. Standing with Stark once again are the indispensable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) upstanding military man and friendly conscience Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard) and a couple of new faces. Scarlett Johansson playing Natalie Rushman ""from legal"" arrives at Starks Malibu digs with a serious demeanor. Later she earns amused giggles. The movies quite good at keeping it under wraps whether she is friend or foe. Either way shes formidable. ""I want one"" Stark tells Potts. Who could blame him? Aligned against him are rival arms manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Rourke) who shares a history with Stark. Buried in ""Iron Man 2"" is the story of sons burdened and blessed with paternal legacies. But like its fast-talking hero this franchise is mildly allergic to getting too serious. So Vankos parallel story never quite collides with Starks to deeper effect. What Rourke does do is lumber onto the screen offering weight to Downeys jig. When Vanko first faces Stark the latters joie de me is wearing thin. Hes in need of a good spanking. Earlier sitting in front of a Senate panel hes more cocky than ever. Yet in the quiet of his lab or looking at himself in a mirror Starks worried. Spider veins creep from his chest where a battery device replaced his ticker. Like a diabetic checking his blood sugar he is constantly sticking his finger to measure his blood-toxicity level. Hes ailing. Director Jon Favreau pumps up the volume and amps the clatter of metal against metal. One wishes that writer Justin Theroux had done more with Vanko. His tattoos mouthful of gold and pet bird are just a start. He misses some opportunities for a mettle-against- mettle throwdown. Still its fine that the film is not overly ambitious. Part of the plot involves Starks willful reluctance to hand over the Iron Man technology to the U.S. government and military. But the real terrain isnt quasi-political. Its the turf of the Cool. Vanko cracks arcs of electricity that slice through cars like butter. Ginsu take that Starks nifty suit is now portable and looks like a suitcase. Iron Man creator Stan Lee always marveled at the notion that his 1960s creation was such a hit with the ladies more than other superhero characters. With the incandescent casting of Downey that love makes exquisite sense. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""Iron Man 2.""

Robert Downey Jr. and company more than prove their mettle in a thoroughly enjoyable -- if entirely un-revolutionary -- comic book movie.What everyone really wants to know is whether No. 2 is better than No. 1. Well it is and it isnt.On the plus side the introduction of two lively new characters shores up some of the originals problems. In the more consistent 2008 film magnetic showman Downey dominated and chewed up every scene. While Downeys bigger-than-life performance was the reason why ""Iron Man"" gobbled up more than 572 million worldwide it also suffocated key supporting players and their characters. Such was the terrible fate that befell Oscar winner Jeff Bridges (""Crazy Heart"") unremarkable as the duplicitous friend-turned-nemesis Obadiah Stane. More movie news reviews <a href=""http//scripts.bayareanewsgroup.com/scripts/feed2js/feed2js.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.contracostatimes.com%2Fmngi%2Frss%2FCustomRssServlet%2F571%2F201110.xmlamp;num=10amp;del=yamp;rel=yamp;html=y"">View RSS feed</a> Villains in comic book movies should never be forgettable. Stane was.With ""Iron Man 2"" returning director Jon Favreau smartly pumps up the bad-boy role of tattooed physicist Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash a decision that provides the spark plug the franchise needs. Mickey Rourke (""The Wrestler"") plays the freak-show part perfectly adopting a thick-as-the-tundra Russian accent and showcasing a muscled torso that seems to bristle with hatred for Tony Stark (aka Iron Man).The most exciting sequence comes when Ivan looking like he scavenged the ""Waterworld"" set for his costume and hairstyle unleashes his wrath by donning a funky electric suit and wreaking havoc during the Grand Prix in Monaco. That scene and an iron-suited wrestling smackdown between a drunken Stark and his frustrated friend Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle ably replacing Terrence Howard) are the suspense high points.Advertisement Also on the plus side Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"") successfully sex up the series with the welcome arrival of Scarlett Johansson (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""). The stunning Johansson plays Starks bodacious new assistant otherwise known as the Black Widow. Dont worry; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been elevated by billionaire Stark to CEO. Johansson has a great time with her smallish role as a mysterious beauty who can tackle nearly any language and take out a room full of baddies. (Just brace yourself fanboys Johansson is guaranteed to give you a case of the night sweats.)All of that is good. Where ""Iron Man 2"" gets a bit clanky is in the plotting department with a flabby midsection and a misshapened climax that should have been as taut as Downeys six-pack abs -- proudly flashed of course. Maybe next time ""Iron Man"" will master the action finale. So far its eluded the filmmakers in both pictures.Given that he penned the hilarious ""Thunder"" screenwriter Theroux fares better when it comes to the witty Stark banter especially during the opposites-attract sparring matches with Potts. The Downey-Paltrow back-and-forths are snappy and fun even if Paltrow remains way too one-note in her role. Downey is a joy to behold once again and even steps aside to allow supporting characters a chance to shine. The Golden Globe winner was born to play hard-drinking playboy Stark and whether hes mocking a Senate hearing (with a nice cameo by Garry Shandling) or grappling with his ticking mortality if he cant find new material to keep his battery charging Downey is always entertaining.As is ""Iron Man 2."" Sure its no ""Dark Knight"" but neither is it a superhero dud like ""Wolverine."" ""Iron Man 2"" straddles that middle line Its a solid blockbuster with a few faults that you just dont mind overlooking.Oh and do stick around for the closing credits Youre in for a surprise.""Iron Man 2""HH1/2Rating PG-13 (for sci-fi action and violence and brief suggestive content)Cast Robert Downey Jr. Don Cheadle Gwyneth Paltrow Scarlett Johansson Sam Rockwell Mickey Rourke and Samuel L.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 6 2010 545 PM Iron Man 2 Robert Downey Jr. suits up for a sequel. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Iron Man 2 check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Iron Man 2 Iron Man 2 (Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment) opens with a nice little allegory about its own sequel anxiety. At the Stark Expo a Worlds Fair-like celebration at a corporate park in Queens the weapons-mogul-turned-superhero Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) makes a spectacular airborne entrance in his titanium suit alighting on an arena stage before thousands of cheering fans. But once he lands and sheds the suit Tony doesnt know quite what to do. Now that his secret identity has been revealed and world peace achieved hes reduced to strutting in the spotlight singing his own praises with mock humility. The first installment of Iron Man traced the billionaire playboys transition from alienated bon vivant to anti-weapons activist. Now that the Pax Ironmaniana is upon us (as Tony boasts to a Senate subcommittee ""I have successfully privatized world peace"") the hero and the franchise are dependent on outside conflict to justify their enormously expensive existence. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That conflict comes along in the form of Anton Vanko (Mickey Rourke) a Russian physicist and ex-con who--for reasons that Samuel L. Jackson will pop up late in the movie to explicate--is Tonys sworn nemesis. While the worlds rogue nations incompetently attempt to copy Starks impregnable suit Vanko manages to devise a working model funded by sleazy defense contractor Justin Hammer (the insufficiently famous Sam Rockwell having the time of his life). Advertisement Rourke as an actor is the anti-Robert Downey. Where Downey flirts and courts making the viewer feel as though were riding shotgun in his sports car en route to the best party ever Rourke always seems to be receding withdrawing to a place where somethings happening thats too deep and dangerous for the viewer to understand fully. Hes a mesmerizing actor to watch and the difference in style between the two could have made for a fascinating clash. But the actors only get two scenes together and during the second one theyre almost entirely encased in metal suits and masks. Its beyond absurd that the makers of superhero movies havent grasped this yet When an actors body and face arent visible beneath a costume it could be anyone under there. Casting the likes of Downey and Rourke and then imprisoning them in jointed refrigerators is resource-squandering of the highest order. Jon Favreau who directed both Iron Man movies (and who plays Tonys driver and sidekick Happy Hogan) barely conceals his impatience with the action sequences. There are three big ones in this movie one per act and the moment each one begins the films energy plummets. (The climactic scene in particular a long battle involving an army of unmanned drones feels as low-stakes as a video game.) Don Cheadle takes over Terrence Howards thankless role as ""Rhodey"" Rhodes Tonys straight-and-narrow buddy in the military who pitches in for the final robot showdown. Poor Cheadle looks even more uncomfortable in a shiny metal super-suit than he did in that cowboy getup in Boogie Nights. Everything worth watching in Iron Man 2 happens when the characters doff the armor and hang out in their civvies. Though the dialogue (by the actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux) is never as screwball-worthy as that of the first Iron Man theres some snappy interplay between Tony and his second-in-command Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) especially after the luscious Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is hired as an executive assistant. Action-wise Paltrow isnt given a lot to do beyond dithering prettily and awaiting rescue but ScarJo gets the opportunity to demolish a few villains in her Black Widow catsuit. Rockwell has a hilarious scene in which he lovingly demonstrates the uses of a suitcase full of James Bond-esque superweapons. And a mid-movie interlude explores Tonys descent into drunken self-pity in scenes that cant help but recall Downeys own years as a privileged Hollywood wastrel. The Iron Man franchise should trust Downey more trust that we want to hang out with Tony Stark as he putters in his absurdly high-tech workshop or nurses a hangover in a giant plaster donut. The first movie got its reputation as the thinking mans blockbuster for a reason It relied on Downeys winning mercurial presence for its firepower. Succumbing to the temptation (or the industry pressure) to ramp up the clanky special effects for the second outing Iron Man 2 throws away its most irreplaceable special effect.

""The question I get asked most often"" he tells the crowd ""is How do you go to the bathroom in that suit?"" Pause. Smile. ""Just like that."" Tonys in celebrity decline making a fool of himself and thinking hes cool. Hes like a rock star trashing a hotel room too stoned to realize its his home. See a list of Iron Man 2 Characters. A Marvel comic-book hero with no superpowers except a Mensa IQ preternatural confidence a sharp wit and an unlimited bank account Tony made 2008s Iron Man the decades smartest action film. It must also have been the one closest to the movie industrys heart for Tony--all mental muscle and verbal elbows in Robert Downey Jr.s acute personification--had the sense of mission and the ruthlessness that define a Hollywood mogul. Or any American titan. (See the 5 Things You Need to Know about Iron Man 2.) In the bolder less satisfying Iron Man 2 director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux had to figure out what Tony would do once he had it all. If they dont quite pee in Iron Mans suit they do turn Tony corrosive the inevitable residue of triumph they posit is decadence. As in Superman III the hero has become his own evil twin. The new movie arrives at a moment much bleaker than the dear dead May 2008 of its predecessor. Back then Tony was a dream zillionaire Howard Hughes updated into Richard Branson. In the wake of the Great Recession his excesses can seem toxic. Appearing before a Senate committee whose chairman (Garry Shandling) wants the U.S. government to control the Iron Man ""weapon"" Tony blithely boasts ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" Even if this is true--can one flying man becalm Iran North Korea and al-Qaeda?--he sounds as arrogant as a Wall Street CEO. Hubris has felled many high flyers and Congress wont vote this one a bailout. All right Marvel doesnt have a hero named Blankfein. And Tony has the excuse of a bum ticker; his mechanical heart is wearing out. More important he makes something besides money his Iron Man couture which rogue nations--and a rival arms merchant Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)--have been unable to duplicate. But in Russia someone has improved on the original. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke with parchment skin Mongolian fierceness and more tattoos than ""Bombshell"" McGee) is the son of a disgraced physicist who worked with Tonys father and Vanko nurses a hatred for all Starks. In the films neatest set piece the iron-suited Russian invades the Monaco Grand Prix and thrashes Tony with chain whips of electricity. Hammer secures Vankos services thus subsidizing the films climactic hero-villain face-off.

Paramount/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 7 2010 1201 a.m. ET Tony Stark creates a new element in ""Iron Man 2"" though its no big deal; nobody even bothers to name it. Robert Downey Jr.s zillionaire genius revealed to be Iron Man at the end of the previous film simply builds himself an in-home particle accelerator fires it up and then bango hes got a safer source of energy for the palladium-powered heart thats been threatening to kill him. This sequel alas settles for old elements in a new alloy--less iron lots more lead and tin. It isnt Mr. Downeys fault. Hes a star of such droll sophistication that he can take one of the notions powering Justin Therouxs patchy script--Tonys unseemly lust for fame--and transmute it into charmingly self-ironic grandiosity. (""Please its not about me"" the world-conquering superhero-turned-stand-up-comic says to a worshipful audience during a Las Vegas-style show at Flushing Meadows Park in New York.) Yet theres only so much a star can do. The distinction of the first ""Iron Man"" was its bipolar grace a gift for swinging between elegant action sequences and the intimate improbably affecting drama of Tonys conversion from an arrogant arms merchant into a global savior with an all-too-human soul. The franchises overseers Marvel Studios have stayed with the same director Jon Favreau the same cinematographer Matthew Libatique and the same love interest Pepper Potts whos played by Gwyneth Paltrow. But intimacy has vanished from the relationship between Tony and Pepper and grace has been stricken from the movie as a whole. In its stead theres Mr. Downey as Atlas (or occasionally Sisyphus) carrying the weight of an unwieldy plot on his buff physique plus the digital dictum that governs most action-adventure sequels these days--whatever effects can be used will be used to excess. (""Iron Man 2"" was screened for critics in IMAX even though most moviegoers will see it in conventional theaters but the giant-screen format wasnt the source of the excessiveness. To the contrary it may have given the movie a stature it hadnt earned.) Its good fun for a while to watch Mr. Downey play Tonys runaway ego with an almost British brittleness and an all-American energy born of fear and desperation--Tony knows the same nuclear implant thats keeping him alive is also doing him in. ""I have privatized world peace"" he boasts to a Senate Armed Services Committee that wants to make his shiny red robotic suit and the technology behind it the exclusive property of the Pentagon. But his boasts lead to banal boozing and his plausible insistence on seizing the day--and falling for Scarlett Johannsons slinky superheroine Black Widow--gives way to absurdity when hes suddenly discovered driving drunk in the Monaco Grand Prix. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke is the films chief villain Ivan Vanko. Paramount/Everett Collection Thats the moment when the movies plot starts devolving into a string of random notions two of which involve villains (one really good bad guy would have done the trick) and their remarkably uninventive villainy. Sam Rockwell gives a lively wry performance as Justin Hammer a rival arms magnate who wants to steal priceless secrets from Stark Industries and sell his own cyborg weaponry to the government. Mickey Rourke is Ivan Vanko the tattooed and toothpick-chomping son of a Russian physicist and a weapons designer in his own right whos determined to avenge the wrongs done to his family by Tony Starks father. Mr. Rourke is a formidable physical presence just as he was in ""The Wrestler"" but hes the cyborg equivalent of a punch-drunk heavyweight when it comes to mortal combat (or rather ""Transformers"" which ""Iron Man 2"" often resembles). Here again it isnt his fault. The ostensibly epic battles between Iron Man and Ivan in his battle gear are staged for maximal impact with minimal ingenuity apart from one bright sequence in which Ivan puts a Rolls-Royce through an ad hoc chop shop with laser whips that he wields like a demented lion tamer. And those confrontations are marred by a clutter thats endemic to the production. Instead of one villain two. Instead of two antagonists three since Tonys friend Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle in the role previously played by Terence Howard) is either battling Iron Man to keep him on the straight and narrow or fighting alongside him against Ivan. The clutter includes the Black Widow--Ms. Johansson looks uncomfortable as well she might playing a rubber-suited seductress with no clear style or function--and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) the director of a shadowy organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. (You dont really want to know what that acronym means do you?) Nicks function is cryptic too but Mr. Jackson looks like he doesnt give a damn. Mother and Child One of the many mysteries of movie-watching is why we do or dont choose to see actors as the characters theyre playing. Sometimes suspension of disbelief comes instantly and were caught up in the unfolding drama. At other times theres no way to see anything but actors acting. That was the case for me in Rodrigo Garcias ""Mother and Child"" a slow and lugubrious film about the impact of adoption on the lives of three women. Worse still its a case of three exceptional actresses--Annette Bening Naomi Watts and Kerry Washington--constituting an ensemble of obviousness. They must have been giving their director what he wanted although thats something of a mystery too since Mr. Garcia has directed 41 episodes of ""In Treatment"" the HBO series justly celebrated for its fine performances. But actors and directors dont work in a vacuum. They depend on the writing and Mr. Garcias script for this film beats with the ardent heart of a telenovela. ENLARGE Annette Bening is a sad mother in Mother and Child. soon Ms. Bening is Karen who gave up a newborn baby girl for adoption when she was 14 and has been haunted by the loss ever since. Ms. Watts is Elizabeth an adoptee who has only the most tenuous attachments to her adopted family (and everyone else). Ms. Washington is Lucy an anxious wife who hopes to adopt the soon-to-be-born child of Ray a pregnant young woman played by Shareeka Epps. (The cast includes Samuel L. Jackson--doesnt he ever take a vacation?--Jimmy Smits and Cherry Jones.) These are not happy people. Karen feels empty Elizabeth is a control freak and Lucy has neuroses to burn. I wont spoil the unfun by revealing how it all works out but I can tell you that ""Mother and Child"" was produced by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu a filmmaker who has displayed in such films as ""Babel"" ""21 Grams"" and ""Amores Perros"" an inordinate fondness for interlocking plots. This films treacle level is upped by a very young woman who is blind--not just blind but wise beyond her years. She doesnt interlock so much as wax poetic. DVD FOCUS Being Julia (2004) ENLARGE Of the many gifts that Annette Bening brings to her best roles the most endearing may be a sense of self-enjoyment. She seems genuinely--and justifiably--pleased to be who she is. This quality shines through every one of her scenes in ""Being Julia"" even when the actress shes playing--Julia Lambert the reigning stage star of pre-World War II London--is supposed to be seized by self-doubt. Ms. Bening is the only reason to see the movie but a compelling reason. Just like Julia she prevails over lesser mortals with unfailing zest. Eastern Promises (2007) ENLARGE Naomi Watts is Anna a midwife at a London hospital who makes a discovery that leads her inexorably to Londons heart of Slavic darkness--think ""Chinatown"" with blinis and vodka--and to a dangerous involvement with Viggo Mortensens Nikolai a driver for a Russian criminal brotherhood. David Cronenbergs harsh but powerful film conjures up a violent world of bottomless evil yet holds out through Anna and Ms. Wattss lovely performance the possibility of doing good. Steven Knight wrote the densely detailed script. The supporting cast includes Armin Mueller-Stahl Vincent Cassel Sinead Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski. Our Song (2000) ENLARGE Jim McKays exquisite independent film follows the friendship of three teenage girls during one hot summer in Crown Heights a mainly black and Latino section of Brooklyn. The trios most obvious candidate for success is Lani who I wrote in my review ""is played enchantingly by a candidate for stardom named Kerry Washington."" (This was her feature debut.) Music as you might expect from the title occupies an important place in the girls lives. Theyre members of a marching band--actually the sensationally stylish Jackie Robinson Steppers--that gives fresh meaning to the notion of bursting into song. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Robert Downey Jr. looks as hung over in ""Iron Man 2 as he seemed drunk in ""Iron Man. He does his share of drinking this time too. And the sequel makes more out of his insobriety. It has an early stretch where it fizzes and slurs with the stars stepping on each others lines and feet. The movie feels drunk too.Downeys billionaire military-industrialist slut Tony Stark slams down into his own expo (for both peace and state-of-the-art weaponry) as his ironclad superhero self. The elemental casing falls away revealing a handsome pinstripe suit. Tony pats himself on the back for saving the world (""Ive privatized peace he brags) praises the scantily clad entertainment (hey everybody its the ""Iron Man 2 dancers) then finds himself served with a subpoena to testify at a Senate committee hearing where the movie begins its improvement of the flagging after-party atmosphere of the first movie.Im almost certain this is the first time C-SPAN and summer blockbuster have met. In any case Tony slouches before a firing squad of congressmen chiefly a simpering Senator Garry Shandling. They want to take over the Iron Man technology. It could be a threat to national security. What if our enemies use it to destroy us? Experts testify -- Starks friend Lieutenant Colonel James ""Rhodey Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and his cocky competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). But Stark rolls his eyes and cracks jokes while his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) gives him sour looks from the gallery. The series continues to operate in an arms-race universe parallel to our own which is a nifty conceit that in this sequence produces comical home-video footage of bad Iron Man clones from North Korea Iran and Hammers company.At this point were about 20 minutes in and you cant help but notice that ""Iron Man 2 is a well-oiled entertainment despite the fact that nothing blows up. This is doubly true a few scenes later when the movie descends on Monte Carlo for a grand prix race and Downey Paltrow and Rockwell seem to really enjoy talking over each other half-swallowing their put-downs. These scenes have the glamour and wit (however minimal it is) of classic screwball comedy which becomes a problem later on when the effervescence flattens and a plot takes over.As it turns out not all those Iron Man copies are bad. Mickey Rourke shows up at the grand prix cracking two sizzling electric whips. He looks like a dominatrix from ""Tron. Rourke plays Ivan Vanko the tattooed son of the Russian who helped Tonys father conceive the Iron Man technology. Vanko has come from Moscow to avenge his father with his black-market suit. He has the mind of a physicist but the body of a paroled bouncer and the hair of a Bratz doll. Naturally Hammer gets a hold of him and enlists him to perfect his fleet of fighting machines. Meanwhile Tony is running out of the palladium that keeps the nightclub in his body from closing. Without it hell die. Will a replacement chemical element turn up in time for last call? Will he drink himself to death? And how do you save the world when youre drunk? None of this is as interesting as it should be so the movie builds action sequences around it all. Rhodey tries to stage an intervention by putting on a spare Iron Man suit and fighting Tony in his armor. They wind up demolishing Tonys cliffside Malibu mansion. Its a dull gratuitous and illogical encounter (cant Tony just tell Rhodey ""Im dying bro?) and it gets to the core of the trouble with this movie -- and perhaps with the entire superhero industrial complex.The technology to realize these movies has never been sharper. But staffing them with real stars might be too much of a bonus since theyre more entertaining than the effects. All three ""Spider-Man films ran aground during their climactic showdowns partially because you knew that wasnt Tobey Maguire swinging through Manhattan. In ""Iron Man 2 I found myself more interested in Rourkes body art than in any of the innovations of the CGI artists. Armed drones are a major feature of the films rushed climax and an apt metaphor for what actors become in these sorts of action sequences.""Iron Man 2 tries to compensate for that as its predecessor did by cutting to Downeys glowing face inside the suit as he blasts away. But theres still something anonymous about it all and that just isnt the case when youre watching Rockwell apply Tom Cruises swagger to Greg Kinnears starch. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology.Even if Paltrow still seems bewildered as to why shes here she spats with Downey better than any woman hes worked with. Replacing Terrence Howard Cheadle is more efficient but the part now has some meat on its bones. And the addition of Scarlett Johansson as a mysterious new Stark Industries hire only sweetens the intrigue. When she steps into the boxing ring wearing work attire and looks just past the camera almost at us its the easiest seduction Johanssons ever committed. (""I want one of those says Tony as she climbs out of the ring.) She makes a strong entrance but has even less to do than Paltrow. And yet youre happy to see her.This movie is at its best when its breezy playing up the idea of the CEO and the superhero as a vain rock star. The beauty of Downeys performance is that Tonys self-regard savages the double lives of Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne. Stark is out and proud. But the heavier both the movie and the metal get the duller they become. Brawling here feels mandated.So I suppose its to the movies credit that its as enjoyably verbal as it is. This isnt Ben Hecht or George Cukor -- Jon Favreau returns as director and the script is by Justin Theroux both of whom are also actors (Favreau reprises his role as Tonys Jeeves). Its clear where their sympathies lie. They prefer the people and ask that we tolerate the machines. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. plus a heap of hardware) is quite literally falling apart in ""Iron Man 2."" Tony Stark the man in the glossy scowling mask is being eaten away from the inside by toxic fuel cells in his artificial heart. The genius military-industrialists one-man monopoly on peacekeeping is under attack from U.S. Sen. Stern (smarmy Garry Shandling) and Justin Hammer a jealous rival industrialist (Sam Rockwell a painfully unhip Michael Dell to Downeys supercool Steve Jobs). Worse yet Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) a Russian antihero wielding electro-laser whips wants to slash Iron Man to smithereens. His friendship with Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is on the rocks. Understandably Starks alcohol intake is spiking and his self-control is slipping. The story goes to pieces as well. Screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"") fashioned a hopscotch plot that is little more than an excuse to have the leading characters swing their big metallic fists. The aimlessness of ""Iron Man 2"" runs deep. Theres no world-in-peril scenario unfolding here; whats at stake is the fate of Starks military contracts. New characters accumulate with scant justification; Scarlett Johansson co-stars largely for the sake of a single acrobatic fight scene. There are a couple of in-jokes foreshadowing future appearances by the Marvel superheroes Captain America and Thor and plenty of Downey wisecracks that seem more calculated to tickle the audience than advance the story. Comic-book extravaganzas dont have to be this hectic and half-baked. Watch this one thinking of Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" films Paul Verhoevens ""Robocop"" ""Richard Donners ""Superman"" and Sam Raimis first two ""Spider-Man"" offerings. Then think of the opportunity director Jon Favreau has missed. This cluttered awkward blockbuster is held together by safety pins and movie-star charisma. Downey plays the smug superhero with his usual flair. Stark is a self-centered rich kid who revels in the attention that comes with saving the world. Hes fighting for truth justice and the American way but hes doing it with an ironic smirk. Downeys Stark is a highly combustible mix of ego and integrity with a few thorny Oedipal issues tossed in for good measure. One of the films pleasures is its time-capsule views of Tonys late father Howard (John Slattery) in a promotional film. As he sets forth his plans for a utopian city of the future like Walt Disney unveiling Tomorrowland we get a glimpse of the deeply mixed emotions our hero still feels toward the man. Tony earned his bullheaded antiauthoritarian streak the hard way. IRON MAN 2  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sci-fi action and violence and some language. What saves the film is not profound character insights but an amiable sort of momentum. As the tale zips along its too much effort to be irritated so you end up being entertained. Who cares if the story doesnt track particularly well? Theres so much to look at so many moments of pure geek pleasure. The pace of the battle scenes is fast and flamboyant the robot suits are sleek and agile the airborne action is filmed from zany angles. Theres a nervous sense of peril in the scene at the Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark as he drives a Formula 1 racer. Vankos flailing whips snap Starks car like a saltine and the stunned billionaire crawls from the wreckage amid autos colliding flipping sky high and exploding spectacularly. For once his cocky air is gone. Vanko lumbers toward his prey at a sure unhurried pace savoring Starks shock grinning at his helplessness. Now thats how a villain does it. Its hard not to smile and enjoy as well.

He plays Tony Stark a superhero who is both a warmonger and a peacemaker. She plays Pepper Potts the CEO of his arms company.Superhero Tony Stark is back battling bad guys powered by his atomic pacemaker.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 07 2010Too many villains. Too many superhero suits. Theres no denying that Iron Man 2 is just too too. At its best its shaggily enjoyable and enjoyably shaggy. Its like steroids on steroids with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark disarming arms industrialist tossing off one-liners like comic grenades.Stark sees no conflict in taking government subsidies while retaining private ownership of bleeding-edge weaponry. Nor does IM2 directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) see inconsistency in making its hero care about both the profits from - and human consequences of - his weapons. War is Tonys business and peace his profession.Tony Stark (a good name for a swank stark-raving egotist) is a warmonger and a peacemaker who has fitted himself with a nuclear-powered pacemaker that makes him a one-man superpower. Tonys a maverick who boasts that he ""successfully privatized world peace""IM2 positively revels in its heros contradictions chief among them that the device keeping him alive is slowly killing him. Does Tony have sufficient power to fight his enemies reap billions from war machines bed every babe in his path and amuse himself with his own wit?Not really though he muddles through with an engaging blend of self-deprecation and self-regard. Often the film follows the predictable cha-cha of superhero conventions (triumph reversal glory - plus the daddy issues that dogged Spider-Man 2) when it would have been so much more fun simply to watch the unpredictable Downey tango with his costars without having to don the iron suit.Favreaus cluttered movie has the noise and neon of a rave on a casino floor.It presents not one but four villains who successively threaten to neutralize Tonys nuclear tickerIvan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) son of a Russian arms designer betrayed by Tonys father arms himself for a showdown.Hammer (Sam Rockwell) rival weapons manufacturer grandstanding for government contracts schemes to drive a flamethrower through Tonys heart.U.S. Sen. Stern (Garry Shandling) Pennsylvania lawmaker wants Tony prosecuted for crimes against the state.Lt. Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) Tonys friend in the Pentagon behaves more like Tonys foe.And then theres Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) Tonys mysterious new assistant who insinuates herself deep in his business. Is her intent seduction - catch her in a Lycra catsuit - or sucker punch?With enemies like these who needs a love interest? Tony it seems who promotes Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) from assistant to corporate CEO. Their verbal screwballs crackle something that cannot be said of Ivan Vankos lightning-bolt bullwhips which resemble something from Siegfried and Roys prop box.Favreau (who has a small role in the film as Tonys chauffeur Happy Hogan) doesnt seem aware that Iron Man 2 looks about as appealing as a slag heap. (This despite working with the first-rate cinematographer Matthew Libatique and the gifted art director J. Michael Riva). Favreaus a workmanlike filmmaker who gets virtuoso performances from his leads particularly Paltrow and Cheadle but most of all Downey.How does Downey do it? How does he simultaneously play shallow and deep? How does he suggest that heavy is the heart that wears the armor and yet carry that iron suit as though it were a wisp of silk? Its a mystery - and a pleasure. Call him Irony Man.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl.

The bad news is that he brought lots of company. TRAILER Get an eyeful of Iron Man 2 SUMMER MOVIE CALENDAR See which films are headed your way Robert Downey Jr. is still spirited and affably snide in Iron Man 2 as Tony Stark the brilliant and fabulously rich inventor/superhero. The action sequences are fun though not as exhilarating as in the 2008 original and the dialogue can be zingy. But the movie strains under the weight of an excessively crammed story. Heroes and villains are shoehorned in. Some of the subplots seem extraneous a few come off like trailers for upcoming films and others are just murky. Downey continues to nail his narcissistic characters blend of charm and snark as fashioned by screenwriter Justin Theroux and directed again by Jon Favreau. Hes called to testify before a Senate committee concerned about his power and looking to harness it. He brags that his Iron Man alter ego has ""successfully privatized world peace."" Thems fighting words to nemesis Sen. Stern (Garry Shandling). But Stark tempers his swagger with a dose of vulnerability. We feel his yearning as he suggests to his beleaguered assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) that they re-charge their batteries figuratively in Venice. She turns him down ruefully ""Not everyone runs on batteries Tony."" Stark puts Pepper in charge of Stark Industries but their quasi-romance gets derailed when Natalie ""from legal"" (Scarlett Johansson) suddenly appears in Starks operation. Innuendos fly as does a battalion of strapping men when Natalie shows off her fighting skills. Bad guys abound. Least outwardly scary is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer an arms manufacturer with ill-defined but apparently dastardly plans. Rockwell revels in his characters dorky menace. More off-putting is Mickey Rourkes Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. Hes the latest in a line of Russian movie villains and doesnt do much beyond glower look grungy and spit out his metallic teeth. He does wield some nifty tentacles of lightning though. When Stark toils in his high-tech workshop he calls up vivid holograms and brushes them aside with a graceful gesture. Its this kind of subtle wizardry and not the loopy villains explosions and fights that leave a lasting impression.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The primary challenge for all blockbuster franchises is to be big yet fleet. Iron Man is as good a model as any thanks largely to Robert Downey Jr.s flamboyantly narcissistic Tony Stark plus filmmakers who valued pacing and character as much as superhero hardware. But sequels in their quest for more and bigger action and colorful new villains tend to take on weight and suddenly Streetcar Marlon Brando turns into a marble-mouthed beast with an ice bucket on his head. The exceedingly busy Iron Man 2 comes perilously close to that tipping point--call it the Spider-Man 3 axis--but much like its predecessor its a clean efficient somewhat generic piece of storytelling and most of the additions arent subtractions. This passes for success in the summer movie season. Exalted worldwide as a one-man peacekeeping force Downeys preening Stark has become so busy erecting monuments to himself that he hands over Stark Industries to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and devotes his energies to Iron Man full time. But he faces serious adversity from within and without Rogue countries and private competitors like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) have begun testing their own weaponized robot suits the Armed Services Committee (led by smarmy Senator Garry Shandling) wants to bring Stark under federal control psychotic Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) looks to carry out a decades-old family vendetta and the arc reactor in Starks chest cavity is slowly killing him. And oh yeah theres his mysterious new assistant Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and a bigger role for military buddy Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle replacing and upgrading Terrence Howard). Thats at least two sequels worth of incident packed into one but director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux treat most of the scenes with a light glancing wit that keeps the bloat at bay. Downey is reliably funny in his runaway egotism and Rockwells Hammer proves the ideal adversary a creature of equal vanity whose haplessness constantly undermines his raw nefarious ambitions. The long stretches between action beats would be a problem for other movies of its kind but as with the first Iron Man the splashy effects sequences--which ring with the dull clang of metal on metal--are by far the least compelling in the film. The less money on the screen the better the movie becomes. Is the Dogville set available for Iron Man 3?

"Iron Man 2 Lots of laughs lots of clanks | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIron Man 2 Lots of laughs lots of clanksThere are lots of laughs In Iron Man 2 but an excess of characters and subplots threatens to take the shine off Robert Downey Jr.s metal suit.Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark a billionaire with a suit of armour he uses to improve the world. Downey makes Iron Man his own man and he can play him both furious and funny.  (Double Negative)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. May 5 2010 (out of 4)""Please its not about me"" reformed warlord Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) insists at the start of Iron Man 2.Hes being disingenuous of course and not just because he makes this statement while surrounded by jiggling dancers at a bells-and-whistles corporate expo promoting his metal-clad machismo.The first Iron Man found hilarity and energy by making it very plain just how much it was about the priapic Mr. Stark whom Downey invests with almost satanic allure.For once we had a superhero who wasnt nibbling his fingernails to the quick fretting about the rights and wrongs of blowing up bad guys and saving the world. Instead he plotted how fast he could slip out of his ferrous attire and slide between the sheets with an admiring hottie.Article Continued BelowReturning director Jon Favreau seems to have forgotten that the sun really does rise and fall on Downeys charms. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux lard the script with a baffling array of characters and subplots which threaten to take the shine off Downeys red suit.There are still a lot of laughs often punctuated by the ""clank"" of that ubercool outfit but some of the jokes are a little rusty and the dialogue often runs to mere verbiage.The one major complaint about the otherwise golden first Iron Man was the lack of a compelling villain. Much time was expended on Starks conversion from amoral arms seller into ass-kicking avenger and not a moment of it was begrudged because Downey made sweet fun of it all. But it was almost as if Favreau and his team forgot they also had to throw a scoundrel into the mix to give Iron Man somebody to beat up. The franchise is based on a comic book after all.On paper Mickey Rourke seems like an appropriately insane adversary. Hes Ivan Vanko (try saying that fast 10 times) a Russian mastermind with an aversion to soap and shampoo but a real knack with a soldering iron. He whips up his own Samp;M version of the Iron Man outfit from purloined blueprints adding electric whips for extra wowza. Hes supposed to be really scary but its hard to fear a villain who wears reading glasses chews toothpicks and coos sweet nothings to a pet cockatoo.Vanko has a grudge against Stark because of unsettled ancient business between Starks arms-dealing daddy Howard (played in flashback by Mad Mens John Slattery) and Vankos pa who wasnt exactly lily-white himself. But both dads are now dead and Vanko is peeved beyond what anyone can fathom. Worse hes in no huge rush to settle scores and neither is the movie.An early showdown between Vanko and Stark at the Grand Prix in Monaco fizzles out in part because actor/director Favreau insists upon giving his Happy Hogan chauffeur character a much bigger role this time out. (Remember Jon it really isnt about you.)The scene slides into auto-chase farce with Gwyneth Paltrow literally along for the ride as a whinier version of Pepper Potts Starks overworked and undersexed Gal Friday.Meanwhile as they say in Comicsville the story creaks with other distractions. Stark has to defend his good work before the U.S. Senate armed services committee where he amusingly tangles with flapdoodling liberal Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and conniving rival arms trader Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).At home Stark falls under the spell of new legal assistant Natalie (Scarlett Johansson) who obviously has a bigger role to play than just making the boiling Ms. Potts jealous about Starks random affections. Suffice to say that her part is as underwritten as Rachel McAdams was in Sherlock Holmes but at least theres no gender bias in the brevity.Starks erstwhile sidekick Lt.-Col. Jim ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle filling Terrence Howards boots) ping-pongs madly between being a loyal pal and a deluded patriot with not enough screen time to sort out the schizophrenia. Samuel L. Jackson makes an eye-rolling cameo as eye-patched Nick Fury to help sell The Avengers film planned for 2012.If all this isnt enough to distract Stark and to slow down the action our clanking crusader also has to deal with his impending slow death from blood poisoning. The rare-metal battery in his mechanical heart is leaching compounds that are slowly killing him and he needs a replacement pronto.Filmmakers often pack their movies with extra characters and scenes when they dont have confidence in the main players. That shouldnt be the case here because Downey has made Iron Man his own man and he can play him both furious and funny.The franchise still has a lot of spark but next time they need to clean the corrosion off the batteries.IRON MAN 2 MARATHONIron Man 2 fans will get their fill with a 48-hour movie marathon at AMC Yonge amp; Dundas 24 where the new action flick will play consecutively for two straight days -- more than 100 times.The theatre kicks off the event with a screening of the original Iron Man Thursday at 9 p.m. followed by the premiere of Iron Man 2 at 1201 a.m. Friday morning.

Mickey Rourke appears in a scene from Iron Man 2. Photo Merrick Morton Words trump action in Iron Man 2 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Iron Man 2 Action. Directed by Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Don Cheadle. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To follow the story of glam industrialist Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"" was to marvel at his quicksilver ability to invent and then test-ride new versions of rocket-propelled armor. And boy was it fun. Who among us didnt spend their childhood scheming to own a jetpack? ""Iron Man 2"" is a better-than-average follow-up but Tony doesnt suit up enough. He almost never flies it except in his splendiferous opening scene and the films rather underwhelming climax. In between we find much crackling dialogue organized around strangely half-realized action set pieces. In fact Tony spends most of the films running time dying from advanced palladium toxicity a result of the coruscating energy source that keeps him alive while it powers his suit. Said fatal condition is revealed at the outset and becomes the excuse for all kinds of drunken and desperate misbehavior including an unfortunate party incident set to middle-period Queen. Now before anyone accuses me of failing to appreciate the Awesomeness That Is Robert Downey Jr. allow me to clarify There is nothing wrong with him. His Tony Stark is such a giddy mix of high-order corporate narcissism and disco swishiness that yes watching him sashay around the movie is a bit like watching John Travolta on the dance floor of ""Saturday Night Fever."" And Mickey Rourke tattooed to his toesies as whip-wielding Russian nemesis Ivan Vanko eats his scenes just by being large and vaguely mutant. Hes the only man Ive seen who can wear his hair in an up-do and still seem capable of murder. Jon Favreau returns to the helm with the same chummy ease he brought to the first ""Iron Man"" letting his actors rattle through Justin Therouxs script with the sort of needling sexually charged crosstalk that marked the screwball era. Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as right-hand gal Pepper Potts) once more spar and sublimate to nice effect. Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard as ""Rhodey"" Rhodes gets to fly a suit himself - straight into a bunch of heady moralizing over the military-industrial complex embodied by Sam Rockwell as a snotty little defense contractor. Marvel fanatics will groove to Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson in small roles linked to the endlessly teased Avengers story line. Those in the non-geek laity might wonder about all of these spare characters and subplots in a movie already teeming with them. They also might question the thought put into or not put into most of the action sequences which lack finesse end abruptly and employ dubious logic. -- Advisory Intense sci-fi action and violence and some language.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Iron Man 2 amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Babies OSS 117 Lost in Rio >> Iron Man 2 Now that Robert Downey Jr. has solved the War on Terror its time for some classic Commie paranoia. Ambitious at the start indulgent in the middle restless at the end this sequel gives us two great villains one whiplash funny hero and ultimately a whole lot of fizzle. Mickey Rourke heavily tattooed and swollen with muscles co-stars as a laconic Russian with a family grudge against the Starks. Before the credits we see Rourke pounding away at a deadly invention--how I love a popcorn flick that glamorizes physics--and sharing what looks like vodka with his pet cockatoo. (At least he makes me want to believe its vodka.) Hes great but gets less screen time then Sam Rockwell as a rival weapons-engineering CEO colluding with the Senate (represented by Garry Shandling in full smirk) to unplug Starks batteries. A sneering preening little priss Rockwell smartly recognizes he cant show up Downey Jr.; instead he makes a point of his weakness pouting through his scenes like an overshadowed little brother. Of course director Jon Favreau knows his franchise belongs to Downey Jr. for packing twice the life in the man as compensation for the Iron Man who is still essentially an angry can of soup. But Favreau isnt satisfied with his winning formula. Instead he and screenwriter Justin Theroux drag down Downey Jr. with a depression subplot and drain energy with the needless entrance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury who exists in this film only to jumpstart the batteries of Stan Lees next three summer blockbuster spin-offs Captain America The First Avenger Nick Fury and The Avengers. As for the tongues that wagged when Don Cheadle usurped Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James Rhodes here is Cheadles first line ""Look its me. Im here. Deal with it."" That goes for the film too. Its not a feast its a quick fix. You want bombs? You want quips? You want tech? You got em. Now go away . . . and come back next July.

There were a couple of reasons I was looking forward to seeing ""Iron Man 2."" There was that wonderful red-and-gold rocket-powered flying suit. There was the character himself the only modern movie superhero who seemed to truly enjoy being a superhero. Iron Man 2 (PG-13) Paramount (124 min.) Directed by Jon Favreau. With Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Mickey Rourke. Opens tonight in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS What I was not hoping for though was a script that kept the villain mostly off-screen -- until a perfunctory ""final battle"" with the title character that lasted all of five minutes. And what I definitely did not want was Stark sadly sitting in his Malibu mansion wrestling with daddy issues and complaining ""He never told me he loved me"" ""Iron Man""? More like Iron Mope. 2009 Oscar nominee Mickey Rourke portrays the villain Whiplash in ""Iron Man 2."" Wasnt Tony Starks confidence one of the series signatures? That unlike the anguished Hulk or Batman Stark actually got a kick out of being a sexually active billionaire crime fighter? Used to be. But what happens when you bring a star back for a sequel -- especially a serious actor like Robert Downey Jr. -- is that they want to start showing the characters ""vulnerable"" side. Well I dont want to see his vulnerable side. I want to see him kicking bots and taking names. And theres precious little of that here. The story -- which purists be warned diverges from the Marvel canon -- checks in on Iron Man six months after hes pledged to make the world safe singlehandedly. Except what he doesnt know is that some of his technology made it all the way to Russia -- and to Ivan Vanko who then uses the circuitry to turn himself into the evil Whiplash. This is where the movie briefly gets interesting. MARVEL STUDIOSThe catsuit-wearing Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow in ""Iron Man 2."" Thats because Vanko is played by Mickey Rourke who -- with his zebra-striped hair and redecorated face -- looks like one of the ""Real Housewives of New Jersey."" Or maybe just one of their couches. And the scene of him tattooed half-naked and advancing on Downey with a pair of electric bullwhips is so wrong on so many levels it reminds you of why you loved comic books to begin with. But then the script pushes Whiplash offstage. It gives the film over to Gwyneth Paltrows prissy Pepper Potts Sam Rockwells overplayed Justin Hammer and the supposedly comic Garry Shandling (whos beginning to look unfortunately like a nice lady from Boca Raton). And by the time it finally brings Whiplash back its too late. There are a couple of good set pieces. The first fight between Whiplash and Iron Man is terrifically staged. So is the (albeit unmotivated) battle between Stark and old friend ""Rhodey"" Rhodes. But even in a Lycra catsuit Scarlett Johansson is oddly dull as the Black Widow. (Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns"" still holds first prize for rocking a unitard.) And the reappearance of Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury is only a reminder that everyone here would much rather already be making ""The Avengers."" But thats the heart of the films problem. Its form isnt appropriate to its function. Its lines are so cluttered it never gets up to speed. Its full of glitches and in desperate need of some tweaks. It didnt need a director it needed a redesign. We got ""Iron Man 2"" all right -- but what we really needed was ""Iron Man 2.0."" Rating note The film contains violence sexual innuendos and a scene of alcohol abuse.

Hes getting soused in the Iron Man suit and wrecking his Malibu pleasure palace. A Russian inventor (Mickey Rourke copping a ""beeg trouble for moose and squirrel"" accent) is gunning for him. His palladium ticker is sputtering and the military wants his goods.Sounds like a job for Robert Downey Jr. who brings his uncanny mix of cocksure glibness and vulnerability to the bigger louder but not better Iron Man 2. Smarter than action sequels have any reason to be but still too nonsensical for true satisfaction the movie rides a gifted cast and a witty (if not cohesive) script to a place somewhere between middling ambition and mindless fun.You could look at Iron Man 2 as the most heavily armed screwball comedy ever made. When Tony starts riffing with his Girl Friday Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) or his man in the military Rhodey (Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard) the overblown superhero shenanigans give way to the joys of timing and repartee. Its not every movie that lets a smarmy arms mogul (Sam Rockwell) compare a smart weapon to James Joyces Ulysses. Theres actually a brain at work behind this thing even if screenwriter Justin Theroux usually has to sacrifice word power for firepower and the interminable explosions that come with it. Hey its a summer blockbuster. Whaddaya want? The weapons are the thing in Iron Man 2. A Senate committee (led by a perfectly cast Garry Shandling) wants Tonys Iron Man suits for the military; Rockwells private manufacturer wants to arm them for profit. Rourkes Ivan Vanko an illustrated man on par with Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises wants to outdo Tony and carry out his family vendetta against the Stark corporation. One scene plays like a high-tech militarized version of Travis Bickles shopping spree in Taxi Driver .With great armament comes big trouble. Iron Man 2 must set some kind of record for mayhem and rubble without a single civilian death. The chaotic unfulfilling finale fires off the most shots but the strongest action set-piece widely featured in the trailers is actually the first. Wielding his patented laser whips - will bondage ever be the same? - Ivan marches onto the Monaco Grand Prix track and starts slicing speeding race cars to ribbons. The sequence is imaginative well-paced and audacious a rare trifecta at a time when the action genre is perpetually starving for something new.If Iron Man 2 boasts fragments of humor and a few extended thrills it also lacks a center of gravity. Its too busy and not just visually. Is it about Tonys identity crisis? The countrys security crisis? The blinding power of celebrity? All of that and yet none of that. The supporting players suffer a similar fate. Sure theyre just comic-book characters but dont they deserve a little flesh on their bones? Scarlett Johansson as a slinky superspy is but eye candy with a few combat special effects thrown in. (She also gets one of the wittiest throwaway moments After acrobatically dispatching a series of tough guys she takes care of a straggler with a spray of mace to the face.)The ultimate lesson of Iron Man 2? Any popcorn franchise would be lucky to have a Downey on board. It cant be easy to breathe humanity into a steel-clad laser cannon but Downey takes us completely out of the traditional superhero zone without sacrificing the swagger. Even in some of the more ridiculous scenes - hey I discovered a new element - you always feel as if theres a person there making mistakes learning from them laughing at them promising to make more of them. I hope he finds his way back to some smaller stuff in the near future but until then hell keep me coming for more.Director Jon Favreau.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 06 2010 556AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Iron Man 2 Directed by Jon Favreau Written by Justin Theroux Starring Robert Downey Jr. Mickey Rourke Gwyneth Paltrow Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle With seemingly twice as much action a whole new complex of villainy competing Iron Man suits robots and love interests Iron Man 2 sequel cashes in hard on the unexpected success of the first Iron Man from 2007 and somehow loses much of its soul in the process. On the positive side theres just as much of Robert Downeys rakish performance as the multimillionaire arms dealer Tony Stark aka steel-suited crime fighter Iron Man. Without Downeys stylish turn - the goatee and pompadour the impeccably tailored suits the arched eye-brow the baritone asides and sudden turns of puppy-eyed tenderness - the movie would be about as much fun as watching a trash compactor squash cars at the local wrecking yard. In the original story of Iron Man Stark after getting captured in the desert came back with a literal and figurative change of heart who ""realized I have more to offer the world than making things that blow up."" In the much more fragmented script for Iron Man 2 written by Justin Theroux ( Tropic Thunder) blowing stuff up has risen on the agenda. The opening sequence shows Stark on a televised press conference watched by a greasy-haired Russian (Mickey Rourke) and a sickly older man. Under pressure from reporters Stark suddenly admits that yes he is Iron Man. Embracing his celebrity - including the attendant babes the autograph seekers the interview requests -- Tony re-opens his fathers Stark Expo technology exhibit. He makes a spectacular entrance in full Iron Man suit to a group of gyrating Vegas-style dancers to deliver his rah-rah speech. Shortly after we learn that Starks high-tech battery heart is slowly killing him a crisis that both impels his careless playboy behaviour and threatens the world peace he has temporarily created. The forces working against Iron Man take a while to line up. Against him is big government with Garry Shandling playing a slimy U.S. Senator determined to reign in the cocky Stark and claim his Iron Man ""weapon"" for the defense department. To do so he enlists expert testimony from Starks military friend Rhodey (with Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in the original). The senator is aided by an oily rival arms manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants his own super-soldier suit. Rourke plays a Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Whiplash of the Marvel comics) who has a grudge against the Stark family and a welding machine to make his own outfit with lashing electric tentacles. Vanko finds an opportunity during the Grand Prix auto race in Monaco to upstage Stark in a highly public way. In the ensuing corporate crisis at Stark Industries Tony promotes his ever-loyal ever-perky Girl Friday Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to CEO. Enter a new more erotic interest the svelte Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) who in the movies most heavily marketed spoiler can assume a secret identity when she trades in her pencil skirt and blouse and pours her curves into a black bodysuit to perform gymnastic martial arts. Late in the game Samuel L. Jackson (aka Marvels Nick Fury) shows up as yet another player in Iron Mans life. Hes wearing an eyepatch and carrying a bundle of papers which he hands over to Downeys character like a messenger handling the afterthought of the second half of the script. Finally Iron Man 2 emerges as a movie thats at war not between Iron Man and his surfeit of enemies but between two different movie-making instincts. Downey and Favreau and screenwriter Theroux like the sarcastic screwball comedy cross-fire of talk and flirtation the displays of attitude and absurdity of super-heroism along with an occasionally sharp satire of corporate jargon. On the other side the filmmakers seem all too readily bow to their own corporate lords feeding the fanboy frenzy for what has been pre-sold as the major blockbuster of the summer. Favreau has a gift for tart comedy but is only another action director and the long climax has so much faceless military hardware zipping about and lighting up the night sky it feels like watching an anxious teenagers screen capture of his top-scoring video game. Whoever controlled the buttons was apparently having fun but for the rest of us all the clanging and light bursts begins to feel like an overtime shift at the welding shop.

"Movie review Iron Man 2 loses its magnetism washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Iron Man 2 Movie review Iron Man 2 loses its magnetism Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark in ""Iron Man 2."" (Industrial Light And Magic) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 7 2010 The best thing about ""Iron Man"" was Robert Downey Jr.s cheek and expressiveness. The worst was the hardware What began as a bracingly irreverent diversion from comic book movies that take themselves way too seriously morphed into ""Transformers"" ending in a clanking heavy-metal smackdown. This StoryIron Man 2 Our hero loses his magnetismFind Iron Man 2 showtimesWatch the trailer ""Iron Man 2"" seems to have taken some wrong cues from its predecessor drowning any potential sophistication in a busy unfocused clatter of cross-talk punctuated by occasional fender-bender royales. Often playing like it has been jury-rigged from bits and pieces of a longer smarter movie ""Iron Man 2"" seems chiefly intended as a placeholder for its next dozen or so sequels. But with everyones eyes on extending the franchise theyve overlooked the possibilities right in front of them. A terrific villain is a terrible thing to waste -- namely Mickey Rourke who like most of the supporting players in ""Iron Man 2"" is given much too little to do with his gifts. Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who as the movie opens is working in Moscow on a metallic exoskeleton that will rival Iron Mans both in technological complexity and destructive throw-weight. Meanwhile Tony Stark (Downey) has secured world peace for the moment rendering the U.S. military and attendant civilian apparatchiks irrelevant. Hes cocky full of himself and obnoxiously at the top of his game -- but with Stark there are always shadows. When Vanko confronts Tony for their first showdown at the Grand Prix in Monaco its clear that ""Iron Man 2"" will be propelled by Oedipal psychological issues and struggles with mortality. Aw whos anybody kidding? ""Iron Man 2"" is propelled by stuff getting blown up strafed consumed by fireballs and blasted into oblivion all of which occurs with the dull sense of due diligence. Director Jon Favreau who stars as Tonys factotum Happy Hogan makes sure to insert whammies at every prescribed juncture leaving viewers to sort out the interstitial blah-blah for themselves. Just when Rourke is hitting his stride -- he boasts an impressive epidermal canvas of tattoos and a Russian accent -- ""Iron Man 2"" introduces another character played by Scarlett Johansson who herself must make way for a recap featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury who must scoot over for some expository mustache-twirling by a defense contractor played by Sam Rockwell. And we havent yet discussed close friend Rhodey stealing an Iron Man suit (Don Cheadle has assumed the role last occupied by Terrence Howard and brings his usual class and understatement to the task). Iron Man and his retinue of enablers still qualify as the most easy-to-like players in the comic-book movie rotation but only when theyre allowed to emerge from behind the gizmos and geek-speak. ""Everything is achievable through technology"" a character says more than once in ""Iron Man 2."" Not so.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and profanity. 126 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Our hero loses his magnetism Find Iron Man 2 showtimes Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/06/AR2010050602167.html,200,ironman226,ironman2,washingtonpost

The magnitude of destruction far exceeds that of its predecessor -- from rows of cars to armies of drones to Tony Starks cliff-top Shangri-La -- and includes repeated instances of characters walking away from a massive fireball without looking back. Cause looking back is for wimps. But thats not all that gets obliterated here. The substance of the original ""Iron Man"" the brain and the soul that set it apart from the typical seasonal fare and made it one of the best films of 2008 also have been blown to bits. Tony Stark had purpose back then and despite the outlandish fantasy of his Marvel Comics-inspired story as a person he had a believable arc. Crafting the high-tech suit and transforming himself into a superhero gave this selfish industrialist and self-destructive playboy a sense of drive a reason for being beyond just his whims and indulgences. Here hes purely arrogant once more with some glimmers of mortality and daddy issues. And Robert Downey Jr. so irresistibly verbal and quick on his feet in the first film (and in pretty much every film hes ever made) seems to be on autopilot. Sure hes got a way with a one-liner and his comic timing is indisputable but hes done this song-and-dance routine before and seems rather bored with it. Then again the character -- and the sequel itself -- are less defined this time. Narratively ""Iron Man 2"" is a mess. Director Jon Favreau working from a script by Justin Theroux throws in too many subplots too many characters -- and what a waste of that cast actors who can really act like Mickey Rourke Sam Rockwell Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson in an eye patch as Nick Fury offering a bit of foreshadowing to ""The Avengers"" film. (For more Marvel movie geekery stick around until the end of the credits.) As we recall from the last line of the first film the whole world knows that Stark is indeed Iron Man. Now the government (led by Garry Shandling as a sniveling senator) wants him to turn over the suit for the militarys benefit and his best friend Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Cheadle in place of Terrence Howard) can only do so much to protect him. Why not more scenes with Downey and Rourke? Meantime theres a new foe in the form of Russian bad guy Ivan Vanko (Rourke buried beneath tattoos and a Boris-and-Natasha accent) whos built a suit of his own in his dank Siberian abode complete with electrified tentacles; sadly he and fellow acting heavyweight Downey spend most of their screen time apart. In no time Starks rival Justin Hammer (Rockwell turning on the smarm) snaps up Vanko and asks him to build an army of Iron Men for himself. Advertise Advertise Advertise Then theres the battle Stark is waging internally as he reflects on his own weakening body and the memories of a scientist father (John Slattery glimpsed in old movies) who didnt love him enough. And speaking of love ""Iron Man 2"" also tries to find time for the blossoming relationship between Stark and his right-hand woman Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) while dangling the possibility of a dalliance with a mysterious new assistant (Scarlett Johansson). So yeah theres a lot going on here. The enemy -- the focal point of the whole movie for that matter -- remains murky making you realize about halfway through that its unclear exactly what ""Iron Man 2"" is supposed to be about. Favreau seemed to handle all the expensive toys effortlessly the first time an exciting discovery given his previous work on smaller films like ""Made"" and ""Elf."" The strain shows now in a lack of momentum and a reliance on generically bombastic action sequences. (The final showdown looks like several blips of light chasing each other around the skies above New Yorks Flushing Meadows.) The cinematography from Matthew Libatique is once again an engaging mix of bright crisp exteriors (especially in IMAX the way ""Iron Man 2"" was shown to Los Angeles critics) and tangibly gritty intimate moments. But the big shiny action sequences -- the reason audiences get giddy for movies like ""Iron Man 2"" ostensibly -- too often look cartoony. Thats especially true of the initial showdown between Stark and Vanko at the Grand Prix of Monaco with its cars tumbling end-over-end before -- you guessed it -- bursting into flames just as it seems the ""Iron Man"" franchise itself is doing.

"Iron Man 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; iron-man-2 ) Iron Man 2 (United States 2010) May 05 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With superhero movies its almost axiomatic to state that the second film is the best of the series. The reason isnat difficult to divine having dispensed with the obligatory origin tale the movie-makers can weave a more compelling yarn. So why does Iron Man 2 provide a compelling counter-example? Thats not to say the second installment of the Marvel comic-turned-movie heros adventures isnt worth seeing because it provides a couple hours of the kind of entertainment one expects from a summer blockbuster. But it isnt up to the level of Iron Man. Perhaps the reason is that in the case of this particular superhero the origin is the most interesting story. Maybe the first movie did such a good job of fleshing out the character that additional forays into the life and mind of Tony Stark were doomed to if not disappoint then at least not overwhelm. Curiously this American-made motion picture debuted a week earlier in most foreign markets than in its own backyard which makes for an unusual distribution pattern. Presumably the promotional wizards at Paramount Pictures feared that opening the movie in the United States before the calendar officially read ""May"" might in some way invalidate Iron Mans claim to raise the curtain on the ""summer season."" I guess the producers arent overly worried about screen-cap torrents from overseas nor should they be. Anyone who would substitute a crappy image viewed on a computer screen for the real thing is missing out on one of the chief pleasures associated with watching this bigger-than-life tale. (And thankfully theres not a 3D version to be found) Iron Man 2 picks up shortly after the completion of the first film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) having revealed himself to be the man in the metal suit has been a one-person force for world peace settling conflicts large and small across the globe. In secret however he is suffering from palladium poisoning with the device that keeps his heart beating gradually releasing toxins into his blood. Recognizing the death sentence he does what any man in his situation might do positions the world for life after him while partying. He hands over control of his company to his faithful assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and allows his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) access to one of his ""spare"" suits. Meanwhile he refuses to cede control of his Iron Man intelligence to the U.S. government. The film provides Iron Man with new foes a would-be Tony Stark entrepreneur named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) whose approach recalls the fatuousness of Gene Hackmans Lex Luthor and Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who has developed his own Iron Man suit with a few nasty enhancements. Iron Man 2 also ramps up the involvement of S.H.I.E.L.D. With a Mace Windu-like extended cameo Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury (his appearance in the first film was limited to a post-credits ""Easter Egg""). Another familiar face from Iron Man is Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). He is joined by the double-jointed and combat-ready Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who goes undercover as Starks new assistant. Its difficult to say whether the main problem with Iron Man 2 is that it suffers from too much plot or too little. Theres certainly a surfeit of exposition - so much so that it interferes with the pacing. For the first 90 minutes of its 125-minute running time the movie is sluggish with action sequences few and far between. There are a lot of scenes of Tony being an asshole plenty of setup for The Avengers movie (which is still at least two years in the future) and a fair amount of dialogue that doesnt amount to much (although screenwriter Justin Theroux delivers a few good one-liners - I especially liked the one about the Hammer-oids). The slowness of the first three-quarters is mostly redeemed by the kick-ass final half hour which features the no-holds-barred battle one is expecting although all the metal-on-metal crunching echoes the climax of the first Iron Man. For a movie that begins with the fertile foundation established by its predecessor Iron Man 2 does disappointingly little to advance the mythos or provide fans with reasons to enthusiastically cheer the films existence. As a villain Ivan Vanko promises more than he delivers. For the most part the narrative treats him as an afterthought until late in the proceedings. More time is devoted to Hammer who admittedly is the more intriguing character and depending on how he his handled in future installments could prove to be a diabolical opponent. What happens late in the movie hurts him in the two places where he can feel pain his bank account and his ego. As was the case with Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. owns the film. His innate charisma his ability to deliver cutting lines of dialogue with the perfect inflection and his capacity to overcome narrative shortcomings are reasons why Iron Man 2 works better than one might suspect. Its a little disappointing that the chemistry he shared with Gwyneth Paltrow in the first film has been diluted here. Scarlett Johansson adds a dose of sex appeal but her role is superfluous; one suspects she will have more to do in the future. The re-casting of Rhodes (from Terence Howard to Don Cheadle) is a misfire. Cheadle is an excellent actor but this part isnt right for him and his attempts to fill Howards shoes serve only to make us aware of how well the other actor played the part. Another minor source of discontentment relates to the special effects which are less convincing than those in the first film perhaps because there are more of them and they call attention to themselves with greater frequency. The ""superhero abilities"" evident in the first movie work better than they do in the second. For the most part its a minor thing but there are scenes in which this provides a momentary distraction. One wonders whether there will be a third Iron Man or whether Marvels future focus with respect to this icon will be relegated to the superhero ensemble of The Avengers. Perhaps Iron Man 2s post-credits sequence which teases Thor is an indication. (Theres also a none-too-subtle reference to Captain America in the middle of the movie.) If there is another Iron Man hopefully the filmmakers will come up with a different sort of foe for the title character. The concept of Iron Man fighting enhanced versions of himself has been taken about as far as it can go. Despite being a re-tread it works here because theres energy and excitement in the final battle but that well probably has likely run dry.

With all those pesky introductions out of the way filmmakers are free to play with the universe they have created liberating their characters from their original stories and delving more fully into their world. Part I establishes the ground rules. Part II gives permission to play on a broader more complex canvas. This formula has applied to every successful comic-book franchise I can think of - Spider-Man X-Men Superman Batman - until the curious case of Iron Man 2. All the main players are back (with the exception of Terrence Howard who was replaced by Don Cheadle) the budget is bigger and the somewhat irreverent tone of the first picture remains intact courtesy of Robert Downey Jr. who remains funny and engaging as Tony Stark the billionaire with a bad ticker and a super-cool suit of armor. The main problem with Iron Man 2 lies in the script by actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux (he played the temperamental director in Mulholland Dr.). Instead of amping up the stakes and furthering the relationships among the characters - such as Starks simmering flirtations with his trusty personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who has been promoted to CEO of Stark Enterprises - Iron Man 2 recycles most of the elements from the first film to dwindling returns. You keep waiting for the film to kick into third or even second gear but it never happens. Once again Stark must squirrel away into his lab to build a replacement for his weak ticker (the one he built in the first film turns out to have had toxic side-effects). Once again there is a baddie Ivan Vanko (a wasted Mickey Rourke) who wants to build a robot evil enough to turn Iron Man into scrap metal. Aside from Vanko the films chief villain is a weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to do what Stark wont Supply the U.S. military with the technology Stark wants to keep for himself. Director Jon Favreau who continues to get better at big-budget gloss keeps the film interesting on a visual level but theres only so much he can do with a screenplay saddled with more dialogue than a Merchant/Ivory picture about repressed British people sipping tea and munching on crumpets. Iron Man 2 is one seriously talky movie With the exception of an early scene in which Vanko disrupts a car race with his electrical whips which can slice through anything like light sabers there is no action whatsover - I mean none - until the climactic 20 minutes (and even that is stolen from the leading man by a fantastic Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow to Marvel Comics fans) . But unlike Avatar which rewarded your patience with a stupendous action setpiece the wait this time simply isnt worth it. Im all for movies that take their time developing their characters but this is ridiculous. Iron Man 2 is more of a set-up for the upcoming Avengers picture than a stand-alone adventure - a puzzling and unexpected disappointment considering how fresh and entertaining the first picture was. The summer movie season gets started with a fat dud. Iron Man 2 ( out of ) opens Friday May 7. Spoiler note If you sit through the end credits youll be rewarded with a brief coda (SPOILERS AHEAD) in which Thors hammer makes an appearance. The scene is not worth the wait.

Watched it yesterday online (pirated copies are all over the internet) and it really does suck. It reminded me of the Transformers franchise full of CGI and loud explosions. There was no character development with Black Widow or Nick Fury; why did they even bother writing them in? It was two hours of jumbled mess. Posted by Joan | May 05 2010 at 0900 PM I hear a lot of mixed reactions about this one. Ill have to wait to see it before I can say anything but I am not expecting it to be better than the first one. So far IGNs review seems the most plausible to me. They also said the film was too unecessarily talky though they enjoyed all the Avengers set up stuff. i dont know what to think of that. i hate the thought that they sacrificed this movie just to set up The Avengers. But im gonna wait to see if it works for me or not. You know this summer really doesnt look very appealing. Only Inception and Toy Stoy 3 look like they might deliver the goods. No sure things aside those two. Everything else looks iffy. Hopefully I enjoy Iron Man 2 more then you did. Posted by Juan | May 05 2010 at 1157 PM You guys have no clue what you are talking about. The movie kicked ass Of course its going to be filled with special effects. Its called IRON MAN idiots If you wanted charater development go watch Brokeback Mointain Posted by Take that | May 06 2010 at 0716 AM Take That Can you please point out the line in my review where I complain about the film having too many special effects? Because one of the problems with the movie to me was that there was was too much Tony Stark and not enough Iron Man. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | May 06 2010 at 1038 AM Dude this movie was the worst thing i have ever seen Do not go see it It was a COMPLETE waste of time. I loved the first one loved spider man movies LOVED batman but this. ohh this was just terrible. Posted by Ni66a | May 06 2010 at 0522 PM aaaaaaahhhhhhhh maaaannn. i was hyped for this movie. not so much now. cono Posted by cinesi | May 06 2010 at 0744 PM I agree that its not as good as Iron Man. But its still very entertaining thanks to Robert Downey Jr. who provide the quirkiness of Tony Stark himself. Theres no better actor to portray Stark than RDJ.

Photo Francois Duhamel If the original was a well-oiled fun machine with Robert Downey Jr. as the rare un-anguished superhero who actually reveled in his powers the overblown ""Iron Man 2"" finds our hero clanking his way through tedious subplots and a talky script thats dangerously low on Tony Starks trademark quips. This megabucks sequel will likely reap untold hundreds of millions on the back of its much superior predecessor which I gave 3 1/2 stars. But its only fitfully entertaining as an all-star indie team led again by director Jon Favreau who gets swallowed up by the same sort of overproduced overkill as ""Spider Man 3."" MORE ON THE MOVIES BLOG BOX OFFICE PREDICTIONS PHOTOS IRON MAN AS CAREER REHAB VIDEO IRON MAN 2 REVIEW READ MORE IRON MAN 2 ON THE POSTS MOVIES BLOG As the film opens Tony Stark the zillionaire playboy who came out as Iron Man in a press conference at the end of the last movie is dying from Palladium the element that powers his Iron Man suit. As if that werent enough of a downer a senator (Garry Shandling) who doesnt appreciate that Tony ""successfully privatized world peace"" (as our hero puts it) wants to nationalize Iron Man. And Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) a rival arms manufacturer has joined forces with Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) a rogue Russian physicist who has a grudge against Tony and our heros late father. Tonys own issues with his dead dad (John Slattery of ""Mad Men"" in flashbacks) are also in the background as our hero starts a bigger version of the old mans massive technology fair at Flushing Meadows -- which he amusingly launches by descending on a stage filled with chorus girls. Closer to his fabulous cliffside home in Malibu hes installed the long-suffering ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries. It isnt exactly a surprise that her dishy successor as Gal Friday Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is a double agent not only for Hammer but fellow Marvel superhero Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who continues vamping with a cameo until he gets a blockbuster of his own. Theres so much clunky exposition in the script attributed to Justin Theroux that it seems forever before the first action sequence which has surprisingly mediocre special effects. Vanko wielding what resembles electric lariats confronts Tony who for no good reason has impulsively decided to compete in the Grand Prix de Monte Carlo. Tony wins that round but his increasingly self-destructive behavior -- he all but levels his mansion while on a bender at his birthday party -- persuades his former pal Lt. ""Rhody"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard from the first film) to steal one of Tonys suits on the militarys behalf. That Rhody is surprised the suit is turned over to Hammer by his superiors is one of many things that make little sense in this sequel. Tony finally starts having some fun -- and making some quips -- toward the end of the movie a huge showdown in Flushing Meadows that ends rather anticlimactically. Rourke is a nutty villain in a largely non-speaking role and Paltrow is reduced to mothering our hero. Johannson has little to do but pout when she isnt maiming bad guys. Shes given exactly one decent line -- asking Tony ""dirty enough for you?"" when she hands him a martini. Even Christiane Amanpour and Bill OReilly have more to say in their cameos. ""Iron Man 2"" doesnt match let alone surpass the heavy metal standard set by its predecessor. While it has its moments there are times when I found myself agreeing when the ADHD-addled Tony complains he finds something ""boring boring."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The last WASP Read Next The last WASP Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 35394 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20778 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 18357 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

With Robert Downey Jr. Mickey Rourke Scarlett Johansson. Director Jon Favreau (205). PG-13 Action violence innuendo. At area theaters Friday.""Iron Man 2"" opening Friday kicks off the summer movie season with laser blasts rocket guns and a smash-ending set in New York. The irony is that despite all the clanky fun its biggest weapon remains the power of personality.This sequel to the 2008 mega-blockbuster fires on more cylinders than the first film yet relies on star Robert Downey Jr. more than it does kinetic energy and rock em-sock em technology (which it has in spades). Downey is the franchises best special effect; his millionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark thinks and talks at the speed of sound. We want to know whats in Tonys head more than what fuels his red-and-gold armor.Here Stark -- an unusual comic-book character in that he enjoys people knowing hes the man in the iron mask -- has gone from defense contractor to global troubleshooter. And hes enjoying it since with great rock-star status comes great feelings of invincibility.But Tony has a full plate ahead of him The generator in his chest that keeps him alive is slowly poisoning his blood. The U.S. government wants to copy and weaponize his Iron Man suit. And a gold-toothed Russian named Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up with a hatred of the Stark family and his own electro-gadget connected to lightning whips. Robert Downey Jr. proves his (heavy) mettle in Iron Man 2 With Rourke facing Downey ""Iron Man 2"" becomes a battle of the reformed bad boys. Their first fight at a Monaco race track is raucous though as with much of the movie the actors make it better than the usual superhero cage match. Sexy Scarlett Johansson is Natalie aka Black Widow a spy in the house of Stark. Don Cheadle takes over from ""IM 1s"" Terrence Howard as Tonys pal Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes known as War Machine when he gets into some silver armor. And Samuel L. Jackson is eye-patched S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury.Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper Potts is elevated from Tonys girl Friday to his more-than-efficient love match (she and Downey put their own spin on flirty bantering). Sam Rockwell snakes around as a Stark-lite rival industrialist and John Slattery (""Mad Men"") has a nice nostalgic moment as Tonys late father.Rourke continuing a comeback gives the movie a terrific jolt letting his scowls do the talking. The doubling theme becomes a bit much -- the story is more ""Attack of the Clones"" than ""The Empire Strikes Back"" -- but director Jon Favreau still hones in on the movies heart. Where the first adventure was about Tonys rebirth this is about his fear of death. And thanks to Downey it still has a long battery life.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The man with a battery where his heart ought to be is restless driven glib grandiose -- which is to say the billionaire industrialist still exhibits all the self-absorbed antiheroic qualities with which Downey first delighted us in the role two years ago. So if this sequel doesnt glow with the same charm as the original and if Iron Mans face-offs against evil lack edge the diminished satisfaction has less to do with the quality of the stars trademark catch-me-if-you-can energy than it does with a performance anxiety that now pervades the whole shebang. Are returning director Jon Favreau and the Marvel Studios producing team buckling under pressure to give the people more of what they think the people want and make it bigger too? Thats the only reason I can think of for the time and money devoted to loud long escalating battle scenes waged among inconsequential war machines (theres nothing duller) that are themselves merely the products of CG artists -- undifferentiated action sequences that stall long stretches of the story and threaten to stomp out the quotient of fun. Which is an odd choice since people who loved the original are exactly the people who dont want clang for clangs sake We want zingy repartee we want characters we want attitude to spice up the further adventures of a superhero still getting used to the demands and perks of the job and drinking too much under stress. We want what Downey had in mind when he pushed for Justin Theroux to write the screenplay quick-thinking wit from the hip writer-actor who co-wrote Tropic Thunder. Naturally we also want a few juicy bad guys. Here were given a choice of villainous types. Mickey Rourke goes for Slavic-psycho stylings as a grimy Russki creep named Ivan Vanko whos been nursing a long-festering complaint against Starks late dad (John Slattery in a nice touch is seen in 60s-style film-reel flashback living the Mad Men life). In a contrasting star turn of virtuoso smarm enhanced by the telling detail of self-tanning dye stuck to his palms Sam Rockwell struts and preens as arms manufacturer Justin Hammer always ready to cut a corner to fill a military contract. For a change were given a choice of pertinent dames too as Stark interacts with two very different female employees. His loyal spunky former assistant Pepper Potts (reprised by radiant ponytailed Gwyneth Paltrow bright as a penny) has been promoted to CEO of his company allowing the boss to go all hound-dog around her curvy purring (and as it turns out secretly busy) replacement Natasha played in full come-hither mode by Scarlett Johansson. (Natasha you may have heard reveals her true identity soon enough and does a passable superheroine martial-arts crouch in a skintight bodysuit.) The Iron Man 2 story expands from a lot to a whole lot. Along the way Stark becomes obsessed with reviving his fathers plans for a showcase for the humanitarian uses of cutting-edge technology. Stark broods (as only a Downey character can) over the progressive corrosion of his substitute heart. And theres a dispensable detour involving Starks military buddy Rhodey (played by Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in a thankless role). With all that heavy payload Iron Man 2 begins to burst at its own galvanized seams as the Marvel instinct for faceless warfare among comic-book characters bangs up against the Downey-Favreau-Theroux instinct for goofitude. (Qualifying as goofy comedian Garry Shandling plays a U.S. senator Bill OReilly plays himself and at one point Iron Man resting curled within the curve of a famous Southern California food-sculpture landmark is told ""Sir Im going to have to ask you to exit the doughnut."")

Iron Man 2 Fair to good Director Jon Favreau. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Sam Rockwell Mickey Rourke. Rating Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some language. RELATED Poll Super vs. super Superheroes we love Supervillains we love Movies based on comic books Spotlight Robert Downey Jr. Spotlight Gwyneth Paltrow Spotlight Don Cheadle Spotlight Samuel L. Jackson Just not all the time. Unevenly paced and at times visually almost incoherent especially during action scenes the film stays afloat as director Jon Favreau relies heavily on the considerable charms of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark along with an excellent supporting cast. Not that Favreau always knows what to do with it; certainly its disappointing that Mickey Rourke spends 80 percent of the climactic battle . . . typing. Yes clickity-clack on a laptop keyboard programming drones to take down Iron Man because well thats what Russian physicists insane with grief do I guess. Thats who Rourke plays Ivan Vanko a brilliant man with bad dentition who believes that his fathers downfall was caused by Tony Starks father. Now hes out for revenge. Though its not clear that he need be; Starks growing ego might have taken him down without any outside help. The toxicity caused by his fake heart isnt doing him any favors either. ""Iron Man 2"" picks up where the original left off right after Stark reveals that he is indeed Iron Man. Months pass and hes flying high literally and figuratively telling a congressional hearing to which hes just refused to give his Iron Man technology ""I have successfully privatized world peace"" Not so fast bub. Not only is Vanko making progress with a sort of steampunk Iron Man knockoff suit Stark is also being flanked by a competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) a squirrelly arms developer itching for a government contract. Meanwhile Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) Starks loyal assistant is trying to convince Stark that he needs to pay more attention to his company (he responds by promoting her). His friend Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is trying to keep Stark in the Armys relatively good graces. And newly hired legal representative Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) seems to know an awful lot about martial arts. . . . Ultimately none of this matters much. The fun that ""Iron Man 2"" offers is found in the interaction between the characters not the story. Even though Hammer is something of a stock character the anything-for-money sort Rockwell is obviously having fun with him. Hammers dealings with Vanko who he sees as a tool to get at Stark are most enjoyable. A scene in which Hammer tries to sell Rhodey on various types of guns is even better. Hammer isnt a super hero but I wouldnt mind seeing a movie about him if Rockwell played the role. Garry Shandling is also really good as the U.S. senator who wants Starks secrets. Cheadle is a fine replacement for Terrence Howard as Rhody. Johansson gets to dye her hair red and kick a lot of butt. Rourke speaks Russian wields electronic whips but spends a lot of time on the sidelines thinking about designing or building weapons designed to kill Stark. Downey is still enormously entertaining to watch his disheveled super hero trying to come to terms with a different kind of recognition than hes used to while he tries to keep himself alive. If that sounds like a lot to sort through well thats the biggest problem with the movie. With all those elements in play Favreau is forced to jump around from one character to the next meaning that if youre enjoying an exchange between Rhodey and Stark well dont get too attached because were soon bouncing over to Vanko driving Hammer crazy. Individually theyre enjoyable moments but its hard to keep a narrative flow. There are hints of an Avengers movie to come (fanboys will want to stick around past the lengthy credits for a specific tease) as well as a funny nod to Captain America. There are lots of things too many things to keep up with for ""Iron Man 2"" to be as satisfying as the original. But as long as Downeys portrayal is one of those things then its hard to complain too much. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

By Anthony Lane Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey Jr. face off in Jon Favreaus movie.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka We have supped full with wonders. After swarms of human mutations and alien life-forms borne along on a tide of fireballs what can cinema still surprise us with? Well believe me until youve heard Mickey Rourke speaking Russian you really dont know what special effects are. In ""Iron Man 2"" he plays Ivan Vanko a metal-fanged Muscovite physicist who taking his cue from Hamlet plans to avenge his fathers death by destroying Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) lately revealed as Iron Man whose own father Ivan thinks was the cause of his fathers demise. If that sounds nebulous it is. I like the ""Iron Man"" franchise but even the most fervid fan would have to concede that motivations are not its strongest suit. That honor goes to the armored rocket-boosted Ferrari-red outfit that Tony dons whenever he wants to zip across the firmament or impress girls. The fact that its forged from heavy metal is the only possible excuse for the AC/DC numbers that have been dumped all over the soundtrack. In contrast to Bruce Wayne who appears to have learned his public-relations technique from Thomas Pynchon Tony relates to his public all too well. We see him at the opening of the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows a year-long celebration of Tony and all his works; at a televised Senate committee hearing where ever modest he says that he has ""successfully privatized world peace""; and at a raucous soiree where he blasts champagne bottles out of the air with his palm-mounted power ray. A peaceful existence all told and one of the pleasures of Jon Favreaus movie with its reams of alert dialogue by Justin Theroux is that it manages to celebrate a full-time narcissist without sucking up to him or letting him shrink into a pest. To find a comic-book hero who doesnt agonize over his supergifts and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them is frankly a relief. Rising from this spree is an affable determination--almost a pact agreed upon by a handful of characters--to squeeze as much talk as possible into the time available. For Downey of course this is no sweat; he long ago patented his hyper-mumble which sounds like Gregory Peck on speed pouring forth low streams of charming verbiage. (The brief impersonation of Peck that he unleashed in ""Only You"" sixteen years ago was frighteningly good.) If necessary Downey is happy to charm himself should there be no one else around to play with but ""Iron Man 2"" finds an upsized role for Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts his exasperated assistant and Favreau does well to stand back and let the pair of them duck and weave turning their flirtation into overlapping chat--a touch of Robert Altman amid a storm of high technology. Also on hand is Sam Rockwell who romps and revels in the part of a noisome arms manufacturer named Hammer and Scarlett Johansson as Tonys legal adviser who mixes a mean Martini. ""Is that dirty enough for you?"" she asks handing him a glass. All these folk are so plainly enjoying the ride that to watch it slow and stall under the weight of dead plot is a cause for regret. Theroux Favreau and the cast have a mind to attempt what no other team has done to take the built-in hyperbole of the genre and treat it as food for laughs. Iron Mans aspirations are as puffed up as those of Batman Spider-Man Watchmen Fantastic Four and the rest of the gang but the telling of his tale feels more leavened and less savage than theirs and its a pity that Favreau didnt go the whole way and toss out the creaky narrative junk. Why have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) a growler with an eye patch show up halfway through like a refugee from another comic? Why have Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) Starks best friend put on a rival metal suit and battle him almost to the death for no discernible reason? The answer is that the audience craves its fix of fighting which means that ""Iron Man 2"" has to keep the clashes coming. The story has piles of momentum but unlike Tonys suit no core and that is why he casts around in some desperation for a fitting opponent. The image that stays with you as the movie dwindles to a close is that of Tony alone in his workshop summoning computerized holograms and then lightly batting them aside one after the next like a gourmet sending back dishes. His real foe isnt Vanko Hammer Rhodes or Fury. Its boredom. The new film of Chekhovs ""The Duel"" was shot in Croatia on the Dalmatian coast. As long as the action stays at sea level the place makes a passable substitute for the Caucasian resort where the original tale is set--nagged by fits of fever and hysterics and swathed in a summer heat that mocks the gentlemens stiff collars and the ladies corsets. In the movies second scene the sight of Laevsky (Andrew Scott) our supremely unheroic hero stretched out on a divan with a cloth over his face to keep off the flies which pester him as though he were a horse or a cadaver sets a tone of itchy indolence that never eases. The movies problem begins as you lift up your eyes to the hills. In Chekhov these are craggy and hostile a fitting backdrop to the dried-out souls who dwell below but Dover Koshashvilis film lingers on green slopes. They suggest fruition and escape whereas for Laevsky the eternally stifled dreamer there should be no way out. He has come to this genteel hellhole with his lover Nadya (Fiona Glascott) whom he filched from her husband like a wallet. Now he regrets the theft and she too has tired of their scandalous menage and bestowed her charms on other men. ""Im sure well find a way to settle the account"" a shopkeeper says with a smirk as she covets a new parasol and a feathered hat. Insofar as Laevsky has any friends there is Samoylenko (Niall Buggy) a robust doctor who spends half his time sweating in the kitchen to feed his two lodgers a footling man of God (Jeremy Swift) and in the opposing camp a scientist named Von Koren (Tobias Menzies) whose scorn for the feeble and the fanciful leads him to declare repeatedly and not wholly in jest that unproductive members of society should be exterminated. ""The Duel"" was written in 1891. The Von Korens would not have long to wait. Little happens onscreen. The characters bicker picnic bathe and borrow money the usual small change of the Chekhovian deal. The title fight itself like the scrap between Rhodes and Iron Man seems to spring from nowhere ""I accept your challenge"" Von Koren declares to Laevsky at the tail end of an argument no more fractious than any other. ""What challenge?"" Laevsky asks. Little happens on the page either except within the busy heads of Chekhovs characters. There and there alone everything happens as persons great and small ponder the paths that they could but will not take. These unspoken neverlands are in the main impossible to dramatize and Koshashvili and his screenwriter Mary Bing are right to grab at them whenever they flicker into view; hence the sad joke at the close of the movie when the deacon is invited on a journey of exploration. ""To the ends of the earth"" he replies although everyone knows full well that he will travel no farther than the jetty or the end of a park bench. Admirers of ""The Lady with the Dog"" (1899)--Chekhovs most wrenching tale which was filmed by the Russian director Iosif Kheifits in 1960--will be pleased to note in the midst of ""The Duel"" a lady walking by complete with little dog. It is a moment of intersection suggesting that Chekhovs stories are not so much fabrications as linked reports from an existing world and it recurs here when Nadya on the brink of an assignation slices open a melon. She is foreshadowing her fellow-adulterer in ""The Lady with the Dog"" who will do exactly the same in the wake of his own lovemaking. If anything she has the advantage because the inside of the fruit is a vivid match for her rich red hair and we instantly see her more than ever as a creature of the flesh. Chekhov never offered a more tempting sample of sexual ripeness and Fiona Glascott a young Irish actress bites into the role with conviction; in truth she carries the movie. Most of her colleagues adopt the slightly arch languor that one has met in a hundred productions of Chekhov plays and Andrew Scott struggles to give life to the spineless Laevsky; it would take a performer of great strength to embody someone so weak. As for the screenplay it is littered with those archaic cries that reek of the stage (""What a fine evening"" ""But what of that?"") and one poor actress even has to exclaim ""Dont speak"" like Dianne Wiest in ""Bullets Over Broadway."" That is why Glascott is needed so badly. As she dabs rouge onto her ghost-pale skin or repels Laevsky with a sudden smash of the elbow when he tries to foist himself upon her from behind she reminds us that Chekhov was the laureate not just of autumnal ennui but of an irritable summers lust. Men duel pathetically with pistols at dawn. Women can pick their time and place. They already have the weapons.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Bruce Wayne could only gaze in envy on its sleek lines its perch above the Malibu coast its softly lit lab with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the sea. In Iron Man 2 the lean bouffanted Downey toils in crisply tailored shirts amid machines poised to answer every whim overseen by a computer with the voice of Paul Bettany English smooth sweet-tempered like C-3PO on chamomile tea with all the superciliousness expunged. In and out march A-list babes in tight dressesa gam-off between Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson in which Paltrow wins on length and then disappears in the glare of her opponents headlights. Starks loyal chauffeur is played by the movies director Jon Favreau which underlines the sequels aim-to-pamper aesthetic its Youre so money reverence carried over from Favreaus first film Swingers. When Stark in his Iron Man suit rockets onto the stage of the Stark Expoa Worlds Fairlike technology showcase spanning the length of Flushing Meadowsand the crowd shrieks and fireworks explode and a kick-line of beauties converges behind him and the egotistical Stark lifts his arms in acknowledgment of his greatness it doesnt seem as if Downey is acting. He might truly be signaling This is it folks the acme of the summer-blockbuster season. And you a mere moviegoer are blessed to be in the presence of someone so money. It would be easy to write something along the lines of Alas those millions couldnt buy a decent movie but I think they canand have. Its true that Iron Man 2 began like all sequels with a titleor more precisely a title and a numeralfollowed by a star and director and then only then a story. It doesnt come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones Superman 2 and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely. The big FX scenes dont kill the pace the way they did at the end of the original and in virtually all of Spider-Man 3. And though its very busylots of characters lots of crisscrossing subplotsFavreau and writer Justin Theroux go for a stylized screwball-comedy tempo with Ping-Pong zingers that show off their leading mans expert timing. The script isnt all fluff. Theres a wonderful exchange in Starks private plane Hes slowly dying (the palladium plug that keeps him alive is also poisoning him) and he begs Pepper Potts (Paltrow) to go off the clock and spend a few days in Veniceonly she thinks hes being his usual boyishly irresponsible self. We can recharge our batteries he pleads and she answers with a sad smile Not everyone runs on batteries Tony. See AlsoGarry Shandling on Playing Senator Stern in Iron Man 2 The first Iron Man picture peddled a bogus but appealing fantasy that an American from a family that made its fortune selling weapons to kill people in far-off countries could himself become a weaponfor peace So those of us despondent over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cheer the anti-military-industrialist-complex messagewhile also cheering the American military-industrialist ingenuity that now gave us our heavy-metal superhero savior. Either way it was America fuck yeah In Iron Man 2 Stark finds himself subpoenaed by a government that doesnt trust him to hold such unchecked power that resents his boast of having successfully privatized world peace. But his chief Senate antagonist (Garry Shandling) is clearly the puppet of a rival weapons-maker Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell with the perfect ratio of unctuousness to menace. The script doesnt clarify Hammers master plan and it dulls the political edge altogether by making Starks dead father (the peerlessly sleek John Slattery seen in corporate-propaganda films) a visionary humanitarian instead of a war profiteer. Favreau and Theroux arent taking any chances with the wing nuts this time. Not at these prices. For all the tumultuous comings-and-goings (the overexposed Samuel L. Jackson with a patch over his eye as Nick Fury; Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard as Rhodey Rhodes) the movies fulcrum is an actor who nearly 30 years ago in Diner was more money than Vince Vaughn and now is more nightmarish than Freddy Krueger. Mickey Rourke plays Starks scariest adversary the low-tech Russian killer Ivan Vanko (a.k.a. Whiplash) with messy tattoos and a mouthful of metal from which he spits bloodsmiling of course. Striding into the middle of a racetrack he throws out arms extended by long electric tendrils and slashes through cars as they hurtle past the man of war as man-o-war. Starks Iron Man suit is more formfitting now and he never looks computer-generated. When Iron Man and Whiplash face off youre aware of the actors under the costumes of the preening ex-addict Downey and the loose cannon Rourke. Such is the voltage of Iron Man 2 Even with a thousand computer artists between the actors and us we can still feel those mad crazy dangerous egos on the line. 1 2 Next Share this story...

And for the first 45 minutes or so this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good.The dialogue crackles the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko aka Whiplash for the first time. So far so excellent Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie and success looks guaranteed. But slowly imperceptibly it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so.A major problem is the number of characters Downey Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously but the same cant be said for Don Cheadle as Starks redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Starks assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts while Scarlett Johanssens Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better.As the film plays out it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts werent just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms army bases and laboratories. A flat studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes.Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun its shiny likeable and never boring. But its also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Lets hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series undeniable potential.

The reviewer might not have realized this is part of a multi-film storyline involving the Hulk Capt.

Good cast fairly well acted but theyve all appeared in much better films than this. Its comic book stuff with good effects thin storyline and poor characterisation. I was bored after about 15 mins.

First one had a lot of action and seeing iron man for the first time on film but the second one is total disappointment. They have so much characters and they literally dont do anything but prepare for ending scene. In whole movie there are 2 action scenes and one exhibition in his house. First action scene is practically whole shown on TV trailers and the second one is at the very end. And I really dont get it - they decide to make a movie about comic hero and they concentrate on his inner struggles instead of action. And what struggles are those is he going to be a happy rich spoil brat or sad rich spoil brat and you can guess which ultimately wins. Not to mention that the bad guys are made pretty much like in 1st movie where they again try to make new iron man for themselves.

""Iron Man 2"" isnt as much fun as its predecessor but by the time the smoke clears itll do. Much like ""The Dark Knight"" this Paramount release brings an enormous stash of goodwill to the party thanks to a well-crafted origin tale whose popularity fueled anticipation for a follow-up. Yet while the first go-round for this lesser-known Marvel hero benefited from its freshness and visual flair the beats here are more familiar the pacing more uneven. Given the demand though that will hardly matter and this armored adventure promises to be a money-making machine that clicks on all cylinders. In a sense the virtues and weaknesses of the latest movie are reversed from those of the original. That film cleverly buzzed along in detailing how Iron Man came to be -- while establishing Robert Downey Jr. as a niftily cool smartass superhero -- then fizzled a bit toward the end amid a so-so CGI melee. Here the movie bounces through various travails assailing its hero Downeys Tony Stark -- whose high-tech heart gizmo is also wreaking havoc on his body -- in less compelling fashion. Fortunately that gives way to a final 35 minutes or so that delivers the goods with two Iron Men (with the sidekick now played by Don Cheadle) in full-throttle action. Throw in Scarlett Johansson kicking butt as an acrobatic super-spy in a skin-tight suit (perhaps wisely never referred to by her comicbook name Black Widow) and well whats not to like? If there are more heroes around as is so often the case with sequels theres villain inflation as well. Starks enemies include a Russian physicist (Mickey Rourke much closer to his role in ""Sin City"" than ""The Wrestler"") with his own access to advanced technology and a long-simmering grudge against the Stark family; and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) an oily defense contractor desperate for his own super-suit. There are enough fun moments in Jon Favreaus playful direction (from Justin Therouxs workmanlike script) and Downeys performance -- a tycoon whos equal parts Warren Buffett and Kid Rock -- to satisfy a weekend audience but one needs a forgiving nature to get past the flabby midsection. The special effects meanwhile are more plentiful and polished once they fully kick into high gear though there are still shots where that gleaming suit looks a bit more animated than it should. All told ""Iron Man 2"" suffers the same fate as many a sequel. Where the first film felt buoyant and occasionally inspired in helpfully demonstrating that done right theres considerable treasure to be culled even from second-tier occupants of the Marvel universe the new pic feels more duty-bound and industrial. As further evidence of the apparent desire to cover all bases there are cameos by Christiane Amanpour (then still at CNN) and Fox News Bill OReilly as well as a slimy senator (Garry Shandling) being interviewed on MSNBC. Thats not to say the movie lacks its charms. But as Tony Starks free-spirited CEO might attest while serving the needs of a major conglomerate has its perks the task also comes with more than its share of obligations.

"Movie review Iron Man 2 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review Iron Man 2The sequel starring Robert Downey Jr. along with Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson is acceptable nothing more.May 06 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic Contrasting TV news personalities Bill OReilly and Christiane Amanpour dont see eye to eye on much but they stand united in agreeing it was worth their time to make cameo appearances in the sequel to the mega-successful "" Iron Man."" Such is the persuasive power of a film that took in more than half a billion dollars at box offices worldwide. Once a film makes that much money it is only a matter of time until the sequel prudently titled ""Iron Man 2"" arrives and that time is now. As sequels go this one is acceptable nothing more nothing less. With star Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau back in the fold this is a haphazard film thrown together by talented people with all the pluses and minuses that implies. Given the non-organic way ""Iron Man 2s"" plot came into the world a hatched by the producers in a series of meetings before a screenwriter was brought on a its surprising that the film has any pluses at all. What makes the difference at least for a while is the sense of humor of screenwriter Justin Theroux who also wrote for Downey in the manic ""Tropic Thunder."" A film that just wants to have fun ""Iron Man 2"" brings back Downeys affable billionaire Tony Stark former weapons manufacturer and self-described textbook narcissist whose exploits inside the all-powerful Iron Man suit have bought a welcome calm to the world. The man himself however has to face the challenge of the erratic battery in his chest that makes him a superhero with an expiration date. Not one to hide his light under a bushel or anything else for that matter Stark likes to say things like ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" Clearly this is one ego thats cruising for a bruising and no one plays over-the-top self-satisfaction with more A(c)lan than Downey. ""Iron Man 2"" is at its best when it surrounds him with practiced farceurs who are adept at keeping things funny. Sam Rockwell is appropriately icky as rival weapons tycoon and smirking slimeball Justin Hammer (of Hammer Industries of course) and Garry Shandling matches him as an oily and obnoxious U.S. senator who cant wait to get the governments greedy hands on Starks design. Scarlett Johansson also gets into the act as amusing drop-dead mysterious triple agent Natalie Rushman and even actor-director Favreau has expanded his own role as Starks man-of-all-work Happy Hogan. The most enjoyably scenery-chewing acting of the movie however comes from Mickey Rourke who looks as if hes having the time of his life as Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash a disenchanted Russian with a family grudge against Stark as well as the ability to come up with a suit of his own to challenge our hero for world domination. Whether chewing on a toothpick cozying up to his parrot or displaying more tattoos than the entire Russian mafia Rourkes Vanko may look like a doorman at a bondage club when he gets into his Whiplash costume but once he cracks those devastating whips the film takes advantage of his electricity. Not faring so well are the performers who either dont have a comic touch or dont get to use it which in this case include Gwyneth Paltrow as Starks close associate and excruciating hysteric Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle who has mysteriously replaced Terrence Howard as humorless Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes. Though he is nominally Starks good friend Rhodey gets so peeved at him he steals one of the Iron Man suits and emerges as War Machine to battle toe to toe with Tony in one of the films more pointless combat scenes. In fact though they no doubt cost the earth and employed effects houses without number the battles in ""Iron Man 2"" are so pro forma in terms of motivation and execution (except for the first appearance of Whiplash) that their main reason for existence has to be to feed the frenzy of the films fanboy base. Catering to that base causes other problems. Though Nick Fury leader of the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization may be well known to Marvel Comics devotees less deep-dish viewers will be simply baffled when the Samuel L. Jackson character appears on the screen. It would be too bad if Marvel became so intent on creating an on-screen empire by uniting all its superhero films (the apparent purpose of Furys character) that it forgot about the people outside the sacred circle. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Clicking on Green Links will take you to a third-party e-commerce site.
