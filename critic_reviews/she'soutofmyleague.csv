Kirk (Jay Baruchel pictured below) works in airport security and dreams of being a pilot. He also dreams of dating a girl like Molly (Alice Eve pictured below) who conveniently leaves her mobile at the airport. Returning it to sender Kirk is stunned to be invited out and struggles to believe that Molly could possibly be interested in him over a series of mishap-riddled dates. Predictably said mishaps include crude gross-out comedy gags aimed squarely at 12-year-old lads. Less predictably this has a decent stab at exploring the psychology of physically mismatched relationships. After a series of hunks Molly is experimenting with inner beauty while Kirk is plagued by low self-esteem after being dumped by his controlling ex.Both leads have charm - Londoner Eve (daughter of Trevor who has a cameo) easily passes for a glamorous American while Baruchel mixes the beguiling delivery of a young Christian Slater with an awkward gait and a hangdog expression. Hes nowhere near plain enough but those whove seen the similarly themed but visually unappealing I Love You Beth Cooper will treat that as a blessing.Its funny in parts Kirks brash socially inept pal Stainer (TJ Miller) amuses and Mollys bitchy best friend Pattie (Krysten Ritter) is great while far prettier than anyone gives her credit for. Other supporting characters - including Kirks idiotic family - fall flat and fail to ring true. Shes Out of My League is uneven and frequently juvenile. But like its hero it has hidden depths - its just a shame theyre not allowed to shine.

It is a romantic comedy but with a very unlikely couple and as the reviewer says there are plenty of raunchy laughing moments. Sort of along the lines of 40-Year-Old-Virgin. It s more of a raunchy comedy no where near as bad as I expected and really quite a fairly good espcapist comedy.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 5 2010_Matt_77_FeaturedThis film had me actually crying with laughter at two points. Yes those were probably the juvenile jokes that the Time-Out reviewer takes aim at but if the jokes make you laugh to the point of crying does it matter that theyre juvenile? This film is not as funny as The Hangover but if youre not fixated with pseudo-intellectual snobbery its well worth seeing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/88414/shes-out-of-my-league.html,200,she'soutofmyleague0,she'soutofmyleague,timeout
"Movie Review Shes Out of My League hits a home run - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-R-ratedMOVIE REVIEW Movie Review Shes Out of My League hits a home runR-rated comedy mixes raunch and decency thanks to the writing team director and stars.March 12 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Jay Baruchel is a ""5"" and Alice Eve is a ""10"" in ""Shes... (Paramount Pictures )There is one particular question that has long bothered and befuddled some of our greatest minds -- Freudians Jungians Judd Apatowians Seth Rogenians and other noted R-rated auteurs alike Can an attractive female fall in love with and I use the scientific term here a schlub? It remains a huge philosophical debate of course so props to ""Shes Out of My League"" for wading unapologetically and unafraid into the fraught and frothy surf of the ""Im not worthy"" genre of films. And more props for doing so with a disarming sentimentality and a certain decency along with the requisite raunch and repressed rage. The disarming part and much of the films good humor comes courtesy of central schlub Kirk played by Jay Baruchel as the kind of adult his gawky college freshman in ""Undeclared"" might have grown into if he had skipped class -- a smart sweet underachiever who works security at an airport. Now the un-hunks of the world may not always get the girl but they do come with a standard crew at least in the movies. Kirk has Stainer (T.J. Miller) in the exceedingly dense but lovable lout role Devon (Nate Torrence) the married romantic and expert on Princess Jasmine (of Aladdin . . . ) and Jack (Mike Vogel) as the coolest guy in their un-cool crowd and thus the sex guru because hes had sex (its really not clear that Devon despite the ring really has). ""The girl"" here is Molly (Alice Eve) a leggy blond beauty to which a lot of math is applied as in ""shes a hard 10 youre a 5 no way can a 5 date a 10"" which is pretty much the entire premise of the movie. Molly and Kirk meet at the airport after a very long tracking shot mostly from above so that everyone can get a glimpse of her ""assets"" although the legs and the long flowing locks get a bit of screen time too. Kirk rescues Molly from the creep with the metal-detecting wand because apparently despite terrorists threats if youre a beautiful blond you can get past security with a few well-distributed smiles. And thus their implausible love story begins. There are rules to the form and the filmmakers hit most of the fundamental tropes in ways that range from surprisingly fresh to you-could- see-that-one-coming-a-mile-away. On the fresh side there is one bit that is bound to join the all-time raunch comedy annals with director Jim Field Smith showing a keen understanding of the fine art of milking ""the implied"" rather than stooping to ""the exposed"" when it comes to going for the laugh. The filmmaking team is mostly unknown at least at the moment with the British director having previously done a few comedy shorts with names that are clever in that U.K. way like ""Where Have I Been All Your Life?"" Screenwriters Sean Anders and John Morris have a couple of priors including 2005s ""Never Been Thawed"" which was mainly seen by friends and family and 2008s "" Sex Drive"" something of an underground cult hit. But with this film and the upcoming ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" (written with Josh Heald) they seem poised to become the newest members of the male comedy writers club that has become the go-to gene pool for studios looking for big payoffs from small investments. Ads have already likened the film to ""The Hangover"" though its not as tightly constructed or as consistently funny. But what helps get ""Shes Out of My League"" through the rough patches and predictable moments is its sentimental side. That soft touch as opposed to the angry edge that has become de rigueur for the genre means the girls arent quite so classically bitchy. Molly does have the Sarah Silverman-style friend Patty (Krysten Ritter) dropping F-bombs all over the place and Kirks ex is a bit of a ranter -- but its all dialed down a notch. On the plus side Mollys smarter and more independent than most of those shoved into the pretty girl box. Nothing would work though without the appealing Baruchel who has floated through a lot of R-ratings since his ""Undeclared"" days including ""Knocked Up"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" and is the voice of Hiccup the Viking teen star in the upcoming ""How to Train Your Dragon"" animated movie. What he brings to ""Shes Out of My League"" in addition to the geek and the gawk is a dash of the debonair which might seem impossible and yet he does. The character also goes for polite over pot as a central reason for his schlubian state a quality so rare in these modern times that it seems like an entirely new concept.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Shes Out of My League Directed by Jim Field Smith Written by Sean Anders and John Morris Starring Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve Classification 14A You dont need to root for the best movies and you dont want to root for the worst. But occasionally along comes a picture so nearly good that you dearly wish it were better. Welcome to Shes Out of My League where the rooting interest is strong but so is the frustration. You keep pulling for it even when it pushes you away. Its beauty-and-the-beast premise has certainly been around the block. Nerdy guys bumbling into hot girls (sometimes the reverse) are a regular item in teen and twentysomething fare. Here nerdy Kirk and his Brillo-pad do (Jay Baruchel) toil in airport security at the Pittsburgh terminal. Unable to attend college (""My Dad built a swimming pool instead"") he took the job fresh out of high school and by now his expectations are about as high as those grounded planes. Kirk has comfortably settled into his bottom-rung status - an ex-girlfriend dumps him cest la vie in his world of diminishing returns. When the gorgeous Molly (Alice Eve) shows up at his security gate male heads from 8 to 80 spin to catch a glimpse. Fate and a forgotten cellphone conspire to bring Kirk into her orbit whereupon the unthinkable happens. The beauty takes a genuine shine to the nerd. Says one of his buddies part of the genres usual mens chorus ""It feels like the universe is out of whack."" It feels that way to Kirk too and heres where the script takes an intriguing turn He can neither believe nor quite accept his luck. In his nasal breathy delivery Baruchel plays that confusion with admirable restraint keeping the character comic but on the safe side of farce. So when after a dinner date Molly leans over to plant a kiss he cant help himself from blurting out a grateful ""Thank you."" Alas when that kiss escalates he cant help himself again too suddenly becoming an embarrassed victim of ""the early-bird special"" - the problem may be premature but that euphemism is hilariously grown-up. Of course complications ensue as do apologies. There follows the standard rom-com journey - the build-up the break-up the make-up. Equally familiar is the set-piece format the big scenes that see us through the trip - in this case tickets to a Penguins hockey game; a restaurant visit where he keeps getting mistaken for the waiter; the meet-the-dumb-ass family tableau; and the guys version of the bikini-wax session ""male prepping"" for the evenings climax. Some of this is amusing but the rest isnt quite as funny as it should be. Almost yet not quite. In his feature debut director Jim Field Smith flashes some talent adroitly wrangling his large cast and zeroing in on their particular idiosyncrasies. But just when the payoff seems certain these scenes come up a dollar short - you dont feel cheated exactly just mildly disappointed. Still there are compensations in Baruchels performance and in Eves too (now thats an ingenues name). Shes a Brit who does really good American and thaws any hint of ice from her blond dolly making Molly sweet but never saccharine bright but not light. Even the supporting roles are worth a second look. Like Kirks ex-girlfriend Marnie the kind of woman who takes her temperature from her surroundings - shes ""hot"" until Molly arrives when her thermostat plummets along with her confidence. And then theres a kind of man rarely seen in the movies. A member of the buddy chorus Devon (Nate Torrence) is the chubby loser who isnt. No hes a bona fide winner - truly kind happily married relatively secure and un-foul of mouth. Weve all met Devon in fact but its a pleasure to see him in fiction at home on the big screen. Hes not the guy who ranks people on that tired numerical scale awarding Kirk a ""5 at best"" and Molly ""a hard 10."" He would however be a gentle critic dipping into his bucket of stars and giving even a flawed flick like Shes Out of My League an ""easy 3."" Me I couldnt possibly be so generous.

Shes way out of his league."" In order to view this feature you must download the latest version of flash player here. Thats one if not the only major problem with this film directed by Jim Field Smith (in his feature debut) from a script by Sean Anders and John Morris. Jay Baruchel of the Judd Apatow rep company (""Knocked Up"" and the television series ""Undeclared"") plays the hero -- a security officer at the Pittsburgh airport -- as such a tongue-tied head-ducking nebbish that its inconceivable that he would end up with the gorgeous smart kind hockey-loving woman played by Alice Eve. (The likable Ms. Eve was seen on Broadway in Tom Stoppards ""Rock n Roll."") The premise might work if the film were content to be a fairly undistinguished example of over-the-top gross-out comedy. Its partly that -- its funniest most transgressive scene involves Nate Torrence as a friend who sees all of life in terms of Disney musicals shaving a very tender part of Mr. Baruchels anatomy. But its also suffused with a retro mildness as if the Apatow-Jody Hill sensibility had been applied to a John Hughes script or a piece of early-80s fluff like ""No Small Affair."" On either side of that equation its out of its league. ""Shes Out of My League"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Dirty words embarrassing stains and much more talk about sex than actual sex. SHES OUT OF MY LEAGUE Opens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Jim Field Smith; written by Sean Anders and John Morris; director of photography Jim Denault; edited by Dan Schalk; music by Michael Andrews; production designer Clayton Hartley; costumes by Molly Maginnis; produced by Jimmy Miller and David Householter; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time 1 hour 45 minutes. WITH Jay Baruchel (Kirk) Alice Eve (Molly) T. J.

Comments (1) Shes Out of My League Rated R  104 minutes  2010 A nebbish who searches suitcases at the Philadelphia airport (Jay Baruchel) stumbles into a serious commitment with a hot chick (Alice Eve) though his buddies are quick to point out that shes way more attractive than he is. Lord knows the shoe-sniffing armpit-patting body-scanning Transportation Security Authority is a ripe target for sexual satire but screenwriters Sean Anders and John Morris are less interested in this idea than in the whining bromanticism of their young bucks as they expose their innermost feelings about love and loneliness. Director Jim Field Smith lifts his best beats from Judd Apatow and his worst from American Pie.

When you ask my favorite movie genre ""broad comedy"" will generally be at the bottom of the list if not altogether missing. But something about the previews of Shes Out of My League had me hopefully thinking perhaps it was in another ... well league ... from most of its ilk. Movie Information Shes Out of My LeagueRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Jim Field SmithActors Jay Baruchel Alice Eve T.J. Miller and Mike VogelRun time 134 minutesMPAA rating R (language and sexual content)Synopsis A beautiful girl falls in love with an average guy much to his (and his familys and friends) amazement.More movies from GuideLive.comHappily it is. The movies terrific - its easily my favorite film released so far this year.Yes its got a quartet of clueless 20-something guys whove remained permanently mired in adolescence its share of gross-out jokes and a plot that at least on first glance reeks of unoriginality. Geeky guy falls for gorgeous girl. Friends on both sides disapprove; his think hes headed for soul-crushing humiliation and hers think soul-crushing humiliation comes from merely being seen with this guy.But Shes Out of My League also boasts elements not so typically found in this genre from above-average acting across the board to an overlying sweetness that tempers even the lamest of icky jokes. Its not Schindlers List but its not trying to be. What its trying to be is an engaging comedy and it does that extremely well.Jay Baruchel plays the nerdy Kirk a security dude at the Pittsburgh airport. His friends - the obligatory hunk Jack (Mike Vogel) the abominably nicknamed Stainer (T.J. Miller) and the Pillsbury-doughboy look-alike Devon (Nate Torrence) - also work at the airport in various degrees of boring jobs that give them plenty of time to goof around with one another. Kirk and Her Gorgeousness Molly (Alice Eve a British actress whos a dead ringer for Reese Witherspoon) meet cute when Molly leaves her cellphone behind at security. She calls it Nate answers and they set up a meeting for its return.Alas that meeting has ""out of his league"" written all over it. Shes a high-dollar party planner and they rendezvous at a shindig being put on by Molly and her best friend-partner Patty (the marvelously snooty Krysten Ritter). But Molly tired of dating men whose physical appeal matches her own but whose intellect and character are questionable is genuinely drawn to Kirks honesty and goofy charm.Much to everyones surprise especially Kirks the two are soon an item bowling and playing den hockey (you just have to see it) with the gang. Things go horribly awry of course but the previously scornful friends intervene and the whole thing wraps up in a slapstick-comedy gem of a scene at of course the airport.Baruchel and Eve give breakout performances. He makes you see the hunky soul of gold lurking under that meek-mouse exterior and shes so witty and good-hearted that we can peek past her golden locks and perfect figure to the gawky-but-irresistible girl whos her authentic self.The supporting cast is splendid. Extra points go to Ritter who gives Patty a sardonic charm and Torrence whose aura of utter goodness turns even the most uncomfortable moment in the film - and its a doozy - into something thats not merely bearable but hilarious. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review Shes out of My League has more yucks than yuks washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Shes out of My League Movie review Shes out of My League has more yucks than yuks Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 12 2010 There are only two really good jokes -- or two really gross ones depending on your sensibility -- in ""Shes Out of My League."" Both of them are stolen. This StoryShes out of My League More yucks than yuksWatch the trailerFind showtimes The first one in this crass comedy about an Average Joe whos dating a Way Above Average Jane is little more than a riff on the infamous ""hair-gel"" scene in ""Theres Something About Mary"" with the addition of a hungry dog. If you have no idea what Im talking about -- or why that description is even vaguely disgusting -- youre too old for this movie. If on the other hand the scenario strikes you as simply well awesome you probably already have your ticket in hand purchased in advance through Fandango. Enjoy my friend. ""Shes Out of My League"" is the story of Kirk (Jay Baruchel) and Molly (Alice Eve). Hes a schlubby airport security screener without a college degree and shes a gorgeous and successful lawyer-turned-party planner. In other words theyre about as unlikely a couple as weve seen since say Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up."" Like Rogen Baruchel is no troll but hes hardly a heartthrob. Close your eyes and he sounds a little like Christian Slater circa ""Heathers."" Open them and he looks like Duckie from ""Pretty in Pink."" Molly by comparison is a ""hard 10"" as Kirks boorish friends keep reminding him all blond hair perfect teeth pneumatic breasts and presumably unbridled libido. If John Mayer were reviewing this movie hed probably describe her as ""sexual napalm"" as he did ex-girlfriend Jessica Simpson in a recent Playboy interview. And yeah its just about that misogynistic. All of which leads Kirk to undergo with descending frequency neurotic levels of insecurity (not funny) public ridicule (slightly funny) and the kind of performance anxiety that causes him during one hot and heavy make-out session with Molly to drop his coins in front of the slot machine if you know what I mean. Cue the uproar. Is there a word for the sound of laughter mixed with people throwing up in their mouths? The other show-stopping yuk -- or should that be yuck? -- involves Kirks attempt to shave his er body hair in preparation for a date with Molly. If it sounds like a rip-off of the chest-waxing scene in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" it is. Only here Kirks aim like the movies is bit lower. After much squealing wielding of razor blades and flashing of Baruchels bare buttocks Kirk enlists the assistance of his married somewhat more experienced buddy Devon (Nate Torrence). Torrence tackles his barbering duties with the same perverse -- one might even say parental -- glee he brings to every scene hes in. Ah but the moments with him are fleeting. Otherwise the film reverts to default mode comic misstep followed by obscene insult followed by blast of loud rock music. Lather rinse repeat. Molly isnt the only one whos out of an admirers league here. The movie clearly aspires to rise to the smutty-but-sweet synergy of other better films. But ""Shes Out of My League"" cant touch them.  R. At area theaters. Contains pervasive crude language and unabated sexual content. 104 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  More yucks than yuks Find showtimes Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031101448.html,200,she'soutofmyleague7,she'soutofmyleague,washingtonpost

Media San Francisco Chronicle Comedy. Directed by Jim Field Smith. With Jay Baruchel Alice Eve. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Shes Out of My League"" is about as close to pure mall fodder as youll see. At heart a mildly sentimental romantic comedy it has been pushed hard in the ""American Pie"" direction with gross-out humor general crudeness and ""hey dude"" dialogue. Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel of ""Tropic Thunder"") plays a nebbishy airport security guard - his friends peg him at about a five on the familiar rating scale. Into his life comes the stunning Molly (Alice Eve) who runs a high-end party-planning business and has a law degree. Kirks buddies put her at a ""hard 10."" Right the ""hard"" is a lame joke like much of the humor here which includes lots of naughty words a semen gag and a testicle-shaving scene. The comic premise is that Molly takes a shine to Kirk and to everyones astonishment (especially his own) starts dating him. The complication is that Kirks own insecurity threatens to scuttle the relationship. And wouldnt you know Molly has her own issues. The leads are better than the movie deserves. Baruchel is likable and Eve comes off as somewhat more human than you expect in efforts like this. Theres up-and-down comic support from T.J. Miller Mike Vogel and Nate Torrance as Kirks work buddies and Lindsay Sloane as his irascible ex-girlfriend. Its pretty sad when one of a movies best gags is that a character leads a Hall and Oates cover band. For the record Jim Field Smith directed the film and this is his first feature. -- Advisory Rated R for strong language and sexual humor and situations.

"Shes Out of My League A 5 meets a 10 and rates a 3 | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShes Out of My League A 5 meets a 10 and rates a 3Shes Out of My League gives the mathematics of love their biggest workout since Blake Edwards 10  a romantic comedy that succeeded in spite of its unsavoury premise.Molly (Alice Eve) runs into her handsome ex Cam (Geoff Stults) to the dismay of Kirk (Jay Baruchel) an average Joe who just cant believe his luck.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 12 2010 Starring Jay Baruchel Alice Eve T.J. Miller Nate Torrence and Lindsay Sloane. Directed by Jim Field Smith. 104 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Shes Out of My League gives the mathematics of love their biggest workout since Blake Edwards 10 a romantic comedy that succeeded in spite of its unsavoury premise.As does this one which also adds up to a happy elevation to leading man status for Ottawas Jay Baruchel who seemed destined to languish in lesser roles in films like Tropic Thunder and Knocked Up. You could call it luck but you need more than that to turn a single gag into something both funny and warming.Article Continued BelowBaruchel is Kirk a terminally shy nebbish who barely qualifies as a five on the infamous 1-10 list of sexual attraction. By the usual contrivances he falls into the orbit and under the spell of the pert Molly (Alice Eve) a blonde stunner described by Kirks slobbering pals as ""a hard 10.""By my reckoning Kirk is more of a six and Molly more of an eight. Its not impossible to imagine them as a couple - they make more sense than Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up - especially when Molly says shes tired of macho egotists and just wants a nice guy. It makes the films laddish mantra ""you cant jump more than two points"" rather moot.But if the pairing of Kirk and Molly isnt all that strange everything else around them is including the rarity of a rom-com set in Pittsburgh of all places.Director Jim Field Smith originally a British sketch comic brings a light touch to the absurdities he inflicts upon our mathematically challenged lovebirds as do screenwriters Sean Anders and John Morris the pens behind the under-appreciated Sex Drive.Kirk works at the Pittsburgh airport for the Transportation Safety Association that cabal of grim body patters and shoe inspectors who make U.S. air travel so fun and dignified. Kirks best pal Stainer (T.J. Miller) also works for the TSA while their other buddies the closeted Devon (Nate Torrence) and the studly Jack (Mike Vogel) have jobs elsewhere at the airport. I believe its a law in this type of movie that every hapless Romeo must have at least three sniggering pals to both encourage and embarrass him.These boys seem to have endless lunch and coffee breaks plus bosses who will tolerate security-breaking shenanigans that are beyond belief in our post-9/11 world. The antics these guys get up to are so outrageous in fact you have to wonder why the TSA allowed its label to be abused in his manner. Almost as ridiculous is Kirks extended family a collection of buffoons that includes two moronic and sexist brothers. Kirk is so much of a loser we are meant to believe he even tolerates the presence of his ex-girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane) who cant give over her attachment to his clan even though she got over Kirk two years ago.We may know exactly where Kirk and Molly are headed - he cant get over his good fortune and she cant abide being put on a pedestal - but the movie keeps upending our expectations and provoking laughs.Much of this is thanks to Baruchels considerable charm which is a cross between a young Dustin Hoffman and a less deviant Christian Slater. As for Eve she manages to put some personality into a role that doesnt require her to do much more than smile and look sexy.The filmmaker cant resist the gross-out gags that are endemic to modern rom-coms and so we get appalling moments that will be referred to as ""the dog scene"" and ""the pubic haircut scene.""Fortunately these dont detract from the overall sweet mood of the movie in which a five and a 10 combine to rate a solid three stars on the enjoyment scale.

Hopefully its out of everyones league - no moviegoer should have to sink so low. Joe Neumaier Thursday March 11 2010 616 PM Title Shes Out of My League The moronic ""Shes Out of My League"" would like to think of itself as an extension of its lead character -- gangly a bit uncouth but ultimately sweet. Unfortunately its more like the best friend in a movie like this -- irritating unfunny and something that hangs around longer than it should.Jay Baruchel doing some sort of Barney Fife/McLovin homage plays Kirk an airport worker who finds a cell phone that belongs to Molly (Alice Eve) the gorgeous blond he has just chivalrously saved from his ogling co-workers. Molly is sexy smart and successful so Kirk thinks shed never go for him. But yup she would and does though his trio of annoying pals (Mike Vogel T.J. Miller Nate Torrence) and her Goth-chick chum (Krysten Ritter) cant believe it.The missed opportunities even in something as low-concept as this are everywhere including a chance for Eve -- a British actress whose turn in ""Starter for 10"" made her feel like a young Nicole Kidman -- and Baruchel (""Tropic Thunder"") to move beyond caricatures. These two not-unlikable performers have one scene when he couldve made a pity-dating speech work but the uninspired script by Sean Anders and John Morris matches the beer-commercial visuals director Jim Field Smith aspires to.Aspiration is how this movie rolls though it ought to have aimed higher than imitating the worst of this genre. Theres barely a smirk in all of its padded hour and 45 minutes though ""League"" has the requisite Judd Apatow-ish joshing among Kirks buddies combined with some Farrelly Brothers shout-outs for the older dudes accompanying their 14-year-old brothers. A word of warning to them though Molly and Kirk only get as far as a heavy makeout session. What do you think this is the heathen 80s?

Molly (Alice Eve) is gorgeous and smart. Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is sweet but sniveling. ABOUT THE MOVIEShes Out of My League  out of four Stars Jay Baruchel Alice Eve T.J. Miller Mike Vogel Director Jim Field SmithDistributor ParamountRating R for language and sexual content Running time 1 hour 44 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY If you found it hard to buy Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl as a couple in Knocked Up youll have to seriously suspend disbelief in Shes Out of My League. INTERVIEW Rising star Jay Baruchel finds himself in a new league The notion of a gawky shambling guy with a nowhere job and no confidence attracting a beautiful woman with everything going for her is definitely a male fantasy. How often do we see the opposite scenario in movies? But plausibility aside the key to making the scenario work is comedy. Much can be forgiven if it delivers enough laughs. Thats the main problem here. Its short on clever humor and big on convention and formula. There are a few quirky laughs mostly courtesy of T.J. Miller and Nate Torrence two peripheral characters and some gross-out moments but nothing along the lines of the Judd Apatow-level rowdy fun its trying for. The film stars Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) as Kirk an airport security worker who seems like a sweet enough guy but hardly someone who could believably attract a babe. He has a tentative sniveling manner thats more annoying than enticing. Still somehow were supposed to buy that he not only attracts but holds on to the pretty sexy and accomplished Molly (Alice Eve). If theyd perhaps shared an interest in anything we might more easily buy this romance. But hes an awkward underachiever with low self-esteem and little ambition and shes a worldly lawyer and event planner brimming with confidence. The one believable aspect is his neurotic nagging sense that hes not worthy and the effect that has on their relationship. On their first date she casually speaks French to the wine steward while hes so clumsily unctuous hes mistaken for a waiter. Were supposed to believe that because she was hurt by hot guys her search is now simply for someone she thinks will not hurt her. The biggest problem is that Kirk is a good-natured doofus but lacks charisma. At one point Molly is asked what she sees in Kirk -- by members of his own family -- and shes mildly flummoxed. When she comes back with something about how he makes her laugh it seems like faint praise. While Baruchel has an endearingly open face he has a nervous almost grating speaking style that undercuts his appeal. Meanwhile Molly is a bona fide male fantasy. Gorgeous smart and understanding shes easygoing and helps Kirks mother wash dishes. She also really knows her hockey. In other words shes a dream girl. Most of the other women in the movie fall into the overbearing or bitchy categories. This limited vision of women could not be more adolescent if it had been written by 14-year-olds.

The neatnik and the slob.Shes Out of My League a raunchy comedy with a surprisingly deep vein of sweetness mines - as the ballad goes - a tale as old as time song as old as rhyme. Not beauty and beast exactly but babe and dweeb. Its a disparity purveyed by movies as diverse as Knocked Up and The Hottie and the Nottie and the cheerfully vulgar (but with heart) League is somewhere between the two.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) a weedy Transportation Security Administration agent lately jilted by his girlfriend is burning in love hell. Will he ever meet a girl who can appreciate his gawky grace?When Kirk returns a cell phone to Molly (Alice Eve) a stunning blonde who accidentally left it in a screening tray he is like a hungry man looking at a feast that is off-limits. The self-described average Joe thinks that just to breathe the aroma of a smoking-hot goddess is all he deserves.Then when Molly gives him a ticket to a Pittsburgh Penguins game Kirk cant get his head around the possibility that Molly invited him as her date. When this is explained to the self-deprecating Kirk he starts worrying about the disparity in their looks and their jobs.Kirk reckons himself a 5 and Molly a ""hard 10."" Why he wonders would this voluptuous party planner for the Pittsburgh elite (with a law degree besides) be interested in an innocuous airport employee who resembles a human exclamation point?The answer provided by the script from Sean Anders and John Morris (who wrote the better-than-average Sex Drive) is that Kirk is honorable and funny qualities Molly hasnt often encountered in men. Still Kirk is vulnerable to razzing by friends and family about why someone like Molly would like someone like him.Directed by Jim Field Smith with obvious attention to the performers and total indifference to visual storytelling League is a diverting showcase for Baruchel and Eve who are excellent arguments for the proposition that theres more to a person than looks.With his corrugated forehead and quizzical air Baruchel (a familiar face from Knocked Up and Tropic Thunder) is endearingly funny. Like Cameron Diaz in Theres Something About Mary Eve (the Australian bombshell from Crossing Over) deftly refocuses attention from her centerfold assets to her characters bighearted warmth.Likewise memorable are Nate Torrence as Devon Kirks hopeless-romantic friend who takes the lyrics to the songs in Disney animated musicals as gospel and Krysten Ritter as Mollys sweet n sour best friend.Unfortunately the filmmakers reach for moves from the Judd Apatow playbook including the requisite sexual-humiliation scene and the superfluous male-grooming moment. The latter involves ""manscaping"" that is shaving the privates. Fortunately the actors are so likable that these wincingly unfunny moments dont spoil the party.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402.

Kirk (Jay Baruchel) plays a nerdy TSA agent who attracts the interest of the beautiful Molly (Alice Eve).

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Nerds have been getting the girl for decades. Theres always a moment of indecision -- ""Is she really going to pick the strong jaw fabulous tan and Lacoste pastels over the scrawny kid with weird friends? Of course not silly. Havent you been watching? The days of Burt Reynolds and David Hasselhoff are behind us. Skinny boys with pocket-protectors and a penchant for Peter Gabriel have inherited their throne.""Shes Out of My League directed by Jim Field Smith is cut from the same carbon copy. Jay Baruchel (Judd Apatow darling ""Undeclared and ""Knocked Up) plays Kirk a painfully average guy with a gaggle of kooky pals. Hes at the bottom of the totem pole the butt of every joke even among his loser entourage and misfit family. He is a TSA agent at the Pittsburgh airport and drives a Neon. He has a physique ripped from a World Vision International infomercial.Cue beautiful girl cast solely because of her head-shot photos. Alice Eve plays Christie Brinkley look-alike Molly. Not only is she gorgeous rich and smart (how many lawyer/ party planners do you know?) she also just happens to be into the sort of guys who hang out in comic book shops looking for nipple slips in out-of-print issues of ""Nights of Horror. If ""Confederacy of Dunces was retooled as a modern bromance comedy Ignatius J. Reilly would be dating Megan Fox.Even though this is all as tired as the Fray songs littering the soundtrack theres something irresistible about ""Shes Out of My League. Mostly its what saves all of these movies -- the pithy poppy unrealistically quick dialogue between Kirk and his friends. Its the only thing that catches you even remotely by surprise.Kirks buds are stereotypes by now; the uncharacteristically attractive one usually faking or masking an Australian accent (in this instance former fashion model Mike Vogel) the jerk (played by Jon Heder doppelganger T.J. Miller) and the geek of the geeks (Nate Torrence). They are flavor notes in an otherwise bland meal.While Baruchel is fun to root for and watch flail about like a pipe-cleaner in the wind this movie encourages a sick desire in me -- to see Michael Cera and all the runners-up in the Mr. Puniverse Contest knocked down a peg by a bully with a neck the size of a tree trunk.

"Shes out of My League | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; she-s-out-of-my-league ) Shes out of My League (United States 2010) March 12 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are a variety of ways one can evaluate the effectiveness of standard-order romantic comedies. Mine is to ask three questions (1) Do I like the characters? (2) Do I sense chemistry between them? (3) Am I rooting for them to be together at the end? If the answer is ""yes"" across-the-board its an easy enough call to recommend the movie to fans of the genre. Thats the case with Shes out of My League. Theres nothing special about the movie except that it does what it sets out to do. It is disposable entertainment but I didnt regret giving up two hours of my life and 8.50 to see it. That may sound a little like damning with faint praise but so few romantic comedies achieve even that moderate level of competence that it should be considered an endorsement. Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a ""5"" on the scale of attractiveness. His buddies Stainer (T.J. Miller) Jack (Mike Vogel) and Devon (Nate Torrence) agree on this and make sure he knows it. Kirk is a nice guy with a self-deprecating sense of humor and a quiet sense of confidence but hes not any womans idea of Prince Charming. So its with befuddlement that his friends watch as Kirk becomes involved with Molly (Alice Eve) a certified ""10."" (Bo Derek eat your heart out.) Molly it seems sees beneath Kirks average exterior and identifies something exceptional inside him much to the shock of her best friend Patty (Krysten Ritter). With the laws of physical attractiveness which state that couples separated by more than ""2"" on the numerical scale cannot succeed aligned against them do Kirk and Molly have a chance? Will it be considered a spoiler if I answer that question? Shes out of My League features examples of unfunny sophomoric humor of the sort that few R-rated romantic comedies can escape. There are numerous missteps but Ill mention a few. One involves shaving pubic hair another focuses on stained trousers and a third features fractious family interaction at a family dinner. Fortunately the obligatory romantic complications (which ivariably involve old girlfriends and/or boyfriends) are treated as throw-away sidelights and are given about as much screen time as they deserve. Director Jim Field Smith a Brit making his Hollywood feature debut is more concerned with the mechanisms that sustain a relationship between a physically attractive woman and an average guy. He uses allusions to Disney cartoons such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast to drive home his point. The attraction between Kirk and Molly transcends physical appearance - our ability to ""get"" that means Smith has done his job. Jay Baruchel who typically gets saddled with the nerd/loser role is provided with the opportunity to blossom a little as Kirk. Hes still geeky but theres something charismatic about him and he doesnt seem as bumbling as say Jason Biggs who played the same kinds of parts a decade ago. Alice Eve showing considerably less skin than she did in Crossing Over (in which she played the Aussie immigrant who slept with Ray Liottas character) is sprightly and attractive. Strangely however in her scenes with Krysten Ritter who plays her sidekick she is frequently overshadowed. Thats a good thing for Ritter but not necessarily for the movie since it argues that perhaps Ritters character should have had a larger part. At any rate Baruchel and Eve make a nice couple and none of the satellite characters are annoying beyond being bearable. The humor gets raunchy enough to earn the ""R"" rating but in some ways its pretty tame especially in the wake of The Hangover. In fact its sex farce elements are on a comparable level with the hair gel scene in Theres Something about Mary. That was daring in the 90s but seems low-key by todays standards. Shes out of My League offers a few chuckles but comedy isnt its strong suit. This movie is intended to be enjoyed for its breezy unforced pairing of two mismatched lovers. Thats what its about and thats where it works. In keeping with the films numerology obsession Ill say this its neither a ""5"" nor a ""10"" but somewhere in between.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its been nine years since Jay Baruchel played an adorably gawky college freshman on Judd Apatows late lamented TV show Undeclared but his appealing quality of eternal adolescence hasnt eroded with age. His ability to project sheepish innocence serves him well in Shes Out Of My League which essentially casts him as a younger variation on Steve Carells overgrown naif in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. The comparison does the rest of this third-rate comedy no favors. Though Baruchel does his best to ground the film in some vague semblance of identifiable reality hes surrounded on all sides by human cartoons each pushing bad advice or roping him into the next grotesque comic setpiece. Its as if the filmmakers learned all the wrong lessons from Apatows films and applied them to a Theres Something About Mary clone circa 2001. Much like Carell in The 40-Year-Old Virgin Baruchels character has settled comfortably and somewhat happily into a sexless life of exceedingly modest ambition; only the people around him think hes a freak. While logging time with his obnoxious buddies (Nate Torrence T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel) as a TSA officer at a Pittsburgh airport Baruchel has a pleasant encounter with Alice Eve a conventionally pretty blonde party planner. When Eve takes a romantic interest in him Baruchel lacks the confidence to even realize it until halfway through the first date and his friends and family dont help either constantly reminding him that... well... its right there in the title isnt it? Facile though it is Shes Out Of My League builds to the agreeable message that a persons feeling of self-worth helps bridge the gap between a five on the attractiveness scale and a perfect 10 but it takes some grim comic business to get there. Baruchel has always thrown himself into embarrassing situations but even he cant be expected to survive the agonizing scene involving premature ejaculation a dog and his girlfriends parents or another where hes convinced against his better judgment to shave his pubes. Baruchel and Eve never shed that awkward first-date chemistry which speaks less to their talents or the possibilities of mismatched romance than to a movie that forces them together like animals being mated in captivity.

Leon Wieseltier hates him. Alan Dershowitz called him an anti-Semite and applied successful pressure to deny him tenure at DePaul University. All of this will give you a rough idea of where political scientist Norman Finkelstein stands on the political spectrum though ""American radical"" may be a misnomer for an intellectual whose life has been forcefully shaped by a mother whose concentration-camp experience turned her into a fiery booster for every available underdog. Directors David Ridgen and Nicolas Rossier mean to redress calumnies heaped on Finkelstein author of the book The Holocaust Industry which accuses Israel (whose existence he supports) and its Diaspora Jewish supporters of playing the Holocaust-victim card in order to divert attention from the oppression of Palestinians. Finkelstein is partly right but American Radical shows -- albeit with great reluctance -- how a formidable intellect partnered with an absolutist disposition can get you absolutely nowhere. With the eyes of a suffering fanatic Finkelstein calls Jewish preoccupation with the Holocaust ""an extortion racket"" and announces to a delighted audience of Arab students that ""it was a good thing Hezbollah delivered a huge defeat to Israel"" in 2006. It never seems to occur to this born martyr that his overkill might lose him the support of Israeli peaceniks like Yoav Shamir whose 2009 documentary Defamation shows sympathy for Finkelstein until Shamir catches him on camera summing up Anti-Defamation League leader Abraham Foxman with a Nazi salute. (Ella Taylor) (Music Hall) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  THE ART OF THE STEAL Matisse called the Barnes Foundation ""the only sane place to see art in America."" But the clamor over moving one of the worlds foremost collections of impressionist postimpressionist and modern art from its small intimate home in the bucolic suburb of Merion Pennsylvania to center city Philadelphia (4.6 miles away) has been anything but reasonable. Unapologetically on the side of those who oppose the relocation (executive producer Lenny Feinberg is like many of the docs impassioned interlocutors a former student of the Barnes Foundation) The Art of the Steal presents its aesthetes versus Phila-stines argument cogently and engagingly. Director-cinematographer Don Argott digs deep to recount the struggle for control of this legendary institution founded by cranky liberal physician Albert C. Barnes in 1922 solely for educational purposes. The film makes clear that arguments about the foundations inaccessibility in Merion are disingenuous at best -- that moving the collection to the city represents the triumph of money and power not just over the express wishes of one man but the publics opportunity to have a singular experience with an astonishing array of art in its original setting. The Art of the Steals thorough research makes it one of the most successful advocacy docs in recent years and may prompt some firsthand investigating of your own. (Melissa Anderson) (The Landmark Sunset 5 Town Center Playhouse 7)GO  CHILDREN OF INVENTION The young director Tze Chun is not a flashy filmmaker but he understands the vulnerability of immigrant workers in the sleazy sub-rosa economies of a floundering 21st-century America. Tze has lived that life and observes it with acuity in this straightforward tale of Raymond and Tina (played by the enchantingly solemn Michael Chen and Crystal Chiu) two Asian children trying to look after themselves while their single mother (Cindy Cheung) becomes embroiled in an illegal Boston pyramid scheme that leaves the undocumented family equally exposed to exploitation by some who mean well -- and others who dont. Children of Invention was edited (on her living-room floor) by Anna Boden co-director with Ryan Fleck of Half Nelson and Sugar and Tzes movie is infused with the same quality of (mostly) unsentimental mercy and the same sensitivity to the way in which being placed at risk without basic rights invariably breeds more and more risk. In the childrens creative response to their apparent abandonment we see -- only a little wistfully -- the capacity of kids to fashion a viable world out of the materials available as well as a rueful homage to American dreams both wonderful and warped. As a bonus theres no spurious uplift. (Ella Taylor) (Downtown Independent)GO  GREEN ZONE Better late than never -- a bang-bang pulse-pounder predicated on the Bush administrations deliberate fabrication of WMDs in Iraq. Paul Greengrass expertly assembled Green Zone has evidently been parked for some time on Universals shelf. Had the movie been released during the 2008 election season it might have been something more than entertainment. Easily grasped as an amalgam of Greengrass artfully verite docudramas Bloody Sunday and United 93 and his Bourne thrillers Green Zone is set in the early months of the Iraq War and seen through the eyes of Matt Damons chief warrant officer parachuted in to find Saddams hidden weapons of mass destruction. After three successive sites yield nothing but mobs of looters and calcified pigeon shit Damon is pissed; whats more he has the guts to stand up at a mass briefing and complain. Boldly asking for the intel source hes slapped down by the brass brushed off by his C.O. and told by a Pentagon smoothie (Greg Kinnear) that ""democracy is messy."" Then following a tip by a friendly Iraqi (Khalid Abdalla) Damon begins to get the picture and sense the fix. Damons two-fisted patriotic megarogue Boy Scout cum investigative soldier is a far less likely figure than the thrill-crazy hero of The Hurt Locker -- grabbing Kinnear by his collar and hissing ""Do you have any idea what youve done here?"" That kiss-off is a bonanza of false consolation that transports the movie into the fantasy zone of Inglourious Basterds. (J.

Opening as tumultuous slapstick this tale of a 27-year-old village idiot Do-joon (Won Bin) and the local madwoman who is his single parent Hye-ja (Kim Hye-ja) quickly darkens once someone bludgeons a schoolgirl. Do-joon is accused of her murder and easily confused into signing a confession. With the simpleton packed off to prison Hye-jas hyperaroused maternal instincts drive the movie. She campaigns for her childs release and attempts to pin the murder on Do-joons only friend. Pushing Mother into a realm beyond routine policier is the giddy realization that there may be no lengths to which Hye-ja wont go to establish Do-joons innocence -- and that although he might indeed be innocent the mother-son dyad is founded on its own guilty secrets. The two share a bed and Hye-ja shows a marked interest in her sons virility. While in jail Do-joon has time to think about the past and rather than provide the evidence Hye-ja hopes for he confronts her with a recovered memory that allows the movie to pivot into psychological (or perhaps just Psycho) drama. It would hardly be surprising if Hollywood attempted a remake -- although it will be a rare studio movie with the nerve to re-create Mothers final reel an ending that leaves its protagonist stranded in a moral netherworld applying her acupuncture needle to the spot that ""unknots the heart."" (J. Hoberman) (Landmark Playhouse 7 Sunset 5)MYSTERY TEAM Just because youre a hit on YouTube doesnt mean you should be making movies. Case in point the three likable NYU grads who perform Internet sketches as Derrick Comedy. Two or three minutes is fine but 105 minutes is excruciating. Riffing on the Hardy Boys and Encyclopedia Brown the trio of Donald Glover D.C. Pierson and Dominic Dierkes plays overgrown boy detectives now shunned by their high school classmates. For good reason The three uberdorky 18-year-old virgins are oblivious to girls (""Yuck"") an embarrassment to their parents and weak on their powers of deduction. A rash of murders breaking out at the lumber mill provides them with the opportunity to visit a strip club score some coke and drink dog urine (dont ask) all of which is even less funny than it sounds. The forced Napoleon Dynamite naivete was already tired by that movies 90th minute and Mystery Team feels more than six years past its sell-by date. A late-film appearance by the always-reliable Matt Walsh (The Hangover Upright Citizens Brigade) confirms the movies core problem Its more fun to watch adults knowingly misbehave than innocents unwittingly bungle. (Brian Miller) (Nuart)OUR FAMILY WEDDING An unconvincingly broad culture-clash comedy whose Latino and African-American ensemble mightve made for a progressive film if director and co-writer Rick Famuyiwa (Brown Sugar) hadnt pandered to the lowest common denominator with brainless screwball laughs this sitcom-grade competition of paterfamilial egos is essentially Meet Los Fockers or My Big Fat Black Wedding. Afraid to tell their folks about their new engagement law-school dropout Lucia (America Ferrera) and her bland do-gooder beau Marcus (Lance Gross) drop the bomb while out to dinner fueling an alpha-male rivalry between their respectively out-of-touch dads -- married working-class clown Miguel (Carlos Mencia) and womanizing radio personality Brad (Forest Whitaker). ""Ill be right black"" mocks Lucias pop setting the tone for more casually racist sniping and pathetic displays of one-upmanship as wedding compromises are made to accommodate both Miguels traditional views and Brads more unorthodox ways. A few of the sentimental scenes especially between Brad and the best friend he should settle down with (Regina King) hint at the sweet movie hiding within but then hes nearly raped by a goat hopped up on Viagra. (Aaron Hillis) (Citywide)THE CRY OF THE OWL The grass isnt always greener on the other side which the sad-sack hero of The Cry of the Owl learns to his horror in writer-director Jamie Thraves promising but ultimately frustrating adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths suspense novel. Robert (Paddy Considine) walks through his days shell-shocked unable to accept the fact that his wife is divorcing him. His miserable lifes only ray of light comes from the illuminated kitchen window he stares into every night after work -- behind it lies a young woman (Julia Stiles) whose happy domesticity Robert tries to absorb from afar. But when she spots him one evening she doesnt recoil instead introducing herself as Jenny and instantly exhibiting a weird almost unhealthy affinity for him. What follows is at first quite enjoyably odd Thraves keeps the audience off-balance as we observe these two peoples unlikely burgeoning friendship and Jennys unexplained abandonment of her longtime boyfriend to spend more time with Robert. Unfortunately The Cry of the Owl starts to unravel once a murder occurs and Robert is fingered for the crime. Considine proves quite adept at playing the patsy but Stiles overdoes Jennys emotional fragility to such a degree that her growing craziness seems to affect the films storytelling which becomes increasingly nonsensical and melodramatic as the twists and revelations fly. All of this is almost redeemed by a nicely ironic final shot that belatedly reestablishes this thrillers priorities forlorn characters over red herrings. (Tim Grierson) (Music Hall) REMEMBER ME Putatively a new romance starring Robert Pattinson Remember Me begins like a vigilante movie A Brooklyn subway platform 1991; a racially charged stickup; an 11-year-old girl watches her mother be shot. Its the first sign that here is a film that wont be content to just chart the little measures by which two people become able to love -- in fact itll barely do that at all. Flash-forward 10 years to the halcyon days of the Strokes and whatever other significant events happened in NYC circa 2001. Pattinson is histrionically depressed Tyler Keats Hawkins a coasting scruffy NYU student coming up on his 22nd birthday. Meanwhile that little girl on the subway platform has grown up to be not Batman but fellow NYUer Ally (Emilie de Ravin) whose still-bereaved overprotective cop dad (Chris Cooper) busts Tyler one night. Some coincidences later Tyler will pick up Ally on a revenge dare ensuring an eventual variation on the ever-popular teen-movie ""Was I a bet?"" breakup. Theres an insult-to-injury quality to a plain bad movie with a ""seize the day"" message (Remember Mes tagline ""Live in the Moments"") which heckles you with all the other things you should or could be doing while youre marking time waiting on the credits wondering if the movie will ever end. Well it does -- oh mama does it ever with a crazy long bomb heave toward epochal significance. (Far be it from me to spoil the surprise; lets just say Robert Pattinson dies in 9/11.) (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide)SHES OUT OF MY LEAGUE This isnt entirely without its selling points chief among them T.J. Miller whos a cross between Seth Rogen and Jason Segel -- paging Judd Apatow now. Miller plays Stainer a mop-topped giant and best bud to Kirk (Jay Baruchel an Apatow player from way back) a TSA lackey and a ""hard five"" who catches the eye of Molly (Alice Eve) a lawyer turned party planner whos a ""hard 10"" and natch out of Kirks league. Molly burned by her hunky flyboy ex wants safe and sweet. Stainer burned by his own former flame is aghast at the coupling; short on self-esteem himself he insists itll never work and it doesnt for long stretches precisely because Kirk buys Stainers sincere rap -- he doesnt want his boy hurt. Stainers the real goofy damaged soul of this slight comedy directed by Jim Field Smith who tries with modest success to blend the sticky-sweet with the plain ol sticky (the first time Molly grinds on Kirk hes a bit early on the draw -- and look here comes the dog to lick his pants). Baruchels bit is the same one hes been perfecting since he enrolled in Undeclared -- puppy-dog pouty and cute and clever and good God hes this close to turning into Michael Cera. Millers the find. Hes out of this movies league. (Robert Wilonsky) (Citywide)TOE TO TOE Spreading social awareness is a valuable pursuit naturally but when filmmakers take it upon themselves to don the cape of an activist hero while constantly reminding audiences of their nobility the message feels cheap. Anthropology-minded writer and director Emily Abt unintentionally exuded that attitude in All of Us (her heartfelt but po-faced feminist doc about African-American women with HIV) and while her first narrative feature shows improvement it still straddles the line between progressive exploration and self-congratulatory melodrama. On the lacrosse fields of a D.C. prep school the rich white troubled and therefore slutty Jesse (Louisa Krause) befriends partly out of novelty Tosha (Sonequa Martin) a determined black girl on full scholarship who wants to escape her inner-city neighborhood. The camaraderie quickly sours -- or at least develops love-hate complications and believable class and racial tensions -- when a handsome Muslim horndog (Raising Victor Vargas Silvestre Rasuk) comes between them. The performances are top-notch and occasionally moving but Abt nearly smothers it all with some embarrassing coming-of-age teen-angst false notes plus cliched Ivy League ambitions a cartoonishly neglectful mother STDs unfair expulsion martyrdom for both the rich and the poor and a nonreciprocal lesbian crush. Adolescence sure gets harder every year. (Aaron Hillis) (Sunset 5) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

MillerParamount Pictures Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr THE ODD COUPLE Alice Eve dates Jay Baruchel in Shes Out of My League (Darren Michaels) C Shes Out of My League Starring Jay Baruchel Alice Eve; Starring T.J. Miller; Director Jim Field Smith; Author Sean Anders John Morris; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted March 10 2010 -- 1200 AM EST If youre hungry to see a romantic comedy about a genetically and culturally imbalanced geek-meets-babe relationship that makes the one in Knocked Up look like the quintessence of plausible human mating then by all means subject yourself to the one-joke sub?Judd Apatow snark-athon that is Shes Out of My League. Kirk (Jay Baruchel) a boyish awkward dork has a nervous fumbling manner a chest as flat as an ironing board and a voice thats a honking sniveling irritant; ? hes like the son of Gilbert Gottfried crossed with a depressed snail. Molly (Alice Eve) whos gorgeous pert shapely intelligent and free of any nasty or judgmental thoughts is like Ann-Margret playing a very liberal nun. She is in other words the films adolescent fantasy of what a ""perfect"" girl should be. Taken as a purely sexual object (which the movie keeps pretending shes not) Alice certainly is out of Kirks league. Yet when they start to date their disjunction in looks isnt whats so far-fetched. Its that hes a socially inept underachiever who works in airport security and shes a high-end event planner who oozes poise and would never be drawn to such a gawky shambling loser. Love may well conquer class divisions but not when theres absolutely nothing in it for the half of the couple whos dating down. Shes Out of My League is eager to be a latter-day Woody Allen/Revenge of the Nerds fairy tale of hormonal wish fulfillment in which a ""funny"" guy with quick-witted neurotic charm triumphs over the fact that he doesnt look like a stud-muffin. The trouble is no one remembered to make Kirk charming Jay Baruchel just plays him as a stammering arrested-development case and glutton for punishment. There are moments when his misery yields some comedy I laughed out loud at Kirks tortured explanation to Molly about why he couldnt stand up to shake her fathers hand. (Imagine an untimely-boner joke only twice as embarrassing.) And at least Kirks Apatow-lite circle of jerky friends (led by T.J. Miller as an entertainingly blunt horndog) offer the movie a few trash-talking breaks. When they really got going I forgot that Kirk was even there.

By comparison - by anyones measure really - Molly (Alice Eve) is a ""hard 10"" a blond knockout with a law degree a thriving event-planning business a fantastic personality and a body that would turn heads at a funeral. One of the running jokes in the film is how Molly remains unaffected by the men who constantly stare and drool and lose their train of thought around her. Shes learned to enjoy the discombobulating effect her beauty has on the opposite sex but she hasnt let it go to her head. The central joke in Shes Out of My League which marks the debut of director Jim Field Smith and was written by the team of Sean Anders and John Morris (Sex Drive the upcoming Hot Tub Time Machine) is that Molly doesnt take an interest in Kirk out of pity or curiosity She actually falls for him and that completely freaks him out. Being in her presence brings out every neurosis and apprehension and soon Kirk is leaning on his friends to help with grooming and an ""early bird"" sexual problem. Mollys just so hot Kirk cant relax and savor his situation. Shes Out of My League essentially plays its central premise straight although the film does find time to veer into gross-out humor (such as the grooming business; some things a man should do without help). There is also the occasional extended setpiece such as Mollys dinner at the home of Kirks demented family in which the movie kicks back and lets the ensemble cast play. As Molly proves shes more than a match for Kirks boorish brother and relatives the humor takes on vaguely surreal dimensions and the jokes fly from all directions. Baruchel and Eve make a likable (if unlikely) couple and the movie doesnt resort to throwing cheap obstacles in their way such as Eves fighter-pilot ex-boyfriend who never becomes Kirks romantic rival in the way you expect. Instead Shes Out of My League tries to imagine what really would happen if a guy this dorky and a girl this beautiful fell in love. The picture has a vague assembly-line airand Smiths attempt to build a Judd Apatow-ish stable of best buds and bros to serve as a Greek chorus for Kirks dilemma is only somewhat successful. But the movie is convincing enough to give every Kirk in the world a semblance of hope. Every once in a while love really is blind. Shes Out of My League (1/2 out of ) opens in South Florida on Friday March 12. Posted by Rene Rodriguez at 0132 PM in Film Reviews | Permalink The Miami Herald Copyright 2010 The Miami Herald.

Shes Out of My League Fair to good Director Jim Field Smith. Cast Jay Baruchel Alice Eve T.J. Miller. Rating R for language and sexual content. RELATED Bottom line League star says no to no-pants day R-rated comedies For instance if you have designs on an absolute babe a perfect 10 you have to be at least an 8 to have any hope with her. You cant jump more than two spots or shes out of your hotness league and the relationship is doomed to fail no matter what. Thats the theory espoused by some of the dim-bulb characters in ""Shes Out of My League"" a sweeter-than-youd-expect sex comedy that finds Kirk (Jay Baruchel) - a mere 5 - dating Molly (Alice Eve) a ""hard 10"" according to Kirks friends (the previously referenced dim bulbs). Until this unlikely pairing Kirk has had a rough go of life. He pines for ex-girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane) who has moved on. He cant exactly forget her though; his parents like her so much that she still comes over to their house with her new boyfriend to visit. Kirk wants to be a pilot but he works as a Transportation Security Administration agent at the Pittsburgh airport seemingly the only employee with any common sense in the entire outfit. (Frequent flyers insert jokes here.) The rest of his pals ogle Molly who ditched a legal career to become a party planner when she goes through security. Kirk doesnt however and when she leaves her phone behind he retrieves it leading to an invitation to a party and eventually a date. To the surprise of his friend Stainer (T.J. Miller) and her friend Patty (Krysten Ritter) Molly really seems to like Kirk despite the disparity on the hotness scale. Things are looking up. But among Kirks friends Stainer and Jack (Mike Vogel) insist that no matter how well things are going (and theyre going quite well; Molly even thrives during a Sunday-afternoon visit with Kirks cretinous family) theres zero chance here. Only the married Devon (Nate Torrence) sees a rosy future but when a guy constantly references Disney princess movies and characters you wonder how grounded in reality he is. There arent a lot of surprises in the story so its dependent upon the characters to carry the film. Torrence is sweet and funny making Devon a good-enough friend that hes even willing to help Kirk with some intensely personal grooming if it will help his chances with Molly. Ritter is nicely acerbic as Patty and Sloane is an absolute loon as the deranged Marnie (thats a compliment by the way). But the relationship between Kirk and Molly is key obviously and Baruchel and Eve make it work. Eves Molly is more than the typical blond babe. We actually see that she cares about her family why she might fall for Kirk why she might have her own doubts. And Baruchel who starred in ""Undeclared"" and has appeared in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" is a charmingly offbeat presence. Far from the typical leading man his quirky personality makes you root for the guy even if you want to yank his hair out at times when he seems intent on sabotaging the relationship. Theres plenty of gross-out humor and lots of sex jokes some of them absurd some really funny. But what elevates ""Shes Out of My League"" - it doesnt turn a 5 into a 10 but it helps - is heart of which its characters have a surprising plenty.

Crushing its one germ of a good idea under a heap of teen-comedy conventions ""Shes Out of My League"" supposes that if a quasi-normal guy actually won the girl of his dreams his own insecurities would scuttle the deal. One can imagine Jack Nicholson strolling into helmer Jim Field Smiths erratic story and bellowing ""You cant handle the babe"" as this appealingly cast movie seesaws from unlikely thoughtfulness to imbecilic vulgarity. Teen auds will respond in force especially those among the semen-joke constituency. In a salute to harried air travelers everywhere the chuckleheads of ""Shes Out of My League"" -- notably Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel) -- all work for TSA aka airport security where they have no problem stalling stopping and stammering at a passenger like the breathtaking Molly (Alice Eve) and gaping at her with undisguised lust. The one guy with a sense of decency is Kirk who gets her through the gauntlet of goons returns her cell phone when she leaves it behind and wins a date in the process. Molly it seems is coming out of a bad relationship and dating a doofus seems like the safe thing to do. Kirk has his own troubled romantic history The opening scene finds him practicing a make-up speech to his ex Marnie (a delightfully loathsome Lindsay Sloane) who since their breakup has maintained her relationship with his parents to the point that she hangs out at their house with her new boyfriend. This puts Kirk on an almost unparalleled plane of pathetic loserdom from which its going to be very hard to recover. Fortunately for Kirk helmer Smith feels no obligation to ensure that circumstances or characters make sense or to avoid reverting to formula. Mollys best friend and party-planning partner Patty (a terrific Krysten Ritter in a badly written part) resists the new match. Kirks friends -- notably Stainer (T.J. Miller) and Jack (Mike Vogel) -- argue that on the cosmic scale of sexual attractiveness Molly is a ""hard 10"" and Kirk is barely a five and ""you cant jump more than two points."" Kirks other pal Devon (the wonderfully squishy Nate Torrence) argues on behalf of love but Devon also bases all his romantic presumptions on animated Disney movies (""Shes Princess Jasmine"" he gasps about one girl). The promise of love as unlikely as it is to begin with in the schematic of the romantic comedy is under constant assault by the people who should be encouraging it. Its almost an interesting angle. Something similar might be said about the quandary faced by Kirk More of a goofball-by-association than a bona-fide dipstick he worries himself out of contention. Here he has a woman who actually comes to his house and visits his family (of whom ""baboons"" would be a complimentary description) and even agrees to accompany them all to Branson Mo. which some might equate with the third circle of hell. But Kirk cant help expecting that hes going to romantically crash and burn and he does -- though he puts it off long enough to get some conflict going and allow some embarrassing disgusting sequences to transpire. Baruchel a member of the ""Knocked Up""/""Tropic Thunder"" repertory company is a charmer his Kirk a self-effacing modest socially high-functioning guy of limited charisma but sweet disposition. And though she might have gotten away with being just a pretty face Eve brings a genuineness to Molly thats refreshing especially in a genre that usually treats young women like chuck roast. You can see them together; its not so hard. What you cant quite believe is that they would have anything to do with anyone else in this movie which dances on the edge of good taste without ever actually falling in. Production values are adequate save for the music cues which seem intended to inflict cerebral hemorrhage.
