Comments Lilo amp; Stitch Smart poignant and utterly beguiling this hand-drawn Disney animation celebrates family while appealing to the hell-raising child in all of us. Stitch a wicked creature condemned to die escapes from his faraway planet and lands in a Hawaiian village where hes adopted as a pet by Lilo a mischievous orphan. Together they run amok pursued by Lilos exasperated older sister and by a pair of bumbling aliens sent to earth to capture the fugitive. Directors Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (who also wrote the script and supplies the voice of Stitch) combine elements of Frankenstein Home Alone and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in this story of a lonely child and her extraterrestrial friend yearning for a nuclear family. The characters are well drawn (in both senses of the term) and the animation superb using vivid watercolors to convey lush tropical backgrounds. The climax an aerial chase straight out of Star Wars seems to go on forever but it fails to restrain the films buoyant spirit. Featuring the voices of Tia Carrere Jason Scott Lee and Ving Rhames (2002). 85 min.

By Richard Corliss Sunday June 16 2002 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME A little girl and a teddy-bear-size monster face two big challenges. One is for the girl (Lilo) to tame her angry new pet from outer space (Stitch) while persuading a social worker to let her stay with her big sister. The other is that the Disney movie they are in Lilo amp; Stitch must make a bundle -- or Hollywood could hear a death knell for the traditional animated feature. Disneys beleaguered boss Michael Eisner has to hope there is still profit in the hand-drawn cartoons that made Disneys name and fortune but have faded as computer-generated (CG) films have flourished. Animators draw figures; movie execs read them. So consider these numbers just from Disney product. The studios four CG features (Toy Story A Bugs Life Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc.) produced by John Lasseter and his cyber-Merlins at Pixar earned an average of 214 million; the last two averaged 250 million. As for Disneys once mighty traditional animated films the last four (Mulan Tarzan The Emperors New Groove and Atlantis The Lost Empire) grossed on average just 116 million and the last two didnt make it to 90 million. Pixar films were originally meant to supplement Disneys basic animation menu; instead they have supplanted it. The story is the same at DreamWorks. The CG Shrek scared up 267 million while the traditional Road to El Dorado cadged a paltry 51 million.

Its a bright engaging bauble with half a dozen Elvis Presley songs for Mom and Dad and just enough sass -- Stitch sticks his tongue into his nose and eats his snot -- to keep the tweeners giggling. Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase) gives the usual lonely-but-superior Disney heroine a twist she is a brat who has anger issues. And far from trying to save China or morph from mermaid to human this Hawaiian handful has no goal loftier than the status quo -- to keep living with her frazzled sister Nani (Tia Carrere). Enter Stitch a killing machine from the planet Turo. An unholy mix of E.T. and the Zuni fetish doll that scared the wits out of Karen Black in the never-to-be-forgotten TV movie Trilogy of Terror Stitch was created by a mad scientist -- or as he prefers to be known an ""evil genius""--who gave the creature only one instinct ""to destroy everything it touches."" Stitch escapes to Earth a primitive planet that the Turans have allowed to exist as a ""protected wildlife preserve to repopulate the mosquito."" Stitch wanders into a dog pound and is adopted by the desperately needy Lilo; she figures ""he used to be a collie before he got ran over."" Will Lilo herself something of a little monster be able to turn this space Satan into a nicely domesticated Hawaiian -- a ukul-alien? Its Disney Darwinism survival of the cutest. Writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois give the film a lush pastel look and rounded black-eyed characters closer to Smurfs than to the keenly defined types of most Disney cartoons. They also borrow roughly from Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki who in My Neighbor Totoro and Kikis Delivery Service plopped adorable kids into magical situations. (In tribute the film has Nani open a business called Kikis Coffee House.) But after a lag in the early sister scenes Lilo reveals its own very American verve and wit along with a smart story sense that marks the best animated features traditional or computerized. When Stitch makes his appearance in a Vegas-Elvis silver sequined outfit the plexes should erupt in delighted laughter. Traditional animation has already seen a tentative revival with DreamWorks Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron. Lilo amp; Stitch is lighter bouncier loads more fun. So lets predict that this new Disney film will be an old-fashioned hand-drawn hit. If traditional animators are not to be the modern equivalents of monks creating illuminated manuscripts -- craftsmen in a world whose technology made their skills anachronistic -- it had better be.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) less LILO amp; STITCH - Photo 172 A Hawaiian girl named Lilo discovers that Stitch can do a stupid pet trick when he uses his nail to play a phonograph record and the sound comes out of his mouth in this scene ... more Photo HANDOUT A girl and her mad dog / Animated Lilo could have been great short 1 / 1 Back to Gallery LILO amp; STITCH Animation. Starring the voices of Daveigh Chase Chris Sanders and Tia Carrere. Directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois. (PG. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" is the kind of movie that cries out for the return of the short. Heres a tiresome feature that could be made into a wonderful 20-minute film -- or with a few adjustments into two or three 10-minute shorts. ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" could be the basis of a whole series of 10-minute cartoons and probably not exhaust itself for years. Instead the movies welcome is exhausted long before its 85-minute running time is up. On the plus side ""Lilo"" has a couple of things that cartoons need. It has a vivid heroine in Lilo an 11-year-old whose hostility makes her the class misfit. (""My friends need to be punished"" she says making voodoo dolls out of spoons.) And it has an attractive look. In setting the film in Hawaii the animators have adopted a pastel palette reminiscent of 19th century childrens books. But Stitch is a problem. Genetically concocted on a foreign planet bred to be tiny strong and destructive he is a spirit of mischief. Were supposed to regard him as an adorable little terror perhaps but as drawn hes homely -- six legs too many teeth. As for the terror part no sooner does he show his personality than does the movie begin its process of reforming him of teaching him the value of love and family. Thats whats wrong with making ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" into a feature film Everything good about it is in the setup. For example theres a social worker (the voice of Ving Rhames) who is thinking of taking Lilo away from her sister her only guardian. This makes for embarrassing moments with the social worker consistently showing up at inopportune times. But its not as if we want that plot element to go somewhere. If he takes Lilo away its terrible. If he becomes friends with the sisters its boring. Better ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" should be like a sitcom or a cartoon series in which the characters situation stays the same and only the adventures change. A perverse 11-year-old girl and her devoted mad dog from outer space -- that could easily be the foundation for a series of adventures. The pleasure would be in sharing those adventures not in watching their relationship evolve. Unfortunately writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois find themselves locked into the structure of a feature film. Theyre forced to tell the story of Lilo and Stitchs relationship to give it shape and a sense of arrival. Since this is a kids movie the relationship can only head in the direction of schmaltz. So the promising anarchy of the first 10 or 15 minutes is suppressed. On the way to stretching the movie to feature length the filmmakers introduce an inordinate number of characters including three agents who arrive on Earth at the behest of their leader to bring Stitch home. After a while it becomes hard to keep track of them all and anyway whats the point? In ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" the action may be frenetic but the resolution is never in question. Its just a matter of waiting around for it. . This movie contains mild cartoon violence.

"USATODAY.com - Stitch will keep you in stitches Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/20/2002 - Updated 1151 PM ET Stitch will keep you in stitches By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Lilo amp; Stitch (out of four) Voices Daveigh Chase Christopher Michael Sanders Tia Carrere David Ogden Stiers Kevin McDonald Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for mild sci-fi action Lilo amp; Stitch is a fresh departure from Disneys recent animated movies. The hand-drawn figures are rounder and simpler than the studios usual style and watercolor backgrounds are used for the first time since Bambi in 1942. The colors in this comedy are ultra-vibrant and rich appropriate to the Hawaiian setting. Best of all the movie has an endearingly cheeky attitude sometimes missing from more earnest Disney tales. Witty touching and well paced Lilo amp; Stitch is ideal family fare but little more. Lilo (pronounced LEE-lo) an adorable Hawaiian girl is a lonely child whose parents were killed in a car accident. She is being raised by her teenage sister Nani who is doing her level best but Dr. Spock might take issue with her parenting skills. Read more below Video View trailer of Lilo amp; Stitch Stories Dumbo and other fun stuff In fact a hard-nosed social worker (who looks like Shaq in shades). visits at an awkward moment and decides Lilo might be better off in a foster home. Nani is determined to hold on to Lilo and tries to cheer up her younger sibling by getting her a pet. At the dog pound Lilo meets Stitch whos really a mischievous alien on the run from his planets ruler. Stitch has crash-landed his space vehicle in Kauai and hidden in the animal shelter. He figures that if he pants barks and generally acts like a canine he might escape a pair of inept aliens hot on his trail. His bright-blue fur razor-sharp teeth and pink bat-like ears make it difficult for anyone to figure out what species he might be. Lilo doesnt care. She knows what its like to be left out for being different and she cant resist the odd-looking creature. A friendship is formed even though mayhem surrounds Stitch wherever he goes. Lilo is a stitch herself funny feisty and ever faithful to the principle of family (""ohana""). She teaches the wayward Stitch what love means and writer/directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois avoid sappiness. The soundtrack is mostly Elvis tunes and Stitch even does an adorable impersonation of the King. As Elvis might put it you cant help falling in love with Lilo amp; Stitch.

The moment however that he springs into action speaking in what sounds like angry samurai gibberish its clear that he has zero dimensions as a character. (He would have been stuck somewhere in the back of a closet in the ""Toy Story"" films.) Stitch gets discovered by Lilo a temperamental Hawaiian girl whos the whiniest of whiny brats. The animation in Lilo amp; Stitch has an engaging retro-simple vivacity and its nice to see a movie for tots make use of Elvis Presley but the story is witless and oddly defanged.

This agreeably modest picture cleverly dovetails the antics of a berserk little space alien with a sympathetic look at two young sisters striving for a sense of family in Hawaii. Spunky mildly irreverent and completely hand-drawn ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" represents a refreshing change of pace in Disneys recent animated output. The second entry after ""Mulan"" from the studios Florida feature animation division this agreeably modest picture cleverly dovetails the antics of a berserk little space alien with a sympathetic look at two young sisters striving for a sense of family in Hawaii. Given a distinctive feel by the lovely watercolor backgrounds and a half-dozen Elvis Presley tunes on the soundtrack pic has a casual freewheeling nature in contrast to the creeping grandiosity of some of Disneys A-list animated titles. Very nice business should sustain throughout the summer with ancillary longevity a given. During the 10-minute pre-credits sequence its hard to believe that one of the two title characters a little devil called Stitch is actually going to command centerscreen for the rest of the movie. A genetic experiment gone wrong the little critter from the distant planet of Turo is horridly obnoxious on top of being wantonly destructive. But hes clever enough to escape from the spaceship sending him into permanent exile and crash-land on Earth which is snootily considered by the alien race to be a wildlife preserve where due to repeated asteroid hits life forms repeatedly ""have to start all over again."" The blue big-eared beclawed and toothsome creature who eventually gets by as a dog but could also easily pass as one of the more fearsome Pokemon characters winds up in a sleepy Hawaiian seaside community where pre-teen Lilo is having some problems shed rather ignore. An outcast among the other girls at school the parentless Lilo lives with her older sister Nani who has come under investigation by the imposing social worker Bubbles for incompetent guardianship. The girls are constantly at each others throats and Nanis cluelessness about mothering is such that she is given three days by Bubbles to clean up her act or else. Lilos adoption of Stitch only exacerbates the situation at first since the indestructible beast was programmed to destroy everything in his sight. In short it takes him no time to contend for the title of biggest problem child on Earth although Lilo persists in seeing him as the answer to her prayer of finding a true and lasting friend. Pursued by the bumbling team of his Russian-accented inventor Jumba and an effete would-be Earth expert called Pleakley Stitch creates plenty of mayhem but also develops a soft spot via his intense identification with the fairy tale character of the Ugly Duckling making him feel that even he needs a family too. Quite neatly then the desires of a lonely Hawaiian girl and a hyperactive space gremlin come to coincide and flower in a patched-together family structure that suits everyones needs just fine; ""Its little and broken -- but still good"" affirms Lilo. Along the way theres some pleasant beachside musicalizing and a sharp surfing sequence featuring Nanis former b.f. David as well as the arrival of the Turo governing hierarchy intent upon taking Stitch back. But ""E.T."" expectations are happily reversed in the interest of family values however ad hoc and offbeat. Its possible that parents might have more trouble accepting the maniacal Stitch than will children who will likely absorb him as just another member of Monsters Inc. Character never softens much but he does become domesticated more or less just as he learns to speak English. Still he certainly ranks among the least overtly lovable protagonists ever to topline a Disney cartoon. Lilos innate optimism and hopefulness in the midst of utter domestic disarray make the girl a strongly sympathetic little leading lady while Nanis flaws are vividly realistic. Comic relief support is more than adequate. Making their writing and directing debut Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois who headed the story team on ""Mulan"" keep things moving briskly while commendably avoiding any special sentimental ""We Are a Village"" point-making despite the obvious opportunity. Character designs are familiar enough but backgrounds possess an unusual pastel quality that gives the film an inviting atmosphere all its own. Elvis songs deliver a kick as well as considerable humor given the incongruity of their integration with the action.
