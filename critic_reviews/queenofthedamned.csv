Comments Queen of the Damned In a pointed analogy the lead character in this movie is both a vampire and a rock star. Hes stalked by an occult researcher whos also a fan; her biggest rival for his affection is an older woman--a vampire queen whose reign of terror dates to ancient times. Regularly digressing from what becomes a perfunctory plot--it explains who made whom a vampire and how else the human and vampire characters are related--director Michael Rymer stages high-tech sequences combining gore romance and gothy music and he has enough conviction to make what could have been very silly strangely provocative; the result is an exploitation movie that seems like its about something--though what exactly I couldnt say. Scott Abbott and Michael Petronis screenplay is based on Anne Rices The Vampire Chronicles; with Stuart Townsend Aaliyah and Marguerite Moreau. 101 min.

Finally Warner has produced a second screen installment from Anne Rices bestselling ""Vampire Chronicles"" (after Neil Jordans ""Interview With the Vampire"" eight years ago) and the result ""Queen of the Damned"" arriving after months of whispery rumors isnt quite as bad as might have been feared. Handsomely mounted this direly conventional bit of vampire business is enlivened by flashes of humor and game performances. It isnt great entertainment or camp but pic sets its ambitions so low it cant help partially delivering on them. That combined with the much ballyhooed presence of late singer-actress Aaliyah in the title role should give pic some brief B.O. bite even if unlike its title character any regal enthronement will be less than immortal. This ""Vampire Chronicles"" pic adopts a distinctly different set of aesthetics from its predecessor. Helmer Michael Rymer disposes of Jordans baroquely operatic style and charges forth in full down-and-dirty exploitation mode. Pic opens in the present as Lestat (Stuart Townsend stepping into the role originated by Tom Cruise) awakens from a self-imposed century-long nap. The world has changedTheres an entire subculture of gothic music and clubs where a vampire might feel right at home -- an aboveground netherworld of the living dead. A pleased Lestat sets out to take it by storm. Amusingly Lestat sets himself up as the lead singer of a goth-metal act and becomes an overnight sensation. He breaks a centuries-old code of vampire secrecy by announcing his true identity to the media (not that anyone believes him) and sets about living it up like a typical spoiled-brat rock star. He even has a much put-upon personal assistant charged with rounding up juicy female flesh. Townsend is terrific prissing and preening totally immersed in whiny-celebrity mode but with a good sense of vampire appeal and electrifying as a stage performer too. A parallel story about Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) a paranormal researcher who may have a secret family link to vampires is less interesting. Jesse is part of the team at a famed London institute -- the Talamasca -- that studies the universes dark forces. The Talamasca is one of those stock horror-movie locales -- a series of lush rooms with spooky researcher types wizened by their association with evil (you half expect Alan Bates character from ""The Mothman Prophecies"" to show up). The gag is that all these people are turned on by vampires too just in a different way than the masses that lap up Lestats music. Jesse has the heavy hots for Lestat and when she reads his ancient diary in the Talamascas collection she falls in love with the tragi-romantic notion of himself that he projects on the page. As Jesse reads we see in flashback how Lestat was abducted by the even more ancient vampire Marius (Vincent Perez) and gradually converted. And Perez like Townsend is clearly having a blast with his swishy mother-father-sugardaddy character. Perez who regrettably isnt around for nearly long enough is the liveliest hes ever seemed in an English-speaking performance. Enacting some great catty exchanges like two jilted lovers quarreling Perez and Townsend have the best scenes in the film. But Jesse is a bore both as a character and via Moreaus performance. When she follows Lestat back to his coven (conveniently disguised as a nightclub) he is supposed to see something special in her but its not a vision the viewer can share. After that point the movie goes on autopilot getting bogged down in mythic-sounding vocabulary and rules and regulations about vampirism. Its a spewing forth of exposition meant to set up the big finale where all of Lestats vampire enemies come to ambush him at a Burning Man-style music festival in Death Valley. Ending feels like a conscious shift in tone as if the filmmakers realized they were having a bit too much fun and didnt want to risk alienating Anne Rice purists. The finale is exactly the son-et-lumiere chaos you expect complete with ill-conceived digital effects and lots of humorless carnage; its a typical vampire show with nothing going on underneath. And what of Aaliyah the movies selling point? Blink and you might miss her. Her big entrance in pics title role doesnt come until nearly an hour in and when she does appear its a bit disconcerting to hear a manipulated robotic-sounding voice coming out of her. (She sounds a bit like Cher on her recent vocoder-enhanced dance singles.) Aaliyah never has much to do and you cant really tell if shes in on the films jokiness or not (because by the time she appears pic has largely solemnized) but her Queen Akasha does slink across the screen with catlike conviction and when she and Lestat stare longingly into each others eyes it really seems like theyve been waiting centuries to get it on. Shot almost exclusively in Melbourne pic has a crisp sleek look courtesy of ace lenser Ian Baker (who regularly shoots Fred Schepisis movies) and some eye-catching sets (doubling at points for recognizable London and L.A. locales) created by vet Aussie production designer Graham ""Grace"" Walker.

USATODAY.com - Queen damns audience to eternal boredom Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/22/2002 - Updated 0910 AM ET Queen damns audience to eternal boredom By Mike Clark USA TODAY Queen Akasha and the Vampire Lestat in Queen of the Damned. If youre going to see Queen of the Damned for Aaliyahs last performance be warned that the late pop star shows up an hour in and that she doesnt become a major story force until the final scenes. If youre going because you want to see an entertaining horror movie good luck. The long-completed Queen is the second screen installment from Anne Rices The Vampire Chronicles and only after Aaliyahs late arrival does the movie have any of the fun Tom Cruise had in Neil Jordans more lively Interview With the Vampire. Read more below Video Queen of the Damned trailer Queen of the Damned (out of four) Stars Stuart Townsend Aaliyah Marguerite Moreau Vincent Perez Lena Olin Director Michael Rymer Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for vampire violence Here Stuart Townsend has the Lestat role created by Cruise and what a bloodless lump he is. He sinks the movie as much as he sunk last years About Adam in which unfortunately he played Adam. Over the past century Lestat has been getting mighty stir-crazy in his crypt and he senses that underground clubs will be to his liking. In other words with goth makeup tattoos and two-toned hair how can you tell whos a vampire and whos not? After becoming the lead singer in a London rock group he brazenly announces that he is a vampire. Fine but in todays blase society it wont knock the Olympics off the front pages nor does it here. Forget Interviews A-list cast Vincent Perez plays a veteran vampire and Marguerite Moreau a paranormal researcher with a romantic yen for Lestat. Word within the vampire community is that Lestats Pied Piper of Biterdom is grooming himself to lead his fans to a coven. Hes in over his head though thanks to Aaliyahs queen vampire. When we finally see her she enters a barroom reaches down below the camera line and rips out somebodys crotch. Martial arts star Sonny Chiba pulled this maneuver with more elan in 1974s The Street Fighter. Aaliyahs Queen Akasha has an electronic voice and is decked out in backless and midriff-flashing garb that makes her look like a relic from a Tarzan movie. A fanged Eartha Kitt who plays an exotic catlike creature also shows up at an outdoor Death Valley rock concert where people on stage burst into flames as the faithful watch. Way too late an overly solemn movie tries having a little fun with special effects but it doesnt make the result any better. Only Lena Olin in a vampire role so small that you forget shes in the movie matches Aaliyahs flair. The rest is so dull that you may be tempted to slip the projectionist 50 bucks to turn on the house lights and see what happens to the vampire cast.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT BAD BLOOD / Queen is a silly overwrought vampire tale and a creepy screen farewell for Aaliyah 1 / 2 Back to Gallery QUEEN OF THE DAMNED Vampire thriller. Starring Stuart Townsend Vincent Perez Aaliyah and Lena Olin. Directed by Michael Rymer. Written by Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Oh the torture of eternity. That deep lonely void. Its tough being a vampire as the charismatic Lestat moans in ""Queen of the Damned"" a toothless overwrought adaptation of Anne Rices 1988 novel -- the third in her ""Vampire Chronicles"" series. In ""Queen"" Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has just emerged from a centurys sleep and reinvented himself as a Goth-rock superstar. Ghostly white and androgynous he devours unsuspecting groupies angers his mentor Marius (Vincent Perez) seduces a librarian (Marguerite Moreau) and awakens Akasha (Aaliyah) the ancient vampire queen. In flashbacks we see how Lestat an 18th century French nobleman was trained and groomed by Marius (""the man who made me""). A fiend for blood since his conversion Lestat is transformed by the taste of it but learns never to drink that last drop to hold back from killing. Directed by Australian filmmaker Michael Rymer who showed promise in the low-key ""Angel Baby"" ""Queen of the Damned"" is self-serious pointless and silly. Its getting more attention than it merits only because it marks the final screen appearance of Aaliyah the singer-actress who died at 22 in a plane crash in August. Aaliyah doesnt show up in ""Queen"" until the last 40 minutes and hasnt much to do but undulate show off her flat tummy and reveal a dental appliance that gives her saberlike eyeteeth. Her costume with its metal breastplate shell skirt and elaborate headdress does most of the work for her. Its more a modeling job than an acting assignment. Aaliyahs voice sounds mechanical and dubbed and when she appears at Lestats outdoor rock concert in Death Valley -- where else? -- she makes a spectacular entrance on a fog- enshrouded hydraulic lift. Just like Cher in her ""Believe"" tour. Had Aaliyah lived longer and become a good actress it wouldnt be the result of anything she learned in ""Queen of the Damned."" Although her presence has a built-in curiosity factor it takes on a morbid edge as the violence escalates and her character leaves a trail of corpses in her wake and is ravaged by rival bloodsuckers. An extra dimension never intended by the filmmakers but unavoidable given the actress death is embedded in those scenes. What might have been a campy little romp becomes something else a premature farewell sobering and sad and given the material a tad creepy. It isnt just Aaliyah and her legacy that are ill served by ""Queen of the Damned."" Anne Rice doesnt fare any better and neither do the rest of the actors not Townsend whose part is equally ornamental and superficial; not Perez who looks bored and confused; not Lena Olin who has a few take-the- money-and-run moments as Moreaus tragic vampire aunt. The music hits a sour note as well. Jonathan Davis lead singer for the neo- metal band Korn collaborated with Richard Gibbs on the score -- he also sings Lestats role -- and the result is a collection of dark overproduced songs that sound like discards from old Billy Idol records. .

This script by Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni -- adapted from a volume of Anne Rices ""Vampire Chronicles"" -- doesnt contain a drop of character development. Not that the acting helps. This time out the legendary vampire Lestat played by Irish actor Stuart Townsend reinvents himself as a rock star. Think David Bowie channeling Marilyn Manson. Meanwhile the late singer Aaliyah in her second and last film role plays the ancient vampire Queen Akasha as if shes a tired robot. But the biggest waste in the film is the remarkably talented Lena Olin as a vampire named Maharet -- somehow a mother figure to a mortal named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who belongs to Talamascan a group which studies paranormal activity. Jesse finds herself lusting after Lestat who ... Oh never mind. None of it makes the least bit of sense and its all utterly ridiculous. Rock n roll vampire Not that vampire movies should necessarily make a whole lot of sense but there should be some kind of a story line that you can sink your teeth into -- so to speak. This film however simply careens from one idiotic scene to the next leaving one bloodless body after another in its meaningless wake.
