But like conkers scaring children seems to have fallen foul of elf n safety touchy-feely-ness. Even the wicked stepmother (Julia Roberts) in this visually stunning live action Snow White is not so much evil incarnate as a Bitch with a capital B. A cougar shes got her claws set on Snow Whites Prince Charming (Armie Hammer). Hes rich and built like an ox she sighs lustily. Plenty seem to be taking kindly to Mirror Mirror as a fresh and funny film that works for parents and kids but for me its knowing sarcasm felt like more of the same lazy humour that passes for funny in so many PG films.Snow (shes dropped the White) is a princess in the revisionist mould - not a simperer but a swashbuckler. Shes sent into the forest with a blundering lackey not a huntsman after complaining about the lot of the peasants. Lily (daughter of Phil) Collins is pleasant in the role but its Roberts whos the star camping it up outrageously in dazzling costumes. Mirror Mirror is as gaudily spectacular as you expect if youve seen director Tarsem Singhs films The Fall and Immortals. As for the dwarves theyve fallen into bad habits since Disney. Dressed like ninjas theyre bandits tricking victims into believing theyre giants with extendable legs. The swords and thievery have clearly been added to lure boys into the cinema. Judging by the dad I spotted patting his son on the shoulder (Next time well see a boys film) Im not sure it worked.

Though far from true to the original tale this is a good 21st century take on it. I went to see it late afternoon and saw/heard plenty of adults and children chuckling away. The humours dry enough for adult with a number of very very subtle sexual innuendos kids would never twig. Great entertainment for the Easter break. -- ""Ian"" Are you sure about your ability to write a simple review?

PS What are ""dwares""?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 6 2012IanFeaturedI am not sure what film Mike saw but my recollections of it are slightly different to his. It starts well and Roberts is very good. After five minutes I thought perhaps we have another Princess Bride here with a genuinely funny and tongue in cheek fairy tale. Sadly it goes downhill from there. Collins ia a pleasant enough Snow White yet she never totally convinces. Pretty as she is there is someting missing from her performance and Hammer whilst he looks the part struggles to act his way out of a paper bag let alone strike you as a leading man. The dwares are both annoying and irritating and the films middle where Snow White finds her inner girl power and the really not very endearing dwarves and her bond over fight lessons strikes me as an added thought from a focus group to tick a demographic box rather than being in the film on merit. Towards the end I was genuinely wishing it was all over. Sean Bean seems somewhat embarassed and his scenes at the end dont really work. Also the awfully cliched yet lets add it for no apparent reason ""Bollywood"" dance finale left me wanting to throw stuff at the screen. Two stars for me. It must really make more of an effort. If you have kids and are at a loose end go see the Pirates instead.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 4 2012MikeFeaturedCath ClarkeaEUR(tm)s Time Out review is very accurate. Over the years Disney (and now Pixar) have turned out some very wholesome childrenaEUR(tm)s movies. However this isnaEUR(tm)t from Disney so aEURoewholesomeaEUR it ainaEUR(tm)t. Julia Roberts plays the wicked queen with such enthusiasm youaEUR(tm)d think sheaEUR(tm)d been waiting her whole career for the role- vain manipulative terrible with money fixated with clothes bitchy obsessed with men sarcastic down-on-her-luck and so desperately seeking husband number five. . There are some great lines in this movie aEUR"" too many to remember them all though two of my favourites have to be the wicked queenaEUR(tm)s aEURoemirror mirroraEUR reflection talking back to Roberts and telling her aEURoeIaEUR(tm)m just like you but with less wrinkles.aEUR or Roberts (to herself) on meeting Armie Hammer (the handsome prince) aEURoeHmmmmmaEUR|. handsome and smart aEUR"" how confusing.aEUR . This is a good movie for both adults and children. Clearly the adult humouraEUR(tm)s dry and finely tuned yet thereaEUR(tm)s enough slapstick for children to enjoy aEUR"" or at least those in the showing I went to were chuckling throughout. . The castingaEUR(tm)s excellent. Lilly Collins is a very convincing Snow White Armie Hammer is excellent as the prince and aEUR"" not to be forgotten aEUR"" Nathan Lane is superb as Brighton the wicked queenaEUR(tm)s butler. . So though a far cry from her Oscar winning performance as Erin Brokovitch Julia Roberts plays the wicked queen with such enthusiasm sheaEUR(tm)s a pleasure to watch from start to finish.

Julia Roberts and Lily Collins in Mirror Mirror (Jan Thijs) C+ Mirror Mirror Genre Comedy Drama Action/Adventure; Starring Lily Collins Armie Hammer Julia Roberts; Director Tarsem Singh; Release Date Wide 03/30/2012; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Relativity Media Posted April 11 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT The magic mirror the poisoned apple the Seven Dwarfs the evil queen the handsome prince and the fair maiden called Snow White all make appearances in Mirror Mirror. But with director Tarsem Singh at the helm the enchanted qualities of the Snow White saga are muffled by the weight of visual peacockery. The director of Immortals and The Cell never met a lily he didnt want to gild and then photograph through a kaleidoscope. And his curiously unemotional obsessive attention to the superficial look of things combined with a screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (from a story idea by Melissa Wallack) that layers a jokey post-modern sensibility over an old Grimm fairy tale makes for a dull and unbewitching movie. Julia Roberts enjoys herself immensely as Snows evil stepmother the Queen. And well she might The character is a psychological classic a woman vain about her beauty depressed about aging and jealous of the young women who will inevitably unthrone her as Fairest of Them All. Playing step-mama with a wink (the heartless bee-yotch also spends money like a sultan while her subjects suffer in poverty) Roberts gets to act out the meanest pettiest and most amusingly wicked of urges laying on the cartoon cruelty. Confidently still one of the Fairest of Them All among her own generation the movie star has fun with the cute contradiction of a pretty woman playing an ugly competitor. Anyway the Queen might just as well save some of her dragon breath As played by Lily Collins (The Blind Side) with an assist from her screen-hogging disorienting dark eyebrows our Snow is a rather bland girl with none of her stepmoms charismatic personality. In a nod to Tangled and the present-day preference for young heroines who know martial arts archery or other forms of kicking ass Snow is as they say an agent in her own self-empowerment. (At least I think they say that in some womens magazine or other.) The young woman takes lessons in swashbuckling from her friends the Seven Dwarfs and proves to be such a deft hand with a sword that the Handsome Prince -- played with true easy charm by The Social Networks Armie Hammer -- almost doesnt know what to make of her. The Seven Dwarfs? Theyre jokey and squabbly and physically rambunctious -- all those things that come with being a) an all-male comic-relief element and b) dwarf actors in a comedy. The guys spend their days as woodland bandits. And when they fight they look awfully cool when they suddenly become tall lifted up by their stilt-like giant accordion pantaloons. Oh those pantaloons Mirror Mirror is a film thats all picture and no propulsion each scene static in a basic set-decoration color scheme of teabag and banana. But those pantaloons -- and every other costume in the movie -- are marvels of artistry by the late great multimedia artist Eiko Ishioka. Sprung from Eikos unique imagination every garment is an art installation every hat a fantastical sculpture. And thats just for daily wear. When the Queen plays a chess-like diversion with living pieces moving across a game board floor and especially when the Queen throws a fancy ball the designer dresses the players in creations that display more vitality standing still than the whole movie does joylessly pushing towards its Happily Ever After finish.

Comments click to enlarge Mirror Mirror Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Rated PG  106 minutes  2012 Reviewing Tarsem Singhs grisly sword-and-sandal epic Immortals (2011) I took a stab at prognostication and described him as ""a talented and eccentric visual artist with no creative future in the movie business."" Im not quite ready to retract that judgment but this fractured fairy tale provides him with a much more congenial vehicle for his florid imagery more in line with his spellbinding fantasy The Fall (2006). Like Terry Gilliam--the filmmaker he most often calls to mind--Singh is much more skilled as a visual artist than a storyteller and his artistic fortunes seem to rise and fall with the inspiration of his screenwriters. In this case hes lucked out with Mellissa Wallack and Jason Keller whose witty script retells the story of Snow White (Lily Collins) from the perspective of the wicked queen (Julia Roberts). If Singh can just stay away from those poison apples he may live happily ever after. By J.R.

"Julia Roberts brings star power to surreal Mirror Mirror |       NJ.com comments Julia Roberts brings star power to surreal Mirror Mirror Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 30 2012 at 801 AM View/Post Comments Jan Thijs/AP/Relativity MediaRoberts as the queen. Once upon a time a very long time ago in the magical Wood of Holly lived a fabulous Queen named Julia. She ruled her kingdom for many years and wore many masks. She was a pretty woman and a runaway bride and a guest at her best friends wedding. She even won a small golden statue for playing a woman named Erin (or maybe just for wearing that painful push-up bra). But then an evil spell came over Queen Julia. And there was a dark decade of duplicity and eating praying and loving and dallying with knaves named Charlie Wilson and Larry Crowne. And her magical cackle was stilled and her courtiers lamented. But now that spell has been lifted for there is ""Mirror Mirror"" a new version of Snow White. And guess who plays the Evil Queen? No not Nathan Lane. Please. (Although that would have been wonderful.) He plays her manservant. Queen Julia plays the Evil Queen and she is vain and brittle and imperious and rather pleased with herself. And if it is not a role she was born to play it is one she has convincingly grown into. In this version of the tale it is the Evil Queens story or so she thinks. Snow White is a mere inconvenience a young maiden played by Lily Collins who has been locked away in her tower bedroom forgotten by all left to do nothing but sigh and comb her eyebrows. But one day Snow White is sent from the castle. And that is when the real magic happens. Because then we meet the seven dwarves who are not Sleepy and Sneezy and Doc but real characters called Half Pint and Butcher and Grub who rule the forest like Robin Hoods mini men and if you asked them to sing ""Heigh-Ho"" would probably punch you in the loins. And we are introduced to Armie Hammer who is as slightly fussy and formal as ever but at least looks like a charming prince. And we see the lovely visuals of director Tarsem Singh who last made the movie ""Immortals"" in which Mickey Rourke wore a lobster claw on his head but here puts his strange imagination to better use. And so we get marionette monsters and royal masques talking mirrors and enchanted cockroaches. We get stilts that collapse like bellows love potions that turn men into the wrong kind of beasts and a Bollywood dance number for no reason at all. And we get the glorious extravagant costume designs of the late Eiko Ishioka. Of course things could be a little more magical at the castle. True Queen Julia is good but her wickedness lacks wit; for someone known for her smile shes never showed a real sense of humor. The Evil Queen should be a poisoned bonbon a chocolate cherry with a cyanide center. Julia is believably nasty but never deliciously so. However the dwarves provide wonderful fun Singhs visuals have true magic and Alan Menkens score is charming. And if that PG rating keeps us from having a truly satisfying ending at least in the end the evil are punished the not-quite-so-evil are redeemed the good are rewarded and everyone lives sappily ever after. Which makes it a story for children perhaps. But also a small welcome treat for the weary adults accompanying them. Ratings note The film contains violence. Mirror Mirror (PG) Relativity (95 min.) Directed by Tarsem Singh. With Julia Roberts Lily Collins Armie Hammer Nathan Lane.

Retell the Snow White story but add humor attitude and contemporary language and really go to town on the sets and costumes. Itll be like ""Shrek"" or ""Hoodwinked"" but with live actors. Somewhere between the pitch meeting and the movies opening this sadly earthbound fairy tale lost its happy ending. ""Mirror Mirror"" is minor minor. It has its moments many of them thanks to the late Oscar winner Eiko Ishiokas stunningly inventive and over-the-top costumes but its far far away from a classic. The film is directed by Tarsem Singh (""Immortals"" and ""The Cell"") whose movies are better known for their extravagant look than their narrative coherence or performances. He does a little better here at keeping the story together but the film is still woefully uneven seesawing awkwardly between comedy action scenes and grandiose visuals. Also read Wrath of the Titans Review Release the Crappy Sequel Like those old ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" that used to turn up on ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" ""Mirror"" puts a decidedly modernist twist on the familiar Snow White story. Although the films characters wear fanciful period clothes and wigs and live in castles and a village that look like something out of an MGM back lot extravaganza from the 1930s (but in color) their attitudes and actions are very up to date. Snow White (Lily Collins) here is every bit the equal if not better than her hunky Prince (Armie Hammer who continues to impress) who is himself the object of frankly lustful gazes and comments by the evil Queen (Julia Roberts). The dwarfs who befriend Snow White are now a band of wisecrackers whove turned to thievery after being banished from the village by the Queen whos anti-little people. Occasionally the attempts at humor pay off especially in amusingly silly scenes between the grasping imperious Queen -- Roberts is having a grand time here but theres nothing subtle in her performance -- and the somewhat dim bulb Prince. And Nathan Lane playing a toadying courtier to the Queen always manages to land his laughs. Part of ""Mirrors"" problem is that the screenplay credited to two writers and with a third getting a story credit is all over the place. At times it seems that the movie is a satire about anxiety over aging as the Queen frets over whos the fairest in the land. But it also hints at a political agenda as when the villagers are told that the onerous taxes collected by the Queen are being used to keep them safe and at being about feminism as when Snow White and the Prince battle for the upper hand while bickering or crossing swords. The film is likely to appeal most to younger viewers say tweeners and early teens who will enjoy the slapstick a poop joke and the blatant rudeness of the Queen. Adult viewers however will find themselves comparing this fairy tale comedy to ""The Wizard of Oz"" ""The Princess Bride"" and the ""Shrek"" movies with ""Mirrors"" shine a dull reflection of those earlier films.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 30 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Luckily history is on our side. Deeply entrenched in European folklore refashioned by the Grimms as a classic fable animated by Disney into a charming and ground-breaking feature Snow White has been whirling around in our collective imagination for centuries. So its likely to survive even Mirror Mirror which in the ham-hands of director Tarsem Singh blasts away the darkness while deadening the charm. When the dust settles all thats left are a few motes of lame comedy atop a few million bucks worth of overdressed sets. Call me Grumpy but this seems less an adaptation than a random assault. Johanna Schneller Lily Collins The fairy-tale princess reinvented Screen grab from the online trailer for the new comedy ""Mirror Mirror"" starring Julia Roberts and Lily Collins Movies Mirror Mirror The official trailer Trailer wars Snow White vs. Snow White A movie trailer smackdown Indeed randomness is the watchword here beginning with the loopy decision to cast Julia Roberts against type. Of course Julia is no stranger to fairy tales; once upon a time she delighted the multitudes as a modern Cinderella in Pretty Woman. Years have passed since then yet apparently not enough that Americas erstwhile sweetheart is ready to sully herself as the evil Queen. Instead stopping well short of evil she veers off in the vague direction of bitchy laughter only to fail on both counts - the bitchiness like the yuks are as faux as her Court of Versailles surroundings. But lets not be too hard on Julia whose performance is just another victim of that enabling script. Whats worse she gets saddled with Nathan Lane as her comic sidekick in the evil Queen biz and the ever-mugging Lane is hardly an antidote to what ails the screenplay - this guy is capable of chewing even computer-generated scenery. Worse still its Nathan in lieu of the huntsman who leads the banished Snow White into the dark woods where she encounters the diminutive septet of Grumpy Dopey ... actually no. Sorry but anyone hoping to brush up on their dwarf nomenclature wont be Happy. This bunch gets new names mainly on the mean side Butcher Wolf Grub Grimm Napoleon and (the writers showing their fatigue) Chuckles and Half-Pint. We meet them earlier in the proceedings not as dwarfs but as little people on big stilts accosting the handsome Prince (Armie Hammer) and stripping him down to his undies - a sight deemed so comically delectable that its repeated later. Yep the Prince frequently has no clothes - perhaps he hopes to become an Emperor. After that theres a ball to be held an opulently costumed and bewigged affair apparently co-sponsored by the conjoined ghosts of Truman Capote and Louis the Sun King. And naturally theres a mirror to be judged the fairest in. Theres even a swordfight to fight with Snow herself taking up the blade in a playful bout with the handsome one punctuated by her asking that most pressing of rhetorical questions ""Why do you have to be so cute?"" Finally there are spells to be cast and potions to be drunk - in this case ""a puppy love potion"" that has the Prince licking faces and bounding on all fours and generally instilling the urge to swat his cuteness with a rolled-up newspaper. Only Lily Collins rises above the lameness and only because in her Snow White gown of virginal hue she hints enticingly at a young Audrey Hepburn - memories of a different royalty in a different time. Unfortunately as the title suggests its not really her film. But no one else claims it either - not Julia and certainly not Singh who for no apparent reason tacks on a lavish Bollywood musical number to run (no stumble) over the end credits.

The Queen (played by Julia Roberts) explains how she was able to trick the King (Sean Bean) into falling in love with her by giving him a love potion. Unfortunately for the Queen the potion is not stronger than the Kings love for his own daughter. When the King goes off on a trip he gives Snow White (Lily Collins) a special golden dagger. Sadly her father disappears and is thought to be dead. Snow White searches for her father but only finds his horse. From that day she lives under the Queens control until her 18th birthday. The Queen does not want to celebrate the day but Snow White is happily surprised when the kitchen helpers have a party for her. They tell Snow that the King meant for the kingdom to be hers. Snow White decides to be brave defy her stepmothers orders and return to the kingdom. Snow is shocked to find people sad and starving instead of dancing and happy as they were when her father ruled. Snow uses her fathers dagger to rescue Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) after he is attacked by bandits. Later the Prince attends a ball given by the Queen but instead of falling for the Queen he dances with Snow White. The Queen is furious and orders her servant Brighton (Nathan Lane) to kill Snow White. Brighton turns out to be a good guy and spares Snow Whites life. Left alone in the woods with only her fathers dagger Snow meets up with the ""bandits"" who turn out to be the seven dwarfs They take Snow White in and teach her how to defend herself. advertisement | advertise on newsday The Queen who is poor after years of spending all the Kingdoms money on herself decides she must have the Prince to herself and wants more parties. She makes the people of the kingdom pay even more taxes. The Queen consults the ""mirror on the wall"" to keep her beauty and make the Prince fall for her but the mirror reminds her there will be a price to pay. There are many great scenes in this movie including the seven dwarfs teaching Snow White how to use swords and outsmart enemies a scary beast scene and sword fighting between the Prince and Snow White. The Queen tries to keep her beauty with a bird poop facial and many other disgusting spa treatments. The effects that they used to show the Queens mirror world are so realistic. The battles with the beast in the woods are so exciting you hold your breath. This movie is great. There are so many funny scenes and jokes for people of all ages. Kids and adults who know the traditional story will be surprised by the big twist and surprises at the end. We rate this 4.5 (out of 5).

And Tarsem Singh the director of Mirror Mirror has certainly done that. From its ""once upon a time"" animated intro to its swooping views of a golden-domed castle perched atop a precipice to the bellows-like stilts worn by a certain septet of little people in this new take on the old Snow White yarn everything looks well fantastic.The costumes designed by the late great Eiko Ishioka add splendor and artistry to what in the end is a not terribly inventive or surprising variation on the oft-told story collected by those brothers Grimm An aging and vainglorious queen takes a look at the pale-skinned young princess in her care and decides to have her offed lest she be deemed the most beautiful desirable creature in the land.Hamming it up richly and for the most part snappily as the nasty Queen is Julia Roberts poking fun at the institutional narcissism and ageism that drives the business shes in. The Queen gazes worriedly into her magic mirror (a kind of watery pool kept in a Japanese-like thatched hut afloat on a lake) takes note of the lines on her face and huffs weakly ""Theyre not wrinkles theyre crinkles.""Attended to by a busy buffoon (Nathan Lane) and despised by her people Roberts malevolent monarch passes her days slipping into and out of elaborate gowns and ordering new taxes on the villagers to pay for her fetes. And when a handsome prince shows up (Armie Hammer fresh from playing Leonardo DiCaprios handsome prince in J. Edgar) a fete she must have - to woo this hunky noble and wrestle him into wedlock.Only problem of course is that Prince Alcott has already taken a shine to Snow (Lily Collins) which is all the more reason the Queen tells her goofy gofer ""I want her killed.""So Snow is sent off into the woods where she is not killed but finds herself shacking up with seven dwarfs - men who make a living robbing the rich and men now smitten (smote?) by the raven-haired young woman who shares their home. Their names are Napoleon Half Pint Grub Grim Wolf Butcher and Chuckles and while they teach Snow how to defend herself with sword and stick she teaches them how to have compassion for their fellow man and to return the money that theyve robbed to those to whom it rightfully belongs. (The starving townsfolk.)If Mirror Mirror seems mostly to be Roberts show it is. Collins has a nice Audrey Hepburn air (and hair) about her but little of Hepburns allure. And Hammer playing a somewhat clownish royal has to actually behave like an excited pup - panting yelping and licking - when he climbs into bed with the Queen. This is because the concoction she has slipped into his wine was not a simple love potion but a ""puppy love potion."" Funny.Singh whose eye-popping tribute to the Silent Era The Fall was several years ahead of The Artist/Hugo curve never lets his attention waver from the production design - those beautiful snowy birch tree forests; the parapets; cliffs; and opulent palace digs. He lets his stars deliver their lines - some with more flourish and wit than others (among the dwarfs Jordan Prentice and Danny Woodburn get off the best) - but his eye is mostly on the gilt and the silk the CG-ed skies and the eerie iced-over lake that separates the castle from the town.Its another story of the one percenters and the 99 but its a fairy tale after all so at least the greedheads get comeuppance.

Photo Its important to know when youve been beaten"" Snow Whites evil stepmother (Julia Roberts) says early in ""Mirror Mirror."" Yes and the screenwriters of this attempt to do a hip comedic take on the legend were licked by Page 5. Why did they keep going? As garish-looking as Versailles reimagined by Donald Trump as boring as a dead carp and as campy as a boxed set of ""Project Runway"" this would-be kiddie comedy directed by Tarsem Singh (""Immortals"") features as Snow White Lily Collins and her eyebrows -- black furry things that resemble Robin Williams forearms. Roberts queen sits around camping it up in acres of taffeta while lobbing dull one-liners consulting her reflection and telling her retainer (Nathan Lane) to kill the girl. The queen doesnt bother to check on the results though she does turn the servant into a cockroach which yields a joke about Lanes character getting raped by a grasshopper. PHOTOS 2012S FUTURE STARS Collins daughter of Phil has an aggressively unremarkable screen presence that suggests she thinks the coolest Genesis song is ""Thats All."" And yet shes more interesting than the devastatingly bland Armie Hammer whose square chin and generically WASP manner mark him down as an actor perfectly suited to toothpaste commercials and not much else. He plays a prince who wanders through a forest in search of adventure and finds himself battling the Seven Dwarves obnoxious little jerks who attack passersby while wearing stilts. When he meets the queen she schemes to marry him for money and slips him a love potion for encouragement. Oops The potion turns him into a puppy instead. Puppy love get it? Yeah neither do I. Hammer like most 6-foot-5 men is not overly skilled in capering and to watch him spend a chunk of the movie lumbering around while trying to make you think of a small dog is as embarrassing to watch as his last performance when he had a fistfight/makeout scene with Leo DiCaprio in ""J. Edgar"" and wore old-age makeup that looked like someone had smeared stucco on his face. To soak up minutes in the middle of the movie Snow White decides to become a brigand and a swordfighter. Cue a training montage whose highlights are the different outfits she tries on and her attaining mastery of a shell game she practices with a dwarf. Then she tries to rob the prince in the forest (both forgetting theyre on the same side) and crosses swords with him. Naturally she wins; later shell explain that for a prince to rescue a princess would be trite so she locks him in the dwarves cottage. What is the lamest aspect of all? Could be the costumes (in a big party scene Snow wears a huge swan on her head while the prince wears a top hat with bunny ears) or the dialogue (this is the kind of flick where ""Dont spend it all in one place"" counts as wit as does ""love means someone to pass the potatoes""). But I pick the lazy inert lackluster plot. The queen has major powers (she can whip up magical evil creatures on command) but hardly does anything with them Unleashing a monster on Snow she then dashes off to chat with her mirror without bothering to see what happens. The poison apple? It occupies about 30 seconds of half-hearted discussion. There is one big winner in this mess though. Congratulations 1961s ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"" Youre now the second-worst movie on the subject.

A bust a la Singhs ""Immortals""? Or a visionary head trip like his 2006 film ""The Fall""? Lets hope he can pull this one off. Starring Julia Roberts Lily Collins Armie Hammer Nathan Lane Bean Reigns Jordan Prentice Danny Woodburn Sebastian Saraceno Ronald Lee Clark Martin Klebba Director Tarsem Singh Release Opened Mar 30 2012  Editorial Review Snow casts pale reflection in MirrorBy Sandie Angulo ChenFriday Mar. 30 2012""Mirror Mirror"" is a visual spectacular. Its vivid set design sweeping landscapes and elaborate costumes recall Tim Burtons colorful Wonderland darkened with a dash of HBOs world-building ""Game of Thrones."" Director Tarsem Singh has shown a gift for fantastical settings (""The Cell"" ""The Fall"" even ""Immortals"") and Snow Whites kingdom is no exception. Unfortunately the star of ""Mirror Mirror"" offers a pale reflection of her stunning setting. As Snow White actress Lily Collins is a washout. Singhs retelling of the beloved story (penned by screenwriters Melissa Wallack and Jason Keller) is neither a live-action version of the animated Disney classic nor a modernization of the original Brothers Grimm tale. Its more a mashup of ""Snow White"" ""Robin Hood"" (with a thieving band of dwarfs) and ""Cinderella"" (featuring ballroom dancing with a smitten prince). The plot is simple enough for younger Disney Princess fans to follow. The fair Snow White is sequestered in her late fathers castle while her pathologically vain stepmother the Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) oppresses the kingdom. After sneaking out of the fortress for a visit to the village Snow has a typical meet-cute with Prince Alcott of Valencia (Armie Hammer) in the woods. He has been bound and burgled and she has no idea he is a prince but unties him and then blushes furiously as she tries not to stare at his broad bare chest before they part ways. When the prince arrives at the castle looking for sanctuary the queen goes into cougar mode figuring that marrying the handsome royal would solve her enormous financial woes. But naturally the prince has eyes only for the mysterious raven-haired beauty he encountered in the forest. Roberts dressed in full sun-colored regalia cranks up the scenery-chewing but its necessary to combat the understated (read boring) performance by Collins. Disneys kind and gentle Snow White was charming could sing and regularly talked to woodland creatures. The same cannot be said of Collins who is lovely (regardless of where you fall in the bushy eyebrows debate) but lacks the sort of charisma that made co-star Roberts the ultimate ""Pretty Woman"" in Hollywood. And in fact the most sparkling conversations are between the prince and the overeager queen even when the topic comes around to Snow Whites beauty. Most of Snows interactions with the magnetic prince are tepid except for one flirty sword fight that includes a bit of much-needed banter (""Have you learned nothing from your spankings?"" the prince asks after repeatedly tapping Snow with his blade). Even the climactic kiss is a snooze compared with the royal love stories of ""The Princess Bride"" ""Enchanted"" or even the animated ""Tangled."" In contrast to Collinss bland Snow White the other characters enjoy brief laugh-aloud dialogue. Nathan Lane is Brighton the queens comically cowardly counsel tax collector and yes man. And the seven dwarfs play a bigger role than in previous ""Snow Whites"" which is probably to the films advantage because the titular character is the weakest link. The dwarfs are scoundrels not miners and they definitely do not whistle while they work which would give them away while theyre stealing gold from wealthy passersby. Forced into exile by the queens ""Banish the Uglies"" decree the dwarfs (Napoleon Half Pint Grub Grimm Wolf Butcher and Chuckles) are a completely self-sufficient lot and dont warm to Snow White until she cooks them a lavish meal. And after they take her in they train her in the essential bandit skills of sword fighting gymnastics and three-card Monte. But theres one lesson they didnt teach how to be enchanting.

There are no hip soon-to-be-dated cultural allusions no spoofing of fairy tale conventions. A person who had never heard the familiar Snow White tale (if there is such a person) wouldnt miss anything in Mirror Mirror because it works as a standalone family-friendly fantasy. This version begins from the wicked Queens point of view. Played with full-wattage charisma by Julia Roberts the Queen reports that her stepdaughters parents named her Snow White ""probably because that was the most pretentious name they could think of."" Ever since the death of the King left her in charge the Queen has wasted the kingdoms money made the peasants miserable and kept Snow White in the castle essentially if not literally locked up. It is on the occasion of her 18th birthday that the beautiful Snow White (played by Lily Collins daughter of old-timey pop musician Phil Collins) starts getting ideas about venturing out into the world. She has a meet-cute with the dashing Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) in the forest where he and his steward Renbock (Robert Emms) have been set upon by a band of robbers who wear stilts to disguise their short statures. If you had to guess how many of these diminutive highwaymen there are you would do well to stay in the ballpark of seven. The Queen proves to be as smitten with Prince Alcotts good looks as Snow White is leading to some very funny exchanges between the young Prince and the um slightly older Queen. More to the point shes smitten with his vast riches and large kingdom which she would very much like to add to her own. (Renbock warns Alcott ""This queen radiates crazy."") Jealous of Snow Whites beauty and influence over the Prince the Queen orders her buffoonish servant Brighton (Nathan Lane) to get rid of her. As you can see while some of the traditional framework is in place this version of Snow White (written by Melissa Wallack and Jason Keller) goes in significantly different directions from the Disney version which deviated from the Brothers Grimm version which was merely the most famous of the folkloric tales anyway. So this isnt a retelling of the famous story but from the Queens perspective the way Wicked retold The Wizard of Oz or Rosencrantz amp; Guildenstern Are Dead retold Hamlet. Its a different story altogether albeit one with some familiar elements. There are pros and cons to this approach. For example part of me hoped the seven dwarfs would have the same personalities as their Disney counterparts just for the fun of seeing them translated into live-action characters. But I can see the wisdom in not being too devoted to that version of the fairy tale as to do so would have made this one seem dependent on it. Directed by the visually talented Tarsem Singh Dhandwar (The Cell The Fall Immortals) Mirror Mirror brims with fanciful imagery as well as marvelous sets and costumes and Collins Roberts Hammer Lane and the rest of the cast revel in the opportunity to play dress-up in fairy-tale land. The first half of the film is about as enchanting and blithely funny as an all-ages movie gets but this diminishes over time as the story falls into sillier devices (a potion makes Prince Alcott act like a dog) and is sometimes slowed down by of all things the action scenes. The delights are in the dialogue -- humorous but rarely jokey jaunty and only lightly sarcastic -- more than in the mechanics of the plot. The kids are gonna love it though and I cant blame them.

In another scene a septet of dwarfs wear huge accordion-style stilts. The distinctively rendered costumes set the stage for outlandish fun.The films magical look is its strong suit along with the gleefully villainous performance by Julia Roberts as Snow Whites vain stepmother the queen. Amoral and petty but wickedly charming she has held her sweet-natured stepdaughter captive in the castle since the mysterious death of the king (Sean Bean). About the movieMirror Mirror   out of fourStars Julia Roberts Lily Collins Armie Hammer Nathan Lane DirectorTarsem SinghDistributor Relativity Media Rating PG for some fantasy action and mild rude humor Running time 1 hours 35 minutes Opens Friday nationwideLily Collins plays Snow White with touches of the young Leslie Caron and Audrey Hepburn. Though Snow White is kind shes not the pushover depicted in the Disney film. This is a fairy tale for youthful audiences who have grown up with empowered heroines from Shrek and Mulan.White holds her own alongside the strapping Prince of Valencia (Armie Hammer). She also persuades the renegade dwarfs -- exiled because of their size -- to take her in when she escapes from her palace prison.Hammer strikes all the right notes as the hunky and somewhat hapless prince. He manages to come off as both a dashing hero and a charming goofball. The queens cougar-style flirtation with him is a clever twist. Some of the films humor falls flat particularly the lines given Brighton (Nathan Lane) the queens ever-bullied servant. But one of the funnier scenes involves the effect of a love potion on the prince that renders him a lovesick puppy slobbering like Fido all over the fastidious queen.The seven dwarfs have new monikers. Instead of Grumpy or Dopey they have names such as Half Pint Chuckles and Grimm. Marginalized by society they also have a more specific occupation than their Disney counterparts highway banditry.In further revisions the queens magic mirror doesnt merely proclaim the fairest in the land. She also chides the queen and serves as her conscience. The story adds the element of a beast that lurks in the woods and is used by the nefarious ruler to keep her fearful subjects under her sway.Mirror Mirrors spectacular production design inventive costumes and sophisticated visual flair paired with a sweet message of true love make for a vividly enjoyable retelling.

All the familiar elements are here right down to the poisoned apple though theyve been reworked with the hip knowing sensibility that unfortunately affects most modern-movie yarns of this sort. (Our spunky heroine needs a man to save her?

Mirror Mirror a tart twist on the Snow White fable fumbles nearly every opportunity to be funny the dialogue is flat straining for wit it never achieves and the pace is torpid when it should be bustling. But the couture darling is hilariously divine. Julia Roberts as the evil Queen of this fairy-tale realm is first spotted in a gargantuan orange gown seated on a seashell throne that seems an extension of her dress; she looks as if she were in the process of being devoured by a ravenous mollusk. The courtiers clothes are a riot too at a stately ball handsome Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) sports rabbit ears in his top hat and fuzzy bunny paws on his hands. So even if youre as annoyed by the movie as I was youll come out laughing the costumes. All belated praise to Eiko Ishioka the great designer whose apparel graced Broadway plays (M. Butterfly) and musicals (Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark) circus spectacles (Cirque du Soleils Varekai) and the opening and closing nights of the Beijing Olympics. Ishioka who died in January at 75 didnt do many movies but what she did was choice. Her costumes for Paul Schraders Mishima A Life in Four Chapters and Francis Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula helped define the style of those lush sepulchral films. ""The costumes are the sets"" Ishioka said in a documentary about her work with Coppola. Her attire certainly complements the riotous vistas envisioned by Tarsem Singh Dhandwar the Indian-born director of Mirror Mirror and before that of The Cell The Fall and Immortals for all of which Ishioka devised beguiling costumes. Whatever his lapses as a comedy director Tarsem shared her connoisseurs eye for cinematic luxe; and the clothes she confected for Mirror Mirror -- another Roberts gown that suggests a veritable ostentation of peacocks the saffron cloak with matching hoodie worn by Snow White (Lily Collins) -- are as illuminating as Tom Fodens grandiose production design which have their own amusement value of a fairy-tale kingdom in a hashish dream. All right youll come out laughing the sets too. (READ Corlisss review of Tarsems Immortals) But not the movie. A kind of medieval The Devil Wears Prada with aspirations of The Princess Brides mix of romance and cunning comedy Mirror Mirror also offers early hints that it will perform for the Snow White story what Wicked did for The Wizard of Oz transform a presumed villainess into a misunderstood heroine. Doesnt happen. The opening narration spoken by Roberts does carry a subversive tone as when the Queen says the old kingdom was a happy place where the citizens sang and danced adding acidulously ""Apparently nobody had a job back then; they just sang and danced."" Will Snow White prove to be a truculent child out of The Bad Seed or The Omen or Orphan unjustly fouling the reputation of a devoted stepmom? She will not. Shes your standard plucky stainless teen who as in the Grimm fable escapes the Queens death sentence plays house with seven dwarfs and seals her destiny with Prince Charming with a perfect reviving kiss. And the movies Queen instead of drumming up sympathy as a beautiful woman who must poignantly confront middle age in a land where only the very young get to be heroines is the same old rotten parent. Roberts wholl turn 45 this fall and whose performance is nothing if not game submits herself to a beauty regimen that includes a mud pack of parrot poop and actual bee stings to give her lips that collagen plumpness. The Queens magic mirror image says shes Her Majestys perfect reflection except that ""I have no wrinkles."" (""Theyre not wrinkles"" the Queen protests. ""Theyre crinkles."") Perfectly attuned to the young-female demographic that made The Hunger Games a mega-smash Mirror Mirror requires of the moms who bring their daughters to the movie that they be able to laugh at lame jokes about their incipient decay. At least that ageist prejudice isnt unique to this film. From ""Hansel and Gretel"" to Tangled the recent Disney take on ""Rumpelstiltskin"" the Grimm canon is full of evil middle-aged women preying on young innocents. (FIND Snow White among the all-TIME Top 25 Animated Features) The dwarfs fare better; this time they are highwaymen who learn to rob from the rich and give to the poor -- theyre Merry Men with Snow White as their Robin Hood. The film manages to define each dwarf without naming them by their humors as Disney did and a few have distinguishing charm; especially good is Mark Povinelli as Half-Pint (the lovelorn one who looks like James Franco). They certainly are allowed more appeal than Hammer who earned an Oscar nomination as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network but here evinces only the befuddled anodyne charm of the young Brendan Fraser. Nor can I add to the rapturous notices given Collins (daughter of Phil) who has been unaccountably heralded as the new Audrey Hepburn. Sacrilege Hepburn was a screen beauty who radiated magical grace from every frame; Collins is poised but sullen and sports the lavish eyebrows that a Hollywood makeup artist used to give leading ladies when they played frumps. Well take a teen Winona Ryder or any brunette from the Disney Channel over this No White. Finally Mirror Mirror is unfair to people expecting more than a few good laughs. Scenes proceed lethargically with pauses after punch lines where Tarsem must hope for audience laughter. Anachronistic gags (as when the Prince tells Snow White that he has to be the hero because ""its been focus-grouped -- it works"") break whatever luscious spell the art direction and costumery might create. On their first meeting in the woods the Prince tells the dwarfs ""Youre short and its funny."" Well the film is shortish (106 mins.) but its also epically unfunny. The producers should have handed the script to an actual clever person like Paul Rudnick (In amp; Out Jeffrey) and told him to send it back in a week with solid jokes and a buoyant spirit. Then audiences could leave Mirror Mirror not laughing the costumes but humming the movie.

Julia Roberts wearing a series of outsize gowns -- the skirts seem to promise theyre concealing either industrial scaffolding or Volkswagen Beetles -- plays the vain and imperious queen. Shes been raising her stepdaughter the Princess Snow White (Lily Collins) since the death of the king. (By ""raising"" here we mean ""locking her in a tower and making cuckoo noises when people ask why they never see her out in public."") As the movie opens the queen has a couple of problems She hates Snow White both for being too beautiful and for being an irritatingly chipper prisoner plus shes broke and her only prospect is a baron she considers far too distasteful to marry. Her only friend is her faithful toady and servant Brighton (Nathan Lane) whose fear of the queens wrath can almost but not quite be passed off as adoration. With the help of her ominously intoning mirror (envisioned by director Tarsem Singh as an oracle residing in a sort of lake house she visits) the queen plots to do away with Snow White and snag for herself the rich Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) a royal from a neighboring province who has wandered into her palace half-dressed after being set upon by bandits in the woods. Shorter-than-average bandits they are. Numbering seven. What follows is a kind of mishmash of traditional Snow White storytelling -- Snow White does indeed wind up falling in with those seven bandits -- and new elements. (Viz. the queens attempts to get the prince to marry her instead of Snow; Snows struggle with the traditional rescue-prone princess role.) Basic structure aside what makes Mirror Mirror intriguingly twinkly and endearing is not the story which is simple enough for little kids to follow and timeless enough for adults to enjoy if theyre feeling game. What works is the execution. The script is slyly affectionate toward the fairy tale genre both respecting its conventions about red lips and first kisses and winking at its archetypes. Thats particularly true when the archetype is Prince Alcott played by Hammer as both a deeply and profoundly dreamy prince and a frequently ridiculous befuddled goofball with a tendency to stumble into profound humiliation -- which somehow only makes him more ... well Charming. Julia Roberts vain Queen broke and jealous of Snows beauty flaunts what she has with ornate and lavish dresses. Jan Thijs/ hide caption toggle caption Jan Thijs/ Roberts is quite good lolling about in the role of the bitchy lady whose insecurity about aging would almost be sympathetic if she didnt respond to it by trying to have people killed. (Roberts has never shied away from playing against her original image as a lovable beauty; one of her best-ever scenes is from the romantic comedy Notting Hill in which she plays an actress who quietly explains jokingly-but-not that her future is one of losing her looks and most of her acting opportunities.) And Collins does fine with the less interesting role of a beautiful princess who does indeed take much more control over her own story than do traditionally distressed damsels but who still isnt given nearly as much comedy to play as almost everyone else -- including the seven ""renegades"" as they call themselves at one point. But the performance that lingers after the film like a fizzy champagne buzz is Hammers. He remains at all times deeply and persuasively sexy but he also commits utterly to sequences that require a level of silliness that not all traditionally gorgeous young actors can give themselves over to so completely -- especially as theyre still negotiating a career transition from supporting roles (The Social Network J. Edgar) to leads. There are films you see to broaden your mind and films you see to observe the highest artistry available. But there are also those you see because escapism has its place in a world that -- lets face it -- often demands to be escaped. You can certainly point to Singhs richly realized visual style as a legitimate artistic flourish but the potency here is in Mirror Mirrors relentless infectious good nature. Its not reinventing anything its not awards bait and its not trying to become your favorite movie of all time. Its a clever luscious-looking fairy tale you really can take kids to -- no allegedly family-friendly snot-and-fart humor here -- and a bundle of high style and sharp wit and terrific performances for yourself.

"Movie review Mirror Mirror makes Snow White fair and tough - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review In Mirror Mirror Snow White is fair and toughJulia Roberts shines as the jealous Queen and director Tarsem Singh injects some toughness into Snow White played by Lily Collins.March 30 2012|By Sheri Linden Special to the Los Angeles Times Julia Roberts and Lily Collins star in ""Mirror Mirror."" (Jan Thijs / Relativity Media )Encased in a coffin waiting to be brought back to life Thats how Snow White spends a good portion of the folk story that bears her name. Theres no such downtime for the princess in the snappy retelling ""Mirror Mirror"" a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm. A booster shot of testosterone lends kinetic kick to director Tarsem Singhs visually inventive interpretation without shortchanging the requisite froufrou or sugarcoating the storys dark Oedipal heart. The mash-up can be choppy but the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts. The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (a screen story credit goes to Melisa Wallack) pointedly rewrites the fairy-tale convention that finds every damsel helplessly imperiled until a prince delivers her from danger. This Snow White (Lily Collins) can get gussied up with the best of them but she also holds her own in a fencing duel. And a hello switcheroo a she rescues a prince in distress. TIMELINE Snow White through the years When in exile Snow (its a first-name-informal kingdom) receives martial-arts instruction from the dwarfs. Like the famous septet from Disneys 1937 classic this woods-dwelling crew provides collective-sidekick slapstick and each has a character-defining shtick a most memorably the love-struck Half Pint (Mark Povinelli). But theyve also been restored to their folk tale roots as bandits and outcasts. Theyre action antiheroes with hearts of gold. Transforming Snow White to an action hero in her own right doesnt lessen the archetypal power of the stepmother-daughter age-beauty conflict. Collins (""The Blind Side"") is a convincing foil for Roberts jealous Queen personifying intelligence innate goodness and fairest-of-them-all femininity. If a movie-star self-regard has crept into Roberts work over the years here she uses it to winning effect savoring the tension and silliness and making an exceptionally entertaining evil monarch. Advised and chided by the alter ego who resides on the other side of her magic mirror a one of the films more striking elements a the Queen sets her sights on an imperial merger with Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) whose provinces resources would save her from the brink of bankruptcy. PHOTOS Mirror Mirror red carpet premiere Hammer who brought an air of wounded regality to the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"" and Clyde Tolson in ""J. Edgar"" gets to shake off the aggrievement and let his princely flag fly often without a shirt. Singh (a.k.a. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar or simply Tarsem) is a fantasist whose singular knack for spectacle can also be his weakness set-piece razzle-dazzle not infrequently overwhelming the characters in his previous films ""The Cell"" ""The Fall"" and ""Immortals."" That weakness reveals itself in ""Mirror Mirror"" when he stops the story cold to indulge in a puppet sequence. But mostly the built-in structure of a well-known tale helps to rein him in as does the propulsive rhythm of one-liners a some of the best are delivered with panache by Nathan Lane and Robert Emms as mouthy servants. For most of its running time the film strikes the right balance of make-believe enchantment and snark-infused lampoon playing to older kids and adults alike. Crucial to the movies magic are Tom Fodens lush and witty production design and the splendid costumes by Eiko Ishioka the renowned designers final screen work before her death in January. The finery and regalia of their contributions are integral to Singhs vision giving this mostly conventional princess story its fair share of romantic froth and more than a little moxie. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJulia Roberts From Americas Sweetheart to neighborhood momDecember 26 2013Movie review Forget fair Snow White and the Huntsman is...June 1 2012Lily Collins sees herself in Mirror MirrorMarch 29 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesSnow WhiteEntertainmentFairy TaleCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-mirror-mirror-20120330,0,1545434.story?track=rss",200,mirrormirror21,mirrormirror,latimes
"Mirror Mirror | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mirror-mirror ) Mirror Mirror (United States 2012) March 29 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mirror Mirror is the latest attempt to rework the Grimm Brothers fairy tale ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" into something new adventurous and appealing to 2012 movie-goers. The result is mixed the affable family-friendly motion picture is lively enough to engage young viewers but will prove something of a challenge for anyone who has gone through puberty. The changes to the source material are numerous but most contribute little thats positive to a story that seems to be on auto-pilot. Tarsem Singh (here working under the third iteration of his name Tarsem Singh Dhandwar) brings his usual visual flair to the proceedings but thats not enough. Mirror Mirror is essentially a live-action Snow White and the Seven Dwarves crossed with Time Bandits. The end result could have benefitted greatly from more of the latter and less of the former. The seven dwarves - Napoleon (Jordan Prentice) Half Pint (Mark Povinelli) Grum (Joe Gnoffo) Grimm (Danny Woodburn) Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno) Butcher (Martin Klebba) and Chuckles (Ronald Lee Clark) - are played by little people and represent the most interesting characters in the story. Instead of being miners (no ""Hi Ho Its off to Work We Go"" although I suppose Disney owns the copyright to the song anyway) theyre bandits. Snow White (Lily Collins) an exiled princess becomes their leader after shes offered their hospitality (such as it is) while seeking shelter in the dark forest. Meanwhile the Wicked Queen (Julia Roberts) who sent Snow into exile (because of the ""whos the fairest of them all"" nonsense) is plotting to marry Snows One True Love Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer). She wants his money and to win his hand she tells him Snow is dead and gives him a love potion. In a sense Mirror Mirror suffers from being a jack of all trades master of none. Its fantasy/adventure sequences which feature sword fights and a dragon-like monster are pedestrian and not the least bit engaging. Its romantic elements are stilted and unconvincing. Any drama is d.o.a. And the comedy is sporadic and often juvenile. Other than Singhs visual showiness theres not a lot here to captivate teenagers or adults. The movie works best with viewers between the ages of 8 and 11 mostly girls. The acting is adequate for the material. Lily (daughter of Phil) Collins making her first starring turn in a feature film is lithe and attractive but she doesnt leave much of an impression as the warrior/robber leader princess. Blame it on the sumptuous wardrobe which overshadows her. I suspect she may be like Ann Hathaway who blossomed as soon as she was allowed to move beyond the juvenilia that trapped her in her early career. Julia Roberts understands the tone - shes arch enough to be amusing but theres sufficient menace in her performance that it doesnt come across as excessively campy. Her asides during the otherwise boilerplate introductory narration which are delivered with the perfect tongue-in-cheek inflection represent some of Mirror Mirrors best writing. Armie Hammer gamely plays the ""damsel in distress"" role in reverse - he becomes ensorcelled needs rescuing and spends significant chunks of the movie half-naked. The actors playing the dwarves are all fine and do a good job with occasional Three Stooges mimicry but there are some differentiation issues - something that was never a problem with Snow Whites animated companions. Perhaps the overriding problem with Mirror Mirror is that it mines territory so overworked that theres nothing new or valuable to be found. Despite occasionally witty lines and eye-catching visual quirks (delivered in delightful 2-D) Mirror Mirror seems like the tired and recycled material it essentially is. The animated version is universally regarded as a treasure and a classic and it is still popular among children today. Theres no legitimate reason for a re-invention unless its to do something radical. But ""radical"" seems far from the minds of Singh and his screenwriters. If their intention was to provide a version of Snow White that will hold the attention of young school-age girls they have succeeded. If they were hoping for something more ambitious it didnt make the transition from idea to actuality. Mirror Mirror isnt bad cinema but its only worth the price of admission as a way to distract a child - and there are better options for that.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 29 2012 112 PM Title Mirror Mirror Film Info PG. At area theaters. In the God-awful Snow White family comedy update ""Mirror Mirror"" Julia Roberts as a nasty queen goes through a beauty ritual involving bee stings on her lips a bite from a scorpion putting burrs between her toes and smearing her face with bird poop. Thats a pretty close approximation of what its like to sit through the movie. This moronic mess -- which no one of any age will find funny -- hasnt a pinch of wit in its seemingly endless 95 minutes. Its charmless shoddily executed and will surely be explained away by Roberts as the kind of film actors do ""for their kids."" If thats so she shouldve done a better movie. The queen is an evil royal who hates her raven-haired stepdaughter the pure-as-snow Snow (Lily Collins). Years earlier Snows dad the King went missing in the woods. The princess now a teenager never leaves the castle -- until the day she sneaks out and finds Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) and a band of dwarf bandits with names like Wolf Butcher and Chuckles. (Disney owns the rights to Sleepy Happy and Doc.) Soon the queen is planning to make Alcott husband number four. So the slapsticky dwarfs adopt the pretty girl train her to fight and together they hatch a plot to save the prince -- who has swallowed a potion that makes him act like a puppy -- and defeat the queen. Director Tarsem Singh has a reputation as a ""visual stylist"" but that doesnt help ""Mirror Mirror"" where scary forests seem recycled from some high school theater production and the queens omniscient mirror lives in a kind-of wooden outhouse adrift in a Dali painting. One fight though with a huge magical marionette does feel like Tim Burton-lite. All the big goofy moments -- an ""Alice in Wonderland""-ish costume dance the transformation of the queens aide (a miserable-looking Nathan Lane) into a cockroach -- are as sluggish as the idiotic action scenes in which Phil Collins daughter and Armand Hammers great-grandson engage in smirky sword fights. Roberts has had exactly one high point (""Duplicity"") since winning her Oscar in 2000 and she acts here as if simply appearing in a floofy dress is high hilarity. Her ""playfulness"" seems like work and her cartoony maliciousness is dull. (Charlize Theron who plays the queen in this summers more serious ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" neednt fret.) They all likely fancied this thing to be the heir to winkingly winning live-action fairy tales like ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Enchanted."" Really they should be bashful that the film leaves more grumpy faces than happy ones. ""Dopey"" is too good a word for it.

TWITTER Julia Roberts Lily Collins and Armie Hammer star in this family fantasy comedy from director Tarsem Singh the first of two reworkings of the Snow White story due this year. NEW YORK - Wait has there been a mistake? The trailer for the upcoming Snow White and the Huntsman set in a macabre menacing fantasy world looks distinctly like something that might have sprung from the dark visual imagination of Tarsem Singh. But instead he somehow got attached to the other revisionist Snow White movie Mirror Mirror the campy comedic kid-friendly take on the Brothers Grimm classic that stuffs a period fairy tale full of winking contemporary humor. Its an unexpected pairing of director and material that is no less perplexing even after sitting through this mishmash. The marketing hook is Julia Roberts playing the evil Queen in a version of the story told from her characters point of view. Theres certainly pleasure to be had from her cruel delight in the misery of her subjects her insane vanity and her vicious scheming against the pure-of-heart Snow White (Lily Collins). The slyly self-mocking Roberts and a droll Nathan Lane as the Queens obsequious servant could do this kind of comedy in their sleep so some laughs are guaranteed. But the director displays zero feel for the farcical in a sluggish movie that starts out flat and rarely acquires momentum. Narrative storytelling is not Singhs strength. In The Cell and Immortals character and plotting come a distant second to the directors elaborate visual aesthetic. But old-fashioned storytelling skills are paramount in any fairy tale. PHOTOS First Look at Relativitys Snow White Project Mirror Mirror Mirror Mirror requires us to hiss at a villainess root for a heroine chuckle with her rowdy band of dwarfs and swoon for her handsome prince. Some of the under-12 audience might get with that program but its an effort. This is a movie drowning in flamboyant design elements and in need of a stiff shot of enchantment. Marc Klein and Jason Kellers wit-deprived screenplay from a story by Melisa Wallack aspires to the same school of fairy-tale irreverence as The Princess Bride Shrek and Enchanted. But those movies had heart. Among the key twists is the now-standard feminist switch that instead of riding along near the end to save Snow White the Prince himself gets saved by a kiss from the heroine who is far from defenseless. Theres also the usual serving of anachronistic dialogue and references such as that well-worn nod to focus groups. Living large in her grand castle on a rocky promontory while the commoners starve to pay her taxes the Queen is a gold-digger looking to replenish the royal fortune. She sees a solution to her financial woes when wealthy Prince Alcott (a game and occasionally shirtless Armie Hammer) stumbles into her kingdom. At first the Queen is merely irked by her stepdaughter but when Snow White catches the Princes eye irritation turns to rage and she orders her to be removed to the forest and executed. Unbeknownst to the Queen Snow White is spared and taken in by seven bandit dwarfs who teach her fighting skills. That prompts the Queen to dip into her dwindling reserves of magic - which she accesses by stepping through her mirror portal to what look mystifyingly like Tahitian thatched huts built on water - to enslave the Prince and eliminate Snow White. Part Jennifer Connelly and part Audrey Hepburn Collins (daughter of musician Phil Collins) is quite a beauty. But shes also a little bland playing the role as a modern girl who never really seems too threatened even when facing down the dreaded Beast a forest-dwelling terror with the head of a wolf crowned by antlers the tail of a giant reptile and the claws of a vulture. That fantastical creature is right in Singhs wheelhouse but the uneven CGI elements are so overwhelming that the characters are all but suffocated. From the lush fantasy landscape to the quaint village to the chilly forest this is an entirely set-bound artificial environment lacking in magic a shortfall that saturation use of Alan Menkens score tries to cover. There are stunning elements chief among them the magnificent costumes of Singhs regular collaborator the late Eiko Ishioka to whom the film is dedicated. But the whole thing lacks tonal cohesion lurching from Tim Burton-style comic grotesquerie to underpowered action set pieces to a gratuitously self-referential Bollywood production number on the end credits. The impression is that of a director constantly fighting to put his stamp on material thats foreign to him and unable to figure out what that stamp should be.

Early on in director Tarsem Singh Dhandwars retelling of the Snow White legend a prince mocks a dwarf ""Youre short and its funny."" ""Mirror Mirror"" alas is neither. Poised between revisionist fairy tale and smirking sendup this gaudy over-frosted cream puff of a movie half-heartedly positions its famous heroine as a dagger-wielding proto-feminist yet ultimately suffers the same fatal flaw as Julia Roberts evil queen It doesnt really care about anything except how pretty it looks. Bowing opposite strong fantasy-themed B.O. competition the family-friendly Relativity release should nonetheless capitalize on its accessible story elements marquee talent and distaff appeal. Set in a faraway kingdom where castles look like pastries and vice versa the picture is nothing if not a triumph of art direction; in scene after scene the filmmakers seem to be seeking new visual definitions for ""ornate"" ""opulent"" and ""gilded."" The lavish look will come as no surprise to devotees of Tarsem the delirious fantasist behind such oppressively gorgeous pictures as ""The Cell"" ""The Fall"" and last years ""Immortals."" Retaining most of his regular crew here the director was arguably a shrewd choice for the job capable of bringing his undeniable visual gifts to bear on a more familiar less self-indulgent story than hes previously tackled. Alas the script -- written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller from a screen story by Melisa Wallack with a hefty but uncredited assist from the Brothers Grimm -- is a mostly mirthless affair littered with stray amusements but more often bogged down by strained whimsy. Rife with anachronisms like ""agree to disagree"" ""I just need to process"" and in one particularly non-magical moment ""your tax dollars"" the film displays an unseemly delight in its own putative cleverness taking its tonal cues from the self-satisfied sneer worn by its reigning villain. That would be the queen (Roberts) she of the wobbly British accent whose arch once-upon-a-time narration fills viewers in on how she bewitched the king into marriage seized control of his dominion and locked away his beauteous daughter Snow White (Lily Collins). Long since widowed the vain queen has become a prowling cougar with romantic designs on the visiting Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer). But the handsome royal becomes smitten with the more age-appropriate Snow who flees into the nearby forest when the queen orders her death. In line with the films unsparingly hip politically correct girl-power sensibility Snows journey to happily ever after now involves mandatory weapons training and political activism. When the princess learns the queen and her loyal lackey (a game Nathan Lane) have been taxing the local villagers to death Snow not only comes to the towns rescue but in a ""Robin Hood""-style twist encourages her new friends the seven dwarfs to raid the queens treasury and give back to the poor which these pint-sized bandits manage by running around the forest on stilts. If 2007s ""Enchanted"" succeeded in skewering classic fairy tales specifically ""Snow White"" while retaining a winning earnestness at its core ""Mirror Mirror"" never musters the comic energy or emotional sincerity needed to refresh its well-worn story. The arbitrary developments that dominate the later reels in particular leave one feeling the script didnt command half as much creative decision-making time as say the precise curvature of the queens oyster-shell-like throne to name but one particular of Tom Fodens painstaking production design. This slack hesitant quality also emerges where it counts most in Roberts performance. While the actress clearly relishes the opportunity to play mean for a change shes less a memorably ruthless baddie than a figure of mildly supercilious comedy a tactic that largely fizzles along with much of the films intended humor with the exception of one tightly cut wickedly funny sequence detailing the queens insect-heavy beauty treatments. Initially polite and demure only to manifest a fierce spunky integrity later on Collins animates her pale-skinned raven-haired archetype with grace and poise while Hammers cocky but lovable prince proves rather too willing to sacrifice his dignity as needed. (One running gag involves the prince forever losing his shirt bearing out the auteurial signature Tarsem established with the bulging male torsos of ""Immortals"" and ""The Fall."") Though stuck with fairly routine peanut-gallery bickering the seven actors cast as the dwarfs make an endearing comic team with Danny Woodburn Martin Klebba and Mark Povinelli among the standouts. Full of snowbound landscapes seen to glossy advantage in d.p. Brendan Galvins well-composed images the effects-heavy production conjures little magic or excitement in its action-driven setpieces as when Snow does battle with a bargain-basement Jabberwocky. The sumptuous and elaborate outfits which include a white swan headdress that would make Bjork molt with envy rep the final film creations of Oscar-winning costume designer and longtime Tarsem collaborator Eiko Ishioka who died in January.

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 29 March 2012 1139 AM Updated 29 March 2012 1248 PM Related Highland Parks Armie Hammer comes to big screen again this time with Julia Roberts in ""Mirror Mirror"" The old Rocky and Bullwinkle Show had a delightful feature called ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" in which various standards of the Prince Charming and fairy-godmother catalogue were skewered with bad puns and the like. More recently the Shrek franchise made a mint poking the notion of living happily ever after with a stick.Now its Mirror Mirrors turn but sadly the results arent so much a fracture as an annoying sprain. Later in the year well get an action heroine take on the Grimm Brothers Snow White fable in Snow White and the Huntsman.Mirror Mirror by contrast is the irreverent caustic but sentimental version complete with wisecracking dwarves a gold-digging evil queen (Julia Roberts) and a digital-effects wonderland crafted by director Tarsem Singh who previously showed his CGI bona fides with the likes of The Cell and The Fall.I suppose we should be glad Mirror Mirror at least looks cool given how tone-deaf the rest of the enterprise comes across. You know the basics vain queen determined to remain the fairest of them all terrorizes stepdaughter (played here by Lily Collins daughter of Phil).Mirror takes some liberties with the rest though the prince (former Highland Park resident Armie Hammer) and the little fellas are still on hand to provide forced humor and yes true romance.Theres no center to Mirror Mirror no sense that anyone involved knew what exactly what they were shooting for.Roberts playing the queen in high-snark mode isnt to blame aside from the mistake of lending her talents to the project in the first place.Nathan Lane as the court lackey Brighton is one of those guys who cant help but be at least a little funny every time he opens his mouth; hes a welcome presence here.Maybe its just that he seems to know what movie hes in an awareness sorely lacking everywhere else Mirror turns.Good for a chuckle every now and then its ultimately a disenchanting and empty spectacle.MIRROR MIRRORC- Directed by Tarsem Singh.

Mirror Mirror Fair Director Tarsem Singh. Cast Lily Collins Julia Roberts Armie Hammer. Rating PG for some fantasy action and mild rude humor. The story is so intriguing in fact that two movies based on it will come out this year. ""Mirror Mirror"" directed by Tarsem Singh is the first of those. And although its not the terrible misfire that it might have been -- a game winning cast sees to that -- it does nothing to prevent you from looking forward to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" due in June. Qamp;A Armie Hammer 10 classic or twisted fairy tale films The story in question concerns a young woman named Snow White -- perhaps you have heard of her. As you probably know she suffers under the stewardship of a vain jealous stepmother usually a queen whose personality is often summed up with the one-word description ""wicked."" So wicked in fact that she not only wishes Snow White dead once the girl becomes the fairest of them all outpacing said evil stepmother but actually acts on her wish ordering an underling to carry out the deed. It doesnt happen and Snow White seeks refuge with seven dwarfs in the forest. Versions differ but in most the happily-ever-after ending is assured. And usually we get all the great fairy-tale standbys -- a poisoned apple a talking mirror and most importantly true loves kiss. ""Mirror Mirror"" has all that stuff only in different contexts. And it has Lily Collins and Armie Hammer as well to say nothing of Julia Roberts chewing scenery as if she hadnt been fed in months. Good thing because as reinventions of fairy tales go this one has some pretty big holes. Not all of the twists on the story work but for the most part its well-meaning goofy good fun. Snow (Collins) -- yes thats what shes called and it sounds as awkward as it does when you read it -- still mourns the death of her father the king (Sean Bean) long disappeared. As well she might -- her stepmother the queen (Roberts) keeps her cooped up in the castle all the time telling her what a loser she is. The queen meanwhile busies herself with spending all of the kingdoms money sending all its people into poverty to pay for her lavish parties. But as Snow grows older she grows restless and the queen grows jealous. Things come to a head between them when a rather dopey fellow Prince Alcott (Hammer) stumbles into the kingdom. Hes hapless but rich -- and he and Snow are attracted to each other. This is too much for the queen who orders her chief stooge Brighton (Nathan Lane) to kill Snow. He cant and he lets Snow go bringing back animal entrails as proof to fool the queen. Snow meanwhile comes across the home in the forest of seven small men. They dont have the Disney names -- no Grumpy no Sneezy no Dopey -- and they are in fact rebels mercenaries which is how Prince Alcott meets them when they attack him. And thats not the only twist. In this telling of the story Snow becomes a sort of feminist warrior despite as Prince Alcott notes how well the charming-prince-saves-the-day plot line tests with audiences. Thats just one of many self-referential winks and nods some of which are funny some of which are just kind of silly. The whole film is hit-and-miss like that. For every funny gag there is Roberts moaning into an alternate mirror-housed version of herself. But Hammer has fun as Prince Alcott especially when he thinks hes a dog (dont ask) and Collins makes Snow spunky worth rooting for. Will audiences leave happily ever after? Well not unhappily exactly. But if this were the only telling of the Snow White story the tale would have been forgotten long ago. So on to the next one.

(AP Photo/Relativity Media Jan Thijs)-- AP+Read Caption In this image released by Relativity Media Julia Roberts left and Nathan Lane are shown in a scene from Relativity Medias ""Mirror Mirror"" opening March 16 2012. (AP Photo/Relativity Media Jan Thijs) / APShare Photo Julia Roberts chews up the scenery and spits it back out again with great brio in her first truly villainous role as the evil Queen in ""Mirror Mirror."" And oh what scenery it is. After all this is a film from Tarsem Singh director of such spectacular spectaculars as the trippy ""The Cell"" and last years dreary ""Immortals."" Basically the scenery IS the movie - and the costumes of course from the late Eiko Ishioka. They dominate every moment of this cheeky heavily tweaked version of ""Snow White"" but at least theyre a marvel to watch. Theyd better be because the dialogue and the action are for the most part rather dull and weirdly devoid of energy. This anachronistic genre-hopping fairy tale - I swear theres a ""George of the Jungle"" joke at one point - comes from screenwriters Marc Klein and Jason Keller from a story by Melisa Wallack. It begins with the beautiful innocent Snow White (Lily Collins daughter of Phil) whos just turned 18 trapped in her bedroom in a castle perched high on a precipitous cliff. Her father the King (Sean Bean) set off into the woods one day long ago and is presumed dead; her stepmother the Queen has taken over the kingdom and tyrannically transformed a place that was once merry into a wasteland of poverty and strife. The Queens right-hand man is the butt-kissing Brighton (Nathan Lane) who keeps trying to tell her shes broke but she wont listen. All she cares about is her status as the fairest of them all which she reinforces by visiting a mirror housed in a thatched hut hidden dramatically in the middle of a dark isolated lake. (That Tarsem is an imaginative dude we cannot deny that.) But fortunately into her kingdom comes the young gorgeous single and (more importantly) wealthy Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer in a perfect bit of casting; he seems game to make fun of his all-American good looks). The Queen tries to woo him with a lavish ball but the Prince only has eyes for Snow whom hed encountered briefly in the forest earlier that day when neither of them realized the other was you know royal. (The wedding she plans for him looks like something that could take place in the Capitol of ""The Hunger Games"" with its foppish guests dressed in garishly colorful over-the-top costumes and makeup.) When the Queen tries to have Snow killed out of jealousy the young beauty escapes and makes a new home with the Seven Dwarves who get actual back stories and some of the films funnier lines. None of them is named Dopey or Doc but they do give Snow a tough-girl makeover complete with the obligatory training montage. Collins has a lovely screen presence - shes got this young Audrey Hepburn thing going - but she lacks a certain oomph even after her character has learned to fight and supposedly found her inner strength. Roberts rules her at every turn even when she flashes that iconic smile in cruel fashion. She seems to be reveling in playing a role thats such a departure; that sense of joy only sporadically finds its way to the rest of the film.
