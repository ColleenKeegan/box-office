With the recent rash of urban dance films like Step Up the genre is ripe for mocking. But this steers clear of smart observational comedy and goes for gross-out every time. Megan is a white dancer who learns street moves from African-American Thomas. Dance battles and romance follow but this is really just a series of spoof sketches. If it had stuck to a Save the Last Dance template it might have had a chance but it throws in too many random references Crash Ray Twilight Juno...Theres a glimpse of socially aware humour in its take on street culture (Thomas pretends hes giving Megan directions when black girls walk past). But most of the comedy involves exaggerated pratfalls and puerile sex gags. That theres a teacher called Ms Cameltoe says it all.

I thought it was worth watching because me and my friend just made fun of it and laughed the whole time especially when they did the spoof of the song and movie FAME because I was in the show Fame it made it even funnier.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2009RoryFeaturedNeither. I am Damien Wayans No really it was a terrible film not even worth one starFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 23 2009MattFeaturedThis film really truly is a monster pile of canine excrement. Please do not waste your time or money on this absolutely terrible drivel. After watching this film I actually felt violated. I still feel violated. I cannot believe that the sweet-looking cashier actually let me pay for a ticket to see this horrendous rubbish. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a strong contender for the single most appalling movie ever made. ... I am not of a politically correct persuasion. I will happily laugh at sexist homophobic and mildly racist jokes and associate with sexist moderately homophobic mildly racist people. But the overwhelming majority of the purported jokes in this film basically consist of nothing more than poking fun at fat people gays lesbians blacks interracial dating and even a blind guy in a way which completely fails to reach even the lowest bar for any kind of humour to be actually funny. The hilarity of this supposed humour reaches such heights as a fat man wanting a slice of pie a black man being an absentee father and a girl committing suicide. Yes its that funny. And as if that werent bad enough you get the same abysmally misjudged ""comedy"" repeated again and again - yes I do mean that they reuse virtually the same identical gags in the space of a single film. (E.g. the absentee father gags and the fat man food gags which just keep on coming.) This film is not even worth watching for the dancing which is just made ridiculous by totally over the top stupid special effects which wouldnt even work in a cartoon for children let alone a film which is so grotesque that I would never let a child near it. Of the so-called jokes which consist of something other than a hugely crass play on a stereotype of some kind (with no original humour to back it up whatsoever) the majority are of the ""oh she got hit by a car isnt that funny"" variety. In other words they are just utterly pointless. ... This film made me feel very sad for the human race that there are actually people out there who can and will put a film together which sucks as badly as this one and there are more people who will put it on in the cinema. I wouldnt mind the no doubt supposedly ironic racism if the film were actually funny. For the record the purported irony does not come across at all. The film basically seems to be making purely racist homophobic statements on the assumption that merely making those statements will make the film funny. They missed the vital ingredient in this equation- actual humour. This film has very very scant comedy value. ... In the interests of a completely fair review I will confess that on a small number of occasions I did laugh mostly rather feebly at some of the infantile gags that this atrocious execrable waste of screen time inflicts upon the audience. Mostly that was near the beginning of the film before I realised quite how utterly dreadful this ludicrous excuse for a movie is. ... Being as un-PC as I am I can stomach the racism and homophobia which this film is built on. But what I find truly repugnant is the way that this film cheapens other much better films (e.g. Twilight and some film about dancing or ballet that I remember seeing once) with its utterly uninspired references to them. How dare the makers of this steaming pile of horse manure associate actual proper films with it by including these references?? ... I would have left the film early due to sheer boredom at its pathetic attempts at humour if I had not been stuck waiting for a friend 140 miles from home. Everyone who is in any way associated with this film and cannot prove that they were utterly desperate for cash should be banned from ever working in anything associated with entertainment ever again. This film is beyond dire. It is quite possibly the worst thing that I have ever seen and I have seen some pretty bad films. I wish I had not seen it. I feel as if by giving over my money for a ticket to see this film I was allowing myself to be robbed. Do not see this film. You will have more fun sitting in your livingroom looking at the wallpaper and I really really do mean that. Even if you are a racist sexist homophobic eugenicist bigot you will hate this film. It has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It does not even deserve the single star I have to give it to count as rating it. Watching it is simply torture. Really honestly truly do not bother. Thats 83 excruciating minutes of your life which you will never get back.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87213/dance-flick.html,200,danceflick0,danceflick,timeout

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Wayans clan peaked with their 1988 blaxploitation parody Im Gonna Git You Sucka. Their 2000 hit Scary Movie a parody of umm scary movies begat a series of even broader lamer send-ups that the Wayans had nothing to do with (Epic Movie Date Movie Disaster Movie et al.). Their new spoof of umm dance flicks almost seems laudable in comparison. Directed by next-gen newcomer Damien Dante Wayans and co-written with uncles Keenen Ivory Shawn Marlon and cousin Craig the movie merges the plot of Save the Last Dance--former ballerina and Juilliard hopeful distraught by her mothers tragic car accident discovers street dancing and interracial romance at an inner-city school--with boob fart and ghetto jokes. Shoshana Bush heads up a cast that includes Wayanses young and old (Damon Jr. as her love interest his father as a loan shark in a fatsuit) but comically and literally Bush is a pale imitation of Anna Faris. The gags themselves only marginally work when they stick to silly non sequitur; the random movie references are forced and flat and the take-offs of Dreamgirls and Fame songs would make ""Weird Al"" groan. Better than nothing Amy Sedaris steals it as Ms. Cameltoe a wicked teacher who beatboxes with her bulbous vagina. Yes its rated PG-13 except its also inappropriate for anyone over 13.

Imagine the face I made ""Home Alone"" meets Edvard Munch. Craig Damien and their uncles Keenen Ivory Shawn and Marlon Wayans are credited with the script for this grade-school parody of ""Save the Last Dance"" ""Step Up"" ""Stomp the Yard"" etc. Previously the senior Wayanses gave us the ""Scary Movie"" series and ""White Chicks."" Let us just say that they have taught the next generation everything they know. ""Dance Flick"" puts the oof in spoof. A break dancer spinning around on his skull until he drills through the floor? Oof. A gangster in a fat suit who demands ""my piece of the pie"" and is handed a piece of pie? Oof. Lady dancers who bust moves so fierce that their breasts detach? Oof. If there exists anyone in the comedy business less funny than the Wayans clan its Amy Sedaris so shes here too doing a dance teacher called ""Ms. Cameltoe."" Guess whats noticeable about her? I shuddered to think of the innocent camel who must have given his hoof for this costume. A ""High School Musical"" joke consists of a Zac Efron type (whose basketball teammates are named ""Peter"" ""Knob"" and ""Weiner"") singing a song about how gay he is in pink tights to the tune of ""Fame."" A would-be showstopper features the fat-suit guy singing ""And Im Telling You My Bellys Growlin."" And a ballerina breaks wind. Occasionally characters dressed up like Tracy Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" and Ray Charles in ""Ray"" pop up not that they have much to do although Ray does fall through an open manhole. By far the funniest part of the ""Dance Flick"" experience was the press notes in which I found out that supporting actor Affion Crockett is ""a modern-day Sammy Davis Jr."" ""the next Jim Carrey"" and ""surely an entertainer to watch for. Stay tuned for Affion Crockett a k a Oskamill for he has only just begun."" If you say so Oskamill. Keenen by contrast is ""an entertainment renaissance man who has built a Hollywood empire"" while Damien ""has taken full advantage of the knowledge bestowed upon him by the brilliant Wayans brothers and is now blazing his own trail through Hollywood."" His family is ""legendary."" Like the Bourbons? Look what happened to them. Im just sayin. Meanwhile Damon Jr. ""followed in his fathers comedic footsteps and braved the world of stand-up comedy under the pseudonym Kyle Green"" and ""later performed in the series My Wife and Kids and landed a job as a staff writer on the series becoming at age 20 the youngest staff writer in television."" Was he still using the pseudonym? Did it fool his father the shows co-creator? kyle.Smithnypost.com DANCE FLICK Zero stars Damonically awful. Running time 80 minutes.

"Movie Review The Wayans Brothers Spoof ADance Flick washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Movie Review The Wayans Brothers Spoof ADance Flick VideoDance FlickA parody of dance movies from the Wayans family. Video by MTV Films>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Monica Hesse Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 22 2009 A new-classic barometer for a film genres clichedness is whether the Wayans brothers have made a spoof of it. Thats how we ended up with ""Scary Movie"" (I II III and IV) and thats how we ended up with Wayans wannabes ""Date Movie"" ""Epic Movie"" and ""Disaster Movie"" and thats how we end up today with the Wayanses ""Dance Flick"" which is different from the other films because it ends in ""Flick"" not ""Movie."" This StoryWayans Brothers Spoof They Did It AgainDance FlickFind Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story In the genre being lampooned here for those without TBS a white girls love for an ethnic or poor guy helps her score a scholarship to Juilliard and helps him become a caricature. Needless to say the concept has been wearing a big bulls-eye for a while now. ""Dance Flicks"" ingenue is Megan played by Shoshana Bush a subscriber to Stuck Up Diva magazine who ""used to dance -- in the suburbs"" until her moms freak death caused her to hang up the toe shoes and move into her dads urban rathole. Newly enrolled in Musical High Megan meets krumping Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.) and his sassy sister Charity. Can they help Megan get her groove back? Nah -- that would be a whole other spoof in 30 years (""Perimenopausal Movie""). What they can do is maneuver her through a sequence of loosely joined sketches based on ""Save the Last Dance"" ""Save the Last Dance 2 Stepping Up"" ""Step Up"" ""Step Up 2 The Streets"" and other random filler movies that have nothing to do with dance whatsoever like ""Ray"" and ""Twilight."" There are two dance-offs multiple fat jokes and one sight gag using eye boogers a heretofore ignored bodily fluid. These are the highlights. In a perfect cineworld ""Dance Flick"" helmed by Damien Wayans would slyly subvert its lampooned targets. It would find humor in exploiting and then dashing audience expectations. This is what happened in ""Airplane"" and in at least the first of the ""Naked Gun"" movies. But thats not what the Wayans spoofs of the past decade or any of the knock-offs have ever been about. These parodies are less into satirizing other films and more into just mashing them together -- either directly referencing the funniest parts or adding poop to them. Sometimes this has worked really well. The original ""Scary Movie"" pulled material from everything from ""Scream"" to ""The Matrix"" to ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- movies differing enough in content and style that ""Scary Movie"" managed to be fresh even in its familiarity helped along by the vacuous comedic genius of Anna Faris. That freshness is absent in ""Dance Flick"" -- but that might be less the fault of the Wayans brothers than the source material they had to draw from. Dance movies are not wildly different in content and style. They are all about urban vs. suburban grit vs. polish bulimic vs. only slightly bulimic. The plot(s?) are such that if you accidentally sat on the remote in the middle of watching ""Step Up"" you probably wouldnt notice when you caught the end of ""Stomp the Yard"" instead. The films already spoof themselves. This means that ""Dance Flick"" must essentially be a parody of a parody a clone of a clone of a clone. The jokes here arent just low-hanging fruit they are fruit lazily taken out of the moldy pile like when Charitys baby-daddy gives alcohol to their son or when a leotard-wearing male character breaks into a song with the lyrics ""Gay I will love men forever I will always love guys"" To be fair Wednesdays advance audience was howling during this song. Bush is no Anna Faris but she does what she can for a part that mostly requires her to do nothing (not even dance). Wayans Jr. is a genuinely gifted physical comedian regularly salvaging laughs from groans -- just wait for the roller-skating scene. Dumb references aside the most terrifying possibility for ""Dance Flick"" is that you wont be able to tell whether the movie is making them or whether youve just wandered into ""Step Up 3 Stepping Up to the Next Step."" As the theater emptied after the advance screening one under-informed audience member turned to his date and remarked ""That was kind of like that other dance movie we saw."" ""Yeah"" she replied looking concerned. ""Thats because this was a parody of dance movies."" ""Oh"" he said. Exactly. Dance Flick (83 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout and language. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Wayans Brothers Spoof They Did It Again Find Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Dance Flick",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/21/AR2009052104137.html,200,danceflick4,danceflick,washingtonpost

But too often it stumbles clumsily into bad taste. In music and dance -- and comedy -- so much revolves around timing. And thats often where Dance Flick trips up. Some segments in the rowdy spoof stretch too long while others are underdeveloped. The target for this Wayans brothers satire turns out to be bigger than dance-themed movies. Though the jokes mostly poke fun at Step Up Stomp the Yard You Got Served and Save the Last Dance the film also ribs Little Miss Sunshine High School Musical Hairspray Twilight and Fame. And those send-ups (often in combination) are among the funniest. Brennan Hillard does a comical gay version of Zac Efrons Troy character from HSM-- riffing on Fame via a song-and-dance number. But the main focus is on Damon Wayans Jr.s Thomas Uncles (you can see where thats going) a street dancer who dreams of being a doctor. Hes engaging and funny while Shoshana Bush as his dance partner Megan White a takeoff on the Julia Stiles character in Save the Last Dance has less humorous moments. The characters hit or miss. One big miss -- and easily the most offensive -- is Amy Sedariss nasty Ms. Cameltoe who insults her dance class in a manner that is initially shocking then drags on tediously. Other characters also suffer from overkill including Marlon Wayans drama instructor. His extreme depiction of a groveling man picking cotton -- in a classroom illustration of integrity -- drove two people at my screening to leave. David Alan Griers loan shark Sugar Bear is beyond morbidly obese and the accumulation of fat jokes thud resoundingly. Dance Flick does offer a reasonable share of silly laugh-worthy one-liners and gags. But like the Wayans other productions (White Chicks and the Scary Movie series) youll have to wince your way through the excesses to find them.

Dance Flick Tripped up by Wayans overload | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentDance Flick Tripped up by Wayans overloadIs Dance Flick a spoof of gotta-dance films or simply a job creation project for the next generation of the burgeoning Wayans clan?The unfunny Dance Flick is tutu much writes Bruce DeMara.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. May 22 2009(out of 4)Starring Damon Wayans Jr. and Shoshana Bush. Directed by Damien Dante Wayans. 83 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Is Dance Flick a spoof of gotta-dance films or simply a job creation project for the next generation of the burgeoning Wayans clan?The answer is both.What it isnt is subtle smart or particularly funny.Article Continued BelowNot that one expects anything but gross-out stunts and tasteless-to-the-max humour from the same people who brought you the first couple of Scary Movies Little Man and White Chicks (and now - shudder - their kids). Its too bad because the concept of gleefully sending up a cluster of similarly-themed films is a sound one. But the execution in this case is simply wretched.No fewer than eight members of Wayans bunch show up in the acting credits. Five of them who share writing credits also show up on an inexplicably long list of producers.In this case too many Wayans spoils the broth starting with director/writer/co-executive producer Damien Dante Wayans who is clearly way in over his head.The plot about a white girl and a black guy who find romance while attending Musical High School (get it?) is paper-thin to begin with.But young Wayans manages to make its slightness even more apparent with a jerky jumpy style that is jarring and annoying in the extreme.There are too many send-ups of Flashdance Save the Last Dance High School Musical Twilight Dream Girls Hairspray etc. and digs at Hollywood celebs like Britney Spears Lindsay Lohan and Zac Efron (who is skewered in a particularly nasty fashion) and not enough effort put into creating a coherent story with a hint of actual romance and a smidgen of dramatic tension.In Living Color alumnus David Alan Grier has some amusing moments in a fat suit as gangsta Sugar Bear and theres also an occasional titter here and there at the expense of hip hop/dance culture. (A break dancer who manages to get his head up his own ass is mildly diverting.)But too much of Dance Flick aims and lands well below the belt though oddly there isnt one swear word in the whole appalling mess possibly to ensure a 14A rating and a steady flow of teenagers.One departs from seeing this flick with the fervent hope that it is the Wayanss last dance movie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Essence Atkins and Shawn Wayans take to the dance floor in Dance Flick. Photo Glen Wilson  Associated Press Dance Flick 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In the first minute of Dance Flick one character urinates on his rival. Less than 15 seconds later another dudes head literally gets stuck up his own rear end. What does it say about the latest Wayans production that the film actually goes downhill from there? Dance Flick is a movie that will make you yearn for the subtle humor and profound character exploration of White Chicks. The parody once again takes a quasi-Airplane approach attempting to make fun of dance films and musicals -- everything from You Got Served to Hairspray. It does this mostly by taking an iconic scene from one of those movies and adding 1. A gay joke; 2. A black stereotype; or 3. A random bodily function. Shoshana Bush and Damon Wayans Jr. play Megan and Thomas who attend a Fame-like school and the best gags in Dance Flick are definitely in the beginning. The demise of Megans mom is covered with some dated but effective humor that mirrors a scene in Crash . The film which is directed by Wayans nephew Damien Dante Wayans mixes in the new generation of the family with the old. Youd think this would add some life to the franchise but it doesnt. Its surprising how dated some of the humor is -- particularly considering the last-minute pop-culture references the Wayans brothers were able to sneak into the Scary Movie franchise. Jokes about high gas prices Wesley Snipes tax problems and the poor driving of Britney Spears all seem so 2008.

Dance Flick. (PG-13) Paramount (83 min.). Directed by Damien Dante Wayans. With Shoshana Bush and everybody in the world named Wayans. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR. Were lucky enough to live in an age when products that can be hazardous to your health come with warning labels. Like the cigarette pack that tells you of cancer risks. Or the box of flu pills that advises you not to operate heavy machinery. Or the radio ads for ""Dance Flick"" that announce ""From the creators of White Chicks and Little Man."" So dont say you havent been warned. On the off chance that you liked those films -- the first of which starred Shawn and Marlon Wayans in drag and whiteface and the second of which starred Marlon Wayans as a dwarf in diapers -- theres a good chance ""Dance Flick"" is for you. And you can have it. This time though Shawn Marlon Keenan Damon and various other assorted Wayanses have contented themselves with supporting parts and behind-the-camera duties. The director is Damien Dante Wayans; the lead is Damon Wayans Jr. Yes the torch has passed to a new generation. Unfortunately this group of nephews sons and cousins isnt as talented as its forebears (who were truly funny in the old ""In Living Color"" TV show -- although that family project more and more seems to owe some serious credit to David Allen Grier and Jim Carrey.) The latest Wayans film -- like their ""Scary Movie"" franchise -- is just an excuse for a lot of genre gags. But unlike ""Airplane"" say or the Mel Brooks spoofs the Wayans have no interest in weaving them into a single sturdy story -- they just throw things at the screen and see what sticks. Not-so-topical gags about Halle Berrys hit-and-run or Lindsay Lohans wild nights? Sure. Glittery vampires and the prom from ""Twilight""? OK yeah whatever. Plus of course as many dirty jokes as you can possibly cram into a PG-13 movie (which it turns out is quite a lot). The most discernible of the many vague plots has Damon Wayans Jr. as a gangsta-threatened high school hip-hop star hooking up with the terribly dull Shoshana Bush a white transfer student with a tragic past. Can they find love -- and win the big dance-off? Oh what do you think? What you will definitely think half an hour or so into this is that youve already seen most of the jokes in the films trailer. And that the entire Wayans clan clearly thinks the two funniest subjects in the world are gay people and vaginas. Theyre not necessarily at least not without some new material. But the Wayanses still like gross-out slapstick and tired references. The movie that this is most pattered after Julia Stiles ""Save the Last Dance"" was made eight years ago. There are a few fresher better targets. The brothers tired gays-are-silly jokes at least find a real target in the subtext of the squeaky-clean ""High School Musical."" And a few jokes about the social perils of interracial dating hint at a sharper smarter comedy. But then they cut to a gag making fun of .. the teenage Ray Charles. And more you-go-girlfriend talk from the very hard working and terribly underserved Essence Atkins as a teen mom with attitude. I am sure the Wayans are a close-knit loving and ambitious group. I would lay money that their birthday barbecues or family-reunion picnics are truly hysterical -- after a few drinks. But their movies need warning labels -- like ""May cause forced smiles and extended wincing."" Rating note The film contains strong language sexual situations graphic sexual humor and underage drinking. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It would be hard to imagine a film with less going for it than Dance Flick. It is after all a Wayans brothers (yuck) spoof movie (double yuck) about dancing teenagers (blech) starring a second-generation Wayans (Damon Wayans Jr.) directed by a lesser Wayans (Damien) and rife with look-alikes riffing on characters from Hairspray Ray High School Musical and Step Up. Oh and it has David Alan Grier in what appears to be one of Arsenio Halls discarded fat suits from his Chunky A days. Every element of the film seems designed to lower expectations. The filmmakers have set the bar so low that they almost cant help but succeed. Flick casts newcomer Shoshana Bush as a sturdy dance-movie archetype the wide-eyed dreamer whose goal of studying classical dance at Julliard seemingly perished in the accident that killed her mother. Bush moves in with father Chris Elliott and discovers the electricity and excitement of street dancing while romancing a young man (Damon Wayans Jr.) torn between his love of dance his dreams of becoming a doctor and his thuggish best friend. Though the Wayans name is now synonymous with scatological spoofery at its most soul-crushing Dance Flick co-writer and co-star Keenen Ivory Wayans once played a big role in clever spoofs like Hollywood Shuffle Im Gonna Git You Sucka and Dont Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood. At its best Flick resurrects the impish spirit of Keenens early parodies and it helps that the dance-movie genre offers a ridiculous abundance of mothballed conventions to satirize. Dance Flicks hit-to-miss ratio isnt particularly high and it leans heavily on pop-culture-reference-as-punchline comedy and people-falling-down gags but it maintains a genial tone throughout and the dancing is fun. Dance Flick benefits from low expectations but it also requires them. Only in the Wayans-brothers universe would ""surprisingly not terrible"" almost qualify as a ringing endorsement.

"Dance Flick | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dance-flick ) Dance Flick (United States 2009) May 21 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the tired world of genre parodies where Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have become the ""go-to guys"" Dance Flick manages the seemingly impossible feat of actually generating some big laughs. It doesnt do much else but for a movie of this sort anything beyond forcing a reviewer to look up synonyms for ""boring"" ""pointless"" and ""unfunny"" is an accomplishment. Of course the lack of any involvement by the Friedberg/Seltzer team has something to do with this. Dance Flick is the product of the Wayans Family (so many of them are involved in one capacity or another that its unfair to single them out by name) who are relentless in their pursuit of humor much of which is bawdy in bad taste and/or politically incorrect. The film pushes the PG-13 envelope to its breaking point. Dance Flick is an equal opportunity offender. When it sees a target it ridicules it - sometimes effectively more often not. A lot of the jokes dont work and as is often the case with failed comedy those duds which come a little too frequently for comfort make the viewer feel vaguely embarrassed for those who are involved. But Dance Flick also hits big on more than one occasion. The best bits in this film fall short of being inspired but they are outrageous. The production as a whole feels very much like a contemporary episode of Saturday Night Live an uneven collection of loosely connected variably clever comedy sketches. Dance Flick doesnt follow a baseline story. Instead it loosely cobbles together elements from nearly every imaginable dance movie running the gamut from Fame to Step Up 2 the Streets. If you can think of it the Wayans probably did as well and there will be something in here. The satirical elements arent restricted to dance movies. For example arguably the films biggest failed gag comes at the expense of Twilight (and occurs right after a not-very-clever nod to Titanic). Its evident that the way this movie was assembled was for the writers to throw out ideas that might be funny without any concern for whether they could be fit into the framework of the movie. Thats why Dance Flick feels more like a series of skits than a coherent parody. I was reminded of (of all things) Amazon Women on the Moon a sketch movie that featured spectacular highs and even more spectacular lows. The same thing occurs here. To the extent that there is a plot it revolves around a white ex-dancer named Megan (Shoshana Bush) whos a newcomer to Musical High School and Thomas Uncle (Damon Wayans Jr.) a black hip-hop artist who needs a crew so he can win at The Streets and earn the 5000 he needs to pay back gangster Sugar Bear (David Allen Grier). Sugar Bear is literally larger than life - he looks like a cross between Fat Bastard and Mr. Creosote. Of course Megan and Thomas hook up and become a team and Thomas helps Megan overcome her reluctance about dancing. When it comes to taking no prisoners in satires the master is Keenan Ivory Wayans whose Im Gonna Git You Sucka did for Blaxploitation what Dance Flick tries to do for dance movies and whose Scary Movie was even more perversely funny and raunchy than Sucka. His input is evident here as is his influence on his nephew Damien who is credited as Dance Flicks director (although by all accounts this was a Wayans ensemble effort across the board). Those who remember the TV show In Living Color which was produced by the Wayans clan will see some similarities here although it could be argued that the scattershot Dance Flick is less structured than the television program. Its tough to apply a standard rating to a movie like Dance Flick because despite doing what it sets out to do and providing some hearty laughs its not a fulfilling 83 minutes. There are times when it drags and even with such a skinny running time it feels overlong. Maybe the root of the problem is that genre parodies have been so played out that they no longer carry much interest and when it comes to dance films some of the worst exist as self-parodies in their own right. So if your interest is solely in blowing off 90 minutes and having a few good laughs in the process Dance Flick exists to scratch an itch. Otherwise this is better avoided or at least deferred until it has entered into the less demanding home video market.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 21 2009 412 PM Title Dance Flick Teen-musical spoof about a hip-hop dancer and a ballerina. With Damon Wayans Jr. Directed by Damien Dante Wayans. (123) PG-13 Crude humor. At area theaters.Theres an art to making a good spoof but good luck finding it in ""Dance Flick"" not only because the movie goes for easy toilet humor but because it often relies on it to stay afloat.Five Wayans wrote it and their style isnt studious; they stitch together patchwork parodies (pick a ""Scary Movie"" any ""Scary Movie"") and just let things roll.So ""Dance Flick"" mainly riffs on recent movie musicals though a few targets were made when the newer Wayanses were still in diapers. Theres also a tacked-on ""Twilight"" joke to seem current.When uptight ballerina Megan (Shoshana Bush) enrolls in a high school of the arts she falls for Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.) who competes in ""street"" dance battles. Thomas owes money to a sweet-toothed Jabba the Hutt-sized gangsta named Sugar (David Alan Grier) and must dance-duel to win cash. ""Hairspray"" Zac Efron and ""Step Up"" are jabbed at mostly with uninspired sight gags.Some of those like Amy Sedaris crotchety teacher feel like pale echoes from the great ""In Living Color."" But Griers fat suit is an all right sight gag though his parody song from ""Dreamgirls"" like a similar goof from 1980s ""Fame"" isnt written well enough to be funny. Marlon Wayans is smirk-inducing as a dramatic drama teacher and Keenen Ivory Wayans shows up as a toothy MC. Keenen Marlon Shawn (pretty funny as a brusque baby daddy) and cousin Craig jotted down the script with their nephew Damien Dante Wayans who directed.As has been said of these kinds of things if you dont like a joke therell be another soon. So when Megans mom is run over license plates tell us Britney and Brandy did it. Fresh? No. But more are coming. Its the Wayans way.

In perhaps the surest sign the teen hot-to-trot pic is played out the Wayans brothers ""Dance Flick"" takes on such easy targets as ""High School Musical"" and ""Step Up"" films that dont take themselves seriously enough to suffer from such mockery in the first place. This slapstick and scatological spoof settles for obvious punchlines delivering just enough laughs to justify its existence without coming anywhere near the bar set by ""Scary Movie."" The clumsy result is what the teen target aud might call a ""dance fail"" with lower returns in store than either dance films or Wayans pics typically enjoy. As the five credited Wayans writers are clever enough to recognize the dance subgenre is Hollywoods favorite place to endorse cross-cultural romances a trend thats ripe for the familys black-centric sense of humor. From the Jets vs. Sharks-style pairing of ""Save the Last Dance"" to the colorblind multicultural ensembles featured in Disney fare such pics love to mix and match characters from every side of the tracks black and white rich and poor classical ballet and street dancers. ""Dance Flick"" uses them all at once pairing a brokenhearted Juilliard reject (Shoshana Bush) and a thuggish gangbanger (the thoroughly nonthreatening Damon Wayans Jr.) and watching their worlds collide. As in ""Save the Last Dance"" the lead loses her mom en route to her big audition only this time the tragedy is played for laughs. Meanwhile her beau must win back 5000 in a dance-off or face the wrath of super-size drug lord Sugar Bear (a fatsuit-clad David Alan Grier). Throw in a tubby Tracy Turnblad type (Chelsea Makela) a Zac Efron-esque closet case (Brennan Hillard) and an obligatory black best friend (Essence Atkins) and youve got your dance-movie cliches covered. Since that alone cant get ""Dance Flick"" to its 75-minute mark (not counting eight minutes of end credits) the Wayans throw in references to such recent pics as ""Dreamgirls"" ""Ray"" and ""Black Snake Moan"" (""Twilight"" even warrants its own epilogue). What the Wayanses fail to do is deliver those scant pleasures the dance-movie genre offers -- namely great music swoon-worthy romantic leads (a Channing Tatum or Rob Pattinson impersonation is a poor substitute for the real deal) and off-the-hook dance montages -- leaving only the raunchiest gags unspoiled by the trailer (best of these is Amy Sedaris turn as dance instructor Ms. Cameltoe pronounced ""Camel-tois"" whose too-tight leotard pushes the limits of the pics PG-13 rating). Parodying the dance itself is a tricky prospect since the best hip-hop dancers are frequently funny in their own right challenging one another in an escalating battle of insult and one-upsmanship. Helmer Damien Dante Wayans doesnt really have an excuse for cutting that corner since he enlisted Dave Scott the same choreographer who devised the power showdowns in half the movies hes spoofing. High points include a young female breakdancer determined not to let her pregnant tummy cramp her style and the ""Flame"" number which rewrites the lyrics of ""Fame"" as a coming-out anthem. Production values are fine though the Wayanses still havent found the right partner to solve their considerable CG and prosthetics demands -- the pics beatboxing cameltoe notwithstanding.

(Glen Wilson/Paramount Pictures) By Danny Deza Globe Correspondent / May 22 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + If you thought the world couldnt get enough of bad spoof movies you thought wrong.The Wayans brothers once again are bringing back these comedies with their latest gem ""Dance Flick."" In a movie that offers everything but real dancing new faces Damon Wayans Jr. Shoshana Bush and Essence Atkins battle with rivals using dance moves that deliver low-blow jokes and cheap laughs. From a break dancing newborn to men dressed up in leotards you definitely get what you asked for when you watch director Damien Wayanss new movie.The film pokes fun at old teen movies like ""Step-Up"" ""Hairspray"" and ""Flash Dance"" putting ""Dance Flick"" on the same shelf as its forgotten satire counterparts; ""Not Another Teen Movie"" ""Epic Movie"" and ""Scary Movie.""In a spoof twist of 2001s ""Save the Last Dance"" a young street dancer Thomas Uncles (Wayans Jr.) takes the new girl in town Megan White (Bush) under his wing as his dance pupil and tries to help her achieve her lost dreams of being accepted into Juilliard. After many obstacles standing in Megans way (freak accidents overweight gangsters and her lack of rhythm) she eventually finds herself dancing with her spunky loudmouthed sidekick Charity (Atkins) and Thomas in the mother of all dance battles between the two rival dance groups in the city.Throughout ""Dance Flick"" scenes quickly turn into a Wayans family reunion as writers Shawn Marlon and Keenan Wayans pass the comedy torch to their nephew Damon. The brothers also make their cameos play ridiculous characters and appear in multiple flashbacks that dont even get a chuckle. The film promises mind-numbing one-liners crude humor and dumb moments that you cant help but laugh at because they are unbelievably horrible. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

A song-and-dance spoof of the chick flick Wayans style Add to ... Jennie Punter From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 21 2009 207PM EDT Last updated Saturday May 30 2009 349AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Dance Flick Directed by Damien Dante Wayans Written by Keenen Ivory Wayans Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans Craig Wayans and Damien Wayans Starring all of the above and Damon Wayans Jr. Shoshana Bush and David Allan Grier Classification 14A It may not be as full-on as the Hollywood musicals golden years but theres a whole lotta step-ball-changing on the big screen these days. Movies from Hairspray to Step Up to the High School Musical series and even TV shows are filled with shimmying wannabes. So the time is ripe for a spoof and wouldnt you know a whole lotta Wayans are up for the task with Dance Flick  an entertaining moderately irreverent comedy that launches the silly movie season on a sure foot. Typically a movie with a long list of credited screenwriters signals a laboured effort. But when the surnames are all Wayans it comes with a guarantee of a comedy style and polish that dates back to TVs groundbreaking In Living Color and the Scary Movie franchise. Whats different here is the spoof fodder is primarily from the ""chick flick"" genre. This may turn off fans of the brothers off-colour male-oriented shtick but might attract a new audience. With each movie from this comedy clan the familys body count goes up. Dance Flick marks the feature directorial debut of second-generation talent Damien Dante Wayans (who also co-wrote the script with his uncles and cousin Craig Wayans all of whom appear). We also get the starring-role debut of Damon Wayans Jr. as Thomas a street dancer who hangs with thugs but has a decidedly metrosexual edge. The movies romantic storyline - lifted from 2001 movie Save The Last Dance - follows Thomass blossoming relationship with Megan (Shoshana Bush). After her mother dies in a car accident en route to her big audition (a spoof of the kiddy burlesque pageant number in Little Miss Sunshine ) Megan gives up her Juilliard dreams. Instead she starts attending Musical High School (har dee har) an urban arts academy where she becomes friends with Thomass sister Charity (Essence Atkins) a single mom who totes her baby to school and dance clubs. The movies ""street"" storyline hinges on Thomas loyalty to A-Con (Affion Crockett) who leads a crew that competes for money in dance battles (spoofing Stomp the Yard and You Got Served ). And the crew needs to win one bad since A-Con is in major hock to local crime kingpin Sugar Bear (David Alan Grier in a ridiculous fat suit). Of course the storylines function as thin threads to hold together set pieces which mainly work thanks to tight writing and fast pacing (dud scenes and there are several breeze past). The Wayans have fun with the white-black dynamic common to many dance movies and also poke fun at non-dance movies like Ray  Dreamgirls and recent teen vampire hit Twilight . The backdrop and episodic nature of high-school life serve the spoof-movie sketch structure well; one of the funniest ""asides"" is a classroom scene with a tour de force cameo by Marlon Wayans as Mr. Moody an over-emoting acting teacher. Amy Sedaris does a fun oddball turn as Ms. Cameltoe a tough dance instructor whose leotard leaves nothing to the imagination. But Dance Flick s most hilarious scene is a lavish song-and-dance routine featuring a spirited performance by 18-year-old newcomer Brennan Hillard as Zack (a nod to High School Musical heartthrob Zac Efron). Teens in the lunchroom start up a jam that riffs into the title number from the enduring 1980 movie Fame . Zack who we just learned is aching to bust out of the closet takes centre stage leading the dancers into the street while belting out ""Im gonna love men forever"" (instead of the originals ""Im gonna live forever"") as the chorus chimes in ""gay"" (instead of ""fame""). This unexpectedly upbeat moment transcends the spoof factor and almost becomes political in its non-ironic celebratory vibe. With so many Wayans Dance Flick sometimes feels like youre watching Eddie Murphy in one of the Klumps movies in which he plays every other character. But you get the feeling these comic brothers keep each others egos in check both on and off screen and Dance Flick proves theres definitely strength in numbers.
