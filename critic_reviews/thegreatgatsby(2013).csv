Ray Harryhausen Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities TheGreatGatsby Baz Luhrmanns latest insane over-the-top occasionally brilliant ultimately empty spectacular spectacular by Wesley Morris on May 9 2013 Baz Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby has one truly spectacular shot. It comes after what feels like an hour -- an hour of spinning and zooming and whooshing of minced imagery of Tobey Maguire talking and talking and talking of a 1922 that keeps whispering the songs of 2000-something (Alicia Keyss voice wails New Yoooooooork as a car crosses a bridge) of relentless audiovisual sugar. As for the shot its just a close-up of Jay Gatsby. But the movie has so gossiped about his parties his travels his riches his essence his bogusness that you just want to see for yourself whats got everybody so breathless. You want to lose your breath too. So when Luhrmann finally put a face to the fanaticism and produced Leonardo DiCaprios I reached for an inhaler. DiCaprios mouth is etched equidistant between a smile and a smirk his blond hair frozen and fixed into amber waves his skin as pink and orange as grapefruit meat. This is why you go to the movies -- for a sight youve never seen even though youve seen it a hundred times. Thats DiCaprio for a lot of this movie somehow new. You wonder how many weeks it took for him and Luhrmann and the crew to determine the math and chemistry of that smile. Its a moment that conjures up visions of blueprints and charts and controls. Yet for as much calculation as there is in that introduction to Gatsby theres also a quality thats simply beyond science stardom. DiCaprios chronically boyish demeanor has denied his screen self both true handsomeness and actual carnality. His steady attraction to nutcases weirdos and loose cannons has desensitized us to what a good psychological actor he is. That roundness of his face also tends to lessen the impact of his talent. Hes still too cute to be taken seriously. But hes never been more beautiful than he is here. Unlike other men whove played Jay Gatsby -- in particular the more mannishly beautiful Robert Redford in the comatose 1974 version of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel -- DiCaprios Gatsby is a gorgeous neurotic always slightly nervous that his ritzy mask will slip enough for the rags and insecurities to show so he simply keeps talking. But the nervous undercurrent DiCaprio gives the character doesnt feel like boasting. Its self-perpetuation. This Gatsby is gossiping too. All this talking aims to get the attention and sympathy of a Wall Street drone named Nick Carraway (Maguire) who lives in a Long Island cottage next door to Gatsbys amusement park of an estate. The book and film are narrated from Nicks point of view though Luhrmann invents a tranquil asylum for a depressed Nick to write down his memories for his doctor (Jack Thompson). Its a lazy screenwriting device that allows Nick to remember his neighbor the way Charles Foster Kane remembered Rosebud. Gatsby wants Nick to facilitate a reunion for Gatsby and Nicks cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan). They were lovers when he was a penniless soldier stationed near her Kentucky home. Five years later hes returned from World War I and other adventures filthy rich and ready to see her. But Daisy is listlessly strung out on the riches of her bullish husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) who happens to have been a classmate of Nicks and is having an affair with the wife (Isla Fisher) of a mechanic (Jason Clarke) in a low-rent district Fitzgerald called the Valley of Ashes. The central romantic question is whether Daisy will leave Tom for Gatsby. The revelation of the answer is as grandiose as it is in the book. Luhrmann clearly cherishes Fitzgeralds sense of luridness. The novel builds to a titillating succession of deaths. But the problem with the book -- one of them anyway -- is that is has no sense of tragedy. The rich and poor suffer at each others hands. And at the center of it all is a love story between a diffident woman and a passive-aggressive man. Theyre ultimately figments to each other. Maybe thats the tragedy that all this work and striving on Gatsbys part is really for nothing. Otherwise its pulp with a fancy zip code noir straining for Theodore Dreiser. And yet its an exciting book to read for its salacious window into moneyed people for how it sees the rich as savage too. Luhrmann tries to get at that sense of ravishment. Before Gatsby arrives and well after hes established himself most of the shots in the movie come at you in a fire-hose rush faces sequins hair asses confetti liquor cars billboards an anguished body flying through the night. The movie has such an overcranked energy that it has to stop to catch up with itself. But all that motoring around sometimes makes sense like when Gatsby takes Nick for a ride in his yellow roadster regaling him with his version of the story of his life. Hes talking and driving so fast that his words have practically blown away behind them before Nick can make sense of what Gatsbys saying. Luhrmann is like a toddler who just discovered that he can walk and talk. Everything in a Baz Luhrmann production -- Romeo + Juliet Moulin Rouge Australia -- feels like hes doing it for the first time and that its amazing. That explains why his star comes on like such an intoxicant -- Luhrmann might not even remember that it was DiCaprio who was his Romeo. That sense of childlike discovery is the source of Luhrmanns showmanship Nothing embarrasses him. He wants to put everything on the screen at the same time. (His sense of excess matches that of his wife Catherine Martin who co-produces his movies and does the costumes and production design. Her French doors are tall enough to play in the NBA and the real estate she chooses could be deployed for Star Trek Into Escrow.) For Gatsby Luhrmann has discovered 3-D and so the entire film is presented that way. But its redundant flavoring optical MSG. During one of the movies climaxes (Luhrmann is nothing if not a multi-orgasmic director) in a humid room at the Plaza Hotel Luhrmann shows you how those plastic glasses can help heighten the emotional intensity of an argument. Gatsby also permits Luhrmann to see what he can do with the novels Jazz Age setting. The films opening image is a series of old-timey black-and-white logos that achieve astonishing Art Deco crispness. You can feel him straining to modernize the book. He told Charles McGrath in a profile for the New York Times that he wanted to give the audience a sense of how thrilling it would have been to hear jazz in 1922. To that end he employed the services of Jay-Z as a music supervisor -- or ""Shawn Jay Z Carter"" says his onscreen credit -- and there are licks or two from nowish hits; things like songs from Watch the Throne and Beyonce covering Amy Winehouses ""Back to Black."" While Tom and Nick party with Fishers Myrtle and her friends in the valley there are cutaways to a young black dude in sunglasses playing a trumpet on a fire escape across the way. Its fair to wonder if were still in a movie or an ad for Disaronno liqueur. Luhrmann seems uncharacteristically confused about how to use this music. Hes hardly a cynical filmmaker but Jay-Zs participation feels like street-cred opportunism. Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge were both shrewd about the power of music. The songs had centerpieces and some relationship to the narrative so that the result was simultaneously Broadway La Scala and MTV. Theres so much narration in The Great Gatsby that its obvious the novel is meant to be the soundtrack but Maguire isnt much of a singer. And after DiCaprio the rest of the casting feels slightly off. If DiCaprio is stubbornly boyish Maguire is still being taken to day care. Hes reliable as Nick but if youve seen him in Brothers you know he can be so much more. His Nick is an incorruptible point of entry but what you notice about him is how much smaller and slighter he is than everyone else especially Elizabeth Debicki the very long Australian who plays Jordan Baker Daisys rumormongering best friend. Luhrmann doesnt bother with the affair Fitzgerald wrote for these two. He might have known it wouldnt play visually. Debicki makes a sport out of sitting around while Edgerton -- wearing a silent-movie mustache -- bellows and grunts and brays and a chicly blonde and bobbed Mulligan sighs pants and flutters. Edgerton acts with a brutishness that he should be ashamed of but he just wears you down with machismo. By the time the movies over he has covered you in it. Mulligan mopes like a great European star. Her face is as long as the Champs-Elysees. Every time you think her glamorized solemnity is all wrong for Daisy shell pump a lot of air into her voice and lift her line to ditzy heights. Shes got the characters melancholy (I suspect thats easier for her to play) but not enough of the addled giddiness. Mulligan needs her own movie as soon as possible. Casting her here is more obvious than inspired. Shes always somebodys Daisy. But the casting gets at how off-kilter and sloshing this movie is. DiCaprio and Maguire are the only Americans in major roles -- the Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan plays Gatsbys Jewish gangster friend Meyer Wolfsheim -- and the accents have no consistent sense of place. Or maybe its the wrong sense of place. At various points the movie looks and sounds as if its one drink and 10 degrees away from collapsing into Tennessee Williams despair. But this Gatsby doesnt have the psychology for that. More than anything that lack of depth is Luhrmanns trouble as director. After a while you expect a bit of perception or some wisdom to creep into the coked-up energy of his filmmaking. Thats why Australia was so ravishing but politically and morally vacuous. I imagine one reason aside from the scale of these productions that he shoots so infrequently -- this is his fifth movie in 21 years -- is that he wants to maintain his capacity for awe. But material this familiar needs an angle sharper than 3-D. Having reverence for Fitzgeralds novel isnt the same as having a grip on it. For one thing the movie doesnt gather as it goes. This is Luhrmann though. He has no sense of proportion. He thinks every shot every microcut is significant. At some point you stop trusting his sense of the dramatic. Its all drama to him and no one has that kind of stamina. And yet for all the antic manic itchiness of his Gatsby for all the jazz hands the movie doesnt reach out and grab you. Luhrmanns not interpreting the book -- or hes not interpreting it far enough. There are interesting interpretations that span the gamut of quality. Theres the all-black Gatsby (2002s risible G) and the shockingly seductive 2010 stage production (Gatz) that grows out of one man reading the entire novel aloud at work. Luhrmanns movie has a noble literalism. It appreciates the surfaces of Fitzgeralds novel. The words appear typed on the screen and fall like snow or ash. (On top of everything else its as if Luhrmanns just learned to read too.) You dont feel the drunken drugginess that you see before you and thats not because this is a cautionary movie -- Luhrmanns Twitter handle would be cautiontothewind. Its because reverence has bogged him down. If Gatsby is on any drug its diet coke.

Credit Courtesy of Warner Bros. 2 starsJust because a film looks like it was dipped in 18-karat gold doesnt mean its rich in quality. Take this 3-D adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds classic novel. Though every frame overflows with opulence it stumbles in its quest to be an edgy and thoroughly modern spectacle. A CliffsNotes plot summary just in case anyone dozed off during 10th grade English In the Roaring 1920s writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire bland) helps facilitate a reunion between dashing and mysteriously wealthy neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his married cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) on New Yorks Long Island. (Five years earlier Gatsby and Daisy were in the throes of love during his infantry training for World War I but then Daisy had to go and get married to a jerk aristocrat). Not long after the two lock eyes again in Carraways home they resume their passionate -- albeit ill-fated -- affair. PHOTOS Leonardos ladies English teachers obsess on the books symbolism and introspective prose; director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) obsesses over his own visual flourishes. Remember Gatsbys over-the-top glitzy parties in his West Egg mansion? Here the soiree scenes are overindulgent with each piece of confetti and drop of champagne seemingly earning an extended close-up. The fabulousness exhausts in a hurry. Trust Youve seen one flapper dancing on a banquette youve seen them all. In a superfluous quirk Nicks words are flashed on the screen as he narrates. Why? Even Luhrmann apparently grows tired of the device as it disappears midway through the 143-minute drama. But the music you cry the music Yep similar to Moulin Rouge the film is laced with a Top 40 soundtrack -- this time courtesy of Jay-Z Fergie Andre 3000 Florence + the Machine Beyonce and Jack White. And its easy to smile when ""H to the Izzo"" plays on blast as Carraway and Gatsby roll through a gleaming New York in a yellow Rolls Royce. Then the gimmick goes from amusing to distracting. When Gatsby and Daisy frolic to a jazzy rendition of Beyonces ""Crazy in Love"" theres a good chance audiences will be more fixated on whos crooning the cover than the romance at hand. (Answer Ramp;B singer Emeli Sande). PHOTOS The most romantic movies of all time All these bells and 21st century-whistles result in a jittery emotionally adrift narrative. Carraway rhapsodizes about the couples hot-blooded romance yet their chemistry is barely detectable. They dont even share a single memorable scene together A rash of quick-cut flashbacks to Gatsbys past adds to the ADD-like viewing experience. Mulligan doesnt get a free pass here. The ethereal actress who reportedly beat the likes of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson for the role only succeeds in looking radiant in her sparkly Prada gowns and diamond-encrusted headbands. She fails to embody Daisys beguiling charm and sophistication withering next to the reliably solid DiCaprio. In fact DiCaprio doesnt get to truly shine until the closing act when he breaks free from Mulligan and Maguire and goes for a swim in his backyard pool. And that moment is. . .  fleeting. For a movie that strives to be Great it all feels just a little too average.

Scott Fitzgerald.His movies including ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" are like watching a three-ring circus. They revel in surface spectacle and sensory overload. Theyre audaciously passionately artificial and at the same time unabashedly romantic -- post-modern pop medleys aimed at the heart not the brain. Perhaps Luhrmann even identifies with Fitzgeralds Jay Gatsby; after all theyre both decadents.But Fitzgerald wasnt Gatsby and Gatsby could never have written such a novel. It takes an observer like Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) to distill the finer sentiments from this sorry tale of the super-rich and Luhrmann isnt that. Hes an extrovert who wants to thrill us and immerse us in his giddy daring. The last thing he wants to do is sit back and watch.There are no two ways about it ""The Great Gatsby"" is misconceived and misjudged a crude burlesque on whats probably American literatures most precious jewel.

The camera is in a state of constant agitation while the actors -- and theyre good actors -- seem to have been instructed to vamp. Either that or they decided it was the only way to compete with the films garish hot deco.But lets give Luhrmann his due The man does cut a good teaser. The idea to swap Scott Joplin for Jay-Z and ragtime for rap was a bold and brilliant choice. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the glamorous elusive billionaire Gatsby and Maguire as his modest admiring neighbor was right on. Carey Mulligan as Daisy wasnt as inspired. She gets the sadness of the character but not the flip side of her personality and shes just not a bright enough spark to keep Gatsbys torch burning for so long. And shooting in 3-D? Look at ""Hugo"" and ""Life of Pi"" It could have worked.Yet Luhrmann seems utterly bamboozled by the technique as if its thrown off his rhythm. The early scenes especially are likely to induce motion sickness and not just because Nick is getting drunk on New Yorks high society. We know Luhrmann can throw a wild party but the movie doesnt build or grow; it just keeps hitting the same high notes until we go numb to the din. And if hes lost in the loud revelry Luhrmann is completely out of his element in the more intimate scenes. The reunion between Jay and Daisy is played for laughs (and it gets a couple too) but Luhrmann shortchanges whatever it is that pulls these lovers together. For such an elaborate display of courtship its a remarkably unsensual affair.Fitzgeralds ""The Great Gatsby"" will endure this indignity as surely as it outlasted previous versions with Alan Ladd and Robert Redford. Its a shame though since the novels depiction of a society dancing on the edge of a precipice is so timely. Its hard not to feel angry at the waste.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

Its not a satire exactly though many of its strongest moments are openly satirical. It is far too literal a translation to be considered an homage. And its oddly straightforward even innocent air disqualifies it as a subversion. Luhrmann seems to want us to feel more or less what Fitzgerald wanted us to feel only more loudly. Call it a ""melodramatization."" More on The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsbys Fabulous Betrayal of 1920s Fashion The Sublime Cluelessness of Throwing Lavish Great Gatsby Parties Actually Go Ahead and Throw That Gatsby Bash F. Scott Fitzgeralds Tense Unhappy Relationship With Hollywood To this end Luhrmann turns every dial at his disposal up to 11. His colors are as bright as those in a detergent commercial; his musical choices as intrusive as the exit cues on an awards show. The camera ducks and swerves like O.J. Simpson on his way to a car rental and the cast all share a slightly vibratory methamphetamine sheen. Topping off such excesses of cinematic technique this Gatsby is rendered in 3D an innovation only moderately less absurd than presenting Moby Dick in Sensurround or Cannery Row in Smell-O-Vision. In short although Luhrmanns film mostly adheres to the letter of Fitzgeralds novel it would be difficult to envision a work less in keeping with its wistful spirit. The movie opens with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) setting the stage in tremulous voiceover. Much of his introduction is Fitzgeralds familiar prose--""In my younger and more vulnerable years..."" etc. etc.--though the script by Luhrmann and his usual writing partner Craig Pearce (brother of Guy) does supply some odd and off-key additions. (""All of us drank too much back then...and none of us contributed anything new"" Nick explains anachronistically as if gazing back on 1922 from the present day rather than 1925.) But odder still are the alterations to Nicks backstory--or I suppose fore-story given that it takes place after the principal events of the film. This Nick has not merely been jaded by his experiences with Jay Gatsby and Tom and Daisy Buchanan hes been driven around the bend He now resides in a sanatorium and his purpose in telling the story is a bid for therapeutic redemption. Thus begins the Moulin Rouge-ification of Fitzgeralds source material Like the protagonist of that film (Luhrmanns third and most successful) this Nick self-identifies as a writer and his expository voiceover is frequently underlined by having his words appear on the screen as he utters them. Other elements are imported too such as the pull-away shots from characters perched in windows to magical-miniature cityscapes. But Luhrmanns latest resembles Moulin Rouge most obviously in its peculiar synthesis of overzealous showmanship and half-hearted tragedy. In place of Satines Golden Elephant we have Gatsbys Magic-Kingdom mansion and in place of Mildly Doomed Nicole Kidman we have Mildly Doomed Leonardo DiCaprio.Its worth noting here that DiCaprio is in fact awfully good as Gatsby charming yet uncertain magnetic yet self-effacing. Hes good when the movie is at its most bombastic--his onscreen introduction is accompanied by fireworks and the crescendo of ""Rhapsody in Blue""--and hes good on the infrequent occasions it slows down as when Nick offers to invite Daisy over for tea as a ""favor"" to him and he hears the word as if for the first time. DiCaprio could have been terrific if this were a boffo over-the-top musical entertainment (an adaptation say of 42nd Street) or if it were a subdued fable of loss and regret (such as I dont know The Great Gatsby?). But Luhrmanns impossibly ill-conceived hybrid of the two is beyond the talent of any actor to make sense of.At least DiCaprios is the only genuinely memorable performance wasted by the film. Joel Edgerton is solid (at times a bit too solid) as Tom Buchanan and Elizabeth Debicki looks the part of Jordan Baker even if she lacks the requisite languor. (Like everyone else in the film she has the feel of a 33 1/3 rpm record being played at 78.) Maguire is profoundly forgettable as Nick his existential trauma indiscernible from adolescent ennui. And Carey Mulligan is a minor disaster as Daisy though its hard to lay the blame at the actresss feet. It is with her character that Luhrmann most clearly displays his incomprehension of the work hes adapting--or perhaps more cynically his assumption that audiences would be unable to comprehend it. This Daisy is indecisive rather than ""careless"" a co-victim in the storys central tragedy rather than its principal architect a smash-ee rather than smasher. Among other consequences this transformation renders Fitzgeralds closing judgment on the Buchanans (which Luhrmann reproduces faithfully) all but meaningless.The problem is that when the movie is entertaining its not ""Gatsby"" and when its ""Gatsby"" its not entertaining. None of which is to say that The Great Gatsby is a bad movie in the most conventional will-I-want-my-money-back sense. Luhrmann is as always a dazzling ringmaster and his movie is intermittently quite entertaining. The score (on which he collaborated with executive producer Jay-Z) is imaginative and ecumenical making evocative use of Lana Del Reys ""Young and Beautiful"" and a cover of ""Back to Black"" by Beyonce and Andre 3000. Many of the gags offered up are rather amusing from Gatsbys explosive entrance to an over-enthusiastic flower purchase to a clever segue between Cole Porters ""Lets Misbehave"" and Fats Wallers ""Aint Misbehavin."" The problem is that when the movie is entertaining its not Gatsby and when its Gatsby its not entertaining. Apart from the misappropriation of Fitzgeralds classic text what is most frustrating about The Great Gatsby is that it offers yet further proof that Luhrmann has a skill-set tailor-made for comedy that he insists on squandering in ill-fated attempts at tragedy. Since his delightful 1992 debut Strictly Ballroom--recently released on Blu-ray--Luhrmann has taken five straight stabs at the latter tradition missing the mark every time Romeo + Juliet Moulin Rouge an underwhelming Broadway production of La boheme the epic folly Australia and now Gatsby. If only Luhrmann could be persuaded to put down his high-school syllabi and start leafing through some old song books instead. (Imagine what he could have done to cite just one example with the amateurishly under-directed Mamma Mia.) But his tragic fixation seems incurable no matter how many heartbroken narrators he cycles through. Just a few days ago the director announced his hope to reunite with DiCaprio for an adaptation of yes Hamlet. And so the question is posed once again. I can only hope that this time the answer is ""not to be.""

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Chrissaid on Sunday March 16 2014 123223 AMFINALLY I found a good review Every other person who has reviewed this film either hasnt read the novel or doesnt understand it... the film was by FAR the best adaptation thats been made the acting was absolutely on point. My only problem was the music I think it could have been done a little better but other than that it was stellar. Marksaid on Monday December 02 2013 121009 AMI have to say that I thought this was a very good book adaptation. And I cant help but think Mr. Roeper missed out on the finest criticism that leaps out at you from the moment it is first presented until the last ... This soundtrack absolutely blows As I see it that is likely the reason for the minus on the grade. If the soundtrack was re-recorded with a better music selection ... one even remotely close to the times and sounds you would expect from this era ... well then I certainly see how it could have been an A but I am struggling to see how it held on with an A- such as it was. Better luck next time. Perhaps Mr Roeper had just come from the Canarble Wagon when he gave this review. susansaid on Saturday November 16 2013 103109 AMthis movie surpasses the old version leonardo DiCaprio made the PERFECT Jay Gatsby. The casting director made the RIGHT choice to play this role. Mr. DiCaprio played it like nobodys business. Ms. Mulligan fell short Mia Farrow was a better Daisy. I did view the original The Great Gatsby with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the starring roles a few days after seeing Mr. Luhrmanns version. Mr. Lurhmann brought a new RICH version of the great novel. He definitely made it his own and spectacularly done. Thank You Mr. Luhrmann for making a fulfilling all encapsulating movie. Prestonsaid on Saturday June 01 2013 120515 AMMy wife and I went to see the new Gatsby and we thought it was a great film and a much more entertaining and accurate adaptation of the book. Leonardo was a much better Gatsby than Redford. I expected more from the older movie as I kept hearing how great it was but it was difficult to sit through the old version after seeing how good a movie Gatsby could be with the new version. Nancysaid on Tuesday May 28 2013 113901 AM""The passionate love between the two main characters."" If you have read the novel there was no passionate love affair between the two. Gatsby was chasing the American dream in which he romanticize that Daisy would fulfill. I would go as far to say he didnt really love Daisy. Daisy doesnt love anybody but herself. Baz Luhrmanns interpretation is a bit of a sensory overload but I think its fitting for the time the novel/movie takes place. Robert Redford as Gatsby made me sleepy. amadnasaid on Thursday May 23 2013 112045 AMThank you Mr. Roper for seeing the potential in this movie. It makes me wonder what people really expected after Romeo amp; Juliet and Moulin Rouge? I felt that Bazs rendition made the book more glamorous and exciting. I find the book to be a bit dull and forgive my opinion on this that it allowed the movie to really capture my imagination and bring this story to life in a more energetic way. I think the casting was spot on Toby played a perfect Nick because Nick was quite boring and was the tote doll during the book. Mr. Gatsby and Leo together is explosive. Leo is incredible and can really transform and he really appreciates the rolls hes given. I just loved it. I cant help it I also enjoyed the sound track because Ill never forget the sound track to Romeo amp; Juliet and how much I loved it rickrowlandsaid on Wednesday May 22 2013 111614 AMSee old redford/copploa movie. Read book.see luhrman/dicaprio. Stir.combine.understand this is history of Fitzgerald and Zelda. ENJOY Jose Velezsaid on Saturday May 18 2013 100607 PMI cant see what Mr. Roeper is speaking of when I saw the film just a few hours ago and walked out after half hour of lovely visuals but absolutely boring but splashy film making. Hollywood threw in everything but the kitchen sink. The costumes were spectacular but I couldnt see Mr. DeCaprio as Gatsby. Joseph Ryansaid on Wednesday May 15 2013 91905 PMThis film surprised me After some so-so reviews I was expecting a so-so adaptation of a great novel. Not ""so"" The film was both a treat to/for the eyes and a treat for the emotions/mind. Great performances besides. Fitzgerald would be very satisfied that his novel was portrayed properly I think.

"The Great Gatsby (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Great Gatsby (PG-13) Fitzgeralds classic gets bogged down by unnecessary glitz. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com5/9/2013 Editor rating 2 Baz Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby is a failure that should have at least been a magnificent mistake a risky endeavor that showed a daring intent even if its brash vision didnt quite succeed. Instead the movie leaves you cold and weary and vaguely disgusted like youve just spent a night of debauchery at Gatsbys mansion and now the sun is up and its time to fish the cigarette butts and champagne bottles out of the pool. In theory turning F. Scott Fitzgeralds classic novel of jazz age disillusionment into some sort of over-the-top commentary on class warfare and the lives of the rich and careless could have worked; the novels themes of excess and delusion are ripe for visual reinvention. But this new Gatsby is nothing more than a garish cartoon. Even when it works -- the grand party scene shown in the trailer is truly a spectacle worth seeing -- the visuals are somehow less exhilarating than you imagine they will be just Moulin Rouge retreads with Long Island and Manhattan standing in for Paris. Creatively its ground Luhrmann has already tread. Nor did any of the material cry out to be shot in 3D which proves to be more of a distraction than an enhancement. Anyone who survived high school English will know the story how narrator and budding bonds salesman Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire) rents a little cottage on West Egg Long Island -- haven for the nouveau riche -- next door to the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio). Gatsby befriends him and soon enough reveals a secret about his past involving Nicks lovely cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who lives across the water on old-moneyed East Egg with her brutish husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). Everyone drinks a lot and gossips and carries on various unsavory affairs until the seemingly eternal summer ends in chaos and death. Luhrmann and longtime collaborator Chris Pearce who also wrote the screenplays for Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet and Strictly Ballroom still use Nick as narrator but they made the curious decision to frame the film with Nick in a sanitarium urged by his doctor to write down his story. I suppose this is so Pearce can use Fitzgeralds dazzling prose in the movie -- the words sometimes float right out onto the screen -- but the implication that the events involving Gatsby caused Nick by far the most rational of the bunch to have some sort of nervous breakdown undermines Fitzgeralds vision. It also appears to be a cheap way to make use of some magical 3D snow since the rest of the movie takes place in a warmer season. Otherwise the screenplay sticks fairly close to its original source right down to the faded billboard of glasses overlooking the ashheaps that separate less fashionable West Egg from glittering Manhattan. But while the novel is trim the movie feels bloated with a few too many scenes of speeding cars careening through the streets and pointless musical segues meant to reflect the carefree attitude of the time. Like he did in Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet Luhrmann marries modern music to his stylized setting but this time the union doesnt work. Using hip-hop instead of the classics of the time isnt cutting edge anymore and it strands the film without a significant musical moment. Remember The Cardigans pop magic Lovefool or Desrees dreamy Kissing You from Romeo + Juliet and youll know what I mean. Perhaps the worst thing about all of this is that Gatsbys cast is terrific from DiCaprio as the obsessed self-made millionaire to Mulligan as the shallow Daisy to Jason Clarke of Zero Dark Thirty as the unfortunate George Wilson whose destiny is wrapped up with Gatsbys own. Gatsbys ""old sport"" sounds odd coming from DiCaprios mouth but then Jay Gatsby wasnt born saying it either. In the end though Gatsbys style overcomes its substance. Effects like the gaudy fireworks that explode when we first see the elusive millionaire overwhelm the soul of this story the pursuit of the American dream lost to bright lights forgettable music and special effects.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 10 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 10 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Baz Luhrmann Written by Baz Luhrmann Craig Pearce Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Tobey Maguire Carey Mulligan Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English But first before the glowing review a little movie history. When The Great Gatsby last ventured onto the large screen in 1974 with a woefully miscast Robert Redford and Mia Farrow squeaking in a voice like loose change the adaptation laid an Egg as big as East and West combined. In fact the film was so bad that it immediately raised two possible questions about the Scott Fitzgerald classic (1) Was it not really a classic after all and didnt deserve its iconic rep?; or (2) Was the novel just too intrinsically literary and delicate to survive any transplant from its rightful home on the page? Multimedia The Great Gatsby The official trailer Cut to the present when in the lead-up to director Baz Luhrmanns much-hyped foray into the field a spate of keen revisionists sacred-cow-tippers all have emerged to answer the first question with a resounding yes denouncing the book (often with more eagerness than proof) as overwritten oversymbolic and vastly overrated. Which brings us finally to Luhrmanns film and to a delicious irony Its a terrific adaptation that succeeds not only as a work of cinema but also wonderfully as proof of the novels greatness. In short the picture rebukes the revisionists even while entertaining them. How?For starters Luhrmann and his co-screenwriter Craig Pearce are astute enough to know that Gatsby is much less an exercise in realism than a lyrical tone poem. In its style and its theme artifice lies at the very heart of the book and the director celebrated for his Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom Romeo and Juliet Moulin Rouge) is no slouch at artifice. So right from the initial travelling shot through an art-deco frame to that green light at the docks flickering end the movie is unabashedly stylized and theatrical. His use of the 3-D camera common now in action blockbusters but still rare in a drama reinforces the artful point while also underscoring the scripts first surprise and its only significant departure from the source material.Prepare to see an aged Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a remote sanitarium diagnosed as a depressed alcoholic (yes Fitzgeralds own fate). There as winter rages outside an encircling window the 3-D effects seem to have him ensconced within a giant snow globe setting down on paper his account of that faraway summer in the Roaring Twenties. Of course in the novel and here too Nick is our narrator prone to his occasionally purple rhetoric. But that imposed conceit the image of a talented depressive writing from inside the bauble of his imagination seems to validate his inflated prose and better yet lets us re-appreciate its inherent poetry.Then from the moment the narrative flashes back to the principal action to Gatsbys impossible dream on the shores of Long Island and in the maelstrom of Manhattan several happy conclusions are quickly apparent. The casting is note-perfect - Carey Mulligans sad-eyed take on the narcissistic Daisy Joel Edgertons aggressively physical run at her philandering husband Tom Elizabeth Debicki as cool and careless Jordan Baker. More important the movie pulses with the vibrant dissolute energy of the era. Youd expect Luhrmann to give good spectacle although the trailers worrisomely suggest he may have gone over the top. Not the case.Instead the succession of costumed party sequences - in the flat of Toms mistress in the restaurant with the scheming Meyer Wolfsheim culminating in the ""kaleidoscope carnival"" at Gatsbys absurdly opulent mansion - play out to a drunken dizzying beat thats simultaneously invigorating and enervating leaving us much like Nick ""enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety"" of Luhrmannesque life. And his trademark use of a contemporary soundtrack (Jay Z Lana Del Rey Beyonce Andre 3000) builds an inviting bridge between two confused and confusing Ages yesterdays Jazz and todays Digital.On to Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. Its a tough gig trying to pump flesh and blood into a character whos essentially a platonic conception of himself. But DiCaprio unlike Redford manages to convey the yearning innocence without sacrificing the palpable menace especially during the pivotal confrontation scene - suspicious Tom tortured Daisy besotted Gatsby onlooking Nick and Jordan - in the steaming heat at the Plaza Hotel. There Luhrmann transforms a dramatic set-piece into a mini-play where the performances are nuanced and the dialogue crackles. Indeed the dialogue throughout rings surprisingly true because the script has the good sense to lift only the most realistic bits from Fitzgerald to augment where necessary with its own inventions and at judicious intervals to layer in Nicks melodically elevating voiceover.The climactic plot twists which strain on the page definitely shouldnt work on the screen yet Luhrmann survives them by turning death itself into a stylized act just the final pas de deux in a thematic ballet. In the end as those famous last words literally dance across the screen the verdict is clear This is a great adaptation that falls just shy of being a great film.The ineffable lyrical magic of the novel the potion that its admirers drink in deeply and its detractors gag on goes missing here perhaps inevitably. But even that absence feels generous pointing to and justifying the classics status. Baz Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby is a fun and entertaining and vital and brave reminder of what the book is and the movie for all its many charms is not - profoundly important.

Scott Fitzgeralds <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> 455 Shares Share 362 Tweet 52 Share 7 Share Email Print Share THE GREAT GATSBY Photo Daniel Smith/Warner Bros The best thing about Baz Luhrmanns much-anticipated/much-dreaded The Great Gatsby is that for all its computer-generated whoosh and overbroad acting it is unmistakably F. Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby. That is no small deal. The last major adaptation in which a recessive Robert Redford reunited with a blank Mia Farrow substituted deadly Brit tastefulness for Fitzgeralds polished American vulgarity--the polish (like the characters opulence) a facade through which we can discern the baseness of the Jazz Age high life. No one can say that the Aussie hot dog Luhrmann lacks the requisite vulgarity. And no one can say that he tries to upstage his source. In the movies inane framing device Nick Carraway is in rehab typing a memoir overseen by an eager shrink. As Fitzgeralds words emerge from Nicks typewriter they sometimes drift across the screen (into our faces if you see the film in 3-D)--a ding-a-ling gimmick but a reminder at least that there is a greater Gatsby elsewhere. The movie is juvenile but could have been so much worse. You know from the outset youre in for an onslaught. The camera hurtles (or what passes for it in CGI) across the water toward Disneys turreted Magic Castle which turns out to be the house of the mysterious Jay Gatsby. A short time later Nick tells us that his cousin Daisy and her trust-fund-fatted polo-playing husband Tom Buchanan live directly across the water from Gatsby at which point the camera CGI-hurtles over to the Buchanans place--almost instantly traversing a gap that ought to remain fixed both literally and metaphorically. Its hard for a man like Luhrmann whose idea of cinema is rooted in instant gratification (you want it you got it) to grasp let alone translate the Gatsbyesque notion of longing to be somewhere you cant be. Hes the anti-Terrence Malick He makes miracles cheap. Luhrmann has exhausted us well before our first sight of Gatsby. As Nick Tobey Maguire has the same dazed-ingenue affect in both his drunken-past and sober-present incarnations but Maguire can be sweet without undue sickliness. Back in the heady days of Prohibition young Nick rents the dilapidated house next to Gatsbys manse (Shrink ""So he was your neighbor?"" Nick ""My neighbor ... yeah"") and spies the man himself in the distance on a dock looking almost Nick says as if hes trying to reach across the water. Then we see Leonardo DiCaprio with his arm stuck out reaching ... reaching ... Its not Fitzgeralds subtlest moment and is clunkier onscreen. Can any actor overcome a first shot like that? Talk about a reach. DiCaprio is on balance a good Gatsby. It helps that most of us like him so much that we root for him to hit the right notes. And if he does as actors say ""indicate"" what choice do you have in a Baz Luhrmann picture? You signal desperately while trying not to look desperate. DiCaprio has a too-nice tan and looks obscenely healthy but hes not playing a wasted reclusive Gatsby Hes a man still aglow with youthful dreams convinced that by adding ""old sport"" to the end of his sentences hell seem to the manner born. (He sounds like someone doing a bad JFK impersonation.) DiCaprio was the most grown-up-seeming of child actors and is now the most boyish of grown-ups. So its easy to believe that his Gatsby could attach no importance to the five years that have passed since he last saw his treasured Daisy back when he was a poor boy. Its easy to believe he thinks hope--plus his new wealth--can vanquish time. Its less easy to believe that Carey Mulligan can embody Daisy. I know Who could embody American literatures ultimate prize its Great White Whale transformed into a beautiful woman who can only be landed after a suitable fortune is amassed? Shes a projection--and at the same time a mistreated discombobulated woman who shows signs of not wanting to bear the absurd weight of a mans dreams. I suspect we all have our Daisys in life but could find no consensus if allowed to vote on an actress. A couple of distant possibilities Peter Bogdanovich recognized a Texas version of Daisy in Jacy in The Last Picture Show--and the poor dreamer launched himself on a Fitzgerald-like road to ruin by leaving his wife for the 21-year-old Cybill Shepherd and installing her in a mansion in Bel Air. Gwyneth Paltrow despite her current Goopy associations still radiates a Daisy-like relish for being envied and desired--along with an obvious (even neurotic) attachment to privilege. Mulligan might turn out to be a better actress than Shepherd and Paltrow put together but shes down-to-earth pretty (a tad mousy) rather than unattainably glamorous. She does well in Daisys most challenging scene in which she has to oscillate between the desires of two impossible men the monomaniacal Gatsby and the overentitled Buchanan. But its possible to forget shes in the movie. Shes upstaged by an Australian actress named Elizabeth Debicki who as Jordan Baker is all sleek insouciance an archetypal New Yorker flapper cartoon brought to vivid life. You could project on Debicki till the cows come home. She slinks off with the movie but she doesnt have much competition. Apart from DiCaprio and Maguire the chief actors are Brits or Aussies and hit their American notes like their rs harrrrd. Joel Edgertons Tom Buchanan is about on the same level as Billy Zanes Cal Hockley in Titanic Leos last rich rival for his soul mates affection. But shouldnt the Fitzgerald version have a bit more nuance than the Cameron knockoff? Jason Clarke who plays the mechanic Wilson as if competing with clowns and elephants for the audiences attention will be lucky if no one recognizes him from his riveting turn as the increasingly tortured torturer in Zero Dark Thirty. As the doomed Myrtle Isla Fisher suggests Bernadette Peters in dire need of a showstopping Broadway ballad. You can find fault with virtually every scene in Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby--and yet in spite of all the wrong notes Fitzgerald (and the excess he was writing about and living) comes through. The Deco extravagance of the big party scenes is enthralling. Luhrmann throws money at the screen in a way that is positively Gatsby-like walloping you intentionally and un- with the theme of prodigal waste. I imagined him directing the spectacle while fending off--like Gatsby--phone calls from shady moneymen ""You spent a million dollars on fireworks? You needed how many sets of twins on how many fountains for one shot? Putz"" About the anachronistic music (Jay-Z Gershwin anyone) I take no position since the movie would be 100 percent ersatz even with period jazz. The sets look like rear-screen projection so that the 3-D--which makes the actors pop out of the artificial backgrounds--feels unusually organic. Its a fallacy that film adaptations of our most revered books require formality and a steady gaze. Novelists jump around in time underlining this ignoring that. Luhrmann is no Abel Gance or F.W. Murnau but his syncopated rhythms his liberal use of narration and his constant weave of present and past (his flashbacks truly flash) conjure up silent screen cinema at its most unfettered. You could even argue that the movie straightens out too much in the last half hour and needed to be more vulgar--it slackens when the noose around Gatsby is tightening. You can cringe all through Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby and still leave with fresh insight into the novels genius. Its about the dream of doing things loud and fast and in grand style. Its about having the biggest budget old sport.A This article originally appeared in the May 13 2013 issue of New York Magazine.

PICTURES By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Playing Opens today throughout Orange CountyThe quick hitBaz Luhrmanns razzmatazz and bombast - in 3D - overwhelm the subtle poetry of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel about the doomed love affair of an upper-crust woman and the ultimate self-made man but some of Fitzgeralds emotion survives thanks to the talent and valor of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. Grade C ""The Great Gatsby"" puts the work of a great American writer onscreen with precision and AA(c)lan. Unfortunately that writer is Woody Allen. In a classic humor piece called ""A Twenties Memory"" Allen satirized the glamour of the self-destructive ""Lost Generation"" recalling the night ""Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda returned home from their New Years Eve party. It was April. They had consumed nothing but champagne for the last three months and one previous week in full evening dress had driven their limousine off a ninety-foot cliff into the ocean on a dare.""Thats how the entire upper crust lives in director Baz Luhrmanns adaptation of Fitzgeralds 1925 novel. Lavishing more attention on external luxuries like the heros peppy yellow Dusenberg than on Gatsbys racing imagination and drowning out meaningful tAAate-A -tAAates with wild parties that depict wretched excess too excessively Luhrmann drives all his characters off a cliff. Theres something mechanical and forced about this directors taste for the bizarre. Hes tiresomely determined to be outrAA(c).The restlessness that rustles beneath the surface of Fitzgeralds prose comes hurtling over the top. People driving from Long Island to New York City look like theyre testing their engines for an episode of ""Top Gear"" or maybe a remake of ""Speed Racer."" An aimless silly gathering in a small New York love nest becomes a pop saturnalia cut and performed like a music video in Madonnas ""Vogue"" period but without her seductive rhythm.The big bashes at Gatsbys Long Island mansion sometimes resemble mosh pits crammed with celebrants dressed to the nines. In a minor incident in Fitzgeralds book one reveler wrecks his new coupe and loses a wheel on the way back to New York. The crash doesnt register dramatically because the movie is strewn with as much clatter and cacophony as a disaster film. Long before the end the wheels of the movie have all come off.Luhrmann knows that in Fitzgeralds book the hectic diversions of elite party animals express both the positive energy of a booming economy and the nervous thrashings of the ""one percent"" - plutocrats and wealthy arrivistes who have lost their moorings in society. But as a director Luhrmann resembles his characters in the worst way. Hes a sucker for expensive empty spectacle resulting in a movie thats all flash. When he introduces Jay Gatsby to the audience he can find no better way to announce him than to set off fireworks. If Luhrmann ever does a biopic of the Pope well see a lot of exploding Roman candles.Its a tribute to the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby and Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan that some of Fitzgeralds emotion survives this debacle. DiCaprio is persuasive as a mysterious millionaire who in the words of narrator Nick Carraway ""sprang from his Platonic conception of himself"" - a conception that includes winning the hand of Lousivilles belle Daisy Fay. He wooed her in Kentucky when he was training for the Army in World War I. But he stayed too long in Europe and lost her to Chicago millionaire Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) a pedigreed philandering brute.DiCaprios Gatsby juggles the tough con-artist instincts of a fellow who makes his fortune in the Asphalt Jungle with the shakiness of a man who feels he may have muffed his chance at love. Earning millions with help from gambler Meyer Wolfsheim (played by the bizarrely miscast Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan) he tries to leap over high societys barricades like a champion hurdler. He buys a castle in nouveau riche West Egg right across the bay from the Buchanans estate in settled traditional East Egg. He entertains there for hundreds every weekend solely to lure Daisy back to him. DiCaprio conveys the insecurity as well as the self-satisfaction of a man who has taught himself sophistication. The actor savors the humorous incongruity of Gatsby calling everyone ""Old Sport"" in an accent that makes it sound like ""Old Spore.""Mulligan is tremulously vulnerable and alarmingly conflicted as Daisy who wants to glide through life. Her perfect attunement to each moment is one of her pleasures and her charms. But her husbands bad behavior - including his affair with a garage-owners wife Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) - catapults her into confusion. Mulligan creates a voice that sounds privileged and cultivated; as Gatsby says in the book its ""full of money."" (""That was the inexhaustible charm that fell and rose in it"" the narrator continues ""the jingle of it the cymbals song of it."") Her eyes betray an untapped ardor and deep-rooted fears. Shes made to be loved not trusted.Luhrmann tries simultaneously to open up and to streamline the story but the directors choices make it either claustrophobic or leaden. The narrator Carraway (Tobey Maguire) like Gatsby a Midwestern World War I vet is pictured as a patient in a mental hospital. He comes to grips with his recent experience in a manuscript he calls ""Gatsby"" - and then with a flourish of his pen adds ""The Great."" (Its almost as if hes Holden Caulfield writing the manuscript that becomes ""The Catcher in the Rye."")Maguire a game actor still has a teenage voice. He can be touchingly adolescent when he conveys his worship of Gatsby. But he doesnt yet have the equipment to deliver the most eloquent lines in American literature. It doesnt help Maguires performance that Luhrmann and his cowriter Craig Pearce cut out Carraways most cogent critical passages and even lop off a classic phrase or two. In this film Carraway praises Gatsbys ""hope"" but not his ""romantic readiness.""They also use the narrator to over-explain elusively lyrical lines. When Daisy reunited with Gatsby at last sobs while burying her face in the thick folds of his shirts she says ""Theyre such beautiful shirts. It makes me sad because Ive never seen such - such beautiful shirts before."" Carraway in the movie has to explain that theyre the only words she can find to illuminate five years of bottled-up emotion.Luhrmann cant resist flashing Carraways old-fashioned penmanship across the screen or tossing letters over the images as if he were playing Jumble. His attempts to be cutting-edge are consistently dull or excruciatingly ham-handed. The soundtrack mash-up of hip-hop and period jazz is a muck-up. Snippets of Gershwin get buried beneath audio noise and visual clutter and the rap and pop tunes produced by Jay Z for BeyoncAA(c) Lana Del Rey will.i.am and others are jarringly off-key.The use of 3D is calamitous typifying Luhrmanns approach as a whole. In 3D the digital New York cityscapes look as artificial as Pandora in ""Avatar."" Whats worse the 3D minimizes your depth perception rather than tests it. It either pushes the actors so close to you that every facial shift is as easy to read as a diagram or deflects your attention from a crucial dramatic moment with overpowering pyrotechnics. And occasionally you feel as if flower petals or confetti have lodged in your eyes.Luhrmanns movie is neither a deluxe entertainment that stands on its own as a pop phantasmagoria nor an adaptation that captures the essence of a masterpiece from a different medium. He fails to honor Fitzgeralds vision or Jay Gatsbys imagination. His arbitrary extravagance lands the film in a plush-lined rut.The Great GatsbyStarring Leonardo DiCaprio Carey Mulligan and Tobey MaguireBehind the scenes Directed by Baz LuhrmannRated PG-13 for some violent images sexual content smoking partying and brief languageRunning time 2 hours 23 minutesContact the writer msragowocregister.com Movie Trailer The Great Gatsby Related Links A peek behind The Great Gatsby Gatsby designer looks to capture decadence Gatsby design headed to stores Celebrity scents The sweet smell of fame Mothers Day Scents amp; Sensibilities Gallego These movies wear it well Own the look Ozs trendy witch The Best (?) of the Met Ball 2013 red carpet Most Popular Costa Mesa Police detail homeowners 2012 fatal shooting of burglar -- caper involved artTim Lincecums struggles continue in Angels 6-2 loss to Red SoxDodgers Yasiel Puig remains in limbo as trade deadline nears; Jay Bruce a possible targeGrocery Outlet debut Free Bruxie lunch for shoppers next week in OrangeMan arrested suspected of baseball bat attack in San Juan Capistrano Related Links A peek behind The Great Gatsby Gatsby designer looks to capture decadence Gatsby design headed to stores Celebrity scents The sweet smell of fame Mothers Day Scents amp; Sensibilities Gallego These movies wear it well Own the look Ozs trendy witch The Best (?) of the Met Ball 2013 red carpet User Agreement Comments are encouraged but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy amp; Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Based on F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel a Midwestern war veteran (Tobey Maguire) finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor (Leonardo DiCaprio). (Photo/Video Warner Bros) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 9 2013 626 p.m. ET Baz Luhrmanns ""The Great Gatsby"" is a tale told idiotically full of noise and furor signifying next to nothing. The production is not insipid lets give it that. An exercise in absurdist excess this fourth screen adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role means to dramatize the excesses of the Jazz Age with hints of Weimar decadence thrown in for bad measure. But thats a banality by this late date and its as far as Mr. Luhrmann goes in making sense of the book. The films only governing principle is maximalism--everything has been made as big as possible apart from conversational interludes when big feelings are displayed like bullet points by actors striking static poses. ENLARGE ALL THAT BAZ Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan in The Great Gatsby. Warner Bros. Pictures For a while the sheer scale of the thing keeps you engaged if not agog. (I watched through 3-D glasses that werent worth the bother.) Gatsbys mansion is a cross between Neuschwanstein Castle and what San Simeon might have been if Hearst had been more gregarious; partygoers swarm like cicadas and make as much of a racket. A road trip between Long Island and Manhattan takes on the thunderous intensity of a Grand Prix; the mere arrival of Gatsbys gorgeous yellow Duesenberg in Nick Carraways driveway is enough to set teacups rattling on a kitchen shelf. (Nick the novels narrator and aspiring writer is played by Tobey Maguire.) Fitzgeralds valley of ashes a desolate strip half way between West Egg and New York City has become an expressionist Hades where doomed workers slave away on giant slag heaps. (Thats as close as the movie comes to the authors complex attitude toward American capitalism.) The artistic elephantiasis takes many forms. When young James Gatz who hasnt yet transformed himself into Jay Gatsby first encounters his benefactor-to-be Dan Cody he doesnt just row a borrowed rowboat out to Codys yacht on Lake Superior as in the book; Gatz saves Cody and his vessel from incipient calamity during a storm of sufficient ferocity to scuttle the Titanic. And when the camera first catches sight of the fully formed Gatsby presiding like a god over one of his parties fireworks fill the summer sky behind him and a symphony orchestra summons up the majestic strains of ""Rhapsody in Blue."" Related Video Watch interviews and behind the scenes footage from the filming of ""The Great Gatsby"" with director Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan. (Photo Warner Bros) The Great 8-Bit Gatsby Charleston Moves for Gatsby Style Its a moment that makes you smile even if you recall that Woody Allen used Gershwins anthem and fireworks to far greater effect in the preface of ""Manhattan."" Theres something touching--again for a while--in the filmmakers desire to please in his fevered efforts to define a time in American history by the way it looks. (Hes so eager to cram in pieces of period detail that one camera pullback reveals high-steel workers constructing a skyscraper even though its the middle of the night.) But many of the borrowings--from Busby Berkeley from ""The Crowd"" from ""Citizen Kane""--begin to ring hollow especially because Mr. Luhrmann borrows well beyond the point of self-parody from the same bag of tricks he opened up more than a decade ago in ""Moulin Rouge"" The problem isnt those tricks per se. When the camera swoops and darts ecstatically or in this case plummets into Manhattans stone canyons the effect can be impressive never mind that Spider-Man has claimed such aerobatics for his own. One fleeting but striking image is that of an apartment building with each window expanding or contracting like a window on the screen of a giant computer as it frames a half-seen life. Nor is the music problematic notwithstanding the films much-hyped use of hip-hop or the presence of the rapper Jay-Z as one of the producers. In fact the hip-hop is used judiciously; it kicks in mainly during party scenes when theres monstrous pounding from other sources and its no more intrusive than all the other efforts to heighten the storys reality. (The screenplay is credited to Mr. Luhrmann and Craig Pearce. Catherine Martin designed the lustrous production and the stunning costumes. Simon Duggan did the cinematography which seemed of variable quality at the studio screening I attended.) ENLARGE Revelers in The Great Gatsby. Warner Bros. Pictures Whats intractably wrong with the film is that theres no reality to heighten; its a spectacle in search of a soul. For all of its glittery fragmentation ""Moulin Rouge"" came around to moments of genuine passion. None of these new trappings means a thing because the people who populate them are stylish sticks unsinged by the spark of life. Thats almost surely not the fault of the actors for the director turns them into lifelike props. Mr. DiCaprio whos no more comfortable with the phrase ""old sport"" than Robert Redford was in the previous version is elaborately sincere when he isnt frowning like Jack Nicholson; being charming like well Leonardo DiCaprio or being mysterious except that people who are genuinely mysterious dont look mysterious. Carey Mulligans Daisy is either languorous or amorous not a lot in between. Mr. Maguires Nick is cheerlessly impressionable. Joel Edgertons Tom is charmlessly brutish. Elizabeth Debickis Jordan Baker is a flouncing cipher. And Mr. Luhrmann uses Amitabh Bachchan a legendary star in his native India to make the Jewish gangster Meyer Wolfshiem a leering Fagin. Given the lifelessness of the enterprise theres little point in belaboring its failure to convey the novels themes let alone the emotional and social resonance of what has come to be considered a masterpiece of world literature. Although the hero created himself out of the whole cloth of romantic yearning we see almost nothing of that self-creation only the conflicted result. Although the Nick of the novel arrives at a new and tragic understanding of the American Dream the Nick on screen cant be more than an earnest observer since any vestige of the storys tragic sense has been replaced by melodramatic sadness. This dreadful film even derogates the artistry of Fitzgerald who wrote ""The Great Gatsby"" while living on Long Island and in Europe. In a deviation from the book that amounts to a calumny against literary history Nick the authors surrogate is discovered in a psychiatric hospital where as an aging alcoholic he struggles to comprehend the vanished figure at the center of the long-ago story and finally completes his treatment by writing the novel. Its literature as therapy and Gatsby as Rosebud. Something in the Air Watch a clip from the film ""Something in the Air."" In the months after the heady weeks of May 68 a group of young Europeans search for a way to continue the revolution believed to be just beginning. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) As a longtime admirer of Olivier Assayas Ive heaped praise on his previous two films ""Summer Hours"" a richly textured drama that examines the emotional content of material possessions and ""Carlos"" which isnt a single film but an epic achievement starring Edgar Ramirez in the form of a 51/2-hour miniseries about the international terrorist of the 1970s and early 1980s. ENLARGE Lola Creton and Clement Metayer in Something in the Air. Sundance Selects ""Something in the Air"" is a fictionalized reminiscence of the writer-directors youthful involvement in radical politics--high-school revolutionaries seized by the drama of their day and graduating from distributing mimeographed pamphlets to throwing Molotov cocktails. Too bad it isnt more engaging--and dramatic--than it is but this new film in French with English subtitles is still worth seeing for what it says of the turbulent state of France in the early 1970s when Mr. Assayas was a high-school student in Paris and of the zigzag pursuit--of painting beautiful girls and independence from a demanding father--that finally culminated in his becoming the filmmaker he was meant to be. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Django Unchained Django Unchained (2012) Leonardo DiCaprio is deliciously expansive as Calvin Candie a pretentious fool of a plantation owner in a Quentin Tarantino film that is wildly extravagant ferociously violent ludicrously lurid and outrageously entertaining yet also remarkably very much about the pernicious lunacy of racism and yes slaverys singular horrors. This reminds us of at least two things relevant to ""The Great Gatsby""--that Mr. DiCaprio is a fine actor when hes given substantial material and that stylistic extravagance far from being the hollow thing it is in Baz Luhrmanns hands can be an effective adjunct to artistry. ENLARGE Carey Mulligan in An Education Sony Pictures Classics/courtesy Everett Collection An Education (2009) Heres another reminder--that Carey Mulligan who is so inexpressively decorative as Gatsbys Daisy has done superb work in recent years most notably in this tale of an English schoolgirls hard-won wisdom. The time is 1961 a year before the outbreak of Beatlemania in a London that Ms. Mulligans Jenny at the age of 16 finds sedate if not downright sedative. Peter Sarsgaard is David the ostensible sophisticate who awakens her and seduces her. Lone Scherfig directed from Nick Hornbys screenplay which took its inspiration in the fullest sense of the word from a short memoir by Lynn Barber. ENLARGE Irma Vep Irma Vep (1996) Olivier Assayas wrote and directed this delightful French-language film about the perils of filmmaking and not incidentally vampires. The matchless Maggie Cheung plays a version of herself--a Hong Kong martial-arts star named Maggie who speaks no French. Jean-Pierre Leaud (the star of so many classic New Wave films by Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard) is Rene Vidal a New Wave director who wants to keep from being completely washed up by remaking the silent serial ""Les Vampires"" with Maggie as his leading lady. Nathalie Richard is Zoe a wardrobe mistress with a special feeling for Maggies body. --J.M. 8 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Pictures From The Great Gatsby - All From Your Imagination All From Your Imagination Credit Warner Bros. Pictures From The Great Gatsby - She Never Loved You She Never Loved You Credit Warner Bros. Pictures If anyone could pull off a multiplex-friendly adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby -- a film treatment that might be capable of stepping out of the long shadow cast by the book -- its Baz Luhrmann right? The Australian director who dragged Shakespeares star-crossed lovers into the music-video-shaken bullet-ridden 90s with Romeo + Juliet and compressed a centurys worth of pop music and melodrama into the glorious Moulin Rouge? In fact Luhrmann is least interesting when most restrained as in the relatively stodgy Australia. And every breathlessly reported aspect of his Gatsby -- from the choice to re-create 20s New York in Australia to the decision to shoot in 3-D to the incorporation of Jay-Z-approved hip-hop and Ramp;B -- suggests he has opted not to rein in the excessive impulses that have served him well in the past. The film itself turns out to be an unapologetically garish riot of color and costumery parading before a restless camera and for a while Luhrmanns go-for-broke impulses serve him well. Where too many directors seem at a loss to turn 3-D to advantage Luhrmann uses it aggressively plunging viewers into Fitzgeralds Jazz Age metropolis and realizing opulently decorated homes bustling streets and an even more bustling underworld with equal care. In the films first act he turns the innocence-corroding journey of new-to-town narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire convincing as a wide-eyed innocent even as he advances well beyond Peter Parker age) into a mad rush of discovery. It will climax of course in that riotous party at the mansion of Nicks mysterious nouveau riche neighbor J. Gatsby a man much spoken of in the early going but little seen. When Luhrmann finally reveals the title character he does so as assorted partygoers work themselves into a frenzy Rhapsody in Blue pounds on the soundtrack and fireworks explode in the sky. Its a glorious bit of moviemaking that doubles as a master class in the fine art of going effectively over the top. Unfortunately the film is never again as successful; from here on it has to dig into the bothersome business of telling Fitzgeralds story. Monkey See Loving Gatsby Too Much And Not Enough Thats not the fault of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio makes for a fine Gatsby hiding behind the smile of a man who has set his world in order letting the smile slip when he thinks no one can see him. He uses charm graciousness and carefully practiced mannerism as bludgeon and shield as he defends the place he has carved out in a world hostile to dreamers strivers and self-inventing social climbers. As Tom Buchanan Joel Edgerton plays his polar opposite bringing a threatening physicality to the part of an entitled bully so secure about his place in the world as to believe it would seem justifiably that he can get away with virtually any kind of bad behavior. Only Carey Mulligan struggles in the role of Daisy the woman torn between the two men; a cipher on the page shes not easily rendered as flesh and blood on the screen even by an actress of Mulligans skill. i Under the watchful gaze of intrigued Midwesterner Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire left) and seething old-money scion Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) Gatsby pays court to Toms fascinated wife Daisy (Carey Mulligan). Your local English major can tell you how that works out. Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Under the watchful gaze of intrigued Midwesterner Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire left) and seething old-money scion Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) Gatsby pays court to Toms fascinated wife Daisy (Carey Mulligan). Your local English major can tell you how that works out. Warner Bros. Pictures Luhrmann takes great care with the rhythms of individual scenes yet the film as a whole plays like a long trudge through a familiar story. Though largely faithful the adaptations greatest liberty is a framing device that finds Nick composing a confessional account of his time with Gatbsy while being treated for alcoholism at a sanitarium. Its a nod to Fitzgeralds own life and it allows for large chunks of the novel to make it to the screen. It also gives the film a moralistic streak whose explicitness is alien to the source material; that nakedness underscores the gaps between the power of Fitzgeralds prose and that of Luhrmanns imagery however eye-catching. Theres a bit of Gatsby himself come to think of it in Luhrmanns filmmaking. As if insecure of his standing he keeps trying to dazzle even when the focus might be better placed on the emotions of the scene. (As Gatsby confronts Tom toward the end of the film the camera steps behind the blades of a fan as swooping noises fill the soundtrack presumably in case anyone was getting bored with all that heated dialogue.) Consequently the material never gets a moment to breathe. For all the filmmaking skill on display this Great Gatsby often feels more like a conceptual exercise than a thought-through take on the material. As the execution of an audacious concept its an impressive effort; as an attempt to distill the spirit of Fitzgeralds novel its a near-total failure. Luhrmann renders the green light on the Buchanans dock with retina-searing vividness but he never comes close to capturing its fatal allure.

"Great Gatsby The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; great-gatsby-the ) Great Gatsby The (Australia/United States 2013) May 09 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Great Gatsby is widely recognized as one of the best American novels of the 20th century although many remember it as a book we were forced to read in high school. Thus far there have been several attempts to convert the book into a movie (most notably the 1974 version starring Robert Redford) but none have been particularly successful in transforming the magic of the novel to the screen. Sadly this new version tarted up with 3-D effects and other kinds of audio and visual chicanery doesnt break the trend. Although the story is faithful (at least in broad strokes) to F. Scott Fitzgeralds tale theres a soullessness to the proceedings that saps it of energy. As unlikely as it might seem high-energy director Baz Luhrmann has in fact crafted a somnambulant motion picture. Obviously The Great Gatsby is a difficult novel to get right so one has to give Luhrmann credit for trying. Some of his choices are bizarre and there are times when the film seems to have morphed into the idiot stepchild of Moulin Rouge. The party sequences which feature music from the likes of Kanye West and Jay Z are so wildly out-of-step with the rest of the movie that they take the viewer completely out of the moment. Theres also a sense that maybe Luhrmann wanted to go further with these scenes (in terms of depicting debauchery) but was curtailed by the limitations of the PG-13 rating. The decision to film the movie in 3-D while not catastrophic isnt a good one since the problems of too-dim images and occasional motion blur diminish The Great Gatsbys look. And the occasional use of pop-up words on screen comes across as distracting and juvenile. This presentation of the story opens with an unnecessary framing device with Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) telling his tale to a psychologist in a sanitarium. It flashes back to 1922 New York and introduces the main characters. In addition to Nick who has moved to the city to sell bonds we meet his cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisys best friend Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki). Then theres Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) the wealthy mysterious man who lives in a mansion next door to the little cottage where Nick resides. Gatsby wastes no time in befriending Nick but he has ulterior motives. He wants his new buddy to arrange a tea party where he can ""accidentally"" encounter Daisy. As it turns out they were once very close and Gatsby wants to rekindle their former romance. As a book The Great Gatsby is a compelling read. As translated into movie form by Luhrmann its something of a struggle. The pacing is consistently off. The movie lurches along unevenly daring the viewer to remain invested and interested. Ultimately its hard to care about any of the characters. The period details when not compromised by the 3-D are nicely rendered. Still it doesnt really feel like the 1920s. There are too many out-of-period tweaks that dispel the illusion. Its one thing for Luhrmann to do this sort of thing in a fantasy/musical like Moulin Rouge but quite another thing to force-feed it into an adaptation of a revered drama. One of the great strengths of Fitzgeralds novel is that it presents a you-are-there window into the roaring 20s without peeking through the portal of The Great Crash and subsequent Great Depression. Thats one of the few things the 1974 adaptation got right; Luhrmann out of a need or desire to amp things up misses the mark here. Theres no arguing that Leonardo DiCaprio looks the part of Gatsby. The movies best material comes early when hes still a half-realized presence a silhouette on a dock or a half-glimpsed figure in a window. His ""unveiling"" is spectacular a stunning close-up of a smiling DiCaprio. After that however the actor has trouble inhabiting the character. His Gatsby experiences bouts of stiffness and when he says ""old sport"" theres a lack of conviction in the way the words are spoken. DiCaprios performance is better than Redfords but this is far from the definitive interpretation of Jay Gatsby. Tobey Maguire is fine as Nick but his function is more as an observer than a participant. Carey Mulligans Daisy is unremarkable in every way. And Joel Edgerton is just a mustache twirl away from doing a Snidely Whiplash impersonation. It would be interesting to know how fans of The Great Gatsby will respond to the movie because theyre the only ones likely to see it. In between the instances of excess there are moments of profound beauty and the novels themes about love wealth celebrity and power are intact. With Romeo + Juliet Baz Lurhmann was able to use his over-the-top style to make a classic exciting and relevant.

Comments (2) click to enlarge The Great Gatsby 3D Video Rated PG-13  142 minutes  2013 The Great Gatsby will always be an unfilmable novel because most of its drama resides in the space between the characters snappy dialogue and their unspoken feelings of ennui disappointment and despair. This may explain why transposed to the screen Gatsby tends to become the very thing it abhors a wild loud party. The hyperbolic Australian director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) is exactly the wrong person to adapt such a delicately rendered story and his 3D feature plays like a ghastly Roaring 20s blowout at a sorority house. Leonardo DiCaprio is typically fine in the title role grasping the deep insecurity that forces Gatsby to worship his lost love Daisy from a mansion across Long Island Sound but Tobey Maguire is too ingratiating to play Nick Carraway the storys actual protagonist whos enticed by the endless carousing at Gatsbys mansion but still rooted in the midwestern values the other characters have abandoned as hopelessly passe.

Its a visual medium. But comparisons cant be helped when said source is as celebrated and stubbornly resistant to movie adaptation as The Great Gatsby.F. Scotts Fitzgeralds Jazz Age tragedy is elliptical and internal despite its subjects outward extravagance. The prose shimmers even when the plotting plods. Naturally its siren song beckons the ambitious filmmaker.Baz Luhrmann is nothing if not ambitious and Gatsby lovers myself included have been lining up to express their fears over what the opulent Aussie might do to their favorite Old Sport. Will West Egg be sliced and diced a la Moulin Rouge in Luhrmanns rapid-edit Cuisinart? Are Scott and Zelda tippling in their graves with resentment?Stand down oh gatekeepers of the Great American Novel. Luhrmann hasnt unlocked the secrets of a story that remains all but unfilmable but his Gatsby is far more than a collection of superficial splashes and tics. The visual dazzle surprisingly enhanced rather than cheapened by the 3-D format proves a fine match for a story of deceptive surfaces and illusory aspirations. Just as important Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce make judicious trims (no drawn-out visit from Gatsbys dad) and fill in some of those ellipses so beguiling on the page but not designed for cinematic consumption.The terrific cast doesnt hurt. Leonardo DiCaprios Gatsby flashes the mercurial danger and duality that eluded Robert Redford in the faithful and dull 1974 version. He has a worthy match in Carey Mulligan who captures Daisys tricky mix of aching heart and basic shallowness. Joel Edgerton stalks and preens like a wolf as Daisys cuckolded husband Tom; he exudes what Fitzgerald described as the characters ""cruel body"" and ""gruff husky tenor.""Then theres Tobey Maguires Nick Carraway whom Ive always viewed as one of literatures overly trusting and unreliable narrators. In the most significant departure from the novel Nick narrates and writes the story from a sanitarium where hes recovering from among other ailments ""morbid alcoholism."" The diagnosis hints at the decadent rot that seeps through the cracks of the production design and costumes.The 3-D makes the characters look like figures in a pop-up book actors in a drama over which they have little control. The music blends period and contemporary a gambit that works sonically as long as it works thematically. When Nick and friends drive by a car filled with black passengers partying to the beats of Jay-Zs ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"" the use of hip-hop speaks to the storys aspirational themes and rebukes Toms rote white-supremacist prattling. This Gatsby is also consistently smart and explicit about the novels central conflict between old money and new.For all that works in The Great Gatsby the movie has no magical alchemy that turns a slender implacable work of prose into a forceful film narrative. Its a far more lively experience than that 1974 adaptation and please dont go near the 2000 TV movie. But Gatsby will always be a lean Sphinx of a novel whose power draws readers back again and again against the current for answers just out of reach. The best a filmmaker can do is step up and put a workable personal stamp on it and Lurhmann passes that test in suitable style.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.THE GREAT GATSBY(B) Directed by Baz Luhrmann.

At area theaters in 2-D and 3-D. Literary classics can be tricky even contested. The novels one generation of high-school students is fed might not be served to one or two removed. So we have at least one thing to be grateful for with the arrival of director Baz Luhrmanns lavishly hollow adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the mysterious owner of the grand abode in West Egg Long Island Carrie Mulligan as his beloved Daisy Buchanan and Tobey Maguire as his -- and a potent eras -- chronicler Nick Carraway. It may send audiences to F. Scott Fitzgeralds still-revelatory novel about American self-reinvention the arrogance of wealth and the dangerous dance of desire and boredom. The problems begin early with a framing device that finds Carraway recounting the story of Gatsby and the differently wealthy Buchanans from a sanitorium. Drink has had its way with him. Writing the story of Gatsby is his therapy. Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce are correct in thinking Fitzgeralds insights still resonate perhaps even more so given the great recession of 2008. Only they have offered their film as an example of the ways sensory overload drowns out moral nuance. You kids want ""Roaring 20s well show you roaring"" seems to be the call at the start. Luhrmann and cinematographer Simon Duggan make sure we know right away that ""Gatsby"" is a 3-D affair. Upping the ante Shawn Carter (better known as Jay-Z) is onboard as an executive producer to make sure the film hooks the younguns by using one of musics most inventive forms to introduce us to 1920s New York rap. After all present day hip-hop embodies the Gatsbys saga of the hardscrabble and the aspirational. The music (a great deal of it from the Bryan Ferry Orchestra) seldom meshes but it does suggest this film might make a very fine soundtrack. After a numbingly flashy start things settle considerably once Gatsby turns toward the camera. In every way Luhrmann treats DiCaprio as matinee idol. Its overblown at times but then so is Carraways early sense of his mysterious next door neighbor who doesnt drink but throws Bacchanalian parties all in the hopes it turns out hell be able to lure Nicks cousin Daisy Buchanan to his home. For his part DiCaprio brings Gatsbys ache -- misguided dogged tender -- to the fore. Hes a truer warmer more vulnerable Gatsby than Robert Redford was in the 1974 adaptation. Australian Joel Edgerton brings a brute muscularity to his rival Tom Buchanan whose certainty in his right to pretty much everything is seldom rattled. Luhrmann has made a lovely find with newcomer Elizabeth Debicki who portrays the observant but aloof athlete Jordan Baker Daisys friend from Louisville. Mulligans Daisy remains an elusive figure present and not present. Perhaps that is the point. After all the challenge of Fitzgeralds novel is that it really isnt the great love story movie-makers want it to be. Daisy is clearly not worthy of Gatsbys consuming and constant love. On this point the book is exquisitely contemporary asking what in romantic love is true and what in it is transferential? Even while being admirably faithful to so much of the novels language Luhrmann and Pearce still cant quite maneuver Carraways more cautionary contours about America. The people who show up uninvited to Gatsbys overstimulating soirees are roaring their engines toward the cliff of the 1929 crash unawares. While Gatsbys guests fiddle and dance and get bombed on illegally manufactured booze the inhabitants of the depressed and depressing area known as the ""ashheaps"" toil beneath the billboard gaze of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. They seem a lifetime away from the goings-on in Long Island and yet as is proved by the disaster that befalls gas station/garage owner George Wilson (Jason Clarke) and wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher) even -- especially? -- the little guy or gal can be reduced to road kill. At the end of ""The Great Gatsby"" Nick Carraway assesses the damage done. With glum honesty he judges the Buchanans ""careless people."" This ""Gatsby"" can hardly be judged careless. The production is too willful Catherine Martins costumes too beautiful and the acting too worked through for that. And yet as a piece of art it resides squarely on the side of the Buchanans of the world. Too taken with its own excess it misses an opportunity leaving an emptiness in its wake.

By Ann Hornaday May 8 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""Its like an amusement park."" Thats Nick Carraway the wide-eyed ever-present narrator of ""The Great Gatsby"" describing one of the legendary parties thrown by the movies fabulously wealthy and elusive title character. But Carraway could just as easily be referring to the very movie he finds himself in a hyper-real hyper-active hyperbolic adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel that spares no flower flapper or fringe in bringing Jazz Age decadence to throbbing life. It takes a singular brand of chutzpah to consider perhaps the greatest piece of American literature of the 20th century and say ""What this story needs is 3-D."" Australian director Baz Luhrmann is just that audacious staging Fitzgeralds tale of reinvention and self-deception as a 21st century visual spectacle and multiculti musical mash-up of Jay-Z George Gershwin and just about everything in between. For all of Luhrmanns swagger though the net effect is akin to seeing ""The Great Gatsby"" miniaturized its characters carefully choreographed against storybook illustrations of overworked perfection. Its glib to suggest that Luhrmann has made a ""Great Gatsby"" for idiots; its more like hes made it for infants who prefer their nourishment pre-masticated and their stories pictorialized by way of bright arresting images (baubles you can try to grab are always nice and help develop fine motor skills). By no means is ""The Great Gatsby"" a disaster Even at its most shallow the film rescues Jay Gatsby as a largely sympathetic romantic figure rather than a cynically ironic one. But neither is it necessary. Childlike fetishistic and painfully literal Luhrmanns experiment proves once again that its Fitzgeralds writing -- not his plot his characters or his grasp of material detail -- that has always made ""Gatsby"" great. Luhrmann acknowledges this fact with his use of familiar words from Fitzgeralds text which flit swim and scatter across the screen at pivotal moments. But like most of his stylistic flourishes theyre deployed more as an effect than a homage. As for the characters who populate ""The Great Gatsby"" -- the enigmatic title character his nouveau riche friends the old-money enclave he seeks to conquer and the woman who embodies his most cherished aspirations -- theyre little more than live-action props in Luhrmanns curiously lavish depiction of the wages of lavish living. Carey Mulligan brings less come-hither effervescence than glum self-reflection to the heedless Southern debutante Daisy Buchanan; if Joel Edgerton plays Daisys husband Tom with too-rough edges (hes a brute but still nominally well bred) he embodies the role with muscle-bound narrow-eyed menace. As Carraway -- whose reminiscences Luhrmann puts in an utterly gratuitous framing device of a sanitorium therapy session -- Tobey Maguire is his usual recessive presence barely registering as either a dynamic part of the events he describes or their watchful witness. Appropriately enough Gatsby himself remains offstage as ""The Great Gatsby"" gets underway finally making his dramatic entrance against a backdrop of fireworks to the strains of ""Rhapsody in Blue."" There are hints of Orson Welless Charles Foster Kane in Leonardo DiCaprios interpretation of Jay Gatsby (born James Gatz) whom he plays with a playful glint a boyish athletic bounce and labored diction that while appropriate to the shaky provenance of a parvenu sounds less a clever characterization than DiCaprios own ongoing struggle to convincingly play a grown-up. Still DiCaprio manages to possess and convey a human heartbeat within an otherwise unmemorable ensemble of players who as arrayed throughout Luhrmanns fussed-over production never come to fully inhabited life. Luhrmann uses 3-D less as a stunt than as a way to gain depth of field (attained in ""Citizen Kane"" -- that most ""Gatsby""-esque of stories -- through camera and lighting) as well as a comment on novelty technology and shifting aesthetic expectations. All of that makes perfect theoretical sense but results in a film that is more performative than immersive keeping the audience at a dreamlike emotionally distant remove. Like Nick were never quite ""within or without"" the opulent ethically compromised world he writes about. There are sensual pleasures to be found in ""The Great Gatsby"" -- Nicks vine-covered cottage next to Gatsbys Gothic mansion a confection-filled tea party where Jay and Daisy awkwardly reconnect the spangly noisy free-for-alls on Gatsbys famous blue lawn. But for all its devotion to surface sheen Luhrmanns ""Gatsby"" is strangely un-beautiful never becoming something genuinely new rather than an elaborately illustrated retelling. When hysteria finally gives way to fatalism the film itself seems to deflate tacitly suggesting that the storys most delicate complex moral reckonings are less interesting than flagrant consumerism and excess. Despite timely relevance enduring truths and Luhrmanns earnest efforts to make ""The Great Gatsby"" jump off the screen he -- and we -- finally cant help but fail to grasp it. Two stars. PG-13.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 9 2013 Save for later Saved The Great Gatsby stars Leonardo DiCaprio (l.) and Carey Mulligan (r.). Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If I were to choose the film director least temperamentally suited to adapt ""The Great Gatsby"" heading my list would be Baz Luhrmann the Australian impresario who gave us the assaultive ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" which was anything but the Bards.F. Scott Fitzgeralds great novel has been filmed five times before most notably (egregiously?) in 1974 starring Robert Redford as the enigmatic Jazz Age bootlegger and world-class romantic Jay Gatsby. In that performance Redford seemed to be confusing ""enigmatic"" with ""blank.""One clear advantage to this Luhrmannized version is that although Leonardo DiCaprio may be miscast and although he appears at times not quite old enough to shave at least hes not drearily enigmatic. He has his many moods dark and ethereal and extra crispy and given how Gatsby is constantly reinventing himself anyway this makes sense. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Almost nothing else in this sputtering Roman candle of a misfire does. Fitzgeralds sensibility is delicately nuanced but theres steel in his melancholy. With Luhrmann everything not just the parties but the intimate scenes turns into Mardi Gras. And to make matters worse hes filmed everything (pointlessly) in 3-D. For a director who has trouble making us care about anything in 2-D this takes chutzpah. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide But I can hear you ask why must Luhrmann serve Fitzgerald? Shouldnt he be able to reinvent this material just as Gatsby himself engineered his own make-over?Well if Luhrmann had a sustaining vision to match Fitzgeralds then perhaps he could be forgiven for turning a great novel about the American dream into a heap of glittering shards. Or turning the Roaring 20s into the Boring 20s.Luhrmann actually sticks fairly closely to Fitzgeralds narrative if not his spirit. Ensconced in his Gothic chateau in West Egg Long Island wearing pale pink suits that match up with his baby face Gatsby pines for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) the lost love who got away and whom he is trying to reclaim via his poor-relation neighbor Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) Daisys cousin. In a dubious switch from the book Nick narrates the movie from a sanitarium where he is evidently recovering from PGS - Post-Gatsby Syndrome.Luhrmann is most in his element when hes mounting party scenes so he piles them on. Its one thing to stage Jazz Age revels quite another to drown us in them. There is no perspective to any of this no sense of irony about what these rich gadabouts are gadding about. Luhrmann probably intends some kind of analogy with todays boom-bust era but hes so entranced by wealth that the film becomes not a darkling look at the American dream but a vast tribute to conspicuous consumption.And there is precious little jazz in this Jazz Age. Instead Luhrmann has larded the soundtrack with hip-hop and warblings by the likes of Beyonce and Andre 3000. His rationale is that jazz in Fitzgeralds day was the hot new sound but if heard today would sound antiquated to modern ears. So why not hip-hop instead?But isnt it the job of an artist to imaginatively transport us into a bygone era instead of yanking us out of it in order to seem ""relevant""? And doesnt Luhmann know that hip-hop isnt exactly the newest sound on the block anyway? Its been around for decades. Might his rationale have more than a little to do with pandering to a younger demographic? Im surprised he didnt also have his revellers texting each other during all those blaringly loud parties.None of these egregious choices would be fatal if at its core this ""Gatsby"" were intensely romantic. But Gatsbys ardor for Daisy despite some heavy contortions from DiCaprio comes across as blah and one-sided - Daisy never quite seems to know what to make of him. (Her bully-boy billionaire husband Tom played by Joel Edgerton certainly knows - worse than being a wife-stealer Gatsby reeks of New Money). Equally blah is Nicks sorrowing hero-worshipy idealization of Gatsby and his ""extraordinary capacity for hope."" We are meant to think by the end that the blasted Nick has somehow derived a valuable life lesson from Gatsbys broken dreams.So there you have it. ""The Great Gatsby"" isnt simply a classic American text In Luhrmanns hands its also the greatest self-help manual ever written.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com The Great Gatsby Share Comment At its best -- which sadly isnt often enough -- Baz Luhrmanns version of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel is a scandal. Its also in event and emotion (if not period fidelity) the most faithful movie version of the book to date. The two are not unconnected. Leonardo DiCaprio gives us the full Gatsby assured yet insecure and hes magnificent but the movie ends up romanticizing what Fitzgerald spent the book de-romanticizing. Anyone who has seen ""Moulin Rouge"" knows that Luhrmann lives for excess and he delivers in the movies opening hour aided immeasurably by the eye-popping costumes and production design of wife Catherine Martin. But over-length a swooningly indulged love story and a fatuous Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway bring it low. In 3-D.

Pictures / Bazmark Film III Pty Limited Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The Great Gatsby. The title raises two immediate questions one of which is easily answered. Why is Gatsby great? Because F. Scott Fitzgeralds 1925 novel embraces all the urgencies of the decade he dubbed ""the Jazz Age"" the fast cars and easy money the plentiful booze (Prohibition made liquor cheaper) and available sex the nexus of big business on Wall Street and in the underworld all appraised in luscious prose. Selling only 20000 copies in its first years of publication (Fitzgeralds first two novels The Far Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned each sold about 50000) Gatsby now moves that many copies every month. The book stays in print and in fashion because it addresses as scholar Matthew Bruccoli noted in the 2000 BBC documentary The Great Gatsby Midnight in Manhattan ""the ways in which the American dream has rewarded its believers and betrayed its believers."" Eighty-eight years after its publication Gatsby remains as modern youthful and shimmering as the creatures in it. A second thornier question Why is Gatsby great? Jay Gatsby a mysterious figure in Manhattan and Long Island lore attracts thousands of revelers to his sensational parties either because the guests dont know the source of his wealth or because they do and that knowledge gives them the thrill of vicarious outlawry. Born James Gatz (""gat"" was 20s slang for a gangsters pistol) to a Midwestern family of no particular means he reinvents himself as a bootlegger with a dandys suave manners. He accumulated all this swag and notoriety in hopes of winning back Daisy Fay the girl he left behind in Louisville and who is now married to the aristocratic brute Tom Buchanan. Nick Carraway Daisys second cousin and the books narrator sees greatness in Gatsbys abounding hope. But to Tom and perhaps to Daisy Gatsbys new money is tainted and so is he. (READ Our 1925 review of The Great Gatsby by subscribing to TIME) Any movie of Fitzgeralds novel has to take Nicks view that Gatsby is the noble man and Tom the thug; that Gatsbys ambition to reclaim Daisy is not new money chasing old but rather a romantic chivalric quest; and that the prize may not be worth the effort. Hollywood is well suited to dramatize these issues. It spends vast sums on the veneer of class swank luxe. It believes in the rogue warrior as hero and the beautiful rich girl as a slave who needs saving from her bondage to the evil prince. It loves love. It is Gatsby. The novel has inspired three big films starring Warner Baxter in 1926 Alan Ladd in 1949 and Robert Redford in 1974 none of which were thought to have located the books seductive elusive heart. (A special frustration of the 1949 version Tyrone Power was originally to have played Gatsby; and Gene Tierney Daisy -- stars whose allure matched their characters.) Because the notion of Hollywood has spread far beyond its Los Angeles borders it is fitting that the latest adaptation should be made in Australia by Baz Luhrmann whose riotous esteem for old movies informed his Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge Those two blood-red valentines to love and death bling and zing created their own gaudy grandeur as did Luhrmanns stage transformation of La Boheme which reached Broadway in 2002. (READ Corlisss review of Baz Luhrmanns Romeo + Juliet) Having plundered Shakespeare and Puccini for tales of fateful romance the director has reunited with his Romeo + Juliet star Leonardo DiCaprio (21 then 38 now) for a go at Gatsby. He chose Tobey Maguire as Nick Carey Mulligan as Daisy and Joel Edgerton as Tom. All are wise choices but casting was the easy part. Luhrmanns main challenge was either to find a visual equivalent for Fitzgeralds elegant prose -- the open secret of the books staying power -- or to bend the material to his own exotic strengths. He tries it both ways with varying degrees of success. The novels Nick has retreated to his own Midwestern home after his New York interlude to consider what made Gatsby great. In the movie Nick has taken residence in a sanitarium where he spills out the story to a Dr. Perkins (Jack Thompson whose character is named for Fitzgeralds editor Maxwell Perkins) and begins putting his thoughts on paper -- a memoir that will become The Great Gatsby. (READ Belinda Luscombes 10 Questions for Leonardo DiCaprio) For the films first half-hour Gatsby is known only through his parties and the outlandish stories that have turned his biography into instant urban legend. This early section shows Luhrmann rampant. Phones literally jiggle when they ring; passages from the novel are scrawled across the 3-D screen like fevered entries in a schoolgirls diary. The proletarian night town where Toms mistress Myrtle (Isla Fisher) lives with her mechanic husband George (Jason Clarke) is spiffed up with a black dude blowing sax on a fire escape across from the garage. The camera of cinematographer Simon Duggan seems to think it cant simply capture an image; it must wrestle it unconscious to the ground. It views a character from a ceiling perch or rushes breathlessly up to his face. Gatsbys parties are Ziegfeld Follies raised to orgasmic pitch. Hundreds of swells flappers and 20s celebrities (Gilda Gray Josephine Baker Cab Calloway) dance madly to purposefully anachronistic songs by Jay Z and Beyonce as the night sky erupts into fireworks and a blizzard of confetti. This is not so much the Jazz Age or even the Pizzazz Age as the Razzle-Dazzle Baz Age. The precision and economy of Fitzgeralds style (the book runs a spare 48000 words) get translated into the famous Luhrmann flair expressed in art-direction adjectives and visual exclamation points. (READ How Luhrmann Bazzed up La Boheme) In a way this excess of opulence suits the setting. From Wall Street to the Long Island suburb of West Egg where the mansion Gatsby owns abuts Nicks more modest rental to the old-money East Egg across the bay Fitzgeralds New Yorkers think too much is never enough. So more drink gamier sex posher clothes. (One scene from the novel has Daisy literally sobbing over the silk shirts Gatsby tosses her way.) To Nick and Gatsby -- country-mice renegades from a part of the country still cosseted by 19th-century scruples -- the big city is a Midass shiny Sodom. Gatsby in novel or film form shows a young mans instant attraction to a town radiant with promise and threat. Thats one thing the movies have always been able to do put the money on the screen. Gatsby when he finally materializes is money incarnate a true golden boy with a tan that George Hamilton or John Boehner would kill for. A nicer Howard Hughes (whom DiCaprio played in The Aviator) he does something that this serious actor who often seems to flee from his charm hasnt tried in ages smile. Gatsby claims to be from old money to have studied at Oxford and dabbled in painting like the best class of Americas postwar emigres in Europe. He calls Nick ""Old Sport"" in the Mid-Atlantic accent used by Broadway stars of the time. Nick can see through Gatsbys pretense but he warms to the native gentility the dogged hopefulness behind the affected airs and dirty business deals. If the story is about Gatsbys love for Daisy it is even more about Nicks love for Gatsby. The narrator has fallen for his new friends star quality. (READ What makes the first edition of The Great Gatsby so valuable?) With star quality goes car quality. The 20s was the first decade to make the automobile an essential embellishment to modern life and many folks imagined they had a professional racers agility. (In 1925 a few months after the book was published Pete DePaolo was the first driver to break an average speed of 100 mph at the Indy 500.) Gatsby in his yellow convertible and Daisy and Tom are carefree maniacs on the road scattering unwary pedestrians and other motorists who are the merest traffic cones to the rich and newly rich. One of these little people will stray into their careering path leading to the novels single spasm of carnage (""her left breast was swinging loose like a flap"") that even Luhrmann cannot bear to put in his movie. Another Fitzgerald message speed kills. When Gatsby the man seizes control from Gatsby the rumor Luhrmann slows down content to play out his and co-screenwriter Craig Pearces summary of the story. Its people talking in rooms -- gorgeously appointed rooms filled with smartly dressed folks. (Catherine Martin Luhrmanns wife was in charge of costumes and production design.) Hearts and flowers mountains of flowers eventually cede to heartbreak in the grand Luhrmann tradition and the actors emote up a summer storm. Maguires otherworldly coolness suits the observer drawn into a story he might prefer only to watch. DiCaprio is persuasive as the little boy lost impersonating a tough guy and Mulligan finds ways to express Daisys magnetism and weakness. (READ Corlisss review of Baz Luhrmann and Catherine Martins Moulin Rouge) Yet the emotions stirred here are not nearly so volcanic as those touched by DiCaprio and Claire Danes in Romeo + Juliet or by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge The reason might be that this time only one of the parties can imagine dying for love. But its also because Daisy understands that her feeling for Gatsby could be as fictional as the imaginary ideal he has tried to embody. When Nick says ""You cant repeat the past"" Gatsby replies ""Of course you can."" Nick is right. The man with a film stars charisma has fooled himself into thinking that life is a movie always reshootable and that his second chance with Daisy will be a more glorious Take Two. Thats why he occupies his West Egg castle which looks like an ornately decorated wedding cake prepared for the day he marries Daisy; its the perfect setting for a Hollywood happy ending. But money cant buy him love. At least new money cant. As Tom the old-money sadist explains to Gatsby ""Were different."" (READ Gatsbys Heirs in Movies and Fashion) ""The rich are different"" Fitzgerald said prompting Ernest Hemingways cynical response ""Yes they have more money."" But Fitzgerald was right The rich are different because they think theyve earned their money that it makes them American royalty unbound by the laws that govern the mass of people whom they notice only in passing contempt. Gatsby uses his connection with the Mayor of New York to wriggle out of a speeding ticket but thats just a minor perk of the new rich. The old rich as the book and this movie demonstrate can literally get away with murder. MILD END-OF-MOVIE-SPOILER ALERT Nick has completed the memoir of  his friend which he has called ""Gatsby."" He leans over the manuscript and as a final tribute and validation adds two words above the title ""The Great."" Fitzgeralds book has an enduring excellence a hold on readers of every generation that no movie version has yet been able to match. No question that Baz Luhrmann has concocted the worthiest tenderest and most extreme of these adaptations. It deserves to be called The Gatsby. Just not great.

The generations of students whove been force-fed F. Scott Fitzgeralds Jazz Age novel could not have imagined the 3-D technology and mash-up music used by Baz Luhrmann to revive the Roaring 20s.Like Luhrmanns ""Romeo + Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" ""The Great Gatsby"" is primarily an experiential film and not a work of social criticism. That might come as shock to Fitzgerald whose book was an artfully disguised time bomb flung at the moneyed elites with whom he hobnobbed but the young intended audience should think its a gas.The fabulously wealthy enigma named Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio aptly cast) is described as a beacon of hopefulness by his neighbor Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire overmatched). In a slight deviation from the novel Nick is now in a sanitarium recovering from recent events he transcribes for his doctor. In 1922 stockbroker Nick rode a wave of Wall Street euphoria to the nouveau riche enclave of West Egg on Long Island. Old-money bluebloods such as his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton) live across the bay in East Egg but Jay Gatsby has the grandest mansion of all from which he gazes across the water toward the estate of his lost love Daisy.After neighbor Nick is summoned to one of Gatsbys bacchanals the hosts asks him to arrange an afternoon tea party with Daisy whom young lieutenant Gatsby knew and loved in Louisville before the Great War separated them.Nick becomes the facilitator and witness of the rekindled affair which Daisy indulges because arrogant Tom is having a tryst with his auto mechanics earthy wife Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fischer). The tragic unraveling drags the last act of this overlong movie into a morass of overheated dialogue but before the infamous finale ""The Great Gatsby"" is both swooningly romantic and giddily energetic. Especially when he draws near to the ethereal Mulligan DiCaprio powers the plot with his smoldering movie-star charisma (and well excuse his faux upper-crusty accent as the characters affectation not his own).But just as the book is driven by language more than story the film is fueled by sounds and images.

From left Tobey Maguire Leonardo DiCaprio Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 9 2013 110 PM Title The Great Gatsby Film Info PG-13 Violence sexuality language. Area theaters. Like his ""Romeo + Juliet"" Baz Luhrmanns unabashedly flashy take on F. Scott Fitzgeralds revered novel will probably outrage the nations English teachers. But while this ""Gatsby"" cant by any standard be considered great it does have its glittering charms. It takes a while to get to them because Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce rely on a misguided framing device. Our distressed narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recollects the story from a sanitarium. As he looks back we swoop down onto 1922 Long Island where Nicks cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) lives with her brutish husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). Nick himself lives across the bay next door to the mysterious Jay Gatsby. Leonardo DiCaprio captures the turmoil within one of literatures most enigmatic characters. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Though Gatsby has long been in love with Daisy his humble rural roots were no match for Toms patrician lineage. But after years apart he has transformed himself into a millionaire one finally suitable -- he assumes -- for an ethereal debutante like Daisy. If you havent read the book in a while wait until after you see the movie. That way you can appreciate Luhrmanns frankly superficial approach without focusing on what he leaves out (Nicks romance with Jordan Baker) or adds in (unmistakable parallels to another decayed American dream ""Citizen Kane""). Leonardo DiCaprios Jay Gatsby yearns for Carey Mulligans Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. (Daniel Smith) It would certainly be easy for a Fitzgerald fan to find fault. The themes are spelled out with all the refinement of Cliffs Notes. The CGI gimmicks add nothing relevant (skip the 3-D ticket). And few of the actors seem at all comfortable amid the decadence. Maguire who does have the wry observational skills needed for Nicks Midwestern decency is directed toward a wide-eyed one-note performance. Mulligan doesnt expand much further but her pretty inaccessibility suits Daisy. Tobey Maguire (seated) as narrator Nick Carraway; standing are Isla Fisher and Joel Edgerton as Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) As the pathetic husband of Toms garish mistress (Isla Fisher) hulking Jason Clarke is completely miscast. Elizabeth Debicki looks great but does nothing as languorous golfer Jordan. And Edgertons Tom all but twirls his mustache in cartoonish villainy. This role requires an actor who understands the ties that bind Tom and Daisy -- Armie Hammer might have been perfect. But the Australian-born Edgerton makes no distinction between old money and new getting his crucial part utterly wrong. Catherine Martins production design is suitably rich. From left Leonardo DiCaprio Tobey Maguire and Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Still for those willing to go with the champagne flow this version has undeniable allure. The party scenes are dazzling spectacles only studio money could buy. The contemporary soundtrack which combines jazz with Jay-Z suggests some timeless connections. The Prada costumes and extravagant set design -- by Luhrmanns wife Catherine Martin -- are astoundingly gorgeous. Luhrmann has created an experience in other words not unlike the events Gatsby throws himself. Of course an empty experience is nothing more than a soul-crushing corruption so its a good thing weve got Leonardo DiCaprio at the movies core. At first he does seem stilted and unnatural. But then you watch him drop the artifice -- every time Daisy enters the room -- and realize how carefully conceived his portrayal really is. Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan in The Great Gatsby (Courtesy of Warner Bros.) Luhrmann piles on one shiny distraction after another. But amid all the seductively gaudy excess DiCaprio finds both the heart and hurt buried within one of literatures everlasting enigmas. Magic moment Gatsby and Nick visit a hidden speakeasy. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags negative review Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Call it ""The Grating Gatsby."" Although the incurably exuberant Baz Luhrmann had the glitter factories and sequin mines working overtime his glitzed-up ""Gatsby"" is dishwater dull. Because he has an eye for spectacle but is deaf to emotional detail he has turned an exquisitely told story of doomed romance into a 3-D production with all the depth of a pop-up book. Given his track record of exhilarating success with flashy music videos like ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" and train-wreck failure with more narrative projects like his incoherent epic ""Australia"" we might have expected subtle literary material to be beyond his grasp. But who would have predicted that Luhrmann the P.T. Barnum of supercharged excess would make Jazz Age decadence such a drag? Like Gatsbys overheated fantasy of his unattainable beloved Luhrmann has decked out his film ""with every bright feather that drifted his way."" The cheerful dissonance of watching flappers and swells rave to Jay-Z quickly fades and the movie plods on like a sixth-period American Lit class. Leonardo DiCaprio (a heartthrob lead for Luhrmanns 1996 ""Romeo + Juliet"") plays mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby whose all-night soirees at his palatial West Egg manse attract the cream (and dregs) of New York society. Hes the subject of wild rumors many circulated by himself. Chasing his blinkered vision of the American dream he reinvents himself and racks up riches outside the law. Tobey Maguire is our narrator Nick Carraway here an onscreen stand-in for F. Scott Fitzgerald writing a memoir of his encounters with Gatsby while riding out ""morbid alcoholism"" at a snowbound Midwestern sanitarium. Ethereal Carey Mulligan is Daisy Buchanan Nicks second cousin and Gatsbys object of desire. Joel Edgerton is her possessive old-money husband Tom whose baleful squint and Hitler-style mustache sum up his character. Each of them seems to be acting in a different movie. DiCaprio conveys Gatsbys passion with a gaze that suggests advanced constipation. Mulligan operates in two modes -- Doe-Eyed Stare for languid moments and Mascara Eruption for high drama. Edgerton attacks every line of dialogue like a bull in a porcelain showroom. Maguire drifts through his performance with the vacant smile of a forgettable lad sitting for his high school portrait. Warner Bros. Pictures Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby in ""The Great Gatsby."" Fitzgeralds novel is a peculiar mix of staggeringly literal symbolism (the billboard eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg occulist launched a million term papers) and oblique psychology. The main character is a cipher. What the players think can be inferred though only up to a point by the epigrammatic things they say. The films solution to these difficulties is to pull out every visual gimmick from period newsreel footage to Mach-10 zooms. Wall Streets pre-Crash jitters are invoked by two separate point-of-view shots from the cockpits of airplanes power-diving toward the financial districts sidewalks. Because one just wouldnt make the point. The ever-writhing camera captures some powerful images. After a teasing half-hour offscreen DiCaprio makes his entrance to an orchestral burst of Gershwin and a volley of fireworks. More often Lurhmanns grand gestures are unrelated to the emotional point of a given scene like exclamation points randomly strewn throughout a sentence. Luhrmanns notion of honoring Fitzgeralds text is to type out key phrases on the screen and stereoscopically float the letters out over our heads. Like Fitzgeralds narrator watching this gaudy mess ""I was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled."" But mostly? Bored.

Slideshow A dizzying display of excess Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Video Trailer The Great Gatsby More about The Great Gatsby >> There I was in the dark with 3-D glasses on and every time Tobey Maguire appeared - boyish and bug-eyed and often bow-tied too as Nick Carraway the optimistic observer of F. Scott Fitzgeralds Roaring Twenties tragedy - Paul Reubens kiddie-show character sprang to mind. Luhrmann would have been better served with Pee-wee as his Yale grad and World War I vet ensconced in a carriage house on the grounds of Jay Gatsbys lavish Long Island estate. Pee-wee certainly would have brought more heft to the role than Maguire does and that trademark titter would have mixed nicely into the cacophonous party scenes when the flappers start flapping and the confetti pours down over the swimming pool. (And Beyonce and Lana Del Rey get all moody and techno on the Jay-Z-produced soundtrack.) Pee-wee could have invited Cowboy Curtis over to pop some champagne too. Why not? Luhrmann the Australian auteur of Moulin Rouge fame wouldnt know the meaning of the aphorism ""less is more"" if somebody beat him over the head with it. And somebody should. Yes The Great Gatsby is a novel about wealth and excess the empty lives of the rich and glamorous and so the fixtures and fittings of the rich and glamorous must be examined the loose low-cut lovely dresses the bespoke suits the boaters (and the boats) the roadsters and coupes the mansions and hotel suites. And all of this Luhrmann and his crew have captured with obsessive detail. But Fitzgeralds 1922 classic evoked this shimmering sphere with language that was clean and precise beautifully turned but not conspicuously beautiful. Many of Fitzgeralds lines make it into Luhrmanns screenplay and into Maguires mouth - and in a distracting show of 3-D gimmickry onto the screen itself letters and words that bob and weave in superimposed mode as Carraways old Remington taps out his climactic account of Gatsby and the disaster that unfolds. (The movies narrative-flashback device - Nick Carraway writing his account while lodged in an asylum suffering from a nervous disorder or depression - is pretty lame. The story is his therapy the audience his analyst) Gatsby in case you havent heard is played by Leonardo DiCaprio an actor whose earnestness can be measured by the furrows on his brow. He is a solitary swell a millionaire whose millions remain a mystery - how did he come by his money? The world wants to know. Gatsby is driven to distraction by Carraways fair cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who lives across the bay with her Old Money husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby courted her before she wed. He assigns Carraway the task of inviting Daisy over for tea. Gatsby will make an appearance and by his reckoning steal her away from the lug she cant possibly love. There have been other stabs at Fitzgeralds book a lost silent production with Warner Baxter as Gatsby a few years after the novel was published; Alan Ladd as Gatsby in a 1949 version; and Robert Redford as Gatsby in the Francis Ford Coppola-scripted 1974 production a handsome but bland affair. But none can be deemed as audaciously miscalculated as this. There are so many things wrong with Luhrmanns Great Gatsby - the filmmakers attention-deficit-disorder approach the anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing the choppy elision of Fitzgeralds plot the jarring collision of Jazz Age cool and Millennial cluelessness. But at the crux of things the problem is that its impossible to care Mulligan makes for a breathy muse (at times she seems to be doing Marilyn Monroe) and she is sad-eyed and stylishly sylphlike. But her Daisy is skin-deep. And Maguires performance is callow and shallow. DiCaprios Gatsby is an empty man and while its a challenge to convey the spiritual void without merely appearing vacant DiCaprio isnt up to the task. (Mad Mens Don Draper is another figure on the 20th century American landscape who has remade himself reimagined himself and who remains haunted by his past. But Jon Hamm pulls this off.) This Jay Gatsby is just a man with some very fine suits and a cross-eyed look of doom. To borrow a line from Fitzgeralds book (from an indignant Tom Buchanan) he truly is Mr. Nobody from Nowhere.

Opening May 10 at GTA theatres. 143 minutes.Baz Luhrmanns 3D movie camera swoops and dives through the lavish party The Great Gatsbyscenes of The Great Gatsby so much so you wonder how he resisted adding the exclamation mark he employed for Moulin RougeThe Aussie director and showman is in his element whenever the lens turns towards opulence which this production provides by the golden bucketload jewelry by Tiffany clothes by Prada Miu Miu and Brooks Brothers cars by Rolls-Royce and Duesenberg anachronistic hip-hop curated by Jay-Z.Article Continued BelowMore from thestar.comWhy The Great Gatsby looks like Titanic -- and its not just Leonardo DiCaprioFive things you didnt know about The Great GatsbycommentsThe Great Gatsby the movie boosts sales of The Great Gatsby the bookAnd vertigo by Luhrmann we might add (and warn). He never tires of the crane shot gazing down on the Jazz Age decadence of flappers financiers and finaglers like a hungry seagull looking for an oyster to grab -- and lets hope its not just an empty shell.In this he is of like mind with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) the title anti-hero of F. Scott Fitzgeralds classic American novel of 1925. The corn-fed Gatsby is equally restless described in the book by his friend and enabler Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as ""never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.""DiCaprio is the right man to play Gatsby possessing the same earnest desire to please and determination to succeed as Fitzgeralds celebrated striver. Its a marvel to behold him -- lit him from behind with exploding fireworks in one of many great party moments -- and to see how much hes matured since the youthful frolics of Romeo + Juliet his 1996 breakthrough role and first film with Luhrmann.Leonardo now has a few lines on his face a few extra pounds on his frame and a glint in his eye that hints at guilty pleasures and secrets. Its a vast improvement on Robert Redfords mostly vacant look in the role in the 1974 production that until now was the most celebrated attempt to adapt Fitzgeralds deceptively simple book to the big screen.Gatsby is described as a mystery by his perpetual party guests -- is he war hero mobster spy or murderer? -- but in truth hes as plain as his bone-white attire and as obvious as his ostentatious Long Island mansion.The nouveau riche Gatsby formerly of North Dakota throws his parties not for personal amusement but in the hope of enticing an appearance by Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) his lost love. While he was busy fighting World War One and later making his millions five long years before this summer of 1922 Daisy was marrying Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) a wealthy thug who boldly carries on an affair with blowsy hotsie Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) reluctant wife of auto mechanic George (Jason Clarke).Daisy and Tom reside in East Egg an old-money preserve across the bay from Gatsbys newly affluent West Egg (both locales are fictional). From his dock Gatsby can see the green dock light of Daisys mansion a signal that both beckons and warns. He forlornly looks out across the water each night dreaming of what might have been -- and what he still hopes will be.The connective link between these self-absorbed people is Nick a modest writer and aspiring financier whose cheap summer cottage rental places him right next door to Gatsbys palace. Nick is Daisys second cousin and he went to Yale with Tom.Nick also serves as the storys narrator and Luhrmanns sole major textual change (with co-writer Craig Pearce) has Nick as a recovering alcoholic making a therapeutic confession to a sanitarium shrink.When the excitable Mr. Gatsby learns of Nicks ties to Daisy he conspires a flower-strewn luncheon rendezvous with Nicks cottage as the literal halfway house. The game is on as they say but if hypocritical Tom finds out whats going on the jig will be up.The story has ample drama to chew upon and Fitzgerald did so in remarkably few pages -- The Great Gatsby is more novella than novel. Yet its here where Luhrmann suddenly loses his nerve.Having done so well with the look of the picture -- which is also due in large part to Luhrmanns wife and collaborator Catherine Martin the films production designer and costumer -- he settles for merely filming the book rather than illuminating it.He pairs his inspired male lead with an uninspiring female one. Mulligans Daisy is ""a beautiful little fool"" to use the famous Fitzgerald phrase and she has as much substance as the windblown white curtains that wrap around her at first glimpse. This isnt entirely Mulligans fault since Daisy is intended to be a figure more of male fantasy than female reality and the character hasnt aged well over decades of gender-equity recalibrating.Precious little screen time is allotted the only two flesh-and-blood women in the film feisty Myrtle and fast-quipping Jordan Baker a golf pro played by Aussie actress Elizabeth Debicki whom well hopefully see more of in the future.Luhrmann almost gets away with the conjurers trick that is his TheGreat Gatsby because the film looks so damned good even though the 3D adds nothing of substance. It will play very well in Cannes next week when the film opens the annual festival of glamour and cinephilia.But then we get the climactic scene in a New York Hotel room when Gatsby and Tom are having their gloves-off ""row"" and we get a flash of the real fire that resides inside DiCaprio.Were also reminded of what this movie could have been had not Luhrmann hit the autopilot switch and allowed Fitzgerald to do all the dramatic thinking for him.And maybe thats Fitzgeralds grandest achievement of all writing a book that continues to fascinate while denying total access like Daisys mystical green light across the bay.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The Great Gatsby By Peter Travers May 9 2013 More News Great Gatsby Is Artificial and Boring All Stories >> More News Great Gatsby Is Artificial and Boring All Stories >> Shush. Listen. Thats F. Scott Fitzgerald turning in his grave. Fitzgeralds 1925 The Great Gatsby a Jazz Age tale of sex lies and conspicuous consumption is a great American novel maybe the greatest. But the tale of dirt-poor Jay Gatsby reinventing himself to win the woman he loves has defied five attempts at filming. Try staying awake during the 1974 version with Robert Redford. Enter Aussie director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) to make the sixth time the charm. He brought visionary zest to Shakespeare in 1996s Romeo + Juliet. So why not cast his screen Romeo Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby? Add DiCaprios pal Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway Gatsbys friend and the narrator of the story and the stellar Carey Mulligan as Daisy Gatsbys fantasy made flesh in lush gowns and jewels. Luhrmann digitally re-created New York in Australia (for tax purposes) shot in 3D (God knows why) and brought in Jay-Z to amp up the soundtrack (nothing like hip-hop to add relevance to a retro classic). Shush. Listen. Thats blind ambition being gutted by flawed execution. Aside from the staggering beauty of Catherine Martins costumes nothing works. The actors are buried in the art direction along with feeling. The film looks as sti ff and lifeless as a posh store window. Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce take risks by conceiving Nick as an alcoholic writing the novel in an asylum. That made me crazy. But not as much as hearing Maguire narrate a scene and then speak it as dialogue as Luhrmann turns the words into display type that pops o ff the screen in 3D. There may be worse movies this summer than The Great Gatsby but there wont be a more crushing disappointment.

Scott Fitzgeralds story about the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1028 p.m. EDT May 8 2013Jazzy visuals drown out the subtlety of the classic American novel.Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan star in The Great Gatsby.(Photo f Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Leonardo DiCaprio Carey Mulligan Tobey Maguire Joel EdgertonRated PG-13; 2 hours 23 minutes; opens Thursday night in select theaters and Friday nationwideFrenzied and overwrought Baz LuhrmannsThe Great Gatsby is a glitz-filled folly.The director has fashioned a gaudy long-form music video -- all kaleidoscopic spectacle and little substance -- rather than a radiant new take on an American literary classic.F. Scott Fitzgeralds epic tragedy is lost amid the lavish excess ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday night in select theaters and Friday nationwide).So much effort seems to have gone into the eye-popping production design swooping camera work and anachronistic musical score that the result is hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment.For those who dont remember their high school English classes The Great Gatsby is the tale of the mysterious self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby as seen through the eyes of his next-door neighbor Nick Carraway.Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) has bought an impossibly luxurious mansion on Long Island for one purpose to grab the attention of Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) the socialite he has obsessively loved since they courted five years before. He throws outlandishly sumptuous parties in the hopes that one day she will stop by.FASHION In Great Gatsby polished fashion pizzazz prevailsGUIDE USA TODAYs Summer Movie CalendarMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYDaisy is married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and lives across the water from Gatsby. Nick (Tobey Maguire) is her distant cousin. When Gatsby learns of their connection he persuades Nick to invite Daisy to tea intent on rekindling her affections.For a while their passion flares but things end badly for this party-hearty bunch.Luhrmann is drawn to tales of impossible love -- see his William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge So Gatsby would seem to be in his wheelhouse. But while his version is undeniably resplendent the storys emotional beats fall flat.In the novel when no one shows up for Gatsbys final gathering its a poignant moment. But in the movie that scene is almost glanced over.The performances are generally lackluster. DiCaprio has some of the haunted qualities of Gatsby but also comes off as dully aloof. He and Mulligan lack chemistry. Edgerton plays the role of Tom as if twirling a villains mustache. Maguire is serviceable but bland.Luhrmanns 3-D visual flourishes feel superfluous Occasionally words pop out across the screen as Nick feverishly writes Gatsbys tale and feathers confetti and streamers fly toward the audience during Gatsbys orgiastic soirees. None of it contributes to a sense of immersion.The melange of hip hop pop and jazz might have worked if the rest of the film hadnt been bent on overkill. Interspersing the music of Jay-Z Beyonce and Lana Del Rey makes commercial sense for attracting young audiences. But it feels more calculated than artfully integrated.The film conveys the decadence of a moneyed crowd in the Roaring 20s. But nothing about the story is moving or remotely subtle. While it can be argued that Fitzgerald employed rather overt symbolism his words were also marked by nuance which Luhrmann essentially obliterates.A key scene stands out for its significance Gatsby takes Daisy on a tour of his estate. Elated to have her in his house and conscious of his vast wealth he goes into his bedroom pulls out dozens of custom-made tailored shirts and throws them on the bed. Daisy buries her face in the shirts and sobs at their beauty.Its as if Luhrmann used that scene for his template. His version of The Great Gatsby is stylish colorful material piled on in excess and tinged with overheated melodrama. 208 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/143yTotSummer Movies Calendar MayTake a look at the films heading to the box office this May complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Leonardo DiCaprio is The Great Gatsby and the mystery at its core (WARNER BROS.) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 09 2013 at 658 AM updated May 09 2013 at 437 PM comments This is what the novel ""The Great Gatsby"" is about. The American dream of constant self-creation self-made status identity you slip on as easily as a pale pink suit. The strange dreamland of the past which paradoxically both fades and strengthens with time. The small childs belief that we can have anything we want if we just want it badly enough. And the movie ""The Great Gatsby"" gets that mostly. This is what the novel ""The Great Gatsby"" is not about. Eye-popping explosions of 3D which coupled with extreme closeups push peoples faces at us like the attractions at a carnival. A madmans mix of music that throws together Gershwin jazz Jay-Z hip-hop and a Bach fugue. Black extras used like exotic props there only to serve and sweat or leer and shimmy. And that is what the movie ""The Great Gatsby"" is in love with. There are good things in it. Theres Leonardo DiCaprio as the title character the poor little farmboy who put on an officers uniform briefly won and lost the heart of a girl and then made an outrageous (and illegal) fortune in the hopes of winning her back. Gatsby is himself a kind of movie star; the role requires one to work and the golden DiCaprio is that arriving on screen to literal fireworks and a surge of romantic music. But Gatsby is slightly absurd too -- his completely unembarrassed and breathlessly shallow consumerism his awkwardly stilted speech his way of calling everyone ""old sport."" It sounds fake but thats because it is and DiCaprio instinctively understands the mirror act as well -- hes an actor playing an actor playing a role. Carey Mulligan plays the unobtainable unforgettable Daisy in The Great GatsbyWARNER BROS. Carey Mulligan is even better as Daisy Buchanan one of the most difficult characters in Fitzgeralds fiction. She insists early on that to be happy in this life a woman should be ""a beautiful little fool"" -- but thats only because this sadly wilted Daisy knows what being smart has brought her. For she was never quite as impractical as the dashing penniless soldier who asked her to wait. And this is the broken heart of ""The Great Gatsby"" because it was the wound Fitzgerald carried and always would -- the knowledge from those first days at Princeton that money made its own luck and that without it he would never be more than the smartest nicest poor boy that the beautiful rich girls ever smiled at for a moment before moving away. Those two performances are -- have to be -- the center of the movie and DiCaprio and Mulligan dont disappoint. But Joel Edgerton is too loud and blustery at first as Tom Buchanan (its no fault of his; director Baz Luhrmann loves huge overbearing theatrical entrances) and Tobey Maguire remains pale and goggle-eyed as our narrator Nick. Worse the movie crams it all into an unnecessary frame with him telling us Gatsbys story from behind the walls of a sanitarium. Its like ""The Cabinet of Mr. Nick Carraway."" But these are of course only the supposed stars. The real star of any Baz Luhrmann film must be Baz Luhrmann. And he wears out his welcome very early. The 3D for example adds a little to some scenes -- particularly the simultaneous nearness and distance of Daisys house across the bay. But then Luhrmann makes the effect superfluous by going for lots of closeups and a very shallow depth of field. Background characters are either lost in the mists or brought suddenly startlingly to the foreground. And the much-vaunted hip-hop soundtrack -- well to begin with it isnt nearly as novel as Luhrmann has convinced himself. (There was a 2005 movie ""G"" -- which everyone seems to have forgotten -- which even made Gatsby a rap mogul.) But neither do the tunes add anything. The soundtrack of the era -- ""Oh the rich get rich and the poor get poorer"" -- was perfect as it was. In the end the modern musics just another unnecessary flourish -- like the slow-motion of a car crash (shown twice) the faded wartime flashbacks or the falling shards of glass that glitter like snowflakes. At one point as Nick starts writing about Gatsby -- and the movies crudest conceit is that Nick is a would-be novelist and a direct stand-in for Fitzgerald himself -- words even appear on the screen. Then they fade. But some words wont. And ""The Great Gatsby"" -- the real Gatsby -- never will as like boats against the current new readers are borne ceaselessly back into its prose.

Thats because all of his effort to get The Great Gatsby on film -- at the cost of a reported 127 million -- echoes the theme of that whale story a man obsessed with using all of the artistic harpoons in his arsenal to land the big one and coming up if not empty then short of the mark.Yet Luhrmanns highly stylized Gatsby -- Hollywoods fifth attempt to turn F. Scott Fitzgeralds perennial high-school homework assignment into a theatrical film or telemovie -- is always visually resplendent. For Luhrmann style is substance as he proved to great effect in his 1996 update of Romeo and Juliet. Its just too bad that this Gatsby unlike his fling with Shakespeare is so emotionally inert that theres little beneath the gleaming surface.By now everyone knows the story Its the roaring 20s and young impressionable Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) moves to Long Island to find himself the neighbor of a reclusive millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio).The only thing most people know about Gatsby is that he throws lavish parties and its at one of these that Carraway makes the big mans acquaintance and becomes embroiled in his life -- which isnt quite as grand as the all the fireworks champagne shiny roadsters and jazz (here rendered with a hip-hop swing) make it out to be.Gatsby is hopelessly in love with his neighbor across the bay Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who happens to be Nicks cousin. Trouble is shes married to an oafish old-money snob Tom (Joel Edgerton). So Nick who narrates the film as a long flashback has a front-row seat to the inevitable meltdown.Luhrmann puts so much emphasis on postmodern pizzazz and distancing artifice -- the anachronistic music the needless use of 3-D -- that much of the humanity gets buried especially in the first half of the film. His casting doesnt help. DiCaprio although he tries mightily doesnt possess the physical gravitas that someone as charismatic as Gatsby should have. And Maguire simply lacks the range to make Nick believable. The fact that theres no heat from the romantic flame thats supposed to be kindled when Gatsby and Daisy are together only underscores the problem.Edgerton (Animal Kingdom Zero Dark Thirty) does his best to bring some muscular energy to the role of Tom and the film improves in the less visually busy second half where Luhrmann gives his actors room to breathe.Yet if the book can be read as a treatise on America and the shimmering mirage of the American dream little of that comes through in the film.Still there are some wonderfully staged moments Gatsbys entrance to fireworks and Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue near the beginning his plunge into a pool near the end and all those Busby Berkeley-meets-P. Diddy parties in between.The perfectionist Luhrmann -- who has only made five feature-length films in 21 years -- captures the exterior excesses of Gatsbys life but overlooks the interior torment that fuels them. Without the latter Gatsby is less a film and more of a salute to production design. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Share Tweet Baz Luhrmann believes in green lights--along with orgiastic parties racing roadsters and 3-D visuals that might pop even the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. Moulin Rouges fearless taste-destroyer may seem like a tacky fit for one of the undisputed masterpieces of American literature. Still the director has often scored when hes gone highbrow. Like Romeo + Juliet (1996) Luhrmanns version of The Great Gatsby emerges as a half-reverent half-travestying adaptation thats campy but not a betrayal offering a lively take on a familiar work while sacrificing such niceties as structure character and nuance. In Baz-world theres nothing illogical about mixing Jay-Z with F. Scott Fitzgeralds cynical portrait of Jazz Age values. (The rapper executive-produced.) Luhrmanns take on Jay-G begins with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) writing from a sanitarium that--for 3-D purposes--seems to have been constructed inside a giant snow globe. Flash back to Long Island where a single tracking shot carries viewers from West Egg across the bay hitting a sail. Cut to East Egg Here in the opulence of the Buchanan mansion Carey Mulligans Daisy appears amid a preposterously luxe flutter of billowing curtains. Every party is a bacchanal--and for an hour the nonstop flow of liquor steroidal Busby Berkeley setpieces and swirling confetti are enough to keep the movie engaging. For once Luhrmanns gaudiness serves his material. The flagrantly fake New York backdrops--the movie was largely shot at Sydneys Fox Studios--seem oddly appropriate for a story concerned with artifice and ostentatious wealth. (The real director to make this movie was Douglas Sirk.) The casting is also inspired Introduced with a flourish of Gershwin Leonardo DiCaprio finds the right blend of self-doubt and assurance as Gatsby and hes well-matched with the similarly ageless Maguire. Fresh face Elizabeth Debicki exudes appeal as brassy Jordan Baker and Joel Edgerton is especially strong as brutish Tom Buchanan. Only Zero Dark Thirtys Jason Clarke flustered as cuckolded George Wilson cant find the right register of stylization. None of this should be discounted given the checkered history of screen Gatsbys most notably 1974s stuffy Robert Redford vehicle and an intriguing 1949 version that accentuates the novels affinities with film noir. Still whatever else The Great Gatsby may be--a jaundiced retort to the American Dream a love story of sorts between two men an influence on reinvention stories touching everything from James M. Cain to Mad Men--its not the great romance Luhrmann apparently had in mind as a selling point. Unsurprisingly the movie grinds to a halt the minute Daisy and Gatsby reunite. Luhrmann and co-screenwriter Craig Pearce milk the pairs dalliance for far more than its worth an emphasis at once plodding and pandering. Eager to show reverence by scrawling large chunks of Fitzgeralds language on screen the filmmakers seem less interested in subtext class issues or much beyond the opportunities the novel provides for spectacle. While it gets points for a Sunset Blvd. homage even the finale goes soft. The movie leaves the sense that like Gatsby himself Luhrmann has bought the book without cutting the pages.

"The Great Gatsby Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Great Gatsby Leonardo DiCaprio cant save flat Great American novel depiction  Images from Baz Luhrmanns film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel. REVIEW Gatsbys substance overwhelmed by Luhrmanns style Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Even if its true lets forget the ""great American novel"" business regarding ""The Great Gatsby"" for a minute. What makes F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel published in the spring of 1925 but set three years earlier such a haunted portrait of a time a place and a Lost Generation dream?The works spellbinding qualities I think lie less with the beauty of the prose (although God knows its beautiful and not just on the surface) than with the psyche of the author so eager to sum it all up and explain the Jazz Age mania and conspicuous consumption and reckless self-deluding love. By most accounts Fitzgerald was a touchy insecure alcoholic (dead by 44) who craved the critical respect and popularity that despite his success remained just out of reach -- ungraspable like the light at the end of Daisy Buchanans pier across the bay. Writing about the mysterious Jay Gatsby through the eyes of Daisys cousin Nick Carraway Fitzgerald was wrestling with a gorgeous illusion of a man. The author who completed ""Gatsby"" while living on the Cote dAzur in the south of France with his fatally ""colorful"" wife Zelda never completely resolved his feelings of envy and of contempt for the Gatsby crowd nor of his own uneasy self-regard. He knew what it meant to be on the outside looking in even when he was in.""When I like men I want to be like them"" Fitzgerald once wrote. ""I want to lose the outer qualities that give me my individuality and be like them. I dont want the man; I want to absorb into myself all the qualities that make him attractive and leave him out."" Were very close to Patricia Highsmiths Mr. Ripley here. None of that for director and co-adapter Baz Luhrmann. Its party time Despite a few good ideas and the uniformly splendid production and costume designs by Luhrmanns mate and partner Catherine Martin this frenzied adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" is all look and no feel.If you liked ""Moulin Rouge"" -- Luhrmanns hyperactive ode to Paris at the end of the 19th century -- youll probably find a lot to admire here. In fragments the look is enough. Our first clear vision of the bootlegger? Murderer? Stock manipulator? Gatsby portrayed as a 100 variations on the theme of Arrow Collar perfection by Leonardo DiCaprio is beyond grand opera. On his veranda the fireworks booming behind him on cue Gatsby turns and announces himself and bang Gerswhins ""Rhapsody in Blue"" reaches its climax. Theres really nowhere to go from there.And yet the story has just begun to tell itself. Working with co-writer Craig Pearce Luhrmann invents scenes with Nick played by a diffident glassy-eyed Tobey Maguire diagnosed as ""morbidly alcoholic"" and drying out at a Menningers-type clinic where he struggles to write his life story as it pertains to Gatsby; his beloved Kentucky debutante Daisy played by Carey Mulligan; Daisys vicious and philandering husband Tom (Joel Edgerton); and the languorous golf pro Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki).The soundtrack for Gatsby and Daisys love story much like the one heard in ""Moulin Rouge"" and countless other films including Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"" is gleefully way way out of period. Shawn ""Jay Z"" Carter served as executive producer on Luhrmanns film and the tracks range from will.i.am to Florence + the Machine. One era evokes another The bashes remain the same only the music changes. The script remains quite faithful to Fitzgerald in many respects other than the framing device of Nick in the sanatorium. The acting is not the issue here. Theres a moment in a key scene a sweltering apartment confrontation between DiCaprios Gatsby and Edgertons Tom when Gatsby loses his vaunted cool. Its quick and scary and because DiCaprio is unafraid of raw emotion startlingly effective. And then its gone and were back to too much computer-generated imagery (although some of the panoramas of the 1920s Manhattan skyline and of West Egg and East Egg Long Island are lovely); restless hurtling editing rhythms designed to grind every conversation to a series of mini-halts; and yet another showcase for designer Martin s pearly taste in shirts and jewelry. Shooting in 3-D because he could Luhrmanns dalliance in this particular visual universe is neither a hindrance nor a help. Its simply more stuff in a movie already stuffed with stuff where the dramatic stuffing should be.My favorite Luhrmann to date wasnt a film at all It was his 2002 Broadway staging of Puccinis ""La Boheme"" which was full of grand concepts and bold design strokes far more selectively handled. The greatest ""Gatsby"" besides Fitzgeralds? Thats easy ""Gatz"" the six-and-a-half-hour theatrical version presented with every word of Fitzgeralds spoken onstage by Elevator Repair Service. (It played Chicagos Museum of Contemporary Art in 2008.) There the mystery of Gatsby the illusion and Fitzgerald the illusion-loving literary striver remained miraculously intact and powerful. Despite the best efforts of DiCaprio Mulligan and Edgerton all I really got out of Luhrmanns movie was a half-developed notion of Gatsby as the freewheeling vaguely psychotic auteur of his own movie. Theres always something to watch. But the actors efforts to get something going the old-fashioned way -- by interacting with each other in the service of the characters -- get shoved to the sidelines in favor of one more blast of glitter.mjphillipstribune.comThe Great Gatsby -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some violent images sexual content smoking partying and brief language)Running time 223Opens 10 p.m. Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Arts and Culture Art Leonardo DiCaprio Music The Great Gatsby (movie 2013) Revisiting Ginevra King the Lake Forest woman who inspired Gatsby Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

"Review Gatsbys substance overwhelmed by Luhrmanns style - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Gatsbys substance overwhelmed by Luhrmanns style The Great Gatsby Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Great Gatsby starring Leonardo DiCaprioTobey Maguire Carey Mulligan Joel Edgerton Isla Fisher and Elizabeth Debicki. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Great Gatsby starring Leonardo DiCaprioTobey Maguire Carey Mulligan Joel Edgerton Isla Fisher and Elizabeth Debicki. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Great Gatsby"" began on paper with F. Scott Fitzgeralds celebrated novel and on paper ""Gatsby"" sounds like quite the film. On screen though things start to fall apart.Directed by razzle-dazzle impresario Baz Luhrmann this ""Gatsby"" boasts the charismatic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan as romantic leads 3-D as its format a soundtrack rife with proven hitmakers a Jazz Age setting and a theme of the American Dream gone sour that still resonates today. Whatever could go wrong? With some exceptions a whole lot. Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels Fitzgeralds ""Gatsby"" is in fact very much a slender reed a tragedy in a minor key. Whats problematic in Luhrmanns version is that while his screenplay (co-written with frequent collaborator Craig Pearce) takes pains to parallel the books tale of Jay Gatsbys star-crossed love for Daisy Buchanan his filmmaking point of view suffocates beyond resuscitation any dramatic interest the story might have generated.PHOTOS The Great Gatsby premiere The director has steadfastly proclaimed his passion for the novel but the film hes made of it too often plays as no more than an excuse to display his frantic frenetic personal style. A filmmaker who has increasingly made a fetish of excess and a religion of artificiality Luhrmann and his team (""Moulin Rouge"" ""Romeo + Juliet"") pile on the spectacle and the glitter until we are gasping for air. Its all so chaotic that the fact that the soundtrack is filled with anachronistic songs by 21st century performers like Jay-Z and Lana Del Rey barely registers. A parallel problem as if this film needed one is that Luhrmanns direction of his actors cudgels every instinct of naturalness out of them and pushes everyone even as instinctively genuine an actress as Mulligan toward overblown characterizations and stilted line readings.The use of 3-D unusual for a straight drama plays into that difficulty. It works well in New York street scenes and panoramas -- such as the novels celebrated vision of Manhattan glimpsed from the Queensborough Bridge (""the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and beauty in the world"") -- but it makes the actors look more like mannequins than people. If you believe that artifice is the new reality that cliche is the way to approach truth you will find a kindred spirit here.PHOTOS 50+ images from The Great Gatsby Except for Indian star Amitabh Bachchans unexpected cameo as Jewish gambler Meyer Wolfsheim the only character who survives this onslaught of insincerity is paradoxically the man who can be seen as the storys master of deception Jay Gatsby. Introduced smiling the most beguiling smile imaginable a look Fitzgerald describes as ""one of those rare smiles with a quality of reassurance about it"" DiCaprio successfully calls on all his movie star charisma to become the films only person of interest.As the impeccably dressed but indisputably modest millionaire who calls people ""old sport"" more than he should and seems to live only to give the most elaborate parties in all Christendom Gatsby in DiCaprios hands is reminiscent of Orson Welles youthful and energetic Charles Foster Kane.Its not only audiences who will prefer Gatsby; so does the storys narrator Nick Carraway (an unpersuasive Tobey Maguire). It is a conceit of the screenplay that we meet Carraway in a sanitarium in 1929 a few months after the stock market crash and seven years after the books central story. Looking unconvincingly dissolute Carraway is trying to recover from being ""morbidly alcoholic"" and his doctor encourages him to write the novel we see unfolding in flashback.PHOTOS The Roaring 20s on-screenA graduate of Yale with more connections than capital Carraway comes to New York in 1922 to work in the bond market and ends up by chance living in a humble cottage next door to Gatsbys huge baronial establishment in fictional West Egg the nouveau riche enclave on Long Island.Just across the water in old money East Egg lives Daisy Buchanan (Mulligan) Carraways second cousin. Shes married to the fabulously wealthy Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) but she spends much of her time with gal pal and professional golfer Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki). Thats because her husband is a serial adulterer given to swinish behavior with tawdry women like Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) married to woebegone garage owner George Wilson (Jason Clarke of ""Zero Dark Thirty"").Ties of blood make Carraway a frequent visitor at East Egg but a kind of affinity allows him to hang out with Gatsby as well. And it turns out there is something of a past between Gatsby and Daisy a past that Gatsby very much wants to re-create in the here and now.Once this aspirational man and his love for Daisy enter the picture ""The Great Gatsby"" calms down as much as it can and scenes like Gatsby displaying a veritable waterfall of shirts for Daisys pleasure allow us to catch a glimpse of what it is about the novel that has intrigued so many.But the films efforts to gain a sense of balance parallel its protagonists attempts to achieve something solid with Daisy Its all way too little and far too late.kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------------------------The Great GatsbyMPAA rating PG-13 for some violent images sexual content smoking partying and brief languageRunning time 2 hours 21 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Images from The Great Gatsby The Roaring 20s on-screen At Great Gatsby premiere a 3-D celebration of Fitzgerald 20s Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-great-gatsby-review-20130509,0,175721.story",200,thegreatgatsby(2013)33,thegreatgatsby(2013),latimes

But wait -- isnt it based on a book? Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics baz luhrmann Editors Picks F. Scott Fitzgerald Leonardo DiCaprio Movies The Great Gatsby Tobey Maguire Entertainment News All novels take place in the imagination rather than the real world and F. Scott Fitzgeralds ""The Great Gatsby"" is a particularly delicate balance of realism and fantasy entirely filtered through the literary consciousness of its narrator Nick Carraway. But that doesnt mean it should seem entirely imaginary which is one way of explaining the problems with Baz Luhrmanns spectacular but oddly uninvolving new film version. ""Gatsby"" has long resisted successful big-screen adaptation not least because of Fitzgerald-as-Nicks famous poetic reveries - which are mostly extraneous to the plot - and because of its ambiguous mythic or fairy tale quality. Luhrmann embraces those elements with gusto (perhaps too much so) and creates a larger and more ambitious screen ""Gatsby"" than has ever been seen before. That doesnt turn out to be the answer either.This ""Great Gatsby"" a long-brewing project from the mad Aussie genius behind ""Moulin Rouge"" and the film that was released under the unfortunate title ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" was shot in ""native"" 3-D (meaning it was not converted in post-production) and features digital effects on a staggering scale including immensely detailed virtual re-creations of 1922 Manhattan Queens and Long Island. Every rosebush and patch of green on the ginormous fantasy-land estate of the mysteriously rich Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) stands out in brilliant beautiful fakeness. The water in Gatsbys never-swum-in swimming pool and the adjoining bay are a heart-stopping blue; the famous light at the end of Daisy Buchanans dock is of course a piercing emerald in the mist. As for the dreamlike production design of Gatsbys enormous bacchanalian parties - which intentionally suggest every era of debauchery from the Roman Empire to the Weimar Republic and beyond - Luhrmann is in his element. Movie stars swan showgirls jitterbug and politicians and captains of industry trade the wet sloppy kisses of corruption; the camera climbs toward the ceiling and then dives through the howling throng while you can almost hear the Mephistophelean laughter behind it all.Whether or not Luhrmanns ""Gatsby"" will go down in history as a legendary flop is not for me to judge (though all signs currently point toward yes) but it surely belongs to the category of baroque overblown megalomaniacal spectacles dubbed ""film follies"" by longtime Nation film critic Stuart Klawans. (Erich von Stroheims ""Greed"" and Joseph L. Mankiewiczs ""Cleopatra"" being two of the most famous examples.) Early in the film before Tobey Maguires Nick Carraway an aspiring writer turned Wall Street bond salesman has even met Jay Gatsby he winds up at a boozy party in a cheap loud and unbelievably vulgar New York apartment where Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) holds his extramarital liaisons. In Nicks account its only the second time hes ever drunk alcohol and the entire sequence is an out-of-body mini-masterpiece that blends sex jazz and liquor - the great trifecta of the Roaring 20s - into a potent cocktail that kicks like a horse.But like almost everything else memorable about this ""Gatsby"" that exhilarating and troubling scene has almost nothing to do with the so-called plot or with the human relationships that are supposedly most important. It is as close as Luhrmann ever gets however to what I take to be Fitzgeralds central thesis That the American dream has always had two faces and what is noblest in it is also simultaneously what is falsest and most delusional about it. (Our greatest indigenous art form jazz was nurtured in the whorehouse; our greatest writers have been misogynists and drunks.) That paradox is meant to be embodied in the person of Jay Gatsby of course but in DiCaprios overly suave overly sleek borderline-repellent performance Gatsby just comes off as a giant phony and far too literal-minded a metaphor. Luhrmanns movie conveys meaning far more effectively when it has no story no characters and virtually no text and is all spectacle. As a visual-musical rhapsody on the themes and settings of ""The Great Gatsby"" - partly composed by George Gershwin and partly by Walt Disney - Luhrmanns movie is a memorable accomplishment. As an adaptation of Fitzgeralds novel its depressingly leaden.Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce have clearly grasped that Fitzgeralds novel contains elements of what we might today call magic realism except that in their version the ""realism"" gets left out. That famous early scene when Nick and Tom walk into the parlor in the Buchanan house where Nicks cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her friend Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) are lazing on couches amid fluttering white draperies - and Nick gets the impression theyve been flying around the room - is rendered in wonderful style. Too bad Daisy the supposed femme fatale of Louisville and motive force behind Jay Gatsbys rise from obscurity turns out to be an insipid and superficial creature free of powerful magnetism or other redeeming characteristics. Similarly the screenplay introduces DiCaprio as Gatsby startlingly late in the film and then gives away his secret almost immediately - its almost as if this were a radical rewrite suggesting that Gatsbys a fake whos barely worth knowing and that the real story lies elsewhere. But where? You Might Also Like No doubt its artistically defensible to set this movie in a fantasy universe that seems completely divorced from the real America of 1922 or any other year. The fictional Long Island communities of West Egg and East Egg are rendered less as parodies of New World wealth than as storybook settings for the palaces of fairy princesses; Gatsbys house which would strike Charles Foster Kane as excessively large and vulgar resembles nothing so much as the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland. Im not suggesting that any of this is accidental or unintentional; as the gauche but awestruck Nick repeatedly observes Gatsbys estate reminds him of an amusement park. Im merely wondering what in hell the point is since Luhrmann has driven out both the distinctive elements of American social and moral criticism and the convincing or alluring love story and replaced them with weird bitter-tasting eye candy.I felt no emotion toward DiCaprios Gatsby beyond a vague irritation (even his passion for Daisy feels unbearably juvenile) and in this telling the narcissistic and/or homoerotic love Nick feels for him seems only to expose the latter as a hapless rube. From the moment we meet the notorious gangster Meyer Wolfsheim (played for some reason by Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan) the nature of the relationship between him and Gatsby is clear. No one else in the movie is particularly interesting or convincing either Joel Edgerton is a big physical bruiser whose accent and manner are all wrong for the old-money polo-playing Tom; and while Debicki has the right look for Jordan Nicks androgynous golf-playing semi-girlfriend theres barely a hint of personality. Almost the only actor who stuck with me was Isla Fisher as Myrtle Wilson the working-class Queens girl whose affair with Tom has a fateful aftermath; she plays it as broad caricature but at least its funny. Simply as a torrent of images and visual ideas - often magnificent and just as often idiotic - ""The Great Gatsby"" is a phenomenon not to be missed. Some of it is breathtakingly misguided like the horror-movie framing device involving Nick in a snowbound mental hospital telling the amazing story of Jay Gatsby to his shrink. (I am totally not kidding) And some of it reeks of blatant desperation as when Fitzgeralds most famous passages are not merely read aloud by Maguire in overdone Midwestern-ese but also appear on the screen as Nick types them ""So we beat on boats against the current"" clickety-clickety-clack. So we wont miss the literary greatness I guess.Mind you the consensus-choice Greatest American Novel really is a tremendous book soulful cynical innocent and heartbreaking in ways that evidently do not translate easily to cinema. Luhrmanns bizarre and extravagant misfire will grab the headlines be debated for a week or two (Im confident someone is now preparing a vigorous defense) and then claim its own peculiar page in pop-culture history. But it isnt ""The Great Gatsby"" any more than is the lost 1926 silent version that no one will ever (apparently) see again or the faithful but dull Robert Redford version from 1974. (Or the half-dozen or so other stage screen radio and - really - video-game adaptations.) Not everything has to be a movie This fragile masterwork probably never will. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Thats not the novel. Thats the Baz Luhrmann movie version.F. Scott Fitzgeralds brilliant distillation of the Jazz Age is still here. You just have to work your way through a heavy filter of special effects and in-your-face bells and whistles to find it. The acting is really good particularly Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. But boy with a running time of nearly 21/2 hours and a near-constant bombardment of visual overstimulation its exhausting.It neednt be.

If theres a lunge to be made at the audience to get the good out of the 3-D glasses hell include it. If there are bright and shiny objects to throw at the camera ditto. Too much is never enough.Except when it is.Luhrmann and his co-writer have created a framing device that Ill let you discover; it didnt bother me but those slavishly devoted to the way the story is told in the novel may have problems. The same goes with the music. Purists may blanch at Jay-Z as we get our first glimpse of Manhattan from the sky but I thought it worked perfectly.As with the book the story is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) a recent Yale graduate who trained as a writer but has moved to New York to seek his fortune. He winds up living out on West Egg on Long Island literally next door to a castlelike mansion belonging to Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) a mysterious richer-than-rich man. Rumors swirl about Gatsby especially among the guests at his lavish parties most of whom have never seen him.Nick sees him in glimpses in a window or out on his dock staring across the water at a blinking green light.That light belongs to Nicks cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) who lives in the more-fashionable old-money East Egg with her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). Their marriage seems as shallow as Gatsbys parties. Tom has a woman on the side that everyone knows about while Daisy has her restlessness and money.Eventually Nick will meet Gatsby who will wine and dine him zipping around in his souped-up yellow roadster and introducing him to the likes of Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan) a mobster who helped fix the 1919 World Series so Gatsby brags. Gatsby is an amiable fellow if a little absent-minded. He would seem to have everything he wants.Except for tea with Daisy. He asks Nick to set that up and what happens after that is where ""Gatsby"" in novel form really gets going. To some extent thats true of the film too so best to let those not familiar with the story enter the film with no further information.For those who are familiar such phrases as ""blinking green light"" and ""yellow roadster"" will signal that Luhrmann despite everything he throws at us will be faithful to the spirit of the novel. As it should be; its one of the greatest ever written. Gatsby so mysterious at first is ultimately anything but He is a man whose judgment is clouded by love a love that cannot be recaptured. You cant repeat the past Nick tells Gatsby. Of course you can he replies. And yet it gives nothing away about the details of the story to say that doing so proves difficult tragic impossible.DiCaprio has aged into roles like this with a certain grace. He carries himself with the self-confidence Gatsby would but also manages the shade of doubt that its all false bravado. Maguires Nick literatures ultimate fifth wheel is a keen observer longing to be a part of the in-crowd even as he watches it self-destruct. Mulligan is good also but Edgerton has the trickiest role as the brutish Tom who despises everything about Gatsby.And he carries it off. Tom is a lout a racist son of privilege who carries none of the doubts about his belonging that Gatsby does. Hes not a likable cad and Edgerton and Luhrmann wisely do not try to make him so.What it all comes down to of course is a harsh examination of ... wait a second look at those fireworks in 3-D And is that Beyonce on the soundtrack?Um what were we saying again?Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Warner Bros) B- The Great Gatsby Genre Drama; Starring Carey Mulligan Leonardo DiCaprio Isla Fisher Tobey Maguire; Director Baz Luhrmann; Release Date Wide 05/10/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 141; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 23 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Baz Luhrmann may be the last guy in the world who needs to make a movie in 3-D. In previous films like Romeo + Juliet Australia and especially Moulin Rouge the whirling-dervish director has turned the screen into a mad circus of razzle-dazzle fireworks. Restraint isnt his strong suit. Then again it wasnt a strong suit of the Roaring 20s either. Maybe thats why Luhrmann piles on the Roman-candle flash for his manic adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds Jazz Age classic. Most famously Hollywood put its mitts on The Great Gatsby in 1974 when Robert Redford and Mia Farrow turned the champagne-soaked love story into a stately snoozy Harlequin romance. Luhrmann goes to the other extreme transforming the high school reading-list perennial into an ADHD workout -- at least for the first half of the film. Plotwise Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce stick pretty close to the novel. The only real jackknife is a framing device that has narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) retelling the tipsy events of the summer of 1922 in flashback from a sanitarium where hes recovering from a debauched season in the sun in Long Islands nouveau-riche West Egg. The main story kicks off after Nick leaves the Midwest and heads east to stake his claim on Wall Street where postwar exuberance runs full tilt. ""The tempo of the city had changed"" Maguire says in a voice-over. ""The buildings were higher the parties were bigger the morals were looser and the liquor was cheaper."" Nicks cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton) a former Yale classmate of Nicks live across the bay from his modest summer rental in old-money East Egg. Meanwhile next door to Nick in West Egg is an opulent pleasure palace where dandies in straw hats and party girls in beaded frocks drink and dance around the clock. Its here that Nick makes the acquaintance of the movable feasts mysterious and fabulously wealthy host Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Gatsby makes sure the glasses stay filled but he stands in the shadows at a quiet remove. Hes got something else on his mind Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby fell madly in love with her. He was a young penniless soldier heading off to war and Daisy was a ""golden girl"" from a prominent Louisville family. Convinced he had to make his fortune before he deserved her he vanished. But he never got over her. Now he intends to woo Daisy back with Nicks help. That may sound like a lot of setup but Luhrmann zips through the high-society swirl with frenzied montages spinning newspaper headlines and Cirque du Soleil-style party scenes where flappers on trapezes (thanks to the films 3-D) seem to swing right into your lap and DJs spin 21st-century hip-hop tracks. At first these anachronistic bacchanals are intoxicatingly strange. But eventually they just seem insane. You half expect a chorus line of Oompa Loompas to high-step on screen with Beyonce. Thankfully Luhrmann does settle down after Gatsby and Daisy secretly meet and rekindle their romance. Still for the most part the actors never sync up with Luhrmanns jitterbug rhythm. Maguire now 37 seems too old to be the naive bumpkin narrator the movie wants him to be. And Mulligans poor little rich girl Daisy isnt given a lot to do besides pout swoon and grouse about the heat. You never understand why Gatsby would be so obsessed with her. Like Redford DiCaprio has a smooth sun-kissed charisma as Gatsby calling Nick ""old sport"" in a clubby drawl. But its Edgerton as the boisterous bully Tom who commands the audiences attention. Behind his Douglas Fairbanks pencil mustache and backslapping Ivy League hauteur lies the films most nuanced performance. I suspect its been a while since most folks have cracked open a copy of Fitzgeralds novel so I wont spoil the ending other than to say that like the giddy period it chronicles the fizzy high comes with an inevitable crash. Theres a reason The Great Gatsby continues to be taught in classrooms nearly 90 years after it was written. Its a dazzling time capsule of a shimmering era and a devastating look into the dark side of the American dream. Too bad Luhrmann the caffeinated conductor doesnt trust that story enough. Hed rather blast your retinas into sugar-shock submission.

Scott Fitzgerald classic.But hold them at bay. Within 20 minutes Leonardo DiCaprio gets more screen time the soundtrack kicks into high gear and this ""Gatsby"" starts turning into something special.The dubious opening finds the disheveled narrator to the richy-rich Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanitarium where hes haunted by the specter of wealthy neighbor Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio). Whats the antidote to chase his melancholy away? Write it down on paper of course.The stagey opening is off-putting and overdone making us fret that this adaptation of Fitzgeralds classic 1925 novel will swerve way off target. In fact throw in 3-D and a Jay-Z co-produced soundtrack and this ""Gatsby"" has all the potential for being a train wreck that could make that anemic 1974 version with Robert Redford seem better than it was.Or maybe not.After seducing us with lavish visuals (the 3-D is exceptional the production design exquisite) but doing zilch to ornament the characters Luhrmann gets on track and goes full-steam ahead -- taking us on a spectacular operatic ride with DiCaprio riding shotgun.Advertisement Given the alcohol-tinged material ""Gatsby"" appropriately picks up when Nick gets screaming drunk while partying with his cousin Daisy Buchanans (Carey Mulligan) two-timin hubby Tom (Joel Edgerton). He is a macho millionaire currently cheating with a gas station owners (Jason Clarke) wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher). Anyone assigned to read ""Gatsby"" in high school knows these characters play pivotal roles in a clash between the haves and have-nots of 1920s America.Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"") and Fisher (""Bachelorette"") round out a terrific cast. But while Mulligan is suitably fickle and waiflike and Edgerton brutish and blustery no one can compare to DiCaprio. As the enigmatic millionaire who gets rich by any means possible all for the sake of love hes spot on.When he takes tea with old flame Daisy at Nicks cabin hes boyish and disarmingly sweet. While hosting an outrageous party at his Disneyland-like mansion on Long Island hes sexy and secretive. And when he realizes he cant control the course of love hes vulnerable and shattered. He nails every note.Speaking of notes the soundtrack hits all the right ones. The diverse playbook features artists that range from Beyonce to Lana Del Rey -- and it couldnt be more appropriate or evocative. Best of all the songs never upstage the material and actors only complement and further deepen the mood.Luhrmann is a master at mixing songs and being stylish. (His ""Moulin Rouge"" remains one of the best movie musicals.) He specializes in creating gloriously alive experiences and his production and technical team have achieved a feast for the senses.Even after a tottering start he bounces back to get into the spirit of Fitzgeralds novel. But it is DiCaprio who really burrows into the soul and the marrow of a classic. Luhrmann just grazes it. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby in Warner Bros.

""I think its what you want."" ""I think so too."" That excerpted exchange from F. Scott Fitzgeralds long-hailed novel ""The Great Gatsby"" ostensibly takes place between love-struck millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his hapless neighbor WWI veteran Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) but it might as well have belonged to director Baz Luhrmann and anyone who enabled his latest glitzy endeavor -- in 3-D no less. Its not that Luhrmanns overwrought proudly anachronistic style is a surprise at this point. His ""Romeo + Juliet"" ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Australia"" have made his directorial intentions quite clear that more is more newer is neater and bigger is better. However just as our narrator is invited into Long Islands most lavish parties whenever thrown by the enigma next door Luhrmann hopes to kick the Roaring 20s up a notch with a heaping helping of hip-hop (Jay-Z counts among the films executive producers) and no small amount of digital augmentation. One might like ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and Jay-Zs own tracks in nearly equal measure but ones first instinct wouldnt be to thrust the two together for maximum enjoyment. Updating ""Romeo + Juliet"" to reflect SoCal gang warfare was inspired and even the pop fantasia of ""Moulin Rouge"" suited the grandly ephemeral illusion of the club and its courtesans. The flourishes brought to ""Gatsby"" only serve to indulge in the excess that Fitzgeralds novel intended to criticize and while I wouldnt believe that Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce failed to gather as much themselves the proper plot of the films second hour feels like a necessary price to pay for such an elegant kick-off. Yet its in this back half that Carraway finally grasps Gatsbys long-simmering fondness for Nicks cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who is married instead to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and situated just across the bay. The green light at the end of Buchanans dock beckons to Gatsby on a nightly basis just as he hopes his extravagant soirees might re-capture her attentions. In those few moments when the actors heightened emotion dominates Luhrmanns heightened expression -- as Jay and Daisy finally reunite or when Jay and Tom finally confront one another -- the film clicks just as the directors previous takes on star-crossed love occasionally would. Alas ""Gatsby"" is more often consumed with lavish costumes loud music and limp rehearsals of Fitzgeralds famous text verbatim at times even thrown at the screen as part of a clumsily included framing device that sees Nick recalling his woes from the safety of a sanitarium some time after. The book saw no need to remind readers that we were being told a tale yet Maguire consistently interrupts a film in which he is easily the least distinctive part. And so we wait wait for the parties to end wait for sparks to fly for tragedy to strike for repercussions to ensue for our persistently passive protagonist to simply shut up already. DiCaprio nails the magnetism despair and fundamental phoniness as new-money Gatsby tries to compete with old-money Buchanan a role to which Edgerton brings an appropriate fervor. Mulligan is suitably breathy as the object of each mans affections although the notion that her character exists beyond being just that is a fleeting one. Isla Fisher and Jason Clarke leave scant impressions as Buchanans own mistress and her aloof husband respectively while wide-eyed newcomer Elizabeth Debicki and Amitabh Bachchan make a bit more of a mark as Daisys gossipy pal and Jays shady business partner. Of course much mention is made of greedily pursuing the future as a means of repeating the past which is arguably the approach that Luhrmann himself has embraced with all his modern intrusions a flashy means to a melodramatic end. In the end his ""Gatsby"" takes the fitting form of a cocktail glass at once undeniably polished and unfailingly empty.

Scott Fitzgeralds literary masterpiece By Rex Reed  05/07/13 525pm As the new Gatsby Leonardo DiCaprio is hopeless a little boy in his first After Six tuxedo. Lets face it. The Great Gatsby never has been--and probably wont ever be--successfully turned into a great motion picture. Many have tried (four flop movies not to mention various small-screen attempts including a truncated but memorable Playhouse 90 with Robert Ryan and Jeanne Crain in the golden days when TV still knew what quality programming was). Robert Redford was a perfect Gatsby in the pretty but boring 1974 version by Jack Clayton but the movie was dead on arrival. The best Ive seen is still Elliott Nugents black-and-white 1949 version with Alan Ladd at the top of his form as the screens most glamorous Gatsby to date heading a cast that included Betty Field Macdonald Carey Ruth Hussey and Shelley Winters. Mired in mysterious litigation for six decades it has never been released on home video is never shown on any cable or network channel and cannot be appreciated by the legions of F. Scott Fitzgerald fans who have never seen his work properly adapted to the screen. And so his literary masterwork remains nothing more--an elegant but elusive triumph of words over images best savored on the written page. You dont realize just how much misguided damage can be done to a great novel until it is vaporized by a pretentious hack like boneheaded Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Some critics through the years have put forth the unpopular theory that Fitzgerald specialized in style over substance but as any college English major knows he was famous for pruning away the clutter. With the cinematic meat cleaver that Mr. Luhrmann wields in one bloated misfire after another (I still havent recovered from the nausea-inducing Moulin Rouge) style is all there is left and in The Great Gatsby it looks alarmingly like clutter. Budgeted between 105 and 127 million dollars depending on which Hollywood trade journal you read with every inflated expense aimed at your eyeballs in awkward totally unnecessary and stomach-churning 3-D this is one of the most maddening examples of wasted money ever dumped on the screen. Jay Gatsby is an enigmatic figure in the excessive Roaring Twenties who came from poverty and devoted his life to becoming a self-made millionaire to win over a superficial girl named Daisy buying an ostentatious mansion on Long Island across the lake from her rich husband Tom and infiltrating high society with lavish loud and impossibly overproduced parties masquerading as social events. Racking up his 3-D budget to the credit-card limit Mr. Luhrmann turns these dinner dances into drunken confetti-drenched orgies. The sumptuous vulgar Gatsby estate overflowing with gangsters movie stars flappers wisecracking alcoholics voluptuous tap dancers people falling from trapezes clowns acrobats and an orchestra in the middle of a swimming pool full of inflatable rubber zebras looks like a high-school costume party on prom night invaded by Cirque du Soleil. Is it any wonder in all the slobber and confusion that the acting is so bad? With the phoniest set of performances this side of an Ed Wood flick you might as well be watching Plan 9 From Outer Space. As the new Gatsby Leonardo DiCaprio is hopeless a little boy in his first After Six tuxedo. Worse still he is no longer the centerpiece of the story a task that falls into the incapable hands of the incompetent miscast Tobey Maguire as Jay Gatsbys friend neighbor and all-seeing matchmaker and Daisys cousin Nick Carraway. He might suffice as a callow Spider-Man but as the films narrator saying campy things like ""They were careless Tom and Daisy ... they smash people and then retreat back into their vast world of money and carelessness ..."" Even with these masterful lines from the book he just sounds like hes reading from a college yearbook. Mr. Maguire is supposed to be the camera through which the tragedy unfolds but he is light years away from possessing the range craftsmanship and experience required to play a Fitzgerald hero. Mr. DiCaprio has the experience and we know he can act but hes not beyond the need for a directors keen guidance. Without proficient direction he comes off like he has no stamina to give the role of Gatsby the stature it demands. That kind of direction would imply the kind of wisdom and insight Baz Luhrmann lacks. Hes too busy directing the confetti. Carey Mulligan is another artist who knows how to pop the cork on bottled emotion but her Daisy Buchanan is so trite and myopic you wonder what Gatsby ever saw in her in the first place. Only the terrific Australian actor Joel Edgerton has the proper grip on the material as her handsome shallow two-timing husband Tom. Its supposed to be a story about fate and irony but the jealous garage mechanic Wilson and his sluttish wife Myrtle (so soundly and wrenchingly played by Shelley Winters in the 1949 version) who gets mowed down by Gatsbys Duesenberg have been all but relegated to bit players. This dilutes the dramatic impact that builds to the storys feverish climax rendering the big finale impotent. This version of The Great Gatsby has the narrative strength of tap water. Like Orson Welles Mr. Luhrmann chooses interesting material to shape into movies but then his colossal ego does ridiculous things to doom it. This catastrophe has actors who roll their eyes and raise their eyebrows in perpetual uncertainty about what kind of literature they are supposed to be interpreting--a trashed-up revision of the original with the narrator now echoing the inner voice of Fitzgerald from an asylum where he is writing a book called ... The Great Gatsby? The jazz and big band swing of the 20s has been replaced by hip-hop music supervised by Jay-Z and songs by Beyonce and Fergie with the historical significance of a tuning fork and there are so many close-ups that it sometimes looks like a movie about ears. I love the publicity quotes by Baz Luhrmann stating that his intention was to make an epic romantic vision that is enormous. Also overwrought asinine exaggerated and boring.

Pictures) / APShare Photo If any piece of classic American literature should be depicted on film with wildly decadent and boldly inventive style its ""The Great Gatsby."" After all who was the character of Jay Gatsby himself if not a spinner of grandiose tales and a peddler of lavish dreams? And Baz Luhrmann would seem like the ideal director to bring F. Scott Fitzgeralds story to the screen yet again to breathe new life into these revered words having shaken up cultural institutions previously with films like ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" This is the man who dared to stage the iconic balcony scene in a swimming pool so mixing in a little Jay-Z amid the Jazz Age standards strangely makes sense. But in Luhrmanns previous films there still existed a fundamental understanding of the point of the stories he was telling; beneath their gorgeous trappings they still reflected the heart and the purpose of the works from which they were drawn. His ""Great Gatsby"" is all about the glitter but it has no soul - and the fact that hes directed it in 3-D only magnifies the feeling of artificiality. His camera rushes and swoops and twirls through one elaborately staged bacchanal after another but instead of creating a feeling of vibrancy the result is repetitive and ultimately numbing. Rather than creating a sense of immersion and tangibility the 3-D holds you at arms length rendering the expensive obsessive details as shiny and hollow when they should have been exquisite. (We should point out that the clothes especially the dresses Carey Mulligan wears as the elusive ethereal golden girl Daisy Buchanan are magnificent though - the work of Luhrmanns wife and frequent collaborator Catherine Martin who serves as both production and costume designer. Watching ""The Great Gatsby"" the film makes you wonder whether all of this might have functioned more effectively as ""The Great Gatsby"" the Vogue magazine spread.) Luhrmanns adaptation which he co-wrote with Craig Pearce lacks the sense of melancholy and longing that emanated from the novels pages even though the script invokes Fitzgeralds prose early and often through voiceover from Tobey Maguire as our narrator guide and Fitzgerald stand-in Nick Carraway. Sometimes as in the books famous final sentence the words pop right up on screen and linger in the air. But theres something about hearing and seeing them in this fashion that depletes them of the power they provide when we experience them on the written page. Its a reminder that one of the most celebrated novels of our time at its core is a melodramatic tale of love and loss jealousy and betrayal. Gatsby himself played with well-coifed panache by Leonardo DiCaprio too often comes off as a needy clingy stalker rather than a tragic figure and a victim of the American dream. But in general though Luhrmanns ""Gatsby"" doesnt get the fact that the book was intended as a critical look at a crumbling dream. It gets too caught up in the buzz of the party. The plot real quickly in case its been a while since 10th-grade English class The year is 1922 and young Nick Carraway has moved into a cottage on the nouveau riche Long Island enclave of West Egg with dreams of making it big on the New York Stock Exchange. Across the bay is the old-moneyed community of East Egg where Nicks cousin the dazzling socialite Daisy lives with her cheating blue-blooded husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). But everyone regardless of where theyre from gathers each weekend for wild parties at Gatsbys palatial abode - which happens to be next door to Nicks humble house. The normally mysterious Gatsby befriends Nick with hopes of reconnecting with Daisy the one who got away five years earlier. Mulligans Daisy is more of an idea than a fully fleshed-out person but then again maybe thats always been the point that shes alluring but tantalizingly out of reach. DiCaprio meanwhile - despite the usual depth and edge he can bring to a role - comes off here as a parody of a Fitzgerald character tossing around Gatsbys jovial greeting of ""old sport"" so often in his affected accent it could make for a dangerous drinking game. Now that would truly be intoxicating. ""The Great Gatsby"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release is rated PG-13 for some violent images sexual content smoking partying and brief language.

DiCaprio among splendor.Warner Bros. Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres a scene in Baz Luhrmanns The Great Gatsby in which Leonardo DiCaprios hyperrich super-awkward Jay Gatsby takes it upon himself to redecorate the bachelor pad of his less prosperous friend Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire). Gatsbys old flame Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) is coming to Nicks house for tea. Eager to impress her Gatsby has brought in boughs draped with explosive white flowers macaroons in every color of the paint box and tiered cakes coated with silky pastel-hued frosting straight out of Marie Antoinettes court. ""You think its too much?"" he asks Nick anxiously. Nick offers a polite answer ""I think its what you want.""The Great Gatsby is both too much and what Luhrmann wants less a movie version of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel than a movie version of Jay Gatsby himself. Its an expressionist work a story reinvented to the point of total self-invention polished to a handsome sheen and possessing no class or taste beyond the kind you can buy. And those are the reasons to love it.Outraged Gatsbyites took to the Twitterverse last May just after the release of the gaudy first trailer a nutball extravaganza of flappers in beaded Miu Miu dresses losing their shit to Jay-Z and Kanye Wests hypnotic and decadent ""No Church in the Wild."" How dare Luhrmann desecrate F. Scotts delicate classic More recently the novel has risen to the top of the bestseller list--people who have never read it now want to thanks to all the movie hype. That should be great right? Not for everybody Last week in The New York Times an employee of groovy-chic Soho bookstore McNally Jackson expressed dismay that the masses were buying the movie tie-in not the edition with Francis Cugats original blue-toned weeping-eye cover art the only one McNally Jackson sells. Apparently Fitzgeralds beautiful ferocious novel is only for those who have been blessed with special sophistication and discernment.Film Details The Great Gatsby RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time143 More Info Trailer Luhrmann will have none of that. His Gatsby--rendered in 3-D no less--is garish and over the top and like all Luhrmanns movies (even the lovely ones like William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet) self-consciousness and silliness creep in through its cracks. It seldom if ever captures that fierce delicacy of feeling Fitzgerald packed into every sentence. And its not an actors movie. DiCaprio has some moving moments--when he sees his beloved Daisy and gets love-struck all over again his face momentarily takes on the bewildered softness he had as a child actor.But mostly the performers look lost in Luhrmanns extravagant panorama. They deliver their lines (which are generally drawn straight from Fitzgerald) with care and respect like birds entrusted with very special eggs. You sometimes get the feeling theyre afraid to sully them with anything so presumptuous as interpretation.No this Gatsby is a mess. But it moves it breathes it has color on its side and because of that it feels far more respectful to the source material than Jack Claytons dreary 1974 number in which Mia Farrow and Robert Redford drifted about wanly in overpressed linen and droopy chiffon. Luhrmann (who with Craig Pearce co-wrote the screenplay) hasnt taken too many liberties with the basics Maguires Nick Carraway the storys narrator and conscience has just moved from Chicago to New York specifically to a tony part of Long Island where his delicate wildflower cousin Daisy lives with her pompous cheating husband Tom (Zero Dark Thirtys Joel Edgerton). Across the bay from Daisys palatial spread--the grounds dotted with gardens that look like dishes of candy--is an even bigger mansion. That one gleaming like the castle in the opening of The Wonderful World of Disney is owned by mystery figure Jay Gatsby a man known for his decadent costly parties even though he doesnt like parties at all Hes just hoping to lure his old love Daisy across the bay which with Carraways help he eventually does opening the door wide to tragedy.Luhrmann doesnt do so well with that. The movies last section which is so tense in the novel is strained and awkward here. But the energy of what comes before counts for something. Though Fitzgerald couldnt have known it he wrote a scene tailor-made for 3-D the one in which Gatsby rummages through his collection of brilliantly colored silk shirts and tosses one after another toward his lady love. In Luhrmanns vision they float down around Daisy like polychrome snowflakes. Luhrmann has also made some dashing and witty casting choices--for example giving the role of shifty gangster Meyer Wolfsheim to Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan whose facial hair actually suggests a wolf.And then there are the parties. And thats what you really wanted to know about right? Luhrmann director of photography Simon Duggan and production and costume designer Catherine Martin dont skimp on the spectacle Confetti falls like silver rain. Champagne glasses glint in the light. Garters teddies and fringe shimmy everywhere. Many of the costumes come courtesy of Miu Miu and Prada and they include swishy silk kimonos and sheer dresses whose beading looks as if it were sewn onto air. Its all so fake. It should all be so horrible. But really all Luhrmann has done is build a crazy art-deco Taj Mahal to the glory of The Great Gatsby. Like Gatsby Luhrmann is a faker but not a phony. Fitzgerald knew the difference. Can we see it too?

Scott Fitzgeralds canonical novel is finally here the dissection and disembowelment can begin. This bombastic superproduction is certainly its own strange beast--bluntly effective as melodrama vividly colorful in its stereoscopic grandeur never a dull moment etc. etc. You just have to accept that the themes undergirding Fitzgeralds precise prose (the bracing critiques of willfully blind idealism and Jazz Age excess) have been squashed by overproduced spectacle. Thats a bit of a backbreaking proviso. A seductive skin remains Embittered narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) self-made romantic Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and flighty flapper Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) move with great ease through the storys tragic-romantic beats. Yet while the books metaphorical signposts all appear (the blinking green light across the Long Island bay the Doctor T.J. Eckleburg billboard) and Fitzgeralds text is often spoken verbatim theres something crucial missing. You can trace it to Luhrmanns Minnelli-on-acid aesthetic The anachronistic pop-music cues digitally augmented tracking shots and disco-globe-glittery production design dont re-create the headiness of early-20th-century New York so much as invent a billowy fantasy otherworld in the gauzy vein of Twilight. Shorn of its quintessentially American roots a biting tale of adult extravagance becomes insubstantially tween-aged.

With The Great Gatsby Does Baz Luhrmann Prove Hes More Gratuitous Than Michael Bay? Eric Kohn May 6 2013 123 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk The least interesting aspects of Baz Luhrmanns unsurprisingly lavish near-musical adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" come from the source material. That should surprise exactly no one. More to the point the sprawling tale of millionaire loner Jay Gatsby (a confident Leonardo DiCaprio) yearning to be reunited with former flame Daisy (Carey Mulligan on mopey autopilot) has been rendered as a series of soap opera interludes in between the directors typically dazzling setpieces. F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel certainly has its fair share of melodrama but Luhrmann never displays any interest in finding its emotional core. Released in ostentatious 3D set to a contemporary soundtrack by Jay-Z and shot with a soaring virtual camera that celebrates every corner of the affluent scenario Luhrmanns ""The Great Gatsby"" has the hallmarks of a contemporary Hollywood spectacle. Its missing the explosions but make no mistake ""Gatsby"" is one glitzy misfire. Ever since the global dominance of the ""Transformers"" franchise Michael Bay has been singled out as the reigning king of studio-produced indulgences. Luhrmann whose attempt at old school Hollywood romance with ""Australia"" bombed hard may not have quite the same track record for pandering to audiences basest sensibilities. Yet his take on ""Gatsby"" suffers the same hollow style-over-substance issues -- in this case flimsily obscured by mock allegiance to a classy text -- that have assailed Bays movies. The difference is that Bay owns up to it. READ MORE Critics Arent Dazzled By Gatsby Much of the plot in ""Gatsby"" is unchanged In 1922 Crestfallen narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire the most believable impressive screen presence for the duration of the movie) moves out to the North Shore of Long Island right next door to the elusive Gatsby whose expensive house parties unfold like gigantic champagne-fueled Jazz Age cliches. Gatsby eventually enlists Nick to help him win back Daisy Carraways cousin in spite of her marriage to the confident Tom Buchanan (a stern Joel Edgerton). Romance ensues followed by inevitable tragedy setting the stage for a grand prelude to the Great Depression -- one last hurrah before historys dark turns take over. Luhrmann nails the hurrah but fails to rein it in. The movie is consumed by the same excess that Fitzgeralds novel treats skeptically. Even the omniscient eyes of T.J. Eckleberg on the billboard near town an iconic image emblazoned on the cover of ""Gatsby"" for decades has been rendered as yet another colorful prop in the filmmakers collage of technical achievements. Its impossible not to admire Luhrmanns penchant for candy-colored displays. He announces Gatsbys arrival in a marvelous tableaux set to the crescendo of Gershwins ""Rhapsody in Blue"" with DiCaprio introducing himself to Maguire against the backdrop of a house party.  Fireworks erupt on cue. The moment is so elegantly timed that viewers may feel compelled to applaud. But when nitty gritty plot details arrive ""Gatsby"" turns hopelessly theatrical with tensions flaring between the main characters in a series of rushed confrontations that play second fiddle to gratuitous sets seemingly divorced from the actions they depict a slo-mo car crash looks cool first creates a modicum of suspense second. A party scene in which Nick and Tom cavort with a group of women in a cramped New York apartment stands out for its speed and fashion more than its relevance to the narrative. Beyond that the contemporary soundtrack is more jarring than the arrival of hip hop in ""Django Unchained"" a movie that did a better job of marrying cartoonish sensibilities with a historical framework. In Luhrmanns ""Gatsby"" the music cues might be an obvious grab at shifting the material into an allegory for modern times but they have the same distracting qualities of an ostentatious CGI feat Look over here At least ""Transformers"" doesnt try to mask its pricey treats with self-serious drama. Luhrmann seems to relish the opportunity to explore the period while regarding the book as a burden. And yet like Bay Lurhmann has an undeniable ability to churn out grandiose cinematic tapestries. In ""Moulin Rouge"" the ubiquitous flashiness fit the proceedings. He has arguably never done better than 1996s ""Romeo + Juliet"" which smartly found the contemporary genre hooks in Shakespeares story while keeping the intensity of the source material intact. ""Gatsby"" by contrast falls into the same trappings of its characters whom Nick famously derides for ""retreating into their money and vast carelessness."" Bound to make many millions of dollars ""Gatsby"" is a familiar story in more ways than one. Criticwire grade C- This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Baz Luhrmann F.

I agree with your analysis. I believe that some books are not reproducible in film form. Perhaps the director attempted to be too faithful to the book so the product fails to deliver credible characters. Reply peter May 12 2016 202 pm Nice review Honestly who did not see this coming? Reply Jordan May 12 2016 202 pm Alan (below) clearly thinks that capitalizing phrases makes them true. Onto the film... I am disappointed about the reviews. I cannot say anything about the film itself as I havent seen it yet but it seems almost unanimous that film failed to deliver on its promise. Eric I think you do establish the intellectual core when you say that ""The movie is consumed by the same excess that Fitzgeralds novel treats skeptically"" and I think the emotional core is very much connected to that and the sense that things arent want they seem. We feel Carraways alienation from a society that appears to value all of the things we value (wealth success liberty fun judgement) but these values when taken to such excess seem grotesque and actually conflict with other values we have. What disappoints me is that Baz Luhrmann seemed like a great director to deliver the message but it seems like he indulged in it rather than employed it to make the point. Reply Alan B May 12 2016 202 pm ""Luhrmann never displays any interest in finding its emotional core."" I couldnt even get through the first paragraph without wincing. The writing is truly baffling especially the way in which you throw out a claim and fail to address it. This is Writing 101. For instance if you accuse the film of failing to capture the source materials ""emotional core"" then you need to DEFINE THE ""EMOTIONAL CORE"" OF THE BOOK. Your review makes NO ATTEMPT what IS the ""emotional core"" of the book? How has Luhrmann failed to express it? Those questions would actually be a spark for an ACTUALLY INTERESTING review of the film instead you just huff as if Luhrmann just doesnt GET IT without bothering to explain what IT is. And - maybe just maybe - there is no UNIVERSAL ""emotional core"" and that individuals engage with different aspects of the text. I dont want to defend the film because it looks terrible but I am certain that - if it is ""bad"" - then it is bad for reasons beyond your understanding. Reply Ana May 12 2016 202 pm The minute I saw the preview for this film I could tell it would be a whole lot of glitz and glamor but I didnt quite see as much of Gatsby amidst all of it of the novel that I so enjoyed reading in high school. I think this is a pretty spot-on review. Reply Little My May 12 2016 202 pm ""in this case flimsily obscured by mock allegiance to a classy text -- that have assailed Bays movies. The difference is that Bay owns up to it"" When Australia bombed Nicole Kidman took the blame it was her fault that the film failed who is going to take the axe this time? will Baz own up? Reply Craig May 12 2016 202 pm What did you really expect? A subtle adaptation in the tradition of Merchant Ivory? Luhrmann likes to use hyperkinetic visuals to confuse people ... you know make them believe he knows what hes doing. I get the feeling that Joel Schumacher and RAISING ARIZONA are Luhrmanns major cinematic influences. Hes not very good and I hope after this failure he just goes away. Reply Johnny Futbol May 12 2016 202 pm ""He has arguably never done better than 1996s Romeo + Juliet..."" Im glad to finally find someone else who feels this way. Im not sure what it is about about Moulin Rouge but it just doesnt really work for me and it seems like the sort of thing that should. Reply Adam May 12 2016 202 pm Who cares how gratuitous it is. Does this really warrant an article written about it? Reply Adam May 12 2016 202 pm Who cares how gratuitous it is. Does this really warrant an article written about it? Reply theresa May 12 2016 202 pm The book is great. The movie does not make justice to an era. Reply Patrick May 12 2016 202 pm It would seem to me that Mr. Lurhmanns films have gotten progressively worse through the years. Reply herb May 12 2016 202 pm Totally agree with this review.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures drama ""The Great Gatsby"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1922 a newly minted millionaire tries to claim the well-born woman he loves. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE The fourth adaptation of the Fitzgerald novel scores some hits and wild misses but DiCaprio nails the bulls-eye. He is Gatsby though ""Gatsby"" has yet to be made. CAST Leonardo DiCaprio Carey Mulligan Tobey Maguire LENGTH 221 Theres a lot to like about ""The Great Gatsby"" Baz Luhrmanns flashy messy manic adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds 1925 novel. That slim but thematically tricky little volume remains a captivating riddle which may be why no filmmaker has created the ""definitive"" version. Luhrmann the fourth to try hasnt either -- theres a lot to dislike here as well -- but his is easily the most entertaining ""Gatsby"" yet. Its a product of its time as were the others a 1926 silent a 1949 noir and a gauzy 1974 romance starring hunk-of-the-moment Robert Redford as the mysterious Long Island millionaire Jay Gatsby. This version is a postmodern pastiche Flappers gyrate to Jay-Z Gatsbys Gold Coast mansion looks like a Disneyland castle and Jazz Age New York has more candy-colored costumes and confetti than a Katy Perry concert. (Make that Madonna; Luhrmanns vision of pop spectacle sometimes recalls the 1980s more than the 1920s or 2010s.)

The anachronisms hammer home an obvious point -- twas ever thus -- which would get tiresome if not for some outstanding performances. Carey Mulligan is picture perfect as Gatsbys aristocratic beloved Daisy Fay Buchanan but the characters vibrancy has been written away; now shes just sad sad sad. Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway strikes a nice blend of passivity and outrage while Joel Edgerton as Daisys husband Tom is a revelation bringing out the nobility in this storys go-to villain. Crucial roles such as the jet-setting Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) and the ill-used Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) are reduced to near-cameos. As for Leonardo DiCaprio he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance -- haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwins ""Rhapsody in Blue"" -- DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. Hes as tough as Alan Ladd in 49 as suave as Redford in 74 but also vulnerable touching funny a faker a human. You hear it all in Gatsbys favorite phrase ""old sport"" a verbal tic that stumped other actors. Its a tremendous hard-won performance. DiCaprio helps save the movie from its excesses and missteps particularly a narration that not only redundantly describes the visuals but obscures them in the form of floating words. Luhrmann hasnt solved the riddle of ""Gatsby"" but its an audacious and worthy attempt. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT In 1922 a newly minted millionaire tries to claim the well-born woman he loves.

By David Denby Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan in Baz Luhrmanns new movie.   Credit Illustration by Ron Kurniawan When ""The Great Gatsby"" was published on April 10 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald living high in France after his early success cabled Max Perkins his editor at Scribners and demanded to know if the news was good. Mostly it was not. The book received some reviews that were dismissive (""F. SCOTT FITZGERALDS LATEST A DUD"" a headline in the New York World ran) and others that were pleasant but patronizing. Fitzgerald later complained to his friend Edmund Wilson that ""of all the reviews even the most enthusiastic not one had the slightest idea what the book was about."" For a writer of Fitzgeralds fame sales were mediocre--about twenty thousand copies by the end of the year. Scribners did a second printing of three thousand copies but that was it and when Fitzgerald died in 1940 half-forgotten at the age of forty-four the book was hard to find. The tale of Fitzgeralds woeful stumbles--no great writer ever hit the skids so publicly--is suffused with varying shades of irony both forlorn and triumphal. Fitzgerald was an alcoholic and no doubt his health would have declined whatever the commercial fate of his masterpiece. But he was a writer who needed recognition and money as much as booze and if ""Gatsby"" had sold well it would likely have saved him from the lacerating public confessions of failure that he made in the nineteen-thirties or at least would have kept him away from Hollywood. (He did get a fascinating half-finished novel ""The Last Tycoon"" out of the place but his talents as a screenwriter were too fine-grained for M-G-M.) At the same time the initial failure of ""Gatsby"" has yielded an astounding coda the U.S. trade-paperback edition of the book currently sells half a million copies a year. Jay Gatsby ""sprang from his Platonic conception of himself"" and his exuberant ambitions and his abrupt tragedy have merged with the story of America in its self-creation and its failures. The strong delicate poetically resonant text has become a kind of national scripture recited happily or mournfully as the occasion requires. In 1925 Fitzgerald sent copies of ""Gatsby"" to Edith Wharton Gertrude Stein and T. S. Eliot who wrote thank-you notes that served to canonize the book when Wilson reprinted them in ""The Crack-Up"" (1945) a miscellany of Fitzgeralds writing and letters. All three let the young author know that he had done something that defined modernity. Edith Wharton praised the scene early in the novel when the coarsely philandering Tom Buchanan takes Nick Carraway--the shy young man who narrates the story--to an apartment he keeps for his mistress Myrtle in Washington Heights. Wharton described the scene as a ""seedy orgy."" With its stupid remarks leading nowhere its noisy trivial self-dramatization the little gathering marks a collapse of the standards of social conduct. In its acrid way the episode is satirical but an abyss slowly opens. Some small expectation of grace has vanished. I thought of Whartons phrase when I saw the new hyperactive 3-D version of ""The Great Gatsby"" by the Australian director Baz Luhrmann (""Strictly Ballroom"" ""Moulin Rouge""). Luhrmann whips Fitzgeralds sordid debauch into a saturnalia--garish and violent with tangled blasts of music not all of it redolent of the Jazz Age. (Jay-Z is responsible for the soundtrack; Beyonce and Andre 3000 sing.) Fitzgeralds scene at the apartment gives off a feeling of sinister incoherence; Luhrmanns version is merely a frantic jumble. The picture is filled with an indiscriminate swirling motion a thrashing impress of ""style"" (Art Deco turned to digitized glitz) thrown at us with whooshing camera sweeps and surges and rapid changes of perspective exaggerated by 3-D. Fitzgerald wrote of Jay Gatsby ""He was a son of God--a phrase which if it means anything means just that--and he must be about His Fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty."" Gatsbys excess--his house his clothes his celebrity guests--is designed to win over his beloved Daisy. Luhrmanns vulgarity is designed to win over the young audience and it suggests that hes less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste. The mistakes begin with the narrative framing device. In the book Nick has gone home to the Midwest after a bruising time in New York; everything he tells us of Gatsby and Daisy and the rest is a wondering recollection. Luhrmann and his frequent collaborator the screenwriter Craig Pearce have turned the retreating Nick into an alcoholic drying out at a sanatorium. He pulls himself together and with hardly any sleep composes the entire text of ""The Great Gatsby."" He types right on the manuscript ""by Nick Carraway."" (No doubt a manuscript of ""Lolita by Humbert Humbert"" will show up in future movie adaptations of Nabokovs novel.) The filmmakers have literalized Fitzgeralds conceit that Nick wrote the text--unnecessarily since for most of the rest of the movie we readily accept his narration as a simple voice-over. Doubling down on their folly Pearce and Luhrmann print famous lines from the book as Nick labors at his desk. The words pop onto the screen like escapees from a bowl of alphabet soup. When Luhrmann calms down however and concentrates on the characters he demonstrates an ability with actors that he hasnt shown in the past. Tobey Maguire with his grainy but distinct voice his asexual reserve makes a fine lonely Nick Carraway. He looks at Leonardo DiCaprios Gatsby with amazement and eventually admiration. As Nick slowly discovers that his Long Island neighbor is at once a ruthless gangster a lover of unending dedication and a man who wears pink suits as a spiritual project some of the books exhilarating complexity comes through. (The love between Nick and Gatsby is the strongest emotional tie in the movie.) DiCaprio thirty-eight still has a golden glow swept-back blond hair glittering blue-green eyes smooth tawny skin. The slender cat-faced boy of ""Titanic"" now looks solid and substantial and he speaks with a dominating voice. Hes certainly a more forceful Gatsby than placid Robert Redford was in the tastefully opulent but inert adaptation of the book from 1974. DiCaprio has an appraising stare and he re-creates Fitzgeralds description of Gatsbys charm that he can look at someone for an instant and understand how ideally he or she wants to be seen. As Daisy the English actress Carey Mulligan makes a good entrance with nothing but her hand lofted over the back of a couch and a tinkling voice to accompany it. Mulligan is not elegantly beautiful but shes a touching actress and when Tom and Gatsby fight over Daisy her face crumples and her eyes tear. Mulligan makes it clear how much Daisy is a shaky projection of male fantasy. The men struggle to possess her; she doesnt possess herself. As the brutal Tom the Australian actor Joel Edgerton is so unappealing that Daisys initial love for him seems impossible but Luhrmann makes the climactic fight between Tom and Gatsby a genuine explosion--the dramatic highlight of this directors career. The rest of the movie offers fake explosions. Luhrmann turns Gatsbys big parties into a writhing mass of flesh feathers dropped waists cloche hats swinging pearls flying tuxedos fireworks and breaking glass. There are so many hurtling ecstatic bodies and objects that you cant see much of anything in particular. When the characters roar into the city Times Square at night is just a sparkle of digitized colors. Luhrmann presumably wants to crystallize the giddy side of twenties wealth and glamour but he confuses tumult with style and often has trouble getting the simple things right. Gatsby and Nick have their crucial meeting with the criminal Meyer Wolfsheim but the director perhaps not wishing to be accused of anti-Semitism cast the distinguished Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan as the Jewish gangster. This makes no sense since the gangsters name remains Wolfsheim and Tom later refers to him as ""that kike."" Will young audiences go for this movie with its few good scenes and its discordant messiness? Luhrmann may have miscalculated. The millions of kids who have read the book may not be eager for a flimsy phantasmagoria. They may even think like many of their elders that ""The Great Gatsby"" should be left in peace. The book is too intricate too subtle too tender for the movies. Fitzgeralds illusions were not very different from Gatsbys but his illusionless book resists destruction even from the most aggressive and powerful despoilers.

Indeed it comes as little surprise that the Aussie auteur behind the gaudy more-is-more spectacles ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Australia"" has delivered a ""Gatsby"" less in the spirit of F. Scott Fitzgeralds novel than in that of its eponymous antihero -- a man who believes bejeweled excess will help him win the heart of the one thing his money cant buy. Cinema audiences can prove as fickle and elusive as Daisy Buchanan too but its a fair bet that a starry cast (and soundtrack) and sheer curiosity value will power this Warner/Roadshow co-production to career-best box office numbers for Luhrmann (a record currently held by ""Australia"" at 211 million) if not quite enough to justify its supposed 127 million budget.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Like the blinking green beacon at the end of Daisys dock -- so close and yet so far -- Fitzgeralds masterpiece of American letters has been a siren call for filmmakers ever since it was published in 1925. The first silent screen adaptation arrived just one year later (and is now like so many films of that era believed lost) with subsequent versions following in 1949 (reconfigured into a film noir) 1974 (the best-known with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow) and for cable TV in 2000. Rarely included in official ""Gatsby"" inventories 2002s quite curious ""G"" found an analog for Fitzgeralds Jazz Age in the world of contemporary musics hip-hop elite long before Luhrmann saw fit to enlist Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter as a collaborator on his films cheerfully anachronistic soundtrack. But no one has yet cracked ""Gatsby"" on film as ingeniously as the theater company Elevator Repair Service did in its 2010 stage adaptation ""Gatz"" built around one actors unabridged cover-to-cover recitation of the novel. <a href=""http//polldaddy.com/poll/7085138"">Take Our Poll</a> It is often said that great books make for inferior films and vice versa but there is something particular about ""Gatsby"" that seems to defy the screen. Transformed into voiceover the running first-person narration of Nick Carraway (here played by Tobey Maguire) turns stilted and dry (presumably a problem the silent version avoided). Scrutinized by the cameras gaze Fitzgeralds beautifully deployed symbols and signifiers become leaden with portent the green light the yellow roadster the mountain of custom-tailored shirts the unused swimming pool and the ever-watchful eyes staring out from the billboard of an enterprising Queens oculist. With Luhrmann at the helm those devices loom larger and more literal than ever until they come to resemble the towering monoliths of ""2001."" Of course to accuse Luhrmann (who also co-wrote the screenplay with frequent collaborator Craig Pearce) of overkill is a bit like faulting a leopard for his spots. Love it or hate it take it or leave it this is unmistakably his ""Gatsby"" through and through and as with all such carte-blanche extravaganzas (increasingly rare in this cautious Hollywood age) it exudes an undeniable fascination -- at least for a while. In the notes for his unfinished final novel ""The Last Tycoon"" Fitzgerald famously wrote ""action is character"" but for Luhrmann action is production design hairstyling Prada gowns and sweeping swirling CGI-enhanced camera movements that offer more birds-eye views of Long Island (actually the Fox Studios in Sydney) than ""The Hobbit"" did of Middle-earth. Arguably the movie reaches its orgiastic peak 30 minutes in with the first full reveal of Gatsby himself (Leonardo DiCaprio) accompanied by an explosion of fireworks and the eruption of Gershwin on the soundtrack. Where really can one go from there? PHOTOS The Great Gatsby Premiere Film Opens in New York But oh how Luhrmann tries. Together with cinematographer Simon Duggan he unleashes every manipulation he can think of -- sepia flashbacks smash zooms split screens superimpositions period newsreel footage new footage degraded to resemble period newsreel footage -- all of it coming at you in three steroscopic dimensions. Only occasionally does the style seem like an actual response to the text rather than a visual circus operating independently of it. In one of the pics more striking passages Carraways famous observation that he feels at once ""within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled"" becomes a lyrical mosaic of shared New York experience. Less effectively Luhrmann has complete sentences from the novel appear typed out on the screen -- a gimmick explained by a framing device that situates Carraway in a sanitarium recounting the tale of Gatsby to a captivated shrink (Jack Thompson) who encourages him to write the story down. What Luhrmann grasps even less than previous adapters of the tale is that Fitzgerald was via his surrogate Carraway offering an eyewitness account of the decline of the American empire not an invitation to the ball. But Luhrmann identifies far more strongly with Gatsby than he does with Nick and instead of a tragic figure undone by his false optimism and unrequited yearning the character becomes an object of envy  --someone whose swank mansion and runway couture would be awfully nice to call ones own. So the champagne flows like monsoon rain and the wild parties roar. Who cares if youre doomed to meet an untimely end so long as you go out looking fabulous? Everyone does look the part in this ""Gatsby"" not least DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan (as Daisy) though in the years since his innovative modern-dress ""Romeo + Juliet"" where style still sat in something like equal balance with substance Luhrmann has become less interested in performances than in artful poses. Periodically as if by accident something like real emotion pokes up through the films well-manicured surface as when Gatsby recounts his first meeting with Daisy his face lighting up with the childlike hope that so entrances Nick about him. More often ""Gatsby"" feels like a well-rehearsed classic in which the actors say their lines ably but with no discernible feeling behind them. By far the liveliest work in the film comes from two actors with only a few minutes of screen time between them the lithe long-limbed newcomer Elizabeth Debicki as gabby golf pro Jordan Baker and in a single scene that marks his belated Hollywood debut Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan as the flamboyant Jewish ""gambler"" Meyer Wolfsheim. Among the uniformly accomplished technical contributions Luhrmanns producer wife Catherine Martin (already a double Oscar winner for ""Moulin Rouge"") once again stands out for her production and costume design.

IMO It was one of the laziest and uninspiring literature to film adaptations that I have ever seen. A half hour into it I was ready to walk out. I only stayed hoping that the movie would get better. Then just when it seemed to get a little interesting the movie ended. The performance of Leonardo Di Caprio and the young lady who played Daisy were the only two positive things about this movie.

Wereblack people turned away because they were black or because the movie was sold out? Did you notice the white het couples being turned away too? Are you so racist and sexist that every ordinary event in life makes sense to you only if it is interpreted as a crucible of discrimination? Is everything observed only as an opportunity for clueless outrage? Are you still a college sophomore mentally though you graduated eons ago and should have matured into nuanced thinking by now? Then please consider getting over yourself and stop being the thing you hate. Oh and Baz threw in anachronistic music because thats what he does in every movie he makes- he does it to make classic material ""relevant"" and so what? Do you think the soundtrack for Romeo +Juliet was taken from traditional airs played in Shakespeares time? And for that matter do you think F Scott Fitzgerald is something holy? Check out Life of Brian sometime if Jesus can take a joke then I think ol Mr. Crackup is sleeping calm in his grave regardless of whether Jay Z and Beyonce accurately depict the Jazz Age. Reply V says May 7 2013 at 819 am ""Fitzgeralds beautifully deployed symbols and signifiers become leaden with portent the green light the yellow roadster the mountain of custom-tailored shirts the unused swimming pool and the ever-watchful eyes staring out from the billboard of an enterprising Queens ocularist. With Luhrmann at the helm those devices loom larger and more literal than ever..."" You are honestly telling me you never saw any of those symbols as obvious and literal in the books? Are you kidding me? Everything was very in-your-face in that book. The symbolism was not subtle and I dont expect it to be subtle in the film either. Reply MK says May 7 2013 at 1212 am Its spelled Caraway not Carraway. Reply Scott Foundas says May 7 2013 at 447 pm Actually its not. Reply D K says May 7 2013 at 1212 am Baz Luhrmann is a bad director plain and simple. A film that is visually busy and looks nice doesnt really cut it when youre trying to film an adaptation of one of the great works in American literature. What you get is THE GREAT GATSBY as a bad music video for attention-deficit teenagers. Pathetic and ridiculous ... with a rap score .... and in 3D GATSBYs undeniable failure as a film (and the bomb/joke that is AUSTRALIA) should finally bury Luhrmann in Hollywood ... good riddance Reply TheOppositionPHD says May 7 2013 at 839 am Are you saying you want a boring version of Gatsby? Splendid Watch one of the past versions. This film would die a painful death in the box office if the bling was removed. Im looking forward to an exciting adaption of Gatsby. Watch it in 2D there are plenty of other great songs like the ones by Florence + the machine. Have you even seen the movie yet? No? Stop being so ignorant Not everything will perfectly match your perception of things this is a version of Gatsby that is unique and exciting. We all have our own versions of Gatsby. I hope the story lives up to the book and I wont judge a movie by the fact thats its available in 3D 2013 everything is in 3D Youre lucky they didnt go IMAX Good day. Reply Sarah says May 7 2013 at 833 pm I dont think anybody is against ""bling"" but when the bling overpowers the substance of the narrative then people reserve the right to criticise the movie and pan it. So sure it may be entertaining but as an art form that includes many more things than visual aesthetics it probably fails. More than 50% of the reviews I have come across at this moment have critics disappointed with the movie. I may just wait for this to come out on DVD if the reviews are this bad. Usually I like to give movies a chance and ignore critics but since this is an adaptation of a novel (one of my favourites at that) Id prefer spending my money on Iron Man which has far better reviews. tomahawkhh7 says May 7 2013 at 553 pm Dont worry D K no one is paying me. I am just an enthusiast of everything that seems to make your world burn. I stand for freedom to explore I love to see things from new perspectives- even if I disagree with a burning passion. Thats the beauty of this world People are free to express themselves and hold their own beliefs. I dont care for 3D Ill be saving my money and watching it 2D style but Im sure there are people out there who want to experience in-your-face 3D Judging this film over its 3D option is like going to an ice cream shop buying a vanilla ice cream cone and complaining over the option other flavors that you personally do not enjoy consuming. We all know the truth is that not EVERYONE hated it. Of course the ones who hated it beyond control would be stomping their criticism all over the internet- but they dont represent the total population. I respect your opinion I loved the book and indeed Luhrmanns version is not completely what I imagined when I was reading but I look forward to a Gatsby that visually illustrates the words I so very much enjoyed reading. D K says May 7 2013 at 947 am Are you serious or a paid flunky trolling the boards? So let me get this straight - of your own free will youre selling the virtues of gimmicky 3D and an over-the-top contemporary soundtrack in an otherwise painfully bad adaptation of THE GREAT GATSBY. Wow. You know everyone whos seen it (and not remotely connected to the film) knows GATSBY is a flawed film (you already know my opinion). And this weekend everyone will know how bad it is. And deal with this fact - Its all Luhrmanns fault. He wanted to make his GATSBY with ahem ""bling"" and now hes going to have to fall on his sword. Hes absolute toast. So True says May 6 2013 at 1008 pm Hollywood sucks. Totally. Bunch of LW POSs. Reply Erquyman says May 6 2013 at 427 pm Mr Foundas says "" Fitzgerald was via his surrogate Carraway offering an eyewitness account of the decline of the American empire"". What empire? American culture or society but there never was an empire. Reply Fitzzz says May 6 2013 at 327 pm IM sure its going to be very successful Today we need distraction lots of color fantasy pretty clothes take our minds off whats happening in this country in the world all around us IM thinking big Hollywood musicals in the 30s that got peoples minds off the depression of their troubles think Gatsby can do similar I dont understand bringing in Jay Z for music when you think of all the great music that was out there in the 1920s but will be interested in seeing how it all plays Reply Marc S. LA says May 6 2013 at 248 pm I saw an advanced screening of this film in November 2012 and I had the same reaction as the writer of this article. I wonder if the film did not improve because it was so limited in its conception and target audience. The screening I went to was 98% white people ages 18-40s. The screening was put on by The Screening Exchange and while I was waiting in line I noticed that certain people were not being let into the film such as a openly gay male couple (I was shocked to hear a manager of The Screening Exchange explicitly tell them that gays were not welcomed to the screening) as well as a group of black men; I dont know the reason they were not allowed in. Perhaps if there had been a better sample size then the film could have evolved into something more comprehensive and ultimately better. Reply Fitzzz says May 6 2013 at 316 pm I find your comments about gays amp; blacks being turned away and not welcome very hard to believe I think if that had been true it would have been a big news story They would have been out parading with banners at one end of the street and looting at the other Reply Marjorie Smith says May 24 2013 at 505 pm I dont believe a word you say. This is one of those apocryphal stories dredged up to drum up sympathy for homosexuals and African Americans. Neither needs sympathy. Get real. Missy Raven says May 13 2013 at 729 pm ...exactly. Marc S. LA says May 6 2013 at 353 pm I find your stereotyping of gays to be ignorant and offensive. Not everyone who is discriminated against makes a big deal about it. I only saw that one gay couple turned away and one of the men started crying in the lobby. I do not know why the black men were turned away. I never said it was because they were black. All I said was they were turned away and I also noticed most people in the theater were white. Maybe it was a coincidence. You should be careful about the assumptions you make about people. It only furthers hate and discrimination. The screening exchange does have a reputation of screening people as well as films (check out yelp). I am wondering if you work for the film or The Screening Exchange. Al Milson says May 6 2013 at 257 pm It looks like the movie is for gay people. It looks like a garish version Bridehead Revisted with a boyish woman and Tobey and Leo are Sebastian and Charles. Reply Jacqueline London says May 6 2013 at 143 pm So excited cant wait to see it. Leonardo D should have won an Oscar so many times. He is a virtuoso an extraordinarily compelling actor. Cant wait And definitely going to see it in 3D The whole production sounds fantastic entertaining visually spellbinding. What a show Reply Renny Hartmann says May 6 2013 at 331 pm Me too. I expect it to be all the excitement Gatsby meant to inspire at the parties he didnt really attend. Fitzgerald was mocking all that but he was very well aware of the 20s excesses because he lived them all. Reply Laurence Glavin says May 6 2013 at 1258 pm I didnt go to see ""Catch 22"" because the primary appea lof the book wasnt the narrative but the gimlet-eyed view of the military even in a ""good"" war. It just wasnt translatable to the screen. I have the same regard for ""The Great Gatsby""; Unless the narrator reads aloud passages from the novel as written I dont see how it can succeed. Ive seen trailers that highlight the soundtrack which is another turnoff. Soundtracks with an aesthetic from a later era can work many romantic films and westerns that employ late-nineteenth symphonic styles a la Rachmaninoff and Sibelius (he lived well into the 20th Century but discontinued composing long before he died) are acceptable. A film like ""The Great Gatsby"" that would seem to appeal to a chronlogically adult population shouldnt feature a soundtrack whose appeal is to those who listen to crappy FM stations aimed at adolescents. Reply Sean (uglybagofwater) says May 6 2013 at 1257 pm So did you like it or not? Reply SARAH FITZGERALD says May 6 2013 at 1249 pm One of the most important American novels of all time bastardized by English and Australian actors and director who knows nothing about the historical content of F SCOTT FITZGERALDS work The roaring 20s -the beginning of the rise of the MAFIA thru prohibition which would give rise to the FBI the excesses which would give rise to the GREAT DEPRESSION and the DUST BOWL and the World War.... the fact that Beyonce and JAY Z have anything to do with this great novel nauseates me Reply Sarah says May 7 2013 at 926 pm Going by your logic all American adaptations of British literature should be panned because ""How can the foolish Americans possibly understand the historical content of this work?"" There are various directors of different nationalities that could have tackled this film. Baz Luhrmann is an otherwise mediocre director with a taste for visual excesses so its hardly surprising. Moulin Rouge was his only decent film and even that is highly overrated. Reply Sarah says May 7 2013 at 907 pm Blithering bumbling fool arent you? I dont remember people commenting and complaining about the bastardisation of British literature by its American adaptations (Dickens Shakespeare J R R Tolkein etc). I think you need to relax your tits and perhaps reserve your unintelligent criticism for later; maybe after you have watched movie? An adaptation isnt ruined by the nationalities and races of those involved with the production it is ruined by the ineffective execution of such films whether it is in terms of acting direction scripting casting music production amp; etc. If you know your literary history then Disneys best animation features are based on European fairy-tales. I dont here the Danes complaining about the suddenly inclusion of a Jamaican crustacean sidekick for Little Mermaid neither do I hear the British whinge about Robin Hoods American accent. Shinichiro Watanabes popular anime Samurai Champloo (2004) was set in the early Edo period. Yet the director chose an anachronistic soundtrack for the 17th century-set anime Hip-hop. The result was truly splendid even though we are talking about Japanese animation. But why should live action be any different? If the director(s) and producer(s) are skilled creative and intelligent enough it is definitely possible to pull off a movie with the anachronistic soundtrack formula. Its been done before and many times to great effect. From all the reviews I have read the OST for the movie gets a nod from most critics. In fact many have congratulated JAY Z for his production yet a same number (or more) have lambasted Luhrmann for fluffing the piece of literature by missing the entire point of Fitzgeralds novel which is essentially a social commentary on upper-class white America (in the same way that Richard Yates Revolutionary Road was a social commentary on suburban white America). However not one of the criticisms was levelled against the (Oh No How can it ever be) atrocity of involving (Gasp) British and Australian skills. If that is your major concern about Hollywood then Im afraid you have the intellectual range of a toothpick. How about you criticise the movie on fair grounds? Reply C Wilson says May 6 2013 at 747 pm ""the fact that Beyonce and JAY Z have anything to do with this great novel nauseates me"" Oh is that because they arent intelligent enough to appreciate it like you do? Just because they are hip-hop/rap/Ramp;B musicians means theyre stupid and ought not be involved with that kind of material? The Great Gatsby is absolutely one of the most important American novels and its one of my favorites and I definitely have reservations about this film. HOWEVER Its clear what your comments imply and I find them incredibly offensive. I intend to SEE the movie and LISTEN to the soundtrack before judging it. And lastly F. Scott Fitzgeralds brilliant novel remains as brilliant as it ever was. Its not as though this movie or any future adaptation somehow eviscerates it. Reply Al Milson says May 6 2013 at 259 pm Isnt the sound track hip hop and rap with cop killa sht and rapin them hoes? Reply Barry Hussein says May 6 2013 at 1058 am Does ""cheerfully anachronistic soundtrack"" mean he incorporated ghetto ""music"" crap into a movie set in the 1920s? Reply Sarah says May 7 2013 at 930 pm ""If she gets unruly and thinks she dont want do Take my 32-20 and cut her half in two"" JAY Z or Robert Johnson? Mull over that for a few. I think the only problem with JAY Z is the same problem with Luhrmann superfluous excesses. All quantity and no quality. Otherwise the musical experimentation probably would have worked better. Reply rusyn says May 6 2013 at 1252 pm yes Reply Lou says May 6 2013 at 1129 am I didnt realize Lana Del Rey Florence + the Machine Gotye and The xx were ghetto? Also I imagine people made similarly disparaging comments about jazz before it became an American art form. Reply meryl says May 6 2013 at 710 pm I think its hilarious how everyone loves to constantly call out hip hop for its blatant use of misogyny and homophobia. Not saying that these issues dont make rap alot harder to listen too. But I hardly ever see people criticizing other music genres for lyrics that are just as bothersome. At the end of the day all media we consume is problematic. Its really ignorant to just dismiss a whole genre of music. Not to mention a bit immature. Barry Hussein says May 6 2013 at 251 pm Right because jazz is all about misogyny and foul-mouthed 5th-grader rhyming by morons. Just like rap. Jim says May 6 2013 at 930 am When you realize that Jay Gatsby is Al Czervik Tom Buchanan is Judge Smails Nick Carraway is Danny-how bout a Fresca?-and Daisy is the Bushwood Country Club itself it all starts to make sense. Reply Al Milson says May 6 2013 at 1009 am LOL Who is Carl Spackler in Gatsby? Who gives Baz Luhrman money to make this tripe? Reply jhkjhkjhk says May 6 2013 at 801 am Sounds like a flick to see drunk and stoned just to enjoy how awful it is. But Baz is Bad not in the ghetto sense and I found Moulin Rouge execrable and Romeo + Juliet = dog doo. And when did chicks start wearing prosthetic nails? Those Lee glue-ons Daisy wears look like they might fly off into somebodys vichyssoise. Reply Patrick Farrell says May 6 2013 at 1244 pm Thats the best way to see any movie Reply Joe Ynot says May 6 2013 at 723 am This is a decent review but if Gatsby is about anything other than its characters (which always come first) its about the decline of the old upper class (hint to reviewer the action takes place after WW1 and the main characters are veterans) and the rise of the new upper class. The problem with filming ""Gatsby"" is that directors are seduced by the spectacle of the physical manifestation of wealth music parties love lust beauty etc and forget to the detriment of story and character. Daisy Buchanan is about the hardest role to cast that I can think of she must be beautiful seductive and loving and yet ironic narcissistic and cynical. The only modern actress that I can think of who could successfully bring of the role is Catherine Deneuve who is obviously not in a position to do so. Theres no arguing with taste of course but if you have a bad impression of this book read it through a second time paying very close attention (its a very short book) and you may be rewarded. It very much deserves its reputation. Reply epomert says May 12 2013 at 1111 pm I appreciate your point of view the way you expressed it and I will consider giving the book another read.

They shot most of this nonsense in Australia. Did Fitzgerald mention kangas dingoes koalas and other marsupials in the book? Hollywood spews out such rubbish just like TV.

Reply trickyk says May 5 2013 at 1141 pm Interesting point and I agree as it sums up the problem well ""What Luhrmann grasps even less than previous adapters of the tale is that Fitzgerald was via his surrogate Carraway offering an eyewitness account of the decline of the American empire not an invitation to the ball."" Reply Brendan Winter says May 5 2013 at 1132 pm As I have predicted since hearing Luhrmann was in charge this sounds likes an abomination. Reply epomert says May 5 2013 at 1017 pm I remember reading Gatsby in high school the same year we read Salinger Thoreau Emerson Twain and Whitman. Fitzgerald had nothing on these guys. Id never re-read him. I wouldnt think twice about going to see this movie except for the pleasure of beholding Luhrmanns kinetic cinematic gusto. Reply PB101 says May 7 2013 at 937 pm You mean youve read one-two book of each. In the same way that Ive listened to Sweet Child Smells Like Teen Spirit Layla Stairway to Heaven so Im a rock expert. Reply Lou says May 6 2013 at 1137 am You read all those in high school? You must be a literary luminary. Im so glad I stumbled upon your post because here I thought that Gatsby Tender is the Night The Beautiful and Damned and This Side of Paradise were some of the finest works of 20th century American literature. And yet you find the ""style is greater than substance"" glossy veneer of Luhrmanns work appealling? How curiously contradictory. Reply EJ says May 6 2013 at 455 pm Fitzgerald is one of my favorites and I too have read every title you mentioned. However there seems to be a personality type that just doesnt ""get"" him. I think it has to do with ones outlook on the world as in my experience all the bashers of his work Ive come across have a similar personality type. Hopefully after this film though everyone will give on the adaptations of Gatsby once and for all. Ian Dowsett says May 6 2013 at 345 am i think this hits the nail on the head. the reason gatsby is unfilmable is that it isnt as good a book as people think. it looks better than it is because it draws more than a few brilliant images of people and places but narratively its a mess; a shambolic bunch of connections between things. and a bunch of interesting characters who disappoint you by failing to do anything interesting. and a poor story doesnt leave you a lot of options for telling it well. maybe this is why baz abandoned so much in favor of images Reply Th_Ph says May 6 2013 at 803 am The reason so many films of Gatsby fail is because Hollywood types read the book upside down. Gatsby isnt meant to be glamorous hes meant to be ridiculous. He wears a pink suit for Gods sake as Tom Buchanan observes. Daisy is an old money girl and Gatsby thinks he can crash the upper class with a brass band display of vulgar and tasteless conspicuous consumption. His tragedy -- and the point of the book -- is that social mobility is a mirage. But Nick both admires Gatsbys pluck while being stupefied by Gatsbys own inability to see the futility of his campaign to be a part of Daisys world.

Daily Edition Login to download The Great Gatsby Film Review 928 PM PDT 5/5/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A hugely elaborate well-cast adaptation of an American classic that will provoke every possible reaction. TWITTER Leonardo DiCaprio Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan star in Baz Luhrmanns adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. The center holds amidst all the razzle-dazzle and razzmatazz of Baz Luhrmanns endlessly extravagant screen adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds imperishable The Great Gatsby. As is inevitable with the Australian showman whos never met a scene he didnt think could be improved by more music costumes extras and camera tricks this enormous production begins by being over-the-top and moves on from there. But given the immoderate lifestyle of the title character this approach is not exactly inappropriate even if it is at sharp odds with the refined nature of the authors prose. Although the dramatic challenges posed by the character of narrator Nick Carraway remain problematic the cast is first-rate the ambiance and story provide a measure of intoxication and most importantly the core thematic concerns pertaining to the American dream self-reinvention and love lost regained and lost again are tenaciously addressed. Set to open the Cannes Film Festival on May 15 five days after its U.S. theatrical bow the Warner Bros. release stands to receive the full range of critical responses and is backed by an unstinting promotional push to spark big openings which are far from assured. Its ultimate box office fate though will be determined by whether or not the film catches on with younger audiences; itll be a matter of the zeitgeist. PHOTOS Great Gatsby Premiere Leonardo DiCaprio Jay-Z and Carey Mulligan Hit the Red Carpet At the very least Luhrmann must be given credit for delivering a real interpretation of the famous 1925 novel something not seriously attempted by the previous two big screen adaptations (there was a now-lost 1926 silent version). Paramounts long-elusive 1949 release directed by Elliott Nugent suffered from threadbare production values and uneven performances but Alan Ladd was a terrific Gatsby. The same studios second attempt in 1974 felt suffocating and stillborn; it had the wrong director in Jack Clayton and Robert Redford was opaque in the title role. A 2000 television adaptation did not make a significant impression. For many the thought of Luhrmann tarting up such a revered classic with 3-D anachronistic Jay Z and Beyonce music techno-spiced party scenes and Australian locations was sacrilegious if not criminal. Perhaps even fans of what the director did with William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge might have wondered if he was the right guy to take on the work most often proposed as The Great American Novel. But no matter how frenzied and elaborate and sometimes distracting his technique may be Luhrmanns personal connection and commitment to the material remains palpable which makes for a film that most of the time feels vibrantly alive while remaining quite faithful to the spirit if not the letter or the tone of its source. PHOTOS The Costume and Set Designs of The Great Gatsby It begins gently in patchy black-and-white that accompanied by somber music turns into a depth-enhancing color 3-D frame that provides an equivalent for Luhrmanns previous red curtains and at length gives way to the famous green light at the end of Daisys pier. Curiously we are introduced to Nick (Tobey Maguire) as a patient in a sanitarium where he begins to tell a doctor (Jack Thompson) the story of what happened during the summer of 1922. Luhrmanns cultural collisions and dislocations then commence as a synthesis of archival footage and CGI (some of which looks to feature the Empire State Building and other yet-to-be-built skyscrapers a decade before their time and one shot featuring an unlikely copy of James Joyces Ulysses which had only just been published in Paris) inflected on the track by modern music all to the purpose of evoking the Jazz Age that Fitzgerald did so much to name and popularize. A polite lad of modest means trying to find a toehold on Wall Street Nick was at Yale with rich bruiser Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and has taken a little house in West Egg Long Island right across the bay from Tom and his wife Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and in the shadow of the ostentatious mansion owned by the elusive Jay Gatsby. Everybody from party girls to politicians comes to Gatsbys extravagant parties where the booze flows and the music plays and the carousing goes on all night. But no one ever sees the host whose wealth is surpassed only by his mysteriousness. No one knows where he or his money came from but during the nocturnal bacchanals no one much cares. Luhrmann and his ever-essential design collaborator (and co-producer and wife) Catherine Martin always seem extra-stimulated by such scenes which involve hundreds of ornate costumes constant movement and music which here imposes blends as unlikely as hip hop and Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue. Whether you can abide some of the specific musical choices or not the way Luhrmann and his music editors mix and match wildly disparate source material is ballsy and impressive; the operating principle is mood and emotion with a surprise element that can be jarring and/or inspired. THR COVER Baz Luhrmanns Despair Drive and Gamble Behind Great Gatsby In time-honored dramatic fashion Gatsbys entrance is delayed for a half-hour and when the moment comes theres something in the way its shot combined with the self-possessed I-own-the-world smile on Leonardo DiCaprios face that reminds of the first time you see the young Charles Foster Kane in an earlier film about a fellow with more money than he knows what to do with. This moment and even more so in the superb compositions and cutting of Gatsbys death show how classically precise Luhrmann can be when he wants to be. Throughout he photographs DiCaprio the way a movie star used to be shot -- glamorously and admiringly taking full advantage of the charismatic attributes with which only the anointed few are blessed. Brandishing his favorite phrase ""Old sport"" as well as a slightly affected accent no doubt carefully cultivated to disguise his origins Gatsby befriends the innocent Nick whom he asks to arrange a rendezvous with Daisy his sweetheart from five years earlier when he was a soldier off to Europe and the battlefront. Having already been taken into New York by Tom and his mistress Myrtle (Isla Fisher) for a debauched afternoon Nick now accompanies Gatsby for lunch at a mixed-race speakeasy with notorious gambling associate Meyer Wolfshiem (curiously impersonated by Indian cinema star Amitabh Bachchan). Once Gatsby and Daisy reunite nearly an hour in the film settles down a bit to focus on Gatsbys sincere effort to recapture the girl who got away who when he went to war married rich boy Tom. Gatsby wants to believe they can rewind the clock to the moment when they fell in love to the purity of what they once had. ""If I could just get back to the start"" he says choosing to ignore Nicks warning that ""You cant repeat the past."" PHOTOS Baz Luhrmann Exclusive Portraits of the Great Gatsby Director They do try organizing a nervous lunch to break the news to Tom then heading into Manhattan on a sweltering afternoon where in room at the Plaza everyones truths come tumbling out followed by tragedy on the road back and ultimately in Gatsbys pool. The precipitating automobile accident is perhaps too sketchily portrayed for full impact and the final stretch is slowed by too much commentary by Nick who has become a bit of a bore by now. Narrator/observer characters like Nick or Stingo in Sophies Choice are almost always uncomfortable fits onscreen especially when theyre far more bland and naive than everyone else around them but still prone to making assessments and judgments about people actually living life rather than standing to the side of it. This is exacerbated here by an element of hero worship towards Gatsby that distorts the more wistful ambivalent attitude conveyed in the books final pages. Maguires slightly aging boyishness has become tiresome by the films second half and a reduction of Nicks concluding commentary would have helped. By contrast we dont see enough of Daisys best friend the sporty haughty Jordan Baker who epitomizes the sort of modern 20th-century woman who has just arrived newly hatched in the world and will take from it what she pleases. Australian newcomer Elizabeth Debicki who with her towering slim build black hair and pool-like blue eyes resembles an elongated Zooey Deschanel is terrific as far as the part goes but after a few prominent scenes up front the character recedes. After a number of roles which however well acted may not have been comfortably in his wheelhouse DiCaprio looks and feels just right as Gatsby; the glamor and allure as at one with his film star persona hes sufficiently savvy to convince as a successful bootlegger but still young enough to recapture the hopes and innocence of youth. VIDEO New Great Gatsby Trailer Offers Beyonce Lana Del Rey and Platinum Extravagance Daisy is a difficult character for any actress to embody to everyones satisfaction because shes a woman onto whom the reader tends to project ones own ideal. Accordingly viewers will debate whether or not Mulligan has the beauty the bearing the dream qualities desired for the part but she lucidly portrays the desperate tear Daisy feels between her unquestionable love for Gatsby and fear of her husband. Edgerton is excellent as the proud entitled and seething bully Tom. Opulence defines the production values led by Martins sets and costumes. As for the use of 3-D by Luhrmann and cinematographer Simon Duggan it is probably the most naturalistic aspect of the film; only rarely do you notice it in a pronounced way and yet it really does add something to the experience drawing you in as if escorting you through a series of opening gates doors and emotional states.

Alonso Duralde | By    Alonso Duralde on May 5 2013  1010 pm Email Print Related The Great Gatsby New York Premiere (Photos) Jay-Z Composing Original Score for The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby Trailer Parties Liquor amp; Leo (Video) Baz Luhrmann sucks the life out of F. Scott Fitzgeralds immortal novel and replaces it with empty filigree and overbearing style F. Scott Fitzgeralds ""The Great Gatsby"" tells the story of a man with a shady past who is willing to waste countless millions of dollars in the pursuit of love and respect so its no surprise that the story has constantly proven to be catnip for people in the movie business. Now making its fourth foray onto the big screen under Baz Luhrmann""gt;Baz Luhrmanns uniquely ADHD-fueled supervision ""The Great Gatsby"" uses the unbridled excess of the Roaring Twenties as an excuse to unleash the unbridled excess of 21st century digital effects but were left with nothing but roar. See Photos The Great Gasby New York Premiere Yes this 2013 ""The Great Gatsby"" offers its occasional breathless moments when we cant quite believe that Luhrmann and his talented crew are going to turn this novel into a soaring candy-colored phantasmagoria but once his agenda of swooping camera movements and gleaming roadsters and anachronistic music takes full hold theres nothing left to fall back on - not even Fitzgeralds prose much of it quoted directly throughout is enough to keep this adaptation from feeling like a stunningly expensive advertisement for the Brooks Brothers collection of ""Gatsby""-inspired duds. Its a story you know from reading the book or at least the Cliffs Notes in tenth grade Ambitious young Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) comes to New York at the height of the 1920s stock market boom and settles into a bungalow in West Egg a nouveau-riche section of Long Island. His mysterious neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) throws nightly bacchanals that attract all the movers and shakers of the day but Nick comes to find out that they exist in the hopes of enticing one special guest Nicks cousin and Gatsbys lost love Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who lives directly across the water from Gatsby in the East Egg estate of her rich rotter husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Also Read The Great Gatsby Features Music From Beyonce Florence + the Machine Daisy loves Gatsby and Gatsby has money but he doesnt have the name or position or social power that her husband can offer and ultimately Gatsby will discover that no matter what hardships he survived in World War I or how popular his parties are hes not equipped to swim the same waters as a preppy shark like Tom. ""The Great Gatsby"" is an immortal American tragedy but the storys impact gets completely buried in Luhrmanns flash and dazzle. While his spin on the adolescent angst of Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" and his over-the-top reimagining of fin de siecle Paris in ""Moulin Rouge"" felt like an exciting blend of the classic and the contemporary - heck even the de trop-itude of ""Australia"" could be forgiven thanks to its cornball old-Hollywood charms - this time out the Luhrmann touch feels more like a smudge covering up the vitality of the original material. It doesnt help that the cast feels like theyre in different movies - and none of them are movies youd particularly want to see. The blank and reactive Maguire and Mulligan are cast as the blank and reactive Nick and Daisy the result being such a vortex of nothing that they threaten to disappear from the screen entirely. Edgerton perspires and chews the scenery in his best Snidely Whiplash manner while DiCaprio has a fluctuating accent that often sounds like its being delivered through a mouthful of marshmallows. DiCaprios utterances of Gatsbys pet endearment ""old sport"" become more and more cringe-worthy with each repetition. Luhrmanns style of filmmaking demands a pre-Actors Studio brand of screen acting but this bunch is incapable of providing a level of brassy artificiality that matches the movies. Only newcomer Elizabeth Debicki who comes off like a combination of Rashida Jones and Kristin Scott Thomas displays any kind of flair or even an approximation of humanity. Humanity is in fact in short supply here with most of the supporting characters reduced to grotesque mugging and posturing. Luhrmann treats the people of color here like exotic furniture shooting his African-Americans as though he were planning to turn them into Mammy cookie jars. Its a queasy situation only compounded by the bizarre casting of legendary Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan as Gatsbys unsavory associate Meyer Wolfshiem. The cardinal sin of this new ""Gatsby"" is that its dull and say what you will about Luhrmanns previous movies thats not an adjective that usually comes up. Here sadly you can hear the wheels of the plot grinding as loudly as Gatsbys custom Duesenberg. This film marks the official moment in which Baz Luhrmanns signature style has become self-parody. So we beat on boats against the current jumping the shark. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
