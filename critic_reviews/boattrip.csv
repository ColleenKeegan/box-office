Comments Boat Trip Cuba Gooding Jr. is the kind of guy who does ten minutes of shtick every time the little light in the fridge comes on and for years Ive been waiting for him to just go away. If this dud comedy is any indication of the scripts hes getting we may not have to wait much longer. He and chubby Horatio Sanz play a pair of skirt chasers who accidentally book themselves on a gay ocean-liner cruise and the vulgar gags are as predictable as the corrective homily about accepting homosexuals. Roselyn Sanchez plays the straight but man-hating dance instructor that Gooding hopes to seduce by pretending to be gay; Roger Moore camps it up as his majesty the queen. Mort Nathan directed a script he wrote with William Bigelow. 95 min. By J.R.

Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Horatio Sanz Roselyn Sanchez Vivica A. Fox Bob Gunton. Directed by Mort Nathan. Written by Nathan and William Bigelow. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Cuba Gooding Jr. Hollywoods leading purveyor of ""more is better"" comic acting won an Oscar six years ago for "" Jerry Maguire "" a movie that showcased yet contained his natural exuberance. Since then Goodings performances have gotten bigger as his movies have gotten smaller. ""Boat Trip"" an unfunny fish-out-of-water comedy set on a gay pleasure cruise presents Gooding at his most flamboyant as a straight man pretending to be gay. Flouncing and preening the actor works hard to sell the movies penile puerile jokes his strain so evident that it borders on sad. SO DRUNK IT HURTS Shame on director Mort Nathan for letting Gooding overact so much especially during a bit where his character Jerry is supposed to be drunk -- Foster Brooks was subtle by comparison. But the bigger problem is that we notice the acting at all in lowbrow comedy like this. If the jokes worked nobody would mind Gooding bugging his eyes. Director Nathan stacks the picture with sight gag after sight gag from phallic ice sculptures to leather daddies in buttless holiday gear. Such flagrant gayness along with references to homosexuals allegiance to Liza and Bette are supposed to crack em up in Middle America. But these jokes were hoary before ""La Cage Aux Folles."" Some pretty spectacular contrivances have led Jerry and his Belushi-esque buddy (""Saturday Night Lives"" Horatio Sanz) to pretend to be gay. First they land on the cruise because of a road-rage incident then Jerry goes fey to win the love of the ships female dance instructor (Roselyn Sanchez) with his buddy posing as his lover. The dance instructor is through with straight men and considering hooking up with a gay guy. No it doesnt make sense but it allows the film to explore territory usually reserved for comedies where men dress in drag. You know the drill The female love interest confides her hearts desires to her unthreatening new pal while he secretly lusts after her. One surprise in ""Boat Trip"" is that Sanchezs character is somewhat interesting -- no small task for a female role in a movie with a subplot about a buxom Swedish suntanning team. Sanchez (""Rush Hour 2"") has a solid inviting screen presence making her character lusty and fun while hinting at past romantic hurts. Her dance scenes with Gooding carry a real charge. The two look hot together. MOORE LEERS Sanz actually underplays his buffoon role staying poker-faced in scenes opposite Roger Moore whos delicious as a randy sugar daddy. ""Would you care for a bite of my sausage?"" he asks Sanz while licking a link. Moore the sly old devil actually makes the line funny. . This film contains raunchy humor sexual situations.

"Also Opening washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Also Opening Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 21 2003 BOAT TRIP (R 95 minutes) Much to my horror there is an audience out there for ""Boat Trip"" a coarse comedy (the way ground glass mixed with cat litter might be described as ""coarse"") about two horny straight guys (Cuba Gooding Jr. and Horatio Sanz) who accidentally get booked on an all-gay cruise and dont realize it until the ship leaves port. Accidentally? What are they blind or just stupid? There isnt a woman in sight and all the passengers look like theyre headed to a Village People fantasy camp or are extras from a ""La Cage aux Folles"" touring company. So much for subtlety not to mention sensitivity to stereotypes. Anyway the genteel folks I sat with the other night howled -- thats right positively howled like coyotes on nitrous oxide -- in response to the sight gag of two men holding hands. This is a sight gag? It is here. But then again so is a scene in which Goodings character pretending to be gay in order to get closer to the ships sole female staffer (Roselyn Sanchez) -- look I didnt say it made sense -- has to watch her orally pleasure a banana. This scene gets him so hot and bothered that he um climaxes out the stateroom window leading to what I can only describe as a ""Theres Something About Mary""-style hair gel shot and a line of dialogue that might have been the films only moment of wit but which was drowned out by the crowds uproarious laughter. It only gets worse. If this garbage sounds like your kind of thing and the folks who jump up and talk back to the screen are your kind of people then sweetheart you and this movie deserve each other. Contains obscenity toplessness and pervasive blue humor.

One can however argue that its a tragedy when a movie this clumsy is the Oscar-winning actors follow-up to last years already perpetual target for put-downs Disneys Snow Dogs. Nick (Horatio Sanz) and Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.) prepare to set sail on a Boat Trip. Gooding and pal Horatio Sanz are straight but they end up on a cruise geared toward gay men. The sexual humor here is as subtle as a Pacific Coast mudslide thanks to co-writers William Bigelow and director Mort Nathan. Theres Something About Mary proved theres something about semen when it comes to getting laughs. This movie tries to extend that legacy. With Gooding in drag (eventually) Roger Moore licking a sausage link and a subplot involving bikinied Swedish blondes in a tanning contest the only thing a movie this unrefined needs is a vaudevillian in baggy pants and someone hawking peanuts in the aisle. (R strong sexual content language drug material.) -- Mike Clark Piglets Big Movie Piglet doesnt play a very big part nor does anything big happen in Piglets Big Movie. In fact the movie feels more like a slightly longer episode of Disneys old Winnie the Pooh television series. More on the movies Boat Trip (out of four) Piglets Big Movie Why it didnt go direct to video can be answered in three words The Tigger Movie. Tiggers big-screen debut in 2001 drew a surprisingly large audience. Based on that success there probably are movies in the offing for Eeyore and Roo too. But at least Tigger merited an actual plot in his movie. Poor Piglet doesnt gets his due on Pooh Corner nor does he in this movie. Voiced adorably by John Fiedler who has been doing it for 35 years Piglet laments his tiny stature and doesnt feel needed by his friends. But when he is lost his pals eventually come to see his worth. The soundtrack has some catchy new tunes notably Carly Simons With a Few Good Friends. Too bad there isnt more to the plot.
