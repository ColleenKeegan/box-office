With Stephen Rea Stephen Dorff Natascha McElhone. Directed by William Malone. Running time 96 mins. Rated R Violence nudity language. 1 Star. The one thing truly frightening about the slasher flick ""feardotcom"" is that Stephen Rea wastes his considerable talents in a supporting role as a man who likes an audience while he tortures young women. Stephen call your agent. The story extrapolates from the phenomenon of bleary-eyed Web surfers who spend too much time at porn sites. In ""feardotcom"" these computer nerds die 48 hours after logging onto a Web site that is interactively voyeuristic and very likely deadly. ""Do you like to watch?"" purrs the Webmistress who materializes on the screen. Click ""on"" and shell hound you like a telemarketer to change your mind. Once signed up the subscriber gets an eyeful of horrific images of kidnap torture and mutilation many involving Rea waxing poetic about death while preparing his next victim. The concept is not far from reality. Watching the Daniel Pearl video that made the rounds of the Internet was similarly sickening. Those who visit this ""feardotcom"" site find that their eyes are bleeding which makes the police and the health services first suspect the deadly Ebola virus. But its no virus more like an Information Age payback. The movie could have been called ""I Know What You Did Online."" With an underlit Luxembourg standing in rather ineffectually for New York City the movies palette is so dark its possible every scene was enacted on one set. Who can tell what with all that monotonous blue-filtered shadow? Investigators enter crime scenes without bothering to turn on a light. Perhaps the action is supposed to take place during a rolling blackout. Stephen Dorff plays a cop hardly New Yorks finest and Natascha McElhone plays an unlikely Health Dept. inspector who grins vapidly while discussing serious public health threats. They are both dim bulbs perhaps to match the movies lighting. What they wonder could the victims possibly have in common? (Heres a clue Each has a computer that imploded.) The victims also experience disturbing visions of a little girl playing with a ball. They die either of fright or of astonishment that director William Malone would steal so blatantly from Stanley Kubrick. Malone has an eye for moody tableaux and certainly knows his horror classics - he rips off several of them from ""Peeping Tom"" to the Danish TV series ""Kingdom."" Many of his artful compositions look like those tattered black-and-white B movies they used to show on afternoon TV. Meanwhile the story is a mess some of the images offensive the acting under par and the dialogue silly. One audience member at the screening yelled over the end credits ""I want two hours of my life back"" E-mail jamibernaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"A More Appropriate Title Would Be Stupiddotcom - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Serial Killer A More Appropriate Title Would Be StupiddotcomMOVIE REVIEWAugust 31 2002|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterThus did the summer of 2002 - the summer that began with a hit about a web-spinner - end with a dud about the World Wide Web.Feardotcom skulks into theaters repackaging the grim and ever-underlit serial killer thriller Seven for the Internet Age.How does it go wrong?For starters it makes little sense. A Web site that kills those curious enough to log into it has cop Stephen Dorff (Blade) remembering the serial killer he never caught ""The Doctor."" It makes a community health official played by Natascha McElhone of The Truman Show think that shes stumbled onto an electronically induced version of the Ebola virus. Victims bleed from their eyes.It has Stephen Rea the Irish star of The Crying Game slinging his idea of an American accent. His version of ""The Doctor"" sounds way too much like Jack Nicholson.And it has Luxembourg and Montreal substituting for New York which is why we see the same Ford Crown Victoria over and over again and why too many supporting players have varying German accents.William Malone of House on Haunted Hill directed this and never moved much beyond the David Fincher ""Lets not turn on the lights"" stratagem of Seven. But all the darkness in Europe cant make Luxembourg look like the City that Never Sleeps. He fills the computer screen with dark hints of every Feardotcom users deepest fears and fills the movie screen with scenes of nude women being tortured.What fun.The pity is that theres an interesting thriller buried inside this concept. The idea that Net voyeurism leads to death that a self-righteous villain might want to punish those who would visit sick sicker and sickest Web sites is a solid hook to hang your film on. Thats not what comes across. The Doctor is under-motivated. Like too many horror heavies hes just evil.The unintentional laughs pour forth from the script in which a grieving mother can remember how her hemophiliac daughter was deathly afraid of sharp objects anything that could cut her. And then brighten up the moment she sees photos of a jagged ruin she recognizes.""Oh thats the abandoned steel mill just down the road. She used to play there.""The silliness doesnt make up for the offensiveness. The endless shadows dont hide the artlessness.And most damning of all the biggest fright involves a dead mouse. And that comes five minutes into the picture.Youd be better off this last weekend of summer going back and discovering the better summer movies you might have missed Signs My Big Fat Greek Wedding Undisputed The Road to Perdition or Lilo amp; Stitch.Whatever you do dont log in to Feardotcom.

Its sluggish pace trudges along at a pre-DSL 14400 bps its cinematography is so cruddy it looks like streaming video on a bad Internet connection and its performances might charitably be described as career lows for all involved. Combine these elements and you have a movie that should premiere in the bargain DVD bin. Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone investigate a series of deaths tied to a bizarre Web site actually called feardotcom.com. The site displays nightmarish images that tap into the most virulent fears of those who log on. It is run by a banally sadistic Stephen Rea who delights in torturing women while quoting Stalin. At this point viewers might wonder who really is being tortured here. Feardotcom was shot in Luxembourg doubling as New York City and features European bit players mangling American accents (Reas faux-menacing lilt is particularly laughable). The screenplay too seems like a bad translation from another language In one scene a character fondly recalls her hemophiliac daughter frolicking at the rusty scrap heap known as the neighborhoods abandoned power plant. The proceedings might be spooky were you able to see what youre supposed to be scared of but director William Malone shoots every scene in murk. Apparently no one in the entire city has paid an electric bill for years. Characters visiting feardotcom.com are asked by a seductive female voice ""Do you want to hurt me?"" Film audiences probably will answer in the affirmative. Youll want to visit jeer.com while Dorff Rea and Malone would do well to check out newcareer.com.

"Maybe It Should Be Titled chuckledotcom - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Maybe It Should Be Titled chuckledotcomAugust 30 2002|MANOHLA DARGIS | TIMES STAFF WRITER One of the great guilty pleasures of moviegoing is watching a film you expect to be bad turn out to be spectacularly bad. A horror movie that puts its own special spin on the word ""howler"" ""feardotcom"" opens with a cameo from Udo Kier a character actor whose presence usually portends either something pretty good (as when hes in a Lars von Trier film) or something pretty awful (take your pick ""Barb Wire"" or ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"").Clutching a book to his body and rolling his bloodshot eyes Kier stumbles across a soundstage thats desperately trying to pass itself off as a New York City subway platform and desperately failing. It doesnt look good in any sense of the term and it looks much worse once a little girl materializes on the scene wearing a smear of black lipstick and a peroxide blond wig left over from the British shocker ""Village of the Damned."" Rolling his eyes as wildly as a drunk rolls dice Kier flings himself into the path of a train a putatively irrational act that seems all too sensible the further this gibberish unfolds.Kiers character and the diminutive she-devil have something to do with a phantom thats haunting the Internet and a serial killer named ""the Doctor"" (Stephen Rea) who videotapes his grisly crimes then puts the footage on the Web. A detective named Mike (Stephen Dorff) has been hunting the Doctor for some time but hasnt been able to catch a break. When victims with bleeding eyeballs begin to litter the city streets however prompting the intervention of a department of health inspector named Terry (Natascha McElhone) the cold case begins to warm.All too slowly Mike and Terry discover that the ghost in the machine draws Web surfers into a site called feardotcom where they and we can watch the bad doctor slowly torture women to death with an assortment of glinting needles and scalpels. The surfers get bloody eyes for their trouble and we get this movie which oscillates between ineptitude and incoherence and inspires more mirth than fright.The biggest or at least most obvious culprit in this regard is Josephine Coyles script which has its genesis in a story by the films producer Moshe Diamant which may explain why this project got made at all. The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene and it makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if theyre trying to remain unrecognized (Rea a very long way from ""The Crying Game"").Perhaps because he read the script--and was trying to make Luxembourg and Montreal pass for New York--director William Malone opts to light the film so darkly that it can be hard to make out everything in the frame. This is a good thing. Malone has made an obvious study of old Nine Inch Nails videos and someone involved with ""feardotcom"" has grabbed onto the shell of Clive Barkers and David Cronenbergs work but no one here has figured out that the shiny surface of fear isnt the same thing as its depth. Then again while such artlessness doesnt inspire shivers its definitely worth a few cheap laughs.MPAA rating R for violence including grisly images of torture nudity and language.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Internets intimidating vastness anonymity artificiality and tendency toward the basest forms of voyeurism and exhibitionism have made it an irresistible subject for horror suspense and science-fiction filmmakers. Still nearly all Internet-themed thrillers fall short largely because there seems to be no good way to make the process of using the Internet look anything other than geeky and passive. The latest in a long line of would-be cyber-thrillers FearDotCom uses the Internet as window dressing for yet another gruesome Seven knockoff complete with lingering shots of decomposed corpses and perpetually rain-slicked streets. The films nightmarish urban dystopia is ironically filled with light fixtures none of which seem remotely capable of illuminating anything. Either the city is going through a major energy shortage or its outlawed the use of all but the lowest-wattage light bulbs. Into this frustratingly secondhand darkness wades the once-promising Stephen Dorff who in keeping with the films mix-and-match approach combines the manly stubble and profession of Sevens Brad Pitt with the Jack Nicholson-inflected vocal stylings of Christian Slater. A tormented detective in a city where torment seems to be the norm Dorff teams up with plucky health inspector Natascha McElhone to track down a serial killer who uses the Internet to lure victims and cyber-cast his crimes apparently in hopes of becoming the Harry Knowles of Internet snuff films. FearDotCom periodically dabbles in the idea of the Internet as a malevolent creature with a soul of its own but mostly borrows its ideas from offline sources like Seven Peeping Tom and Dont Look Now. Not surprisingly its silliest aspects are the ones most related to the web. The ""killer"" sites animation for example is strangely evocative of Terry Gilliams Monty Python work; perhaps a sequel will feature characters checking out the sites sound-clips of ""The Lumberjack Song"" when they arent being cyber-menaced and cyber-mutilated. FearDotCom was made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises but its quickly apparent that theres no thought or originality under its grim familiar surface.

Comments Feardotcom A police detective (Stephen Dorff) and a city health officer (Natascha McElhone) try to determine why people are dropping dead exactly 48 hours after theyve logged on to a mysterious Web site; meanwhile a surgeon turned serial killer (Stephen Rea) tortures a young woman held down in part by a leather strap across her bare breasts. Like David Finchers Seven this sicko horror movie takes place in a perpetual midnight of shadowy apartments and gray blue office spaces interrupted now and again by the Web sites frenzied and gruesome montage. The script written by Josephine Coyle from a story by producer Moshe Diamant labors to explain its murky premise with some mumbo jumbo about the ""secret soul of the Internet"" yet its plot devices range from the unlikely (a video shot by the first two victims that handily explains their deaths) to the preposterous (a lipstick shell dug out of a corpse that contains a note with the serial killers address--""Bingo"" exclaims the cop). William Malone directed this shameless exercise in high-tech sadism; with Udo Kier Amelia Curtis and a great cameo by Michael Sarrazin. 98 min. By J.R.

This Summers Final Answer By Collin Levey Updated Aug. 30 2002 1201 a.m. ET The scariest thing about ""Feardotcom"" is that the movie ever got made. Obviously somebody in studio accounting failed to notice that the bulk of the target audience would never be allowed past the ticket window. Pre-teen girls (i.e. the ""Titanic"" audience still coming off its sugar high) are the only demographic that might be susceptible to the screaming freak-out the producers evidently intend. But theres a little matter of the R rating for ""grisly images of torture"" and random nudity. The premise -- that the Internet is killing people -- would not seem entirely unpromising. Stephen Dorff plays Mike a virile young police detective assigned to a long-unsolved case to find a ""doctor"" who experiments on live humans while broadcasting his sicko behavior over a Webcam. Thing is the acting is awful the script is dreadful and the delivery is unintentionally comic. It would make anyones list for 10 worst of the year. One day like any other day a man is found leveled by a subway train face frozen in a scream clutching a book called ""The Soul of the Internet."" Weird huh? Could this be a hyperlink to the unsolved case? If that werent enough excitement soon a punked-out stoner kid babbling in a foreign tongue is dragged into the station house. Hes bleeding from the eye sockets. Within hours hes dead but has left a mysterious message scrawled on the wall the number 48. Investigating the young mans apartment Detective Mike finds a dead girl in the bathtub (also bleeding from the eye sockets) and a Health Department hottie (Natascha McElhone) who has beaten him to the scene. ""Possible signs of a hemorrhagic virus"" she observes trenchantly. Its not a virus of course which makes all this dying and bleeding very inexplicable until our clever girl unearths a clue All the people began to bleed internally within 48 hours of visiting the same Web site feardotcom.com. None of this is nearly as interesting as it sounds. For instance how visiting the forbidden site makes viewers eyes bleed is never entirely clear. It has something to do with the ticked-off ghost of a former victim but thats the closest I could come to an answer. For the most part the movie serves up an incomprehensible collage of high-tech voyeurism sprinkled with every hackneyed creep-out trick in the book -- from eerie little ghost girls to melting walls and scurrying cockroaches. Detective Mike and his health researcher/love interest follow a trail that seems decipherable only to themselves leading us through a series of encounters with characters irrelevant to the plot who are never seen again. Americans have always had a thing for horror films and the charm of ""The Exorcist"" or ""Psycho"" or ""Friday the 13th"" was anything but their unpredictability. The cheerleader always dies two minutes after her boyfriend says ""Dont worry Ill be right back."" But even your basic slasher flick is still expected to clear some minimum bar for pacing and startle factor. ""Feardotcom"" instills little fear. This despite the fact that the cast and crew includes a few veterans of this genre. Director William Malone was responsible for 1999s ""House on Haunted Hill."" Stephen Rea who plays the mad doctor appeared in the movie adaptation of Anne Rices ""Interview With the Vampire"" and Jeffrey Combs (as Mikes partner) turned up in ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."" The difference was that in all these movies when the audience laughed it was because the jokes were intentional. Satin Rouge Its too bad that the best movie this week will open on only a small fraction of the screens that the stinker above will. Set in Tunisia Raja Amaris ""Satin Rouge"" is a subtle and understated exploration of sexual awakenings and reawakenings -- and of mothers and daughters. Its a simple story exposing the beauty that lives inside difficult relationships and it leaves you feeling quietly exalted without ever seeming to try. In French with subtitles ""Satin Rouge"" spins the tale of a widowed seamstress Lilia and her teenage daughter Salma. As the movie begins the two are as different as two women can be The young girl braless and zaftig has a lust for life checked only by her sense of responsibility for her mother who is frigid dutiful and alone. The older woman hair pulled back from a tired face passes her days knitting a sweater that her daughter has long since outgrown. One evening when Salma doesnt return home Lilia fuming stalks out to try to find her in a belly-dancing cabaret where she is seeing one of the musicians. The teenager is nowhere in sight and soon the mother becomes engulfed in a swirling scene where hazy cigarette smoke and sweat and men mingle with the undulating and jingling of the belly dancers. The debauch is such a shock to her system that she passes out on the floor. When she comes to she is being looked after by the clubs lead dancer. The two strike up a friendship and Lilias transformation begins. Slowly she relearns how to move her body as a young woman does sheds her drab housedress and comes out into the world again. She re-emerges tentatively into an Arab society that demands modesty and obedience. While the films theme of middle-aged dalliances in an exotic cabaret may seem tawdry it has none of the in-your-face sexuality a Sunday afternoons channel-flicking will turn up. The girls of the Tunisian cabaret shake bodies far more covered and far less perfect than the overcoaxed specimens Hollywood usually offers. What they reveal about women is something else entirely. Mad Love Known as ""Juana la Loca"" in Spain where it was made ""Mad Love"" is a film to prove that nymphomaniacs have been around since the 16th century. It tells the story of Queen Joan of Castile who was eventually locked up for insanity and known as ""Joan the Mad"" because she loved too much. Or perhaps because she loved the wrong man. The movie begins in Laredo where Joan (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) the daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand is setting sail for Flanders where she is to be married to Philip the Archduke of Austria and heir to the Holy Roman Empire. The marriage is a political one and the dark almost translucently waifish Princess Joan is frightened of the brute she expects to meet on the other shore. ""If youre asked"" the queen counsels the child bride ""answer as I do that you married for love."" That turns out to be easier than expected if you allow for some blurring of the lines between love and desire. Within minutes of meeting her intended known as Philip the Handsome (Daniele Liotti) she is slung over his shoulder and carted off to bed. From that moment she is utterly devoted. Unfortunately for her the man from Flanders turns out to be a philandering and pathological cad sending Joan spinning into rages of incoherent jealousy. In theory the movie leaves it to the audiences discretion to decide whether Joan of Castile is a raving lunatic or simply an unlucky woman hitched to a cruel Fabio lookalike. Her spiraling jealousy and neurotic behavior render her unable to concentrate on anything else. She bears his children but we never see them. She surrounds herself with the ugliest ladies-in-waiting she can find. And she hatches schemes to test the love of her disdainful husband. But by the time Philip the Handsome has had enough of her and her too-bright eyes the audience has too. Despite being a pretty film with some good performances its hard to sympathize with a character that wont help herself. More proof if we need it that mixing sex and politics only leads to trouble.  VIDEO TIP To complete the trilogy of films about women and the men they covet 1944s ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is the one to see again. Directed by Frank Capra and starring Cary Grant the movie is a hilarious dark comedy about two murderous old women who lure men into their Brooklyn apartment for a drink of elderberry wine then kill them and bury them in the basement. Cary Grant is brilliant and the killer aunts are so innocuous theyll make you start wondering about your most docile neighbors. Joe Morgernstern is on vacation.

Its bad in a sickening disturbing way with its gratuitous mixture of sex and violence. The movie follows New York police detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Department of Health researcher Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) as they investigate why people are dying within 48 hours of logging onto the Web site www.feardotcom.com. (If curiosity gets the best of you and you feel compelled to click onto the site dont worry _ you wont die. Youll just waste time with information on the cast and crew.) The Web site in the movie allows people to watch as murderer Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea who doesnt need this work) tortures women before killing them. Screenwriter Josephine Coyle probably intended this as an indictment of peoples voyeuristic appetites and the way in which the Internet feeds them. But the images are so twisted and bloody they seem to shock for shocks sake and provide no insight. Pratt injects a bit of comic relief into this dreary outing as a sort of ""Saturday Night Live"" version of Hannibal Lecter. He nasally intones in his victims ears ""Tell us about yourself _ who you are where youre from"" and compliments them on their cheap perfume while theyre tied up and blindfolded. Like ""Poltergeist"" the Web site knows what scares the people who log on to leer at the violence. They end up dying from what they fear most A woman whos petrified of insects is eaten up by them; a man who fears car crashes goes flying through his own windshield. Despite the popularity of his Web site _ and the string of corpses hes left behind _ Pratt has eluded police and the FBI for years. Mike figures the only way to find him is to log on even though Terry warns him not to do it _ and so begins the 48-hour countdown to death (which is never explained but whatever). Then Terry points and clicks to try to save Mike _ and guess what happens to her. Beautiful but boring Terry contributes to the investigation with insights like ""Well know more when we get the body back to the morgue"" and ""Maybe this guy was trying to tell us something."" The look of the film is no better than the script. Director William Malone is described in the production notes as a film historian and avid collector of memorabilia. But the images hes chosen are strictly cliches a spooky-looking little girl playing by herself with a ball elevator doors that close at the last minute during a chase and incessant thunderstorms. Malone must have saved a ton of money on lighting though. Most of the movie takes place at night and every room is illuminated by a single lamp in the corner which usually has been knocked to the floor in a flurry of Internet-induced violence. In its quest to be a dark Gothic horror movie ""fear dot com"" ends up being just dark. ""fear dot com"" a Warner Bros. release is rated R for violence including grisly images of torture nudity and language. Running time 98 minutes. One star out of four (the lowest rating). ___ Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions G _ General audiences. All ages admitted. PG _ Parental guidance suggested.

Liam Lacey From Saturdays Globe and Mail Published Saturday Aug. 31 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday May 21 2013 346PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English FearDotComDirected by William MaloneWritten by Josephine CoyleStarring Stephen Dorff Stephen Rea and Natascha McElhoneClassification RRating The Internet as the locus of evil has popped up in a number of movies recently including Olivier Assayas Cannes-competition film Demonlover and the apocalyptic Japanese ghost story Pulse from Kiyoshi Kurosawa (to be remade by Wes Craven). The latest FearDotCom is a studio B-movie that is gruesome and bewildering featuring lots of bruising computer-generated effects subbasement atmosphere and glimpses of women being bound and dismembered. Theres potential here for a macabre cult favourite touching on themes of technology and the body-mind split but the movies progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ""fatal script error."" The movie stars Stephen Dorff as a gruff detective and the English actress Natascha McElhone ( Mrs. Dalloway) as a health officer who join together to solve a series of gruesome deaths. (Her deer-in-the-headlights performance is a classic case of a good actress flailing about in a role that makes no sense.) The victims who bleed from the eyes and nose before succumbing to an apparent fright attack have all logged onto a Web site offering virtual sadism the clumsily-named feardotcom.com.The virtual hostess who looks like Sharon Stone with Joan Crawfords eyebrows asks in a faintly European accent ""Do you like to watch?"" Apparently the answer ""Only if its good"" does not apply.Director William Malone ( The House on Haunted Hill) shoots almost everything in tones of blue and black and the look achieves the mouldy wallpaper texture of the movie Seven. The movie is almost constantly interior and ominous. The villain as we learn fairly quickly is a man called The Doctor (played by Irish actor Stephen Rea using a theatrically effeminate American accent) who likes to cut up women on-line somehow with the goal of proving the puritanical presumption that voyeurism leads to hideous violence. Along the way horror fans may recognize a little blond ghost girl with the bouncing ball borrowed from Tobe Hoopers Poltergeist.Midst the carnage and techno-rubble there are a few deft touches Jeffrey Combs plays another detective who cant stop eating and smoking long enough to finish a sentence and Michael Sarrazin is a phony computer scientist and alcoholic who wrote a book on psychic energy on the Internet.But the movies merits are outweighed by the confusion of the story. Audiences embrace films such as The Silence of the Lambs that take them places where they dont want to go with skill; they dismiss the movies that disgust them with no moral payoff.For the timid or curious it can be safely reported that feardotcom.com takes you to an innocuous Warner Bros. site promoting the movie. The more direct  takes you not to a scary place but a forum that offers debates about Franklin Delano Roosevelts assertion that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.

Which maybe they could if only someone would turn on a light in this ornate empty and low-watt horror flick. The film squanders every opportunity (and international-coproduction cent) on by now imitative Nine Inch Nails-video-style visual Goth-goo and scarily forgets to input a plot or script that makes any sense. Before the Internet wasnt it TV movies and radio that warped the minds of techno-junkies? What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess. Most excessive of all The Crying Games Stephen Rea looking utterly (and understandably) miserable plays the sadistic scientist who invents the site in the first place.

With any luck most moviegoers trying to log on to ""FeardotCom"" will find themselves confronted by a busy signal or an internal server error. This more torpid than terrifying late-August entry is no ""Sixth Sense"" despite its own smattering of angry spirits seeking vengeance from beyond the grave. Nor does pic benefit from the campy fun that distinguished helmer William Malones 1999 remake of ""The House on Haunted Hill."" Bowing over the traditionally sluggish Labor Day weekend this visually elaborate (an entire CG second unit is credited) but frequently incoherent pic wont shake the box office out of its end-of-summer doldrums. Pic borrows more than just a page from the recent wave of Asian fright pics Hideo Nakatas ""The Ring"" (a DreamWorks remake arrives Oct. 18) Kiyoshi Kurosawas ""Pulse"" (a Wes Craven-helmed remake is in development) and Ann Huis ""Visible Secret"" (which is not being remade -- yet). ""FeardotCom"" conceives of a contemporary reality in which the Internet has developed the ability to harness ""psychological energy"" and to use that energy to invade the lives of its innocent users. Beginning with the apparent outbreak of an Ebola-like virus among a broad range of Manhattanites pic then reveals that the victims all shared one connection 48 hours before their demise each logged on to a Web site called -- you guessed it -- feardotcom (actually feardotcom.com). Detective Mike Reilly (a suitably grizzled Stephen Dorff) and Health Department investigator Terry Huston (a confused-looking Natascha McElhone) are on the case but screenwriter Josephine Coyle (working from a ""story"" by Moshe Diamant) cant be bothered with the details of whodunit or why. Rather pic is constructed as a series of scenes in which various cast members log on to the titular Web site (usually right after another cast member frantically warns them NOT to) followed by set pieces in which they meet a particularly unpleasant end. For good measure theres also an arrangement of familiar horror/suspense tropes -- from an albino child bouncing a rubber ball to a deranged serial killer (an enjoyably over-the-top Steven Rea) who writes notes to his favorite detective (Dorff) using blood and plaster instead of pen and paper (for viewers who didnt get their fill of such antics from Clint Eastwoods ""Blood Work"" earlier this summer). ""FeardotCom"" never quite realizes its potential to evoke the real horror of the Internet the way in which it has for many come to serve as a substitute for intimacy and personal interaction. To be that movie ""FeardotCom"" would require a massive overhaul and a considerably more frolicking spirit -- something close to Malones own ""House on Haunted Hill."" Yet Malone has given the film a distinctive atmosphere and occasional flashes of his perverse sense of humor. Working with cinematographer Christian Sebaldt and production designer Jerome Latour Malone has crafted an entire film that seems set in one of ""Sevens"" dreary apartments with a New York City (pic was actually lensed in Montreal and Luxembourg) that has rarely looked so dank and pale and grimy and gray. (Its also arguably the least brightly lit movie since the last Peter Hyams pic.) And Malone turns loving attention to the wonderful Jeffrey Combs (as a cop who can barely utter a word for all the doughnuts and cigarettes crammed in his mouth) and Michael Sarrazin (as an ersatz computer scientist whos always drunk by 8 p.m.) in roles that might easily have been throwaways. Unfortunately ""FeardotCom"" needs more of those moments and less needlessly explicit bondage/torture sequences and dime-a-dozen shock imagery -- enough to make most viewers clamber for the ""refresh"" button on their Web browsers.

Starring Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone. Directed by William Malone. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is how it works with ""FearDotCom."" As the people onscreen get scared to death the people in the audience get bored to death. The film is a failure in just about every way save for its acting which is adequate. The cinematography is murky and grainy. The lighting is shadowy without being artistic. Worst of all director William Malone cant instill fear in his audience by building a mood so he takes the familiar course of desperation. He makes viewers uneasy by threatening to show at any point something creepy to look at sadistic torture scenes. A corpse smiling knowingly. A doctor reaching into a cadavers chest cavity to pull out a plastic bag full of organs. The movie deals with a phenomenon occurring around New York City. People are developing nosebleeds followed by ear bleeds followed by screaming hysteria and then death. At first the detective on the case (Stephen Dorff) and a Department of Health researcher (Natascha McElhone) believe that theyre looking at an outbreak of Ebola fever but no. The victims are having strokes from terror and the terror is coming as a result of browsing around on a Web site called . . . FearDotCom. By the third time we see someone log onto FearDotCom the site itself has become tiresome. Its a site inhabited by an evil spirit of some kind who knows everyones name and secret terror and whose goal it seems is to kill everybody who logs on. Why this should be the case is even less clear at the end of the movie than in the middle. Speaking of evil theres also a lunatic serial killer at large in ""FearDotCom"" a gentleman nut case who regularly broadcasts his murders over the Internet. These murders always of women are preceded by as much as 48 hours of torture. Stephen Rea who plays the killer adopts an intentionally bizarre but identifiably American accent -- a kind of Midwest soul-of-reason accent -- and its funny enough to be the best thing about the movie. Its also a small thing about the movie. The premise of a wicked Web site thats literally wicked is a nonstarter. Just think about it for 10 seconds and it becomes comical. And who wants to watch scenes of Rea whispering sweet nothings in a womans ear as he tortures her with a scalpel? Such scenes are neither eerie nor thrilling nor psychologically penetrating. Theyre just unpleasant. Given the movies silly premise and repellent preoccupations ""FearDotCom"" was never going to be a good movie but the director does his part to make matters worse. The sequences in which the Web sites victims are confronted by their worst fears should have been a highlight. Instead Malone goes into a frenzy of quick cuts and shaky camera moves each time showing things that are more generically creepy than specific to the mentality of the characters. Anyone who wants to see a good fear montage should rent the John Dahl movie ""Unforgettable"" where the terror visions are brilliantly conceived and edited and theyre genuinely frightening. It can be done. But what we get in ""FearDotCom"" is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words its badder than bad. Advisory This film contains grisly scenes of torture violence and death.

Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (violence torture nudity profanity). At the Empire the Orpheum the Chelsea West others. ---- FEARDOTCOM"" is a low-rent slow-witted horror flick notable chiefly for its hilariously unsuccessful attempt to pass off Luxembourg City as New York City. This old European capital is in fact credited as subsidizing this collaboration by a handful of bottom-feeding international producers - who have assembled a thoroughly overqualified cast for the dreary work at hand. Stephen Dorff who ought to know better plays Mike an NYPD detective investigating a number of gory serial murders with the help of Terry (Natascha McElhone) an epidemiologist with the citys Health Department. The culprit is Alistair (Stephen Rea) the demented genius behind a Web site called feardotcom - which all of the victims logged onto exactly 48 hours before their deaths. Yes that Stephen Rea - the Irish actor nominated for an Oscar for ""The Crying Game"" and here reduced to playing a lisping cross between Truman Capote and Charles Nelson Reilly. While theres enough gore sadism and bad acting to satisfy undemanding gorehounds the proceedings are less fun than director William Malones last epic the unabashedly campy remake of ""House on Haunted Hill."" At a preview screening of ""Feardotcom"" bored audience members left in droves until the last half hour - when the film suddenly abandoned all pretense of coherence and seriousness and became unintentionally quite funny. Terry who spends the entire movie wandering into dark and forbidding locations without ever looking for a light switch hops in a car and drives to an abandoned steel mill ""just outside"" New York City in the middle of the night. Its not exactly giving anything away to report that she dives headlong into a pool of fetid water and pulls out a rotting corpse - an act that had the preview audience in stitches. Why did the three stars sign on for such arrant nonsense? ""Its a piece of s- - -"" one character says when asked about a book he wrote. ""But I needed the money for a car.""

"Nets dark side explored in `FearDotCom - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Nets dark side explored in `FearDotComAugust 30 2002|By Robert K. Elder Tribune staff reporter.The horror film ""FearDotCom"" recalls an old joke.A man tells his doctor ""It hurts when I do this"" and bends his elbow backward.""Then dont do that"" the doctor says.""FearDotCom"" uses the same gag but doesnt follow its natural logic.Stephen Dorff plays Mike a police detective brought in to investigate a series of mysterious deaths.The symptoms? Bleeding from the nose and eyes followed by almost certain painful death 48 hours after logging onto a grisly site -- you guessed it -- www.feardotcom.com.Logically what would be the next step? Why log on to the site and see what happensIts amazing that the horror genre has taken this long to hook into the Internet as a moral hunting ground for terror. Past franchises such as ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" preyed on the underlying tensions in a Reagan-era morality that demonized teen sex and drug use. For the past decade the dark side of the Internet -- sadist porn hate groups galore Ann Coulter columns -- has been ripe for some sort of horror take. (""The Net"" dealt more with identity fraud and doesnt really qualify as horror depending on how you feel about Sandra Bullock.)""FearDotCom"" swoops in when the subject is overripe; it falls apart from one too many ideas and plot holes you could -- and do -- get lost in. For instance when people die of their worst fear why do they perish from something as pedestrian as a car wreck or a swarm of beetles?Worse Why not just take down the Web site if its such a public hazard?Technology addiction and its possible tainting of the human soul has been dealt with better in David Cronenbergs ""eXistenZ"" and even David Foster Wallaces literary opus ""Infinite Jest."" But ""FearDotCom"" becomes more preoccupied with themes of retribution and fetishized murder than any philosophical explorations.Audiences may have to wait for the forthcoming (October) American remake of Japans ""The Ring"" for a nearly identical idea taken to its psychological extreme.Beauty Natasha McElone adds a romantic tension to the creepy atmosphere which director William Malone (""House on Haunted Hill"") rips right out David Finchers ""Se7en"" rain and all. Thespian Stephen Rea even offers his services as the requisite scalpel-wielding madman but to little benefit.As scary and minor-chord heavy as ""FearDotCom"" can be theres no big payoff no logical resolution. Its like waiting for a site to download only to find that when it happens anticipation was more than half of the empty thrill.`FearDotCom(star)1/2Directed by William Malone; screenplay by Josephine Coyle; photographed by Christian Sebaldt; edited by Alan Strachan; production design by Jerome Latour; produced by Moshe Diamant and Limor Diamant. A Warner Bros. Pictures release; opens Friday. Running time 138. MPAA rating R (violence including grisly images of torture nudity and language).Mike ............. Stephen DorffTerry ............
