Perhaps the best way to describe ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a supernatural mystery. Whatever it is its damn creepy.Richard Gere plays Washington Post reporter John Klein. Two years after the death of his wife (Debra Messing) following a bizarre auto accident Klein finds himself stranded in Point Pleasant W.Va. with no memory of how he got there. Knocking on the nearest door for help hes greeted by a rifle-toting stranger (Will Patton) who claims that Klein has been lurking outside his house night after night.Klein soon discovers from the local police officer (Laura Linney) that inexplicable occurrences are commonplace in this town. There are sightings of a winged birdlike presence. Whatever it is it seems to be able to predict global catastrophes. Creepier still the drawings people make of this red-eyed mothlike creature are the same as those his wife made before she died. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Theres a factual basis for Richard Hatems fictional screenplay newspaperman John A. Keels 1974 book ""The Mothman Prophecies"" delves into numerous sightings that occurred in Point Pleasant in the 1960s. But director Mark (""Arlington Road"") Pellingtons stylishly eerie movie would be just as effective without this knowledge. Using shadows and strikingly designed sounds he skillfully creates an atmosphere of otherworldly invisible menace. Gere and Linney both solid dance around the edges of a romance. Alan Bates contributes a juicy cameo as a spooked-out scientist. Pellington knows as did the 1940s master of horror Val Lewton that what you dont see can raise far more goose bumps than what you do.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Like a thing foretold that doesnt live up to advanced billing ""The Mothman Prophecies"" develops as a portentous journey into cinematic doom which fails to fully evoke its chilling and tragic dimensions. Following in the M. Night Shyamalan school of characters with extra-sensory perception pic blends contemporary American urban and rural settings with dark (and frequently red) forces that can be perceived by an unfortunate few including generally cool-headed star Richard Gere in his most comfortable persona -- a lonely man in a crisis. Director Mark Pellington hardly lets a moment pass without suggesting some bad vibes creeping onto the edges of the screen but hes let down by Richard Hatems script based on John A. Keels book which delivers an ounce when it promised a gallon. Word-of-mouth will dull post-opening turnout but numbers should be in line with Geres other dramatic outings. Ancillary visitations will boost those numbers considerably. ""Based on true events in Point Pleasant W. Va."" is what the opening informs but whats immediately clear is that the movie is equally based on the filmmakers ability to place auds into a frightscape that offers no way out. Soon after ace Washington Post reporter John Klein (Gere) and wife Mary (Debra Messing) seal the deal on a Georgetown brownstone Mary crashes their car as she sees an image of a giant moth figure swooping into her view. A rare temporal lobe tumor proves fatal for Mary; by her bedside John finds a sketchbook filled with her drawings of what looks like a moth with human arms and legs (though they actually look like she had been heavily borrowing from Francis Bacon). Two years later John still a D.C. political reporter is not fully over the loss of Mary. Driving overnight into Virginia he inexplicably ends up 400 miles off-course in Point Pleasant where he meets the grizzled Gordon (Will Patton Hollywoods favorite current crazy man). Town cop Connie (Laura Linney wearing what looked like Frances McDormands uniform and cap from ""Fargo"") verifies John is a reporter and admits that ""things have been strange around here lately."" Realizing he has a story on his hands John investigates things with Connie interviewing several townfolk who say they witnessed everything from visions in the sky to red lights to static-filled electronic noises over the phone. Pellingtons swooping and stalking camera and a tingly nerve-wracking sound design by Claude Letessier do all they can to distract from some increasing narrative problems starting with Johns Post job. He phones the office on occasion but doesnt seem to want to fill his editors in on the story and it begins to feel like he doesnt even care if he has a job to come back to. The John-Connie relationship which goes too quickly from courteous to intimate hints at some unsure trimming. Still Gere and Linney keep it from looking ridiculous. Its townie Gordon who gets the first signals that whatever forces are working on the town are warning of a coming catastrophe. The force even has a name -- Indrid Cold (the voice of Bill Laing) -- but it sounds more like the stuff of a pulpy page-turner than a fact-based chronicle. At the one-hour mark ""Mothman"" wanders away from its sustained atmospherics into silly expository detours led by a retired physics professor (a badly used Alan Bates) who once experienced the same moth-ridden prophecies of doom as John and offers up a historical brief on the Mothman as a presence of bad tidings. Johns quick unannounced visit to Chicago to see the prof as well as a subsequent all-night drive to see him again are only a part of the awkward plotting that slows the second half of the movie. Story indicates through ghostly re-appearances by Mary that John is especially sensitive to the Mothman and though the dead wife tries to keep him away from Point Pleasant he returns just in time to witness the disaster weve been waiting for. Pellington stages a vivid but curiously unaffecting five-minute sequence that has John rescuing Connie from the subsequent destruction. The scene is terrible enough but perhaps mitigated in the mirror of our post 9-11 world. Besides a few moments of strained emotionalism Gere performs within his zone underplaying and taking in everything around him being generous with his co-stars and looking great in a long black winter coat. As few stars recently have been he is almost constantly on screen from start to finish. The visual strategies employed by Pellington and lenser Fred Murphy never overlook a chance to inject the creeps including tilted cameras perspective-altering dissolves and even smeared raindrops on a car windshield made to resemble moths. Letessiers amazing work is augmented by the minimalist trance music of group Tomandandy exquisitely assisted by a battalion of guitarists including the commanding Glenn Branca.

Starring Richard Gere Laura Linney Will Patton. Directed by Mark Pellington. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 113 minutes.) ""The Mothman Prophecies"" doesnt resort to the cheap jolts of other thrillers which is commendable. Unfortunately the movies more abstract scare tactics -- flashes of a spooky winged creature disembodied telephone voices -- are so restrained that viewers may start to yearn for a bogeyman to burst from the closet. Since the mothman made it into the title a little bit more of the menacing insect would have been nice. The giant red-eyed spirit beast appears during a car crash in a frightening early scene. But after that we get only drawings of it -- or should it be ""him""? -- and talk of its motivation. Red light signifies its presence morphing mothman into an urban legend instead of a movie monster. Richard Gere plays a Washington Post reporter (why do they always work for the Washington Post?) whose wife dies from cancer shortly after the car crash. The mothman prophesies more bad things for Gere. Otherworldly forces lead Geres Audi to a tiny town in West Virginia where scary occurrences abound and the prettiest smartest woman in town is also naturally its sheriff. Shes played by Geres ""Primal Fear"" co-star Laura Linney. Gere makes an effective everyman dropping the rapid blinking and heavy breathing he sometimes uses as shorthand for distress. Linney possesses such a noble bearing that the regulation police duds actually become her. Director Mark Pellington has visual panache as he showed in ""Arlington Road."" Using a palette of blues and grays inventive camera angles and subtle musical cues he establishes an eerily beautiful mood early in ""Mothman."" But he overdoes the visual tricks. Will Patton as a local yokel haunted by spirits and Alan Bates as a professor addled by the mothman make the best of their stock characters. Each adds a hint of craziness that suggests that this stuff might be in the townspeoples heads. Some events in the film supposedly really happened in the 1960s in Point Pleasant W.Va. Mothman sightings lore and paraphernalia apparently are still the rage in the area where the monster is sort of the Appalachian Sasquatch. - Advisory This film contains violence some sexuality.

The Mothman Prophecies is a better movie than it is a box office magnet though moths or mothlike visions are major plot components in this thrillers only occasionally faltering suspense. Whats more its a mysterious prophecy that leads to director Mark Pellingtons superb climactic staging of a true-life disaster that took place decades ago. This compellingly watchable horror-spectacle redeems the movie just when its pacing is starting to slacken. Read more Stories Mothman sightings will continue Richard Gere who once played a USA TODAY columnist in The Runaway Bride here is a Washington Post reporter whose beloved wife (Debra Messing) is involved in an icy auto mishap after a moth apparition averts her attention. (At the hospital its discovered she has a brain tumor.) Exactly two years later Geres widower is driving to Richmond Va. for a political story when after midnight his car breaks down. With enough bearings left to realize that the Ohio River doesnt run through Richmond he discovers he is in Point Pleasant W.Va. The Mothman Prophecies (out of four) Stars Richard Gere Laura Linney Will Patton Debra Messing Director Mark Pellington Distributor Sony/Screen Gems Rating PG-13 for terror some sexuality and language Opens Friday nationwide Problem is he doesnt know how he got there. And an at-wits-end local (Will Patton) claims Gere has been stalking him for three nights running. The town cop (Laura Linney in interesting casting) doesnt take sides and alludes to recent strange goings-on. The rest of the story which avoids an expected Gere-Linney romance often confines the journalist in a grungy motel room futilely trying to decipher all kinds of mysteries including screeching noises he keeps hearing on the telephone. A side trip takes him to Chicago where he meets a spooked-out academic (Alan Bates in a strong cameo) who knows too much. Working from a non-fiction book by John A. Keel Arlington Roads Pellington makes you buy most of this while its onscreen and his finale is so chilling that the movie will likely linger in the memory. Pellingtons single-minded treatment -- forget humor; this is one glum story -- takes the movie to a certain level while possibly keeping it from reaching an even higher one. But if youre ever asked to name 10 good studio releases from the past 10 Januarys this creepy little surprise will at least help you get the total up to five.

But while it employs the formers tone and the latters plot twists ""Mothman"" is actually a rather ambitious film that works more often then it doesnt. Based on events reported in the Ohio River town of Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1967 ""The Mothman Prophecies"" directed by Mark Pellington (1999s ""Arlington Road"") and written by Richard Hatem is loosely based on a 1975 book by John Keel. The story however is told in the present day. The climax of the film involves an event that took the lives of 46 people. But its the prior 13 months upon which the film is based. According to Keels book those months were full of strange and unusual occurrences for the citizens of Point Pleasant. Some people heard something some saw something and others only felt something. What is that something? Heres the rub. Its unexplainable -- as youre told repeatedly in the film. Apparently the interpretation of whatever happened depended on the persons mental and emotional make-up. However for many the experience manifested itself in the form of a huge moth-like creature which appeared out of nowhere. Real strange real fast The protagonist is John Klein (Gere) a reporter for the Washington Post. While driving back to Washington from their new house in Virginia Klein and his wife Mary (""Will amp; Graces"" Debra Messing) are involved in a traffic accident. Mary had been suddenly distracted by a strange object in the road. John doesnt see anything and when Mary dies he is haunted by her last words ""You didnt see anything did you?""
