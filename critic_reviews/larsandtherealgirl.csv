George Kraychyk/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment hide caption toggle caption George Kraychyk/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment Ryan Gosling stars as Lars Lindstrom in Lars and the Real Girl. George Kraychyk/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment Director Craig GillespieGenre Comedy/DramaRunning Time 106 minutes Twenty seven-year-old Lars (Ryan Gosling) is so painfully withdrawn that his sister-in-law must literally tackle him before hell walk twenty paces to his brothers house for dinner. Hes polite sweet good-natured and utterly reclusive -- a loner at the office keeping to himself at church. Then one day he orders an anatomically correct silicone doll online and starts introducing her around as his girlfriend Bianca. Yeah yeah ... the premise sounds like a one-joke sex comedy -- but as Lars small town rallies to support him in his delusions the film starts exploring family psychiatry community awkwardness and it all turns surprisingly touching. Much of the reason is Gosling whos been playing wounded a lot of late -- a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson an abandoned lover in The Notebook -- and whose belief in this guys quirks makes Lars plausible without turning him precious. His belief makes Bianca plausible too. I realized at one point as the camera backed up across the room at a party to watch him as he leaned over to whisper in the dolls ear that I knew precisely what he was telling her. (Recommended.)

Lars and the Real Girl Emotionally deflated | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLars and the Real Girl Emotionally deflatedIts a thin tightrope navigated by Lars and the Real Girl Craig Gillespies movie about a delusional 27-year-old (Ryan Gosling) who finds love and community acceptance as a result of falling big time for a mail-order sex doll.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Nov. 2 2007 (out of 4)Starring Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Paul Schneider Kelli Garner Patricia Clarkson Nancy Beatty. Written by Nancy Oliver. Directed by Craig Gillespie. 106 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowIts a thin tightrope navigated by Lars and the Real Girl Craig Gillespies movie about a delusional 27-year-old (Ryan Gosling) who finds love and community acceptance as a result of falling big time for a mail-order sex doll.On the one hand the movie has all the sticky earmarks of state-of-the-art Sundance-certified indie quirk. On the other it conveys a sense of desperate winter-chilly loneliness thats palpable in its sadness.Nothing in the movie embodies this uneasy tension more than Gosling whose performance as the formidably intimacy-averse Lars (who literally screams when touched by the supremely patient physician/psychologist played by Patricia Clarkson) is one-half thrift-shop geek joke and one-half twitchy study in terrified child-man.When in the former mode Lars is a lovably needy puppy dressed in galoshes toque and strip-mall ski jacket. But when in the latter hes all darting eyes cowering posture and evasive mumbles.How one wishes that the whole movie could pull these two tonal polarities together with quite the same touching effect as Gosling does but it doesnt. Lars is finally a movie that seems uneasily wobbly on its tightrope and it leaves you wishing you were watching the movie Gosling so gamely commits himself to.In its early passages as Larss patient-but-confused brother (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer) struggle to love and understand the strange man who lives in their garage Gillespies movie is a fascinating study in strained but affectionate domestic dynamics.With Schneider and Mortimer easily matching Goslings proclivity for minor-key subtlety these scenes have a quiet intimacy that gets lost as soon as the doll (which Lars names Bianca) arrives and the entire movie shifts gears. After going public with his synthetic but resolutely chaste passion (a credulity-straining stretch in itself) Lars becomes the object of a community-wide campaign of empathetic acceptance. Bianca is not only welcomed by the town but integrated wholeheartedly within it a rubberized symbol of decent-hearted rural tolerance and goodwill. At one point we even learn shes been elected to a local political position only one of many tantalizing threads that point to another movie that Lars never quite becomes.Ironically if Gillespie and former Six Feet Under screenwriter Nancy Oliver had stuck to the movies darker implications - say by generating some genuine conflict between Larss delusional certainty and a sex-doll-freaked community or by letting Lars get his groove on with Bianca - Lars and the Real Girl might have actually had a richer emotional payoff for having taken some real risks.As it is Lars and the Real Girl remains suspended somewhere between perversity and pap with only Gosling hinting at the mingling that might have been.Read more about Ryan GoslingThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments Lars and the Real Girl Recommended If someone had told me this was directed by the guy who did Mr. Woodcock and most of the humor revolved around a sex doll I wouldnt have gone near it. But Lars and the Real Girl is both hilarious and poignant with a Capraesque humanity that caught me completely off guard. An awkward young man in a small Minnesota town (Ryan Gosling) invites his older brother (goofy Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer) to meet his new fiancee but to their horror and embarrassment she turns out to be made of rubber. The local psychiatrist (Patricia Clarkson) advises them to play along with his delusion and eventually the close-knit religious community moved by concern for the brothers joins in. Im not sure theres still that much compassion in the world but in keeping with the spirit of the movie I was willing to pretend. Craig Gillespie directed a script by Nancy Oliver (HBOs Six Feet Under). PG-13 106 min. By J.R.

"Lars and the Real Girl reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lars and the Real Girl reviewed. Lars and the Real Girl reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 12 2007 302 PM Shes the Silent Type Ryan Gosling falls in love with a sex toy in Lars and the Real Girl. By Dana Stevens Ryan Gosling in Lars and the Real Girl After effortlessly shifting from the cornfed Romeo of The Notebook to the drug-addicted schoolteacher of Half Nelson to the arrogant young lawyer of Fracture Ryan Gosling is now in a position to take on any role he wants from Hamlet to action hero. The fact that he chose Lars and the Real Girl is a disturbing sign. Is Gosling trying to prove that his box-office draw hasnt affected his indie bona fides? Or is he like the tactophobic hermit he plays in this heartfelt but muddled film slightly nuts? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its never quite clear whats wrong with Lars Lindstrom who lives in a freestanding garage outside the house of his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and Gus pregnant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer). Hes high-functioning enough to hold down an office job but so terrified of human contact that even Gus and Karin can barely corral him for a family breakfast. He runs from the flirtatious advances of his new co-worker Margo (Kelli Garner) and wears a scarf made from the baby blanket his mother knitted him before dying in childbirth. So far so sad--but this collection of character traits hardly adds up to the portrait of someone delusional enough to mistake a life-size silicone sex doll for a living breathing speaking human being. Which is exactly what Lars does when he brings home Bianca whom he insists is a half-Brazilian half-Danish missionary he met on the Internet.  Advertisement From the moment Lars set Bianca up at Gus and Karins dinner table for an awkward getting-to-know-you meal this movie lost me. Whatever line the script (by Six Feet Unders Nancy Oliver) was trying to walk between whimsical fantasy and psychologically realistic drama was obscured by the sheer creepiness of the premise. Is it just me or is the inability to distinguish between living flesh and inert matter as horrifying as something out of Edgar Allan Poe? Lars relationship with a commercially produced sex toy cant help but carry associations with prostitution mail-order bride services even necrophilia. Yet all these dark links are glossed over by the movies determinedly wholesome tone. The denizens of Lars unnamed Midwestern hometown (the deep snow and ambient Swedishness suggest somewhere in Minnesota) agree with Norman Rockwell-esque unanimity to treat Bianca like a real person carting her to church in a wheelchair restyling her synthetic hair even electing her to the school board. Theyre aided in this group madness by Dr. Dagmar Berman (Patricia Clarkson) Lars psychologist who gently assures Gus and Karin that the road to sanity is paved by hundreds perhaps thousands of benevolent enablers. To its credit the movie directed by Craig Gillespie never mocks Lars or turns his love for the doll into a dirty joke--in fact he insists that she sleep in the guest room until they get to know each other better. But what about Biancas anatomical correctness the purpose for which she was engineered? If Lars truly falls for this rubber dummy as the movie suggests shouldnt their relationship become physical at some point? Or in order for us to believe in the goodness of Lars soul must he be totally without sexual desire? I couldnt give myself over to the movies quaint celebration of mass psychosis without wondering about these questions. Those with less debauched imaginations may be charmed by Lars and the Real Girl which if nothing else admirably maintains its peculiar tone throughout. Gosling throws himself into the role with his customary intensity but also maintains a light touch When he tenderly inquires after his inanimate sweethearts well-being you fully believe that he can hear her answer. All the supporting actors are terrific even if Clarkson feels miscast as the doctor--she just seems too smart to recommend such a fruity course of treatment. Though its too slight and well-meaning of a movie to get worked up about Lars also sends an odd message about male/female relationships. If Lars passion for a piece of store-bought plastic is as the script implies what teaches him to love a real person how will he transfer those lessons to the realm of human intimacy? What will his time with Bianca have taught him about reciprocity spontaneity listening to other points of view? Wont the post-Bianca Lars be like a monkey raised in a lab environment utterly unable to cope with the demands of a flesh-and-blood partner? Lars and the Real Girl suffers from an even stranger delusion than Lars does. The movie is convinced that its man-loves-mannequin premise is uplifting when actually its just kinda gross. Correction Oct. 15 2007 The article originally identified the sex doll as half-Brazilian half-Dutch when in fact it is half-Brazilian half-Danish. (Return  to the corrected sentence.)

"Lars and the Real Girl Break a Wooden Heart washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Lars and the Real Girl Break a Wooden Heart Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Lars and the Real Girl TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 19 2007 Ryan Gosling wears a big uncomfortable-looking mustache in ""Lars and the Real Girl"" and the meaning is clear His character a misfit in his mid-20s who lives in the garage of his childhood home in a small unnamed Midwestern town is trying to convince the world and himself that hes an adult by wearing a disguise. Larss brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and his pregnant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer) live in the main house and despite repeated invitations to join them for meals Lars keeps obstinately to himself. Karin -- radiant with human kindness -- is worried about Lars who as if to offset the mustache also walks around wrapped in his own light-blue baby blanket. He clearly has issues which finally burble up to the surface when he orders a life-size sex toy over the Internet and presents her to his family church and co-workers as his new girlfriend Bianca a wheelchair-bound Brazilian missionary. The trailers for ""Lars and the Real Girl"" are presenting the movie as a wry absurdist comedy a marketing strategy that seemed borne out at a recent preview screening where the audience regularly broke out in guffaws but I didnt laugh once. This tender closely observed drama is admittedly shot through with rueful humor. But so badly wanting ""Lars and the Real Girl"" to be a comedy is to suffer from the same misapprehension -- even delusion -- as the people in Larss life who focus on the improbably voluptuous synthetic Angelina look-alike not the man next to her. At its core ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is a medical mystery on a par with the stories of Oliver Sacks and when Lars and Bianca begin visiting the towns doctor Dagmar Berman the pieces to his psycho-emotional puzzle begin to fall into place. (Actually its not true that I didnt laugh once during ""Lars and the Real Girl."" I cracked up when Karin told Gus that their family practice doctor is also a psychologist ""She says she has to be this far north"" she added by way of explanation.) Dr. Berman is played by the superb Patricia Clarkson who like Gosling and Mortimer delivers a performance of breathtaking and finally deeply moving conviction. In fact although ""Lars and the Real Girl"" certainly possesses moments of visually surreal comedy especially as the town welcomes Bianca into their collective life -- hiring her for part-time positions at the mall cutting her hair at the salon electing her to a seat on the school board -- its really a study in conviction and the Christian love that Larss Lutheran minister speaks of at the movies outset. As Lars quietly desperately comes to the psychic break -- or breakthrough -- thats looming his family friends and neighbors fully embrace the notion of the compassionate response going along with the narrative hes inventing as if in recognition that love means indulging one anothers most necessary illusions. No I didnt laugh -- much -- during ""Lars and the Real Girl"" but I almost cried several times encountering so much spiritual generosity. If the movie occasionally goes overboard in its depiction of Lake Wobegon sweetness those moments are far outweighed by its rigorous morality embodied most completely by Clarkson and Mortimer. Their performances -- one as dry as crackling tinder one as warm as bubbling brown sugar -- act as ballast in a production that otherwise might get carried away by its own conceit and turn into the episode of ""King of the Hill"" when Bobby falls in love with Luannes beauty school practice head. (""Lars and the Real Girl"" was written by former ""Six Feet Under"" writer Nancy Oliver and directed by Craig Gillespie.) Of course the real key to ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is Gosling who for most of his fans arrived on the scene in 2004 in the romance ""The Notebook"" but who has been turning in consistently exceptional performances since his breakout lead role in the searing 2001 drama ""The Believer."" Yet again he doesnt put a foot wrong as a character who is inert for most of the movie but whose inner life is in constant motion as he navigates what turns out to be a fraught transition. Goslings performance as Lars is a small miracle not only because hes completely vulnerably open as a man whos essentially shut off but because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes. Look carefully at the closing shot of ""Lars and the Real Girl"" at the set of Goslings shoulders and the focus of his eyes and you realize Hes a man whos grown into his mustache. Lars and the Real Girl (106 minutes at Landmarks E Street Cinema and Landmarks Bethesda Row) is rated PG-13 for some sex-related content.

Movie review ""Lars and the Real Girl"" with Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Paul Schneider Kelli Garner Patricia Clarkson. Directed by Craig Gillespie from a screenplay by Nancy Oliver. 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sex-related content. Harvard Exit. Prepared to be shocked by ""Lars and the Real Girl"" simply because it isnt shocking at all. Instead Craig Gillespies comedy written by Nancy Oliver (TVs ""Six Feet Under"") is almost impossibly sweet a tale of love and kindness thats funny without being snarky. And whens the last time you said that about a movie that depicts a relationship between a man and a life-size doll? Lars (Ryan Gosling complete with a sad little mustache) is an emotionally shutdown young man in a small Midwestern town living in the garage apartment behind the house formerly owned by his late parents. His brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) who live in the house perpetually worry about his isolation and loneliness so theyre thrilled when he announces that a woman friend is coming to visit. She is Bianca -- tall slender vaguely resembling a waxworks Angelina Jolie and entirely inanimate. Gus and Karin being polite Midwesterners greet her with a stunned courtesy and Karin even makes uncomfortable small talk with her when the two of them are left alone. It seems to this loving sister-in-law the right thing to do. Bring on the ""Knocked Up""- and ""Superbad""-style dirty jokes right? Wrong. What unfolds is the towns surprised but warmhearted acceptance of Bianca Lars is loved and so she will be loved too however odd the situation may seem. ""These things happen"" says a sensible neighbor. ""Lars is a good boy."" When Gus and Karin take Lars to a doctor (Patricia Clarkson wonderfully dry) no particular alarm bells are rung. ""He appears to have a delusion"" says the doctor advising them all to go along with it. And so Bianca becomes part of the fabric of the town and starts having her own life -- a job shopping trips a makeover at the local salon. She goes with Lars to church and to parties where the two of them slow dance (he holds he sways). You keep waiting for the movie to turn smart-ass and cynical and to Gillespie and Olivers great credit it never does. Theres a gentleness to the performances thats irresistible Gosling who seems to almost imperceptibly relax when hes near Bianca makes us understand in few words the towns affection for Lars. And Mortimer with her sad little chirp of a voice is sweetness personified as Karin whose love for her brother-in-law overcomes all doubt. Asked about potential trouble between Lars and Bianca Karin shakes her head decisively. ""They never fight"" she says having long ago banished any ideas that Bianca is anything less than real. And weve gone there with her completely won over. Movies can make whats not real seem real and ""Lars and the Real Girl"" takes that magic a step further -- not through trickery or technology but through the love in a young mans eyes.

"Lars and the Real Girl the doll of his dreams - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeLars and the Real Girl the doll of his dreamsSHY GUYS INFLATABLE PAL BRINGS HIM OUT OF HIS SHELLBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 10/25/2007 033515 PM PDTUpdated 10/25/2007 041841 PM PDTIn ""Lars and the Real Girl"" Ryan Gosling plays a guy in love with an anatomically correct life-size doll - an imaginary friend with benefits. Its a premise as fanciful as Jimmy Stewarts ""Harvey"" and yet the movie has a sweetness that manages to be pixilated and plausible at the same time. After Lars uncrates his polyurethane fantasy he introduces her as Bianca - half-Danish half-Brazilian and according to some women at the beauty shop who have looked under the hood all girl. Up until this moment he has managed to live almost completely off the grid of anyones attention in a small Midwestern town. What makes ""Lars"" clever instead of cloying is the pitch-perfect script by Nancy Oliver whose previous experience bringing the inanimate to life was on the HBO series ""Six Feet Under."" If her slightly deranged premise seems likely to remind people of such whacked-out brainteasers by Charlie Kaufman as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" her movie also has a body temperature warmth that Kaufmans subzero cinema lacks. After a difficult childhood Lars (Gosling) has been hiding out in the garage apartment next to the house in which he and his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) grew up. And where Gus still lives with his aggressively friendly wife Karin (Emily Mortimer). Lars is the kind of guy who wears a tie under a crew neck sweater every day at work; if there were a way for him to make himself as invisible as that tie he would do it.Advertisement Karin is pregnant with her first baby and her maternal instinct is telling her to try to bring her shy brother-in-law into the family fold. But when she and Gus invite him to move from the garage into the house Lars looks as if he would prefer to corkscrew himself into the ground first. Confronted with a simple invitation to dinner Lars makes excuse after excuse. When he sees no other avenue of escape he lurches for his darkened apartment so Karin tackles him. Several weeks later Lars takes delivery of a large box and after opening it introduces Karin and Gus to Bianca a ""missionary"" who has taken a sabbatical ""to experience the world."" He asks if Bianca can stay in their guest room not wishing to give anyone the wrong idea about her. About them. Bianca may have all her parts in working order but Lars likes her because she listens to him. In this story the dolls anatomical correctness is interesting only to the rest of the town. After the doll has been introduced not only to us but to a duly horrified Gus and Karin its hard to see where the movie can go without lapsing into either pathos or farce. But by seeing Bianca as Lars does the town finds a value in her and the picture adroitly manages to turn its world upside down. As Lars wheels the doll - with her face frozen as the wintry landscape - around from place to place the entire town treats her as a real girl. Because to do otherwise would mean that Lars is crazy. And though Lars is crazy the implications of that are simply too awful for anyone to face. And because Bianca brings Lars out of his shell. He whispers bashfully into her ear and then acting as interpreter he formulates her replies forcing him to be social with people from whom he would previously have run. Bit by bit Bianca is accepted into the community. If her relationship with Lars doesnt seem believable exactly viewed in the context of the sometimes difficult relationships that men and women enter into it also doesnt seem all that unusual. ""They never fight"" Karin says approvingly. The familys preternaturally perceptive physician (Patricia Clarkson) who comes handily equipped with a degree in psychology takes Biancas blood pressure and talks to her when Lars is around. The doctor advises Gus and Karin to do the same. But Gus cant bring himself to play along and tries to burst his brothers balloon. Figuratively that is. He actually likes Bianca too much to try to pop her. Gosling is a gifted young actor but his character is a cipher. And while Peter Sellers managed to make that interesting in the similarly upside-down world of ""Being There"" in 1979 Gosling merely manages to make Lars credible. Under the circumstances that seems like enough. In this movie its Schneider an actor with a gift for a kind of hyper-naturalism that allows him to make average guys distinct and memorable who stands out. After Lars drops Bianca off at a school board meeting (shes a joiner) he sneaks away for an evening of bowling with Margo (Kelli Garner) a woman from his office whose longstanding crush he had previously rebuffed. At first its disappointing to see him treat Bianca like that making a fool of her. But then you realize Lars is getting ""real"" himself.

Starring Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Kelli Garner and Paul Schneider. Directed by Craig Gillespie. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some people probably like the idea of going to a movie about a guy and his sex mannequin but for those who dont a qualification is in order. ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is not about sex. At no point does the protagonist have carnal (or plastic) knowledge of the mannequin. Likewise saying this gives away no plot point. Virtually from the first minutes the movie establishes that the man-doll relationship is and will remain chaste. Theyre saving themselves for marriage. ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is a gentle comedy offbeat but never cute never lewd and never going for shortcut laughs that might diminish character. From looking at stills of the movie one could be led to expect something arch and knowing but the film is anything but that. Its an emotionally invested movie about loneliness and the lingering scars of early trauma. At the center of it is Ryan Gosling who at 26 is already a mature talent - not the usual flashy appealing fellow but deep-revolving and mysterious. Gosling shows you plenty but leaves you with the feeling that theres much more hes not showing. Usually with movies we see everything. But in real life we talk to people and hear them and feel we understand - even while realizing well never know them inside and out. The depths are apparent and we see hints of them but theyre never fully open to our inspection. Watching Gosling is much more like the experience of real life than the movies. Just in itself its remarkable that Gosling without saying much establishes from the beginning that whatever is going on with Lars its benign. Lars is so shy and leery of human contact that he can barely bring himself to speak to anyone. He greets the world with a tight uncomfortable grin. Easily with another actor Lars could have come across as one of those ""nice quiet guys"" who snap and kill everybody in sight but Gosling does something with his eyes that tells you that thats not the deal here. Theres a sweetness and softness about him which makes it clear why everyone really likes him even though he puts out less energy than a dead battery. So when he finds a girl with even less life force than he has - specifically a life-size plastic sex mannequin that he buys on the Internet - its a meeting of true minds. Lars is delusional. He believes that ""Bianca"" is real that she talks to him that shes from Brazil that she cant walk and that shes very religious. The latter means that while he sleeps in his garage apartment she sleeps in the main house where his brother (Paul Schneider) lives with his pregnant and very giving wife (Emily Mortimer). That would seem to be the setup for a decent skit but writer Nancy Oliver finds a whole screenplay in it by conscientiously pursuing the premise investigating the fears the wants and the pain that might lead to such a delusion without losing sight of the comedy. This impressive balancing act continues until the final shot and the movies only weaknesses are minor ones. Some of the bits involving the communitys reactions are far-fetched and theres more of that element than the movie needs. Schneider gets some of the best laughs as Lars horrified older brother and Patricia Clarkson brings a nice exhausted humanity to her role as a psychiatrist. By the way there is a ""real girl"" in ""Lars."" Shes a co-worker played by Kelli Garner a gorgeous actress who is convincingly plain-Janed up for her role here. Garner is choosing good roles in quality movies and its paying off. She was brilliant in ""Dreamland"" and delivers the goods in ""Lars"" as well. -- Advisory This film contains adult subject matter and a pink bowling ball.

"Lars toys with love and tolerance - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Lars toys with love and tolerance By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 19 2007 If genuine virtue seems scarce in Hollywood its because the movie industry excels at and profits by vice. Virtue is hard to come by. So when a movie about a guy who orders a sex doll off the Internet can turn vice into virtue something miraculous has occurred. ""Lars and the Real Girl"" achieves that kind of miracle.Directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Nancy Oliver the movie nestles us in a frosty rural Wisconsin town. When Lars a pathologically shy cubicle drone played by Ryan Gosling falls in love with Bianca the life-size plastic woman who arrived in a crate the rest of town does too. A few people bat an eyelash including Larss older brother Gus (Paul Schneider) whos been letting Lars live in the garage behind the house he shares with his pregnant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer). But for the most part everybody accepts Bianca as a member of the community. In a funny scene at the local church folks worry that Lars has crossed a line. But these are people with their own idiosyncrasies (kleptomania dressing up cats etc.). Who are they to judge?When she arrives Bianca looks like an escapee from the Pussycat Dolls (fishnet getup thick eyeliner pillowy lips) but a homely makeover makes her look perfectly local. She doesnt speak out loud but Lars can hear her (eventually so can everyone else). Their conversations range from intense to loving. And when they go out on the town shes in a wheelchair. Soon enough Bianca is volunteering at the local hospital and winning a school board election. The towns easy embrace of her and Lars who seems somehow less puzzling to most people is simultaneously amusing and poignant.It helps that every actor in every part is effortlessly good - none more than Patricia Clarkson who is wonderful as Dagmar the towns family doctor who manages to treat Lars without the faintest whiff of skepticism.Once a week while Bianca undergoes ""special tests"" the doctor tries to unpack Larss dysfunction in the next room. Her approach is light yet effective. Before their sessions we knew that Lars was considerate and compassionate - a neurotic true but a wholesome and gentlemanly one all the same. In his conversations with Dagmar he reveals himself to be lucid and perceptive too. This is therapy that both heals and clarifies and Clarkson makes casual restraint look extremely easy.Eventually Lars begins to notice a milky sweet-natured co-worker (Kelli Garner) and we realize that Bianca is actually like a set of romantic training wheels. And its fascinating - for us and for the townspeople - to watch Lars shed his buxom psychological crutch. Gosling is fascinating too. No jitter stutter head-cock eye-roll or awkward physical movement is too much or too studied. Hes a natural jazzy actor who thrives when lost inside actual damaged characters (imagine Montgomery Clift minus the personal doom).Two of his loveliest moments here are musical. In the first Gosling sings Nat King Coles ""L-O-V-E"" lying in a tree house in a kind of childish operetta voice. In the other he dances at a party. The song is Talking Heads ""This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"" whose lyrics of romantic dislocation capture the generous heart of the movie.""Lars and the Real Girl"" is poised on the line between earnestness and farce. This is the knifes edge that separates Frank Capra from Preston Sturges. The movie believes in the innate goodness of people but its not on the lookout for an object of mockery. In many ways it could serve as a rebuke to Lars von Triers ""Dogville"" his heartless but shrewd dissection of American intolerance and the hypocrisies of Christian charity. Gillespie and Oliver persuasively embrace all the ideals of rural American life that von Trier found imaginary.Their movie certainly works as a story of all kinds of tolerance but its too rooted in these characters personalities to be purely allegorical. Of course if you crave a metaphor for this town and its residents look up. Its heaven.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

But ""Lars and the Real Girl"" crosses the border. Its nothing less than a miracle that the director Craig Gillespie and the writer Nancy Oliver have been able to make such an endearing intelligent and tender comedy from a premise that in other hands might sustain a five-minute sketch on TV. ENLARGE The premise is straightforward A likable but withdrawn young man named Lars Lindstrom (played brilliantly by Ryan Gosling) buys a life-size sex doll on the Internet and falls in love with it. Or rather with her since he endows his silicone beauty with a vivid personality. Her name is Bianca shes a missionary from a Brazilian-Danish family and she doesnt believe in pre-marital sex so their relationship will be chaste at the outset. Were glad to go along with the gag and were not the only ones. Larss sister-in-law then his brother then the people of his midwestern town -- somewhere up north maybe in Minnesota -- go along with it too albeit cautiously at first. Thats the wonder of this story which moves from the cheerfully ludicrous to the quietly momentous. People go along with it and are changed by it as they realize that Lars is not a hopeless nut job but a good soul in distress. Delightful as the business about Bianca may be its only a catalyst for the communitys effort to help heal one of its own. Of all the unfashionable things in our crass day and age ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is a movie about kindness. It is also on its own modest terms an almost perfect movie with flawless performances. Ryan Gosling has done extraordinary work before -- most notably in ""The Believer"" and ""Half Nelson"" -- but the comic sensibility he unleashes here still comes as a surprise. The leash is short and taut. You cant even call what he does deadpan for that would suggest some hint of self-comment. His Lars is simply rooted in every moment though that doesnt quite get at the actors art either. Theres nothing simple about Larss fantasy life with Bianca or his response to being touched by a therapist physically and emotionally in one of the best therapy sequences youve ever seen. Just as that life with Bianca grows out of need as the therapist explains to his family (with hardly a syllable of psychobabble) Mr. Goslings portrayal grows out of judgment-free revelation; he lets us in on the safe sweet pleasure Lars takes from his ostensibly inanimate inamorata. ENLARGE Paul Schneider Emily Mortimer and Ryan Gosling in ""Lars and the Real Girl"" Every other performance in the film is of a piece -- not a false note to be seen or heard. Paul Schneider as Larss older brother Gus fulfills the promise he first showed in David Gordon Greens ""All the Real Girls."" (Will his next movie have a ""real girl"" title too?) While Gus has managed barely to escape his familys dire destiny his emotional range remains constrained. Within that range though Mr. Schneider rings witty changes on his characters obtuseness his skepticism -- Gus is our surrogate in all of this goofiness -- his verbal contortions buried guilt and essential decency. Guss wife Karin played with exquisite ardor by Emily Mortimer is much easier to decode. Pregnant and immensely pleased about it shes an earth-mother-to-be. Karins first impulse is to open herself to the lives of others so she leads the charge after some brief hesitation to embrace Bianca as a palpable creature of Larss inner life. Kelli Garners Margo is a smaller role -- the ingenue who must compete with Bianca for Larss affection -- but Ms. Garner fills it with an unaffected sweetness that recalls the early films of Shelley Duvall. Then theres the divine Patricia Clarkson -- droll dry and precise yet mysteriously intense -- as Dagmar the towns physician who is also a psychologist. An actors actor Ms. Clarkson possesses among so many other gifts a peerless talent for listening which is perfect for Dagmars sessions with Lars. One of the movies most delicious lines is also the most understated. It comes after Dagmar first meets Bianca and listens to Lars extolling her virtues ""He appears"" the psychologist says ""to have a delusion."" Remarkably Nancy Olivers original script for ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is her feature debut; some writers spend whole careers learning to write as concisely and evocatively -- and hilariously -- as shes done the first time out. Though other films have turned on romance between a guy and a literal doll this one turns the notion into a classic comic parable with stirring scenes Karin replying with furious hurt to Larss accusation that people dont care about him; Gus answering Larss question about how and when someone becomes a man; a pastors heartfelt eulogy for a much loved member of the congregation. Ive held off on discussing the director Craig Gillespie only because the results of his work in this film are so impressive that they deserve to be appreciated fully in the context of his cast and crew. But thats easier said than done. When I was starting out as a young critic I would read other critics asserting with great authority that the direction in this film or that was good or bad and Id wonder with great anxiety ""How do they know since direction is intangible? How can you tell what a director does let alone pass judgment on it?"" The answer of course is you can never tell exactly but the director always leaves his mark for better or worse in the movies tone and in an accumulation of details and choices. In this film its for better at every turn. The tone is consistently delicate. One of the first details I noticed about the films physical production was the paint on the front of the garage where Lars sleeps -- not insistently disreputable to make a point about his sad status in the world just peeling normally plausibly. A nice choice if a small one grounded in reality but was it made by the director or by the production designer Arv Greywal? No way to know. Still it was consonant with other nice choices small and large Larss grounded laconic comment on Biancas silence -- ""Shes shy. Everythings so new""; Adam Kimmels clear-sighted cinematography constantly showing without being showy; Tatiana S. Riegels deft editing which cuts quickly from rather than lingers on the whimsical spectacle of a child sitting on Biancas lap in the doctors waiting room; Karins throwaway explanation of why Dr. Dagmar is also a psychologist -- ""She says you have to be this far north."" A common denominator of these choices is trust -- in the material and in the audiences intelligence. Some may have been made by Craig Gillespie others by his collaborators including Ms. Oliver but all of them were made within a stylistic climate that the director established and sustained. The climate is funny breezy and warm. Elizabeth The Golden Age ""Elizabeth The Golden Age"" ends with Cate Blanchett as the Virgin Queen cradling a newborn babe in her arms. (Dont worry it isnt hers.) Digital effects can do wonders these days but the squalling baby looks real and his squalls truly seem to give way to a smile of beatific pleasure as he gets his first look at Ms. Blanchetts face. I know how the kid feels. She can do no wrong and does none here though the movie around her a popcorn-worthy sequel to the 1998 ""Elizabeth"" often lapses into opacity or grandiosity. In the first film the queen established the Church of England and the question was whether Geoffrey Rushs Walsingham her Master of Spies would get in bed with Spain or France. In this film directed as before by Shekhar Kapur the issue is war. The Spanish Armada sets sail at ten minutes after the first hour and an impressive naval battle ensues. Before that though the queen spends lots of quality time with Clive Owens dashing silver-tongued Sir Walter Raleigh and the film qualifies as a bodice-ripper or at least bodice-loosener when Raleigh finds blood-quickening qualities in the person of the queens favorite lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton (nice work by Abbie Cornish). All of this is much more fun than Englands history churning away in the background and Alexandra Byrnes costumes are to live for. When you see Cate Blanchett in one fantastical gown after another you understand why Elizabeths reign was golden.    DVD TIP As I tried to recall another film with a comic tone as delicate as that of ""Lars And the Real Girl"" I got nowhere until I thought of Lars as the product of a Scandinavian family. Bingo. ""Kitchen Stories"" (2003) in Norwegian with English subtitles starts in post-World War II Sweden where time-and-motion scientists dispatch a researcher to rural Norway to study the kitchen routines of single men. Its an absurd premise but this is an absurdist comedy par excellence. And very much like ""Lars"" it ramifies into something more--a parable of friendship devotion to duty and the basic human need for social intercourse.

And theres no language barrier because she cant speak. But she is ""anatomically correct"" a feature highlighted on her XXX Web site.And Lars (Ryan Gosling) the small-town sad sack whos crashing in his brother and sister-in-laws garage proceeds to fall for this life-size sex toy. If relationships are all about projecting your ideals and fantasies onto someone else - and arent they half the time? - then maybe spending your days with a plastic love doll isnt as weird as it seems.Written by Nancy Oliver a writer and coproducer of HBOs merrily morbid family saga Six Feet Under and directed by Craig Gillespie whose other 2007 release is Mr. Woodcock the Billy Bob Thornton (ahem) masterpiece Lars and the Real Girl spins on the kind of clever conceit that might have made for a good Saturday Night Live sketch.But dressed up as a quirky deadpan indie a pancake-flat melodrama with a gently comic tone Lars and the Real Girl becomes increasingly precious. Taking a profoundly wounded soul and watching him heal with the help of neighbors loved ones and his own hard-won epiphanies is a worthy idea.But the central gimmick of the film remains just that - a gimmick - as genuine emotion gives way to shaggy-dog shtick.And so Lars unpacks the doll whom he dubs Bianca dressing her in prim proper outfits and propping her in a wheelchair. Shes of Brazilian and Danish heritage he says. Shes a missionary shes touring the world. Lars brother (Paul Schneider) and his wife (Emily Mortimer) are understandably freaked by the appearance of Lars new friend and the grin thats pasted on the hitherto mopey painfully shy guys face.They consult with the town doctor (indie trouper Patricia Clarkson) who suggests that the couple humor Lars delusions as he works through the traumas that have upended his life. She even starts meeting with Lars herself. And the rest of the town from neighbors to churchgoers to Margo (Kelli Garner) a friendly coworker who represents Lars real shot at romance consort to help the winky blinky Lars work through his issues by pretending that Bianca isnt a figment of his imagination.Gosling nominated this year for an Oscar for his chilling portrayal of a crack-addict school teacher in Half Nelson shambles through Lars and the Real Girl with a goofball mien a kind of holy fool vibe. The rest of the very able cast offer various shades of befuddlement bemusement and folksy compassion.But by movies end it seems like the only one giving a truly genuine performance is Bianca. Mouth-agape steadfastly mum.Lars and the Real Girl 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Craig Gillespie. With Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Patricia Clarkson Paul Schneider and Kelli Garner.

Or perhaps a creepy psychological chiller. Or maybe a zany absurdist satire. ""Lars and the Real Girl"" however is a heartwarming story about a man who falls for a sex toy. Her name is Bianca. Shes half-Danish half-Brazilian and uses a wheelchair. And he doesnt apparently have sex with her.The young man who falls for her is pathologically shy emotionally crippled Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling). He lives in a converted garage outside the home of his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and Guss pregnant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer) who adores and worries about her reclusive brother-in-law a fellow so withdrawn she counts it a triumph if hell venture inside their home for dinner. In fact everyone in their small snow-banked Midwestern town is fond of this very odd duck for reasons that are never quite explained.Bianca arrives one day in a large shipping box. Lars unwraps her and his pride swelling as much as his delusion introduces her to the family. Needless to say they are speechless. The wise and unconventional local doctor (Patricia Clarkson) whom Lars is persuaded to see on the pretense that she is treating Bianca encourages the family--and indeed everyone in this uncommonly tolerant backwater town--to play along with Larss fantasy sensing that his ""relationship"" with Bianca might bring him out of his shell and into the real world. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The audience is being asked the same thing to suspend our notions of normalcy in the service of a fable about redemption. Its a lot to ask and Im not sure screenwriter Nancy Oliver and director Craig Gillespie quite pull it off though watching them try is not without its gently daft fascination. Whats hard to swallow is not so much Larss total immersion in his obsession but the sentimental notion of small-town life as an oasis of tolerance. The films true subject is community and its benign vision of America could easily come out of a 30s movie which is surprising from a woman who wrote many episodes of ""Six Feet Under.""If ""Lars and the Real Girl"" works better than it has any right to its thanks to the committed cast who play out the metaphor without winks or coyness. Anyone whos seen Gosling in ""Half-Nelson"" or ""The Believer"" knows hes an acting miracle worker and his pudgy perplexed painfully skittish Lars is like nothing hes shown us. Hes barely recognizable so totally does he lose himself in the part. Schneider whose deep-set eyes and slight spaciness may call Steve Martin to mind puts a fresh off-kilter spin on his lines; you might think he was someone found on a Minnesota street and not an actor (thats a compliment). And Clarkson brings a sly playfulness to her therapist role that keeps us guessing just maybe this doc is a bit pixilated herself.Gillespies movie walks a delicate line through a minefield of potential bad taste. Directed with patient low-key sensitivity it never goes for a cheap laugh at its protagonists expense. But the gritty realism of the setting cant totally disguise the sentimental fantasy at the heart of the movie which to these skeptical eyes seemed more willed than truly earned. To put it another way I admire what ""Lars and the Real Girl"" isnt but I dont quite buy what it is.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The setting is a very flat Midwestern town where the lonely over weight and socially mal adroit office worker Lars (a pitch-perfect Ryan Gosling) hears one day that anatomi cally correct ""girls"" are available on the In ternet. He sends for one but doesnt use it for sex. In stead he introduces ""her"" as Bianca his new Swedish-Brazilian girlfriend to his bewildered brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and Gus very preg nant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer). While the properly chaperoned Bianca moves into their guest bedroom Lars - who carries psychic scars that are gradually revealed over the course of the flick - continues to live qui etly in the garage and gradually emerges from his shell. A sympathetic doctor (Patricia Clarkson) recommends that Gus and his wife support Lars delusion. She believes it serves a purpose at this point in his life. Gradually the entire snow-covered community (even the girl with a not-so-secret crush on Lars nicely played by Kelli Garner) comes to put aside their snickers and welcome Bianca who becomes a cherished hospital volunteer. This might sound pretty creepy on paper but it doesnt seem smarmy at all on the screen thanks to a completely straight performance by Gosling who has demonstrated his extreme versatility in films such as ""Half Nelson"" (netting an Oscar nomination as an addicted teacher) and the four-handkerchief ""The Notebook."" The script by ""Six Feet Under"" writer Nancy Oliver eschews cheap laughs for character-driven humanist comedy and is sensitively directed by Craig Gillespie (whose recent debut film the abominable ""Mr. Woodcock"" was taken out of his hands). Its a tribute to the filmmakers and cast that by the end of ""Lars and the Real Girl"" you can almost accept that Bianca is well a real girl. Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (some sexual references). At the Chelsea and the Angelika.

Kelli Garner (l.) plays a real cutie. Friday October 12 2007 400 AM Lars and the Real Girl. Comedy fable about a lonely guy who imports a silicone girlfriend from an Internet sex shop. With Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Paul Schneider. Director Craig Gillespie (146). PG-13 Sex-related content. At the Paris and the Clearview Chelsea. Though the life-size silicone doll serving as Ryan Goslings girlfriend in the infectiously whimsical fable ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is said to be anatomically correct youll be happy to know her owner/boyfriend never takes advantage of her. This would be an entirely different movie if writer Nancy Oliver and director Craig Gillespie had gone that extra step. But Goslings Lars is in no way a pervert; hes simply the loneliest guy in one of the loneliest chunks of frosty real estate in the upper Midwest. No specific diagnosis is made of Lars other than that hes delusional. But he has social phobias that prevent him from making emotional or physical contact with the people around him. He can barely look at his older brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) or at Margot (Kelli Garner) the pretty young co-worker who has taken an interest in him. But when Bianca shows up - shipped to him in a box from an Internet sex-doll company - Lars personality suddenly lights up. He creates an entire backstory for his instant (half-Brazilian/half-Danish daughter-of-a-missionary girlfriend) which he relates to his slack-jawed relatives with Bianca propped up on the couch next to him. Shes quite a looker with long black hair and an alluring bosom and though only Lars can hear her she makes a big impression on everyone she meets. And that is everyone in this small Capraesque community. While Lars falls deeper in love he and Bianca become the towns community-service project. Bianca is invited to school board meetings to volunteer at the hospital to meet with the girls and gossip at the hair salon. Lars has mixed feelings about all the attention shes getting; it eats into his time with her. But it gives him some solid socializing experience and eventually it helps him find his way into the real world. Working with a doll cant be easy but Gosling actually makes it feel emotionally real. A scene where he shares an imaginary dance with Bianca with his eyes closed and a beatific smile on his face is by itself worth the price of admission.

The director of one of the years worst movies Mr. Woodcock has also helmed one of the years sweetest and most moving Lars and the Real Girl. At a time when romantic comedies seem to have exhausted unique ideas along comes Lars an original amusing and heartfelt tale sharply written by Nancy Oliver (Six Feet Under). Ryan Gosling continues to demonstrate his impressive range as Lars Lindstrom a painfully shy young man with a boring office job. When not working hes reclusive emerging only weekly to attend church services. Though well-meaning he recoils from human contact declining even the invitations of his well-intentioned sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer) and brother (Paul Schneider). Inexplicably he orders a life-size anatomically correct doll from the Internet. While the dolls are intended for kinkier use Lars develops a starry-eyed romance with the Brazilian-Danish Bianca a shy missionary in a wheelchair. His brother is worried that the delusional Lars has gone crazy while his sister-in-law is more supportive but equally baffled. They are encouraged by a small-town doctor (Patricia Clarkson) to go along with the fantasy in an effort to find out what trauma may be underlying it. Soon all the townspeople are playing along (Bianca even gets elected to the school board) and Lars is receiving guidance from Clarkson in dealing with his emotional issues. The community in embracing Bianca helps to heal a painfully scarred young man. Its a simple story that is never simple-minded or cloying. Gosling poignantly embodies the awkward Lars with signature gestures (a repeated blinking feels particularly authentic) bringing his sweet-natured character to vivid life. Lars and the Real Girl is a tenderly observed and affecting Capra-esque fable that is well-acted and gently funny.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 12 2007 Save for later Saved Sullenly introverted Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling) has a dull office job in a small Midwestern town. He resists bantering with his co-workers and shrinks from the flirtations of Margo (Kelli Garner) the appealingly daffy new hire. He attends church regularly and lives in the garage apartment behind the childhood home occupied by his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant wife Karin (Emily Mortimer) who worries that Lars is friendless.One evening he makes an announcement that he has been joined by a companion Bianca a half-Brazilian half-Danish missionary wheelchair bound raised by nuns whom he met on the Web. Gus and Karins elation is short-lived Bianca is a custom-ordered anatomically correct silicone doll.Before you recoil in horror at the apparent grossness of yet another Hollywood high concept you need to know that ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is anything but an exploitation film. Director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Nancy Oliver want to shock audiences but not in the ways you might expect. Their movie is about loneliness and the ways in which it is mitigated by human kindness. If Frank Capra were starting out today he might have made a film like this one. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Lars is deeply delusional of course but the community cares about him. Hes a ""good boy"" pronounces the universally accepting Mrs. Gruner (Nancy Beatty) and very soon the villagers take up the cause. In Larss presence they all pretend Bianca is a real woman and in a sense because she is real to Lars she becomes real to them too. Only Gus is humiliated and disturbed by this turn in his brothers sanity but with Karins forbearance he accepts the situation in the hopes that with the help of the local psychologist (Patricia Clarkson) things will work out. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 He has good cause to hope since Lars who doesnt believe in premarital relations has installed Bianca in a spare bedroom in his brothers home. With her plastic sheen pouty lips and raven hair Bianca is initially an unsettling presence in the household. Larss love humanizes her.When I mentioned Capra earlier the compliment was double-edged. In attempting uplift Capra often front-loaded his morality plays with a heavy dose of whimsy. Gillespie and Oliver do a similar thing here. Its not just that they nix any sexual involvement between Bianca and her beloved. They also present a community in which not even one person attempts to make a public spectacle of Lars. The movie is an idyllic view of life as it ought to be rather than the way it is. Grade A-Rated PG-13 for some sex-related content.

Were asked to believe that Lars (Ryan Gosling) is a hardworking church-going young man whos so terrified of emotional or physical closeness that he introduces a sex doll as his mail-order girlfriend named Bianca. Were also to believe that Bianca -- clearly manufactured for less talkative pursuits -- offers Lars companionable relief from crippling mental problems. And that his brother (Paul Schneider) his pregnant sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer) his fellow congregants and heck the wise local doctor (Patricia Clarkson) collude in his delusion because really hes such a good soul. Plus it takes a village to populate a character-driven indie drama. Really I think we put up with Lars at all only because Gosling has such an affinity for the wounded boy birds he tends to play that its easy to watch him do his thing. He treats his silicone costar with great gentleness. But even his mad skills at embodying misfit masculinity cant sustain the plastic premise. Will no one talk to Lars honestly about the pitfalls of dating a golem?

By Christy Lemire updated 10/8/2007 85009 PM ET 2007-10-09T005009 Print Font + - REVIEW It may sound like a contradiction in terms to say that a movie about a guy in love with a sex doll is bursting with humanity but thats really the most apt way to describe the warm wonderful ""Lars and the Real Girl."" Ryan Gosling who earned an Oscar nomination this year as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher in ""Half Nelson"" and played a cocky prosecutor in ""Fracture"" further reinforces that he can do pretty much anything. His Lars Lindstrom is an awkward fiercely anti-social twentysomething who spends his days in a cubicle at a generic company and his nights in the converted garage behind his childhood home. Friends and relatives are constantly trying to set him up with nice girls they know; hiding behind an array of hideously 80s sweaters and ties and a neatly trimmed mustache he smiles shyly says no thanks and scurries off alone. Then one day Lars orders a life-size anatomically correct doll online. When she arrives though he truly believes shes a real woman -- the first ""person"" who gets him who makes him feel comfortable. He introduces her as Bianca says shes a missionary on sabbatical and that she doesnt speak much English (which explains why shes so quiet of course). With her slightly open mouth curvy frame fishnet stockings and flexible limbs she clearly wasnt intended for religious purposes but Lars sees only the purity in her. Their relationship if you can call it that is quaintly chaste. Now this all could have easily turned bawdy and crass. Worse yet it could have been ""Mannequin."" But director Craig Gillespie working from a script by Nancy Oliver (""Six Feet Under"") shows a surprisingly delicate touch following his last film the alleged comedy ""Mr. Woodcock."" (This should in theory give Gillespie a clean slate.) Everyone in this bleakly remote Midwestern setting from Lars older brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) to the family doctor (Patricia Clarkson) and the town reverend plays along out of respect for his obviously fragile mental state and because they love him too much to burst his bubble. Plus hes happy -- deeply radiantly happy -- for the first time in his lonely life. (The familys back story is revealed slowly as the film progresses and it explains everything.) Of course there are the obligatory sight gags involving the ridiculousness of the doll at the dinner table. And the way Bianca becomes an unexpected sensation in this insular snow-covered town (shot with spare cinematography by Adam Kimmel) is hilariously weird. But the humor remains deadpan and slyly absurd throughout -- never condescending never mean. As Lars politely squires Bianca around taking her to parties and to church and showing her his childhood haunts nearly every person he runs into has the decency to refrain from making fun of him. (Leading the way is the familys physician whom Clarkson plays with disarming sweetness and insight.) Gus is sarcastic and reluctant at first -- hes the only one who says what were thinking -- but eventually his derision turns to sympathy as he begins to wonder whether his brother has been afflicted by a serious delusion. But Gosling had nothing but respect for this role -- and his manufactured co-star. Through small gestures and bold choices hes created a character you begin feeling sorry for and end up rooting for and almost envying simply because hes found something (someone?) that makes him feel whole and alive. In our point-and-click world of instant gratification thats hard to come by. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Lars and the Real Girl | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lars-and-the-real-girl ) Lars and the Real Girl (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Lars and the Real Girl is an example of how even the most ridiculous premise can be used to construct a smart touching motion picture. The film sounds like it was developed with Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell in mind but the key here is that while there are laughs to be had Lars and the Real Girl is intended to be taken seriously. This is not a rude crude lewd comedy. It takes an idea that could easily be reduced to a series of sex jokes and pratfalls and develops it into something intelligent and thoughtful. But yes even taken seriously its nothing less than absurd and the filmmakers know that. Such recognition is a key to debut director Craig Gillespies success because he understands how to get the audience to the place where they embrace the characters and believe their situations rather than laugh at them. So whats it about? Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling) is a socially awkward man who spends his days huddled in a cubbyhole at work and his nights hiding out in the garage-turned-apartment he calls home. Ryans sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) is worried about him but Lars big brother Gus (Paul Schneider) doesnt think its something to be concerned about. He changes his mind when Lars brings home a girlfriend. For Karin and Gus delight turns to shock when they ""meet"" her. Shes Bianca - a life-sized anatomically correct sex doll (one of the high priced ones not the cheap blow-up models). Lars treats her exactly as he would a real woman although he concedes that she doesnt speak much English is in a wheelchair and is shy. Dr. Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson) the local psychiatrist believes that the best approach to Lars delusion is to play along with it. Soon the entire town is treating Bianca with respect including Margo (Kelli Garner) a girl who is hoping Lars will dump Bianca for her. TV commercial director Gillespie (whose Mr. Woodcock is also reaching theaters this fall) has infused his film with equal parts comedy and pathos. Arguably the funniest moments of the movie come when Karin and Gus are introduced to Bianca. There are other introductions as well but Gillespie resists the temptation to overplay the hand and overuse the joke to the point where it is no longer funny. Theres sadness here too - sadness that Lars upbringing with a cold broken-hearted father left him feeling unloved and sadness that Lars is too afraid of real intimacy to let anyone physically touch him. To him a hug isnt a comfort. It feels like a burn. Gillespie isnt afraid of laughter and tears and he orchestrates their merger with complete confidence. Lars and the Real Girl takes a lot of chances and succeeds mostly because they all work. Canadian-born Ryan Gosling one of his countrys most prominent up-and-coming actors is wonderful as Lars playing the part completely straight. Hes moody and broody but we understand a little of his pain and are able to sympathize with him. As far as Lars is concerned Bianca is the best thing to happen to him although the brief glimpses provided into Lars psyche by the actor hint that he knows how fragile his fairy tale world is. Paul Schneider and Emily Mortimer are excellent in supporting roles. One could argue that they have it tougher since their characters see Bianca for what she is but must pretend shes something else. Both get chances to play their share of comedic and serious scenes and neither misses a beat no matter what the tone. Other supporting players include the always-reliable Patricia Clarkson as the psychiatrist who suggests sympathy over ridicule and Kelli Garner as the very real girl who might provide Lars with an alternative to Bianca. Gillespie navigates the tightrope so well that he doesnt even need a balancing pole. The shifts in tone between comedy and serious material are adroitly handled. We never feel like were being jerked around or that the film has stumbled on the unevenness of its terrain. Lars and the Real Girl hits all the right notes never allowing the humor to become too broad or the drama to become too serious. Biancas primary intended function is referenced only a couple of times - and not too crudely - and we are not subjected to the kind of physical amusement that characterized the dead-man-almost-walking A Weekend at Bernies. While ""quirky"" is a good descriptor for the production Lars and the Real Girl isnt so bizarre that mainstream movie goers will reject it. This is an offbeat independent production that could become one of those big little fall surprises.

When a socially awkward small-town bachelor introduces an anatomically correct silicone doll as his girlfriend the local community ultimately responds with surprising compassion in ""Lars and the Real Girl."" Helmer Craig Gillespies sweetly off-kilter film plays like a Coen brothers riff on Garrison Keillors ""Lake Woebegone"" tales defying its lurid premise with a gentle comic drama grounded in reality. Although well-acted by a name cast the offbeat subject matter and idiosyncratic tone make it arthouse material. Skedded for a limited release Stateside it should have a longer life in ancillary and could serve as a niche item for offshore distribs. The underlying theme of ""Six Feet Under"" scribe Nancy Olivers script -- how a damaged person comes to terms with past traumas and grows into adult responsibilities -- may feel familiar but whats fresh and charming is the way the characters surrounding the protagonist also grow as they help him through his crisis. Set in an unspecified snowbound place in the northern Midwest that feels a lot like Minnesota (although pic was shot in Ontario) the plot centers on 27-year-old oddball Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling). Raised by a taciturn father after his mother died in childbirth Lars has some major emotional baggage He prefers to avoid human contact and cant stand being touched. Living in the garage apartment behind his childhood home now occupied by his older brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) Lars tries to avoid the married couples constant invitations. His social life consists primarily of attending church and listening to the porn and action-figure fantasies of a co-worker. At the office he scrupulously avoids the overtures of flirtatious colleague Margo (Kelli Garner). Karins pregnancy seems to awaken a deep-seated fear of abandonment in Lars expressed by the unexpected materialization of a girlfriend Bianca whom he wants his brother and sister-in-law to host. Shes a wheelchair-bound Brazilian-Danish missionary on sabbatical to experience the world. And shes also a custom-made life-size plastic doll ordered from the Internet. Horrified by their new houseguest and Lars apparent insanity Gus and Karin take the couple to family doctor-psychologist Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson). Believing Lars delusion indicates hes working something out Dagmar advises his worried family to go with the flow. Tenderly depicting his characters human foibles with low-key visual humor Gillespie never condescends or goes for an easy joke. Olivers pithy dialogue also avoids obvious yucks. All the perfs are fine with nerdily outfitted Gosling sympathetic in a role very different from what hes essayed of late and Schneider Mortimer and Clarkson impressively three-dimensional. Among the supporting cast Nancy Beatty makes an impression as a plainspoken neighbor as does Karen Robinson as office receptionist Cindy. Tech package is strong with spot-on costumes. The eventual absence of Lars blanket-cum-scarf beautifully signals character development. Lars and the Real GirlProductionAn MGM release of a Sidney Kimmel Entertainment MGM Pictures production.
