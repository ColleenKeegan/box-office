Nathalie Atkinson Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 22 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 21 2016 447PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda Written by Hirokazu Kore-eda Starring Haruka Ayase Masami Nagasawa Classification PG Hirokazu Kore-edas adaptation of Yoshida Akimis popular serialized josei (or womens) manga Umimachi Diary (Our Little Sister) is about three very different but close adult sisters who adopt a fourth - their younger half-sister. They live together in the old family homestead and scenes revolve around the preparation and sharing of meals. Its subdued at times even too leisurely but the film and its characters are luminous especially lead Ayase Haruka. The subject matter of family ties and ordinary lives observed through the elliptical passage of seasons will garner comparisons to a contemporary Yasujiro Ozu though its as much like work by Jane Austen or Louisa May Alcott.

Was the invite extended simply to spite their almost equally disunified mother? Audiences softened by Hollywood cynicism are bound to be confounded by filmmaker Hirokazu Koreedas (After Life Like Father Like Son) gentle upbeat tone. The directors prime influence Yasujiro Ozu notwithstanding it clearly doesnt take a superhero to resolve lifes endless flow of contradictions nor does our titular outcast in the sailors suit transform into a stringy-haired Japanese demon. Koreeda instead looks at what holds a family together long after the sands of time have filled in the emotional crater left by a messy divorce. And dont expect a conventional sappy ending.

(COURTESY SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL)  Reminiscent of The Commitments Sing Street is filled with spirited original pop tunes true to the era.  (COURTESY SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL)  Our Little Sister stars from left Haruka Ayase Suzu Hirose Kaho and Masami Nagasawa in a tale of family bonding.  (Mikia Takimoto / Sony Pictures Cl)  The Bosss script lazily conspires to have entitled Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) move in with her too-nice former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell).  (HOPPER STONE / UNIVERSAL STUDIOS)  By Peter HowellMovie Critic and Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 21 2016Life AnimatedDirected by Roger Ross Williams. Opens July 22 at Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema. 89 minutes. STCThe amateurish home movies portray the Suskind family living the dream until the day 3-year-old Owen ""vanished.""The seemingly happy and active child suddenly starts to undergo a series of unsettling changes such as being unable to sleep and loss of motor skills. A burgeoning vocabulary is replaced by gibberish.Article Continued Below""Its like we were looking for clues to a kidnapping. Someone kidnapped our son"" recalls father Ron Suskind a former national affairs reporter for the Wall Street Journal.Life Animated portrays the 20-year journey of Owen from difficult childhood to young adulthood. The story opens with him weeks away from leaving an adult program for people with autism and preparing to live on his own independently.Director Roger Ross Williams storytelling skills are at their finest in an engaging story suffused throughout with emotion that never descends into mawkishnessOne revelation stands out Owens ability to relate to animated Disney films -- he identifies with Peter Pan the boy who wont grow up and others -- and how that near obsession plays a role in his own ability to communicate and develop an understanding of a complex world.Williams make fine and (fortunately) sparing use of animation to show the world through the eyes of a lost little boy who discovers allies and hope in his battle against dark forces.Owen himself is a warm and delightful presence facing the issues every young man has to deal with -- a girlfriend a breakup getting a job -- with equanimity courage and humour.Intelligent and heartfelt without ever being heavy-handed Life Animated is sublimely inspirational filmmaking. Our Little SisterStarring Haruka Ayase Masami Nagasawa Kaho and Suzu Hirose. Written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. Opens July 22 at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 127 minutes. PGFollowing his Cannes Jury Prizewinner Like Father Like Son and continuing with domestic family narratives Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda merely coasts here in this slice-of-life study of four parentless siblings based on the graphic novel by Akimi Yoshida.Its bonding time when after the death of her father 13-year-old Suzu (Suzu Hirose) arrives to live with her three older half-sisters Sachi Yoshino and Chika (Haruka Ayase Masami Nagasawa and Kaho). They all reside in their late grandmothers home in a Tokyo suburb. Each has a lesson to learn but not in any overtly dramatic way. The sisters mark the seasons with traditional activities including winemaking fireworks displays and nature appreciation. With a delicate palette and soft tones the craftsmanship on display is impeccable but the pulse-free drama -- think crying over spilled milk -- makes for muted impact. Sing Street (DVD)Starring Ferdia Walsh-Peelo Lucy Boynton Jack Reynor Mark McKenna and Ben Carolan. Available on DVD July 26. 104 minutes. 14ARemember when rock solved every problem? The latest film from Irelands John Carney does joyfully set to a 1980s beat thats as musically alert as Once his 2007 smash.Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo charms as bullied Dublin 1985 high schooler Conrad. Hes out to impress too-cool-for-school Raphina (Lucy Boynton) by starting a band.Conrad cant sing (yet) and his guitar playing needs work. But with the help of neighbourhood pals -- including shy multi-instrumentalist Eamon (Mark McKenna) scrappy managerial wannabe Darren (Ben Carolan) and Conrads opinionated older bro Brendan (Jack Reynor) -- theyll get the gig and maybe the girl too.Reminiscent of The Commitments the film is filled with spirited original pop tunes true to the era. Sing Street knows what it takes to form your own band.Extras include a making-of featurette filmmakers chat and cast auditions.The Boss (DVD)Starring Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Ella Anderson Peter Dinklage and Tyler Labine. Directed by Ben Falcone. Available on DVD July 26. 99 minutes. 14AAfter starring in 2014s profitably puerile Tammy for her director-husband Ben Falcone Melissa McCarthy is back to her old rude tricks all dressed up and without a trailer park in sight but as tediously over the top as in excesses of old. Falcone again directs with sledgehammer finesse.McCarthys ribald and self-entitled Michelle Darnell is just Tammy in designer duds. Michelle screwed over her former lover (Peter Dinklage) and mentor (Kathy Bates) while becoming the 47th richest woman in America.The ex-lover retaliates by getting Michelle jailed on an insider trading rap. She emerges from the slammer penniless and friendless but the script lazily conspires to have her move in with her too-nice former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires preteen daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson).

Photo Sony Pictures Classics By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 14 2016 217 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS If youre looking for something to lift you up and take you away from the tumult and anguish of the moment seek out ""Our Little Sister"" a lovely new film in Japanese with English subtitles thats going into national distribution this week. The director Hirokazu Kore-eda is one of my favorite filmmakers a kind spirit who explores the lives of his characters--often children--with calm precision and ineffable grace. This story which he adapted from Akimi Yoshidas graphic novel ""Umimachi Diary"" starts when three 20-something sisters--Sachi Yoshino and Chika--meet their shy teenage half-sister Suzu at the funeral of their estranged father and invite her to live with them in their large traditional house in Kamakura a pretty seaside city south of Tokyo. More Reviews Ghostbusters The Infiltrator Cafe Society Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The workings of the plot concern the reworkings and coming together of the newly augmented family--individual struggles and triumphs sibling friction moments of unrestrained joy. Suzu is shy at first and burdened with guilt that soon melts in familial warmth. An endearing girl with gifts to give she also changes her sisters and her friends. The theme of sisters living together may bring to mind Kon Ichikawas 1983 classic ""The Makioka Sisters"" or just as reasonably may evoke Chekhov. ""Our Little Sister"" often feels Chekhovian a movie attuned to the passage of time and the changing of seasons. As I watched it though I also thought in a general way of Thornton Wilder that quintessential American playwright whose plays most notably ""Our Town"" are suffused with love and kindness. And I discovered when I read the production notes after seeing the film that ""Umimachi Diary"" means ""Seaside Town Diary"" and that Mr. Kore-eda sees his film as focused not only on the family but on the town which absorbs and embraces all the people living in it over the years and centuries. I didnt understand that--perhaps one needs to be Japanese--but I like it and find it moving. ""Our Town"" then is the same town the sisters call home.

Larson July 14 Suzu Hirose second from left plays an orphaned young Japanese woman who is welcomed into a newly discovered family in ""Our Little Sister"" which has a refreshing take on female characters. (Sony Pictures Classics) Hirokazu Kore-edas ""Our Little Sister"" glides gently through the ups and downs of its characters lives like a boat riding slightly rippled waters. As in several of his previous works (""Still Walking"" ""Like Father Like Son"") the Japanese director takes on weighty familial themes including separation and abandonment. But the emotional tone of this beautifully filmed drama is more restrained at times to a fault. Based on Akimi Yoshidas serialized graphic novel ""Umimachi Diary"" (literally ""Seaside-Town Diary"") the live-action film centers on three 20-something sisters who have been on largely their own for many years. Theyve had no connection with either parent since their mother left them with their grandmother some 15 years earlier after their father took up with another woman. Upon their fathers death the trio travels to the countryside for his funeral where they meet for the first time their half sister Suzu (Suzu Hirose) a shy girl in her early teens. Not wanting to leave the now-orphaned Suzu with her neglectful stepmother -- their fathers third wife -- the three women invite her on the spot to come live with them. She soon joins them in their coastal home town of Kamakura in the old house that once belonged to their late grandmother (which they jokingly refer to as a ""girls dorm""). What follows is a tender rendering of the bond that develops between Suzu and her siblings conscientious nurse Sachi (Haruka Ayase); party-girl Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) who works at a bank; and the hippie-ish Chika (Indou Kaho). As the three older siblings embrace her -- in ways both sisterly and verging on the maternal -- Suzu thrives in her new surroundings excelling in sports and growing into a poised young woman. Scenes of daily life roll by with a lovely backdrop of the changing seasons -- cherry blossoms summer fireworks -- and a meditative piano score. The foursome delight in such simple pleasures as homemade plum wine and seafood dishes that bring back memories of absent family members. The emphasis on female characters and their relationships is refreshing. The interactions among the sisters are the focus of the film. While they have occasional romances their suitors for the most part stay in the background. Older women including the girls great-aunt and the friendly owner of a local diner figure more prominently. To his credit Kore-eda avoids oversentimentality in a narrative that could easily have indulged in it. Yet the unhurried pacing and minimal dramatic tension -- even when an important character makes an appearance midway through the story -- feels unsatisfying. Indeed its surprising how little conflict seemingly arises from the young womens unexpected living arrangement as they create a new family structure to replace the one their parents have failed to provide. But while the emotions may be muted theres still something appealingly heartfelt about the way these siblings find each other. One cant help but cheer them on. PG. At Landmarks E Street Cinema.

When years ago her father left for another woman and their mother subsequently abandoned the family to live her own life Sachi (Haruka Ayase) was forced to become a maternal figure to younger siblings Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) and Chika (Kaho). The experience has hardened Sachi emotionally a trait that finds its extreme opposite in the newest member of the Koda clan half-sister Suzu Asano (Suzu Hirose) their now-deceased fathers 13-year-old daughter whom the almost-30 Sachi invites to live with them -- and who exudes all the open-heartedness she lacks.Kore-eda though isnt content to allow us to observe these character contrasts and draw these conclusions ourselves in his adaptation of Akimi Yoshidas popular Japanese manga series Umimachi Diary. Instead he has characters directly declaim such observations for our benefit. ""She has such an open heart"" the elderly diner owner Sachiko (Jun Fubuki) says of the newly arrived girl; later Sachi concludes that despite her ill feelings toward their philandering father perhaps he did something right after all by giving birth to Suzu. Even a small physical gesture like Chikas random fly-fishing hand motions pays off later on in a way that feels too neatly scripted.Film Details Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary) (Umi-gai Diary) RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time128 min. Showing Today In1 Theater More Info More worrying than that however is an emotional reticence that at times verges on too subtle for its own good. At his best Kore-eda matches the great Yasujiro Ozu in marrying an austerity of style with great depth of feeling in exploring often-repressed emotions in domestic situations. But though profoundly universal desires eventually punctured the placid surfaces of Still Walking (2008) and Like Father Like Son (2013) with slow-burning force Kore-edas manner is so serene in Our Little Sister that moments of bitterness and anguish dont quite have the gut-punch impact they ought to have. One has to take Suzus word for it when she tearfully confesses her guilt over the way the past sins of her father still haunt her sisters so passive is Kore-eda in dramatizing her inner anguish throughout.Still Our Little Sister often vibrates with such tenderness of feeling that its difficult to dismiss outright. The excellent performances from the four lead actresses help offset the occasional heavy-handedness of the script with Kore-eda alive to their distinctive tics and gestures Yoshinos romanticism and Chikas whimsicality counter Sachis hardness and Suzus innocence. No matter that plot here is relatively minimal with only a temporary return of the mother who abandoned the siblings bringing anything like dramatic tension to the film. All one needs is a close-up of Suzus face euphorically looking skyward eyes closed as she rides on a road surrounded by cherry blossoms to grasp the laudable humanity at the heart of Kore-edas patient warmhearted worldview.

The trio invite their half-sister (Suzo Hirose) to join them too. By Peter Rainer Film critic July 8 2016 Save for later Saved Our Little Sister stars (from l.) Haruka Ayase Suzu Hirose Kaho and Masami Nagasawa. Sony Pictures Classics          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Writer-director Hirokazu Kore-edas ""Our Little Sister"" is not for people craving sharp conflict in their movies. Its pretty much a nonstop bliss-out and so it may seem insubstantial by normal dramatic standards.But some of those moments of bliss are so captivating that it seems churlish to go on about how the film is Chekhov lite - very lite. Insubstantiality when its as pleasurable as this surely has its own reason for being.Three grown sisters all living together - Sachi (Haruka Ayase) a nurse at a local hospital having an affair with a married pediatrician; the fun-loving bank clerk Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa); and the sartorially challenged Chika (Kaho) - travel to the funeral for their father who left the fold years ago to be with the woman now dead who was the mother of their teenage half-sibling Suzu (Suzu Hirose). Living uneasily with her stepmother Suzu who is meeting her siblings for the first time takes up their offer to move to their spacious seaside home in Kamakura near Tokyo. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time If you were maybe expecting that Suzu would enable a rift in the sisters lives you dont know Kore-eda. I dont know that Ive ever seen quite as much smiling in one movie. Sachi who is easily the most well-defined of the three older sisters may have a fraught relationship with the pediatrician but there is a worldliness almost a contentment about her acceptance of her fate. (This part is like Yasujiro Ozu lite.) She is after all the unstated matriarch of the brood and has her dignity to maintain. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Kore-eda has a gift for portraying goodness that is quite rare. He does so without a whisper of banality. When Suzu is riding on the back of a boys bicycle under a swirl of cherry blossoms the close-up of her bliss is so joyful its practically ecstatic. I like this film much more than his last the overly schematic melodrama ""Like Father Like Son."" Kore-eda may have moved away from the adventurous mysterioso moodiness of early films like ""After Life"" but the smiles he provokes here - both with his characters and with us - are well-earned.

All three sisters have been on their own since Dad got hitched to another woman years ago -- dont even ask about Mom -- with Sachi acting as a de facto den mother raising her younger siblings in the family house. When news of their fathers passing reaches the trio the eldest bitterly dispatches the other two to go without her. Yet Sachi eventually does show up at which point she encounters Asano (Suzu Hirose) -- the 14-year-old half-sister none of them had ever met. On a whim the alpha female invites the adolescent to come live with them. Reluctantly the kid accepts.

Asano becomes the schools soccer superstar. Sachi gets a potential offer to practice medicine abroad. Romantic entanglements come and go. A flaky matriarch and a few non-family members -- an elderly woman who runs the ladies favorite diner Chikas goofy boho-hipster best friend -- drift into their periphery and slowly eddy out again. Nothing cataclysmic happens. Nothing much happens at all except life the passage of time and the slow hardening of the glue that holds these four young women together. Its the way that Koreeda handles such quotidian details and detours of this quartet that makes all the difference and Our Little Sister the sort of incredibly rich rewarding moviegoing experience that makes you feel like your molecules have been rearranged as you leave the theater. One of Japans more prestigious modern directors -- Sister scored a record amount of nominations at the countrys equivalent to the Oscars last January -- the filmmaker has specialized in the spiritual (1998s After Life)  the torn-from-the-headlines stark (2001s Aum Shinrikyo-like cult drama Distance; 2004s Nobody Knows) and the existentially surreal (2009s sex-doll-come-to-life parable Air Doll). But for the last few years the director has settled into making the type of tender homu doramas that were Yasujiro Ozus stock in trade complete with the latters signature train shots and floor-level people-sitting-on-tatami-mat shots. If Koreeda isnt exactly the masters heir hes certainly perfected the art of the glancing character study and Our Little Sister is rife with the atmospherics and attention to telling little shifts that mark all of his best work. Hes the kind of filmmaker who will stage a seaside fireworks scene and then favor the spectacles colorful reflections off the water and observers faces or linger on a person walking through a landscape for effect -- a practitioner of grace notes rather than grand all-caps statements. And the man knows how to collaborate with actors Its impossible to single out any of the main turns here because in the hands of these females their individual roles seem to morph into one multi-stranded four-sided performance. The effect is less like watching a cast trade lines than seeing a band listen to each other and lock into a groove -- the give-and-take between these actresses is that seamless and that essential to the spell the film conjures. By the time the movie ends with a stroll on the beach the sensation that you know these women is palpable. You can take Our Little Sister as a foreign-film antidote to summer blockbuster bombast an arthouse salve or simply a cinematic chamber piece set to the key of kin-based connection. Just see it.

O. SCOTTJULY 7 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo A scene from Hirokazu Kore-edas film ""Our Little Sister"" about three young women who meet a teenage half sister they hadnt known about. Credit Sony Pictures Classics ""Our Little Sister"" begins with a couple waking up in bed. After some morning conversation the woman dresses and leaves and as she walks home the soundtrack swells with string-heavy melodramatic music. The lushness of the sound seems at odds with the plainness of the images and this discrepancy establishes a tone that will last through the rest of this delicate and satisfying film. Characters may refrain from expressing the strong emotions that flow beneath the surface of their daily lives but every so often the music (composed by Yoko Kanno) will remind us of the existence of those feelings.The effect is sometimes jarring which is part of the point that the director Hirokazu Kore-eda is making about the complex and sometimes invisible cords of affection and duty that bind members of a family. One of the most reliable Japanese filmmakers currently working Mr. Kore-eda specializes in low-key domestic dramas that take account of abandonment and loss as well as loyalty and love.""Nobody Knows"" (2005) is the story based on news accounts of a group of siblings fending for themselves in the Tokyo apartment where they had been left by their overwhelmed mother. ""Still Walking"" (2009) is grounded in the routines of an elderly couple whose surviving children have grown up and moved away. ""Our Little Sister"" which is played in a breezier more comical key than those earlier films settles in with three adult sisters who live together in the house where they grew up. Their father left when they were young and their mother seems to have been a marginal presence in their lives. She shows up now and then to dispense irrelevant advice. The main authority figure seems to have been a great-aunt. Video Movie Review Our Little Sister The Times critic A.O. Scott reviews ""Our Little Sister."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date July 7 2016. Photo by Sony Pictures Classics. At their fathers funeral in a faraway coastal town the sisters -- Sachi (Haruka Ayase) Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) and Chika (Kaho) -- discover another sibling 13-year-old Suzu (Suzu Hirose) who seems destined for a pre-ball Cinderella existence with her unsympathetic stepmother. Suzus half sisters to stay with the fairy-tale metaphor do the Prince Charming job of rescuing her from that fate bringing her to live with them. She enrolls in school joins a soccer team and becomes a helpful and cheerful member of the household.""Our Little Sister"" adapted from a popular manga series by Akimi Yoshida has a deceptively episodic plot. Seeming to wander through small incidents and mundane busyness it acquires momentum and dramatic weight through a brilliant kind of narrative stealth. You are shaken by the end at how much you care about these women and how sorry you are to leave their company. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its possible to discern the ghostly outline of an American television sitcom in the movies structure. The four sisters are sharply drawn their distinctive personalities a few crosshatchings away from caricature. Sachi is the responsible one working long hours as a hospital nurse and scolding the others when they fall short of her standards. Yoshino who works in a bank is a little wilder. She likes to drink and has a history of bad boyfriends including the good-looking loser she wakes up next to in the first scene. Chika is the kooky one working in a sporting-goods store and maintaining a low-key relationship with an eccentric co-worker. Video Trailer Our Little Sister A preview of the film. By SONY PICTURES CLASSICS on Publish Date April 22 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Suzu also finds a bit of romance but the pursuit of love is peripheral to Mr. Kore-edas concerns. Sachis long discreet affair with a married doctor is the most serious such relationship in the film -- at least to the extent that it injects some complication into the plot -- but it hardly represents an ideal of happiness. That is to be found at home in the rush of breakfast or the weary calm of a late supper.Food and drink play an important role in ""Our Little Sister"" in particular the freshly caught baby eels that are a local delicacy and a link to the absent father. The most vividly drawn secondary character is the woman who runs the sisters favorite diner -- another potential sitcom element treated with delicate realism.Janet Malcolm once wrote of Chekhovs stories that we swallow one ""as if it were an ice and we cannot account for our feeling of repletion."" Something similar can be said about this film which goes down as easily as a sip of the plum wine the sisters brew and yet leaves the viewer both sated and intoxicated.""Our Little Sister"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for grown-up situations. Running time 2 hours 8 minutes. It is in Japanese with English subtitles.

Sony Pictures Classics hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Classics Sachi Koda (Haruka Ayase) in Our Little Sister. Sony Pictures Classics On the surface Our Little Sister a new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda feels like nothing much is going on. Three grown sisters travel from their pretty seaside town in rural Japan to attend the funeral of their father who had abandoned them to marry another woman. The young women end up taking their half-sister Suzu Asano (the enchanting Suzu Hirose) whos just entering her teens back to live with them in the family home theyve shared for years. Suzu is personable and eager to please but her arrival comes as close to a triggering event as this all but plotless film ever gets nudging each sister to revise her view of their parents and the wounds they inflicted. What follows is both less programmatic and less long-faced than it sounds. Life goes on pretty much as it always has with Suzu settling into her new life and her new siblings affections. A boy shows interest; theres a rapturously photographed bike ride through trees laden with cherry blossom. But the new status quo is uneasy its fragility exacerbated by a visit from the girls mother who wouldnt exactly qualify as Mom of the Year. When the kindly owner of the local diner a de facto mother to the girls confronts unwelcome changes of her own at least two of the sisters are forced to face up to the ways in which they may be repeating the very flaws they resent so much in their parents. Our Little Sister continues Kore-edas focus on the plight and the resilience of children who suffer abandonment or neglect but the film lacks the sense of emotional emergency of his searing 2004 domestic drama Nobody Knows which charted the flagging fortunes of small siblings afflicted with a feckless unstable mother. Perhaps the comparison is unfair. Nobody Knows examined the inner workings of a real-life tragedy that dominated the headlines for a long time and sparked a national debate about the degradations of the supposedly stable Japanese family. Adapted from a popular graphic novel some of whose internal conflicts Kore-eda softened for the movie Our Little Sister works in small shifts of emotional temperature its turmoil observed with a serenity some might find enervating or oppressive. Best seen perhaps as the view from later in life when equanimity and the bigger picture rule the movie bestows a forgiving compassion on all its troubled souls even those of the misbehaving dead. As always Kore-eda shares his belief in the power of ceremony and ritual that more than any epiphany or redemption act as healing markers in the relentless flow of life. ""That was a good funeral"" observes one satisfied mourner who had reason to know the desires of the deceased better than anyone else present. Our Little Sister ends as it began with the sisters contemplating the surge and knock of the waves that lap the shores of their circumscribed universe. Only now they reverse the adjectives they once used to dismiss their father as ""kind and useless"" a critical revision that reflects their appreciation of the lasting gift he has left them. Shes standing right beside them.

"A family grows and deepens in the warm rewarding Our Little Sister - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review A family grows and deepens in the warm rewarding Our Little Sister ""Our Little Sister"" Sony Pictures Classics Suzu Hirose in the Japanese drama ""Our Little Sister."" Suzu Hirose in the Japanese drama ""Our Little Sister."" (Sony Pictures Classics) Kenneth Turan Film Critic ""Our Little Sister"" has to be seen to be believed. Not because it depends on huge explosions or special effects but because it doesnt.A delicate unforced meditation on the bonds of family and the joys and wonders hidden in everyday life this film is able to move audiences without apparent effort and that must be experienced firsthand to be appreciated and understood. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story One of the favorite films at Cannes 2015 ""Our Little Sister"" is the latest work by master Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda a writer-director-editor whose wonderfully human films include ""After Life"" ""Nobody Knows"" ""Still Walking"" and ""Like Father Like Son"" the last of which won the Cannes jury prize in 2013.This time working from a graphic novel by Akimi Yoshida Kore-eda focuses on sisters and their relationship to one another starting with three siblings in their 20s who live together in an old ramshackle family house in the charming seaside town of Kamakura south of Tokyo. But more than this Kore-eda as always focuses on family on how people relate to each other and the way life in all its inescapable complexity simply happens to the films protagonists and those they know and love.""Our Little Sisters"" plot kicks in when the three Koda sisters receive the news that their ""kind but useless"" father whom they havent seen or heard from in 15 years has died.Traveling to the funeral in a small town they meet Suzu (Suzu Hirose described in the press notes as ""the Busiest 16-Year-Old in Japan"") the shy half-sister they didnt know they had. Shes the daughter of their father and the woman also now dead who broke up his marriage to their mother.On an impulse but one shared by her siblings oldest daughter Sachi (Haruka Ayase) invites Suzu to move to Kamakura and live with them. And this despite warnings from the womens acerbic great aunt that a child is not a pet is just what happens. Its no surprise that Sachi was the sister who spoke up. A hard-working nurse she is not only the oldest of the three but also the take-charge most responsible one a role she took on while still a teenager when the siblings mother took off.Middle sister Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) who works for a bank is a different sort. More outgoing and fun-loving always on the lookout for a boyfriend or a beer she is mocked by Sachi ""for indulging men and ruining them"" though simply having a good heart may be the cause of it all.Chika (the single-named Kaho) the youngest Koda sister is someone else yet again a genial goofball who works in a sporting goods store and has her eye on a mountaineering co-worker who lost six toes in an attempt on Mt. Everest. Neither of her sisters quite understands her taste in men.Suzu the wide-eyed newcomer is as eager to fit in with her siblings as they are for her to feel welcome. Over the course of a years four seasons ""Our Little Sister"" slowly gets into the rhythm of their lives both as individuals and a group as time-sensitive tasks like the picking of plums and the making of plum wine occupy their spare time.As shot by Takimoto Mikiya ""Our Little Sister"" is visually attentive to the beauties of the changing landscape with a marvelous bicycle ride Suzu takes through a veritable tunnel of blooming cherry blossoms being a special high point.It is the nature of director Kore-edas style which is warm and approachable without being in the least sentimental that ""Our Little Sister"" deepens almost without our noticing it effortlessly taking us inside the particular dilemmas of these intertwined lives.One of the key statements in ""Our Little Sister"" comes by way of the sisters late grandmother (an everyday presence because of an in-house shrine) who believed that ""every living thing takes time and effort.""Its a sentiment that the director interviewed in Cannes when the film debuted fully supports. ""For the sisters to form a real family you need a lot of time"" he said. ""That expresses the essence of this film.""Our Little SisterIn Japanese with English subtitlesMPAA rating PG for thematic elements and brief languageRunning time 2 hours 6 minutesPlaying Laemmles Royal West Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-our-little-sister-review-20160704-snap-story.html,200,sisters11,sisters,latimes

But those three titles have a narrative backbone that engages the viewers imagination in a way that his new picture the extremely soft and airy Our Little Sister does not. The story based on the popular Japanese magna comic Umimachi Diary begins with three sisters (Haruka Ayase Masami Nagasawa Kaho) traveling to the funeral of their estranged father. There they encounter their fathers 15-year-old daughter (Suzu Hirose) from his second marriage and in quick impulse judgment the sisters invite the girl to come live with them in seaside idyll. Anyone with foreknowledge of the director will figure out that the little sister is not possessed by dark secrets or demonic revenge. This is the Japan of Ozu not Ringu and the winsome girl easily adjusts into the family and comes to signal a burst of hope-springs within each of her three half-sisters. But except for a small handful of moments--such as a magnificent bike ride through a pink-white dome of cherry blossoms or a fetishized meal of delectable whitebait on toast with plum wine--the story lingers and wanders and meanders with a disappointing lack of throttle. The entrance of the womens long lost mother at the halfway mark is an attempt to energize the film with some dramatic thrust but comes too late especially given the films two-hours-plus running time. Despite fine intentions and four lovely performances from the female leads Our Little Sister is simply too light to be felt. It floats away in the wind--and the memory -- like a paper umbrella.

Share Tweet Among Japanese directors past and present Hirokazu Kore-eda wrestles with the great Yasujiro Ozu for the title of ""most gentle and serene"" (though the two would be more apt to sigh wistfully at each other than do any actual wrestling). Even by Kore-edas standards though Our Little Sister is unusually placid. In part thats due to the nature of the source material The film was adapted from a popular serialized manga called Umimachi Diary which has been running since 2007 (and is still in progress; the most recent volume was released in January eight months after Our Little Sister premiered at Cannes 2015). The story was low-key and anecdotal to begin with and Kore-eda has chosen to omit many of its spikier aspects; its as if he loves the characters so much that he cant bear to put through them any significant turmoil. As a result the movie version feels a tad weightless especially relative to its hefty running time. Anyone in the mood for two hours (and change) of sheer unadulterated loveliness however will be amply rewarded.Kore-edas Nobody Knows (2004) derived pathos from a group of abandoned children. Its easy then to understand what attracted him to Umimachi Diary whose three main characters likewise had to fend for themselves from an early age. Now in their 20s Sachi (Haruka Ayase) Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) and Chika (the uni-monikered Kaho) still live together in their childhood home years after Dad ran off with another woman and Mom unable to cope with the shame also took a powder. Their lives are pleasant and uneventful until word arrives that their father has died setting in motion a major change that will render everything... pretty much equally pleasant and uneventful. Attending the funeral strictly out of a sense of duty Sachi meets for the first time their half-sister Suzu (Suzu Hirose) and impulsively invites the teenager to come live with her and her sisters in Kamakura. The rest of the movie simply details the slight adjustments these four women subsequently make as the youngest sister settles into her new family. Abandon hope all ye who seek narrative intrigue or even fairly basic conflict. (Mom does eventually reappear causing tempers to flare momentarily.) From moment to moment though Our Little Sister is so thoroughly winning that its total lack of momentum barely registers as a liability. Kore-eda coaxes relaxed yet sharply drawn performances from the four young lead actors (supported by old pros like Kirin Kiki and Lily Franky) and his screenplay condensed from what was then six volumes of the manga teems with absorbing details (e.g. the arduous process of making plum wine) and indelible images (like Suzus sort-of boyfriend taking her on a bike ride through a ""tunnel"" that turns out to be a canopy of cherry blossoms). The film eventually feels overlong and it could use some bite to offset the insistent sweetness--theres way too much dialogue in which the sisters discuss how much they love each other sentiments that come across just fine without being spoken. But charming is charming.

The half is Suzu (Suzu Hirose) who is still a teen-ager; after the death of her father she meets her three older half sisters for the first time. One is a nurse; another is a bank clerk; the third works in a sports shop. They attend the funeral and are so struck by Suzus maturity and grace that they invite her to come and live with them in their large old house where the doors arent even locked. The practiced calmness of Kore-edas approach is such that you barely notice the speed at which he tugs the plot along and flips from one setting to the next as modern mores--arguments about sleeping around breakfasts grabbed on the go--are played out against traditional backdrops with a flourish of blossom and at a shrine where Suzu prays before heading to school. Nobody could describe the movie as eventful (and viewers may be surprised to learn that its adapted from a graphic novel) yet the thrust of Kore-edas storytelling as so often is that even a quiet life can be a full one.

This irresistible light-filled family drama from Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda (I Wish Still Walking) brims with small moments and slips down as easily as the many meals it shares with us. Kore-eda gives us three sisters Sachi (Haruka Ayase) Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) and Chika (Kaho) all in their twenties who meet their teenage half-sister Suzu (Suzu Hirose) for the first time at their estranged fathers funeral far away in the countryside. Immediately getting on well with this balanced smart young woman they invite Suzu to share with them the old family home in Kamakura that their father abandoned 15 years earlier and where the three still live eating drinking and talking together like friends as much as siblings. Their close rapport and reliance on each other - and the dignity with which they welcome their new sister despite her presence unearthing old resentments - is deeply infectious. Absence is a theme the mother of the three older sisters like their father has been away for some years too and part of the power of Kore-edas film rests on how he subtly tracks each of these four womens different perspectives on their parents. Those perspectives in turn continue to influence their attitudes to each other their work and their relationships with men. Although men firmly take a back seat in Our Little Sister this is a sisterly drama through and through. An intimate warm embrace of a film it radiates joy and harmony despite playing out entirely in the shadow of a difficult fathers death. Out of darkness Kore-eda discovers light and theres a meandering extremely personable charm to this film that means that even its more soppy moments - such as when two characters cycle through an avenue of cherry blossom - feel well-earned and entirely fitting. Deeply charming and quietly moving.

Entertainment Salma Hayek Eats A Monsters Heart In The Worlds Darkest Fairy Tale Movie Hayek gets gory and Vincent Cassel gets randy in sumptuous fairy tale film Tale of Tales. Another Cannes premiere Our Little Sister aims for more grounded family drama. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Le Pacte ID 5743273 Of all the darkly evocative images that fill Matteo Garrones Tale of Tales the one that lingers longest is of Salma Hayek sitting at a banquet table devouring a sea monsters heart. She does so thoughtfully with determination if not enjoyment alone in an ornate white room -- the better to see that blood with my dear. That piece of meat represents a bargain shes made. Shes the queen and the strange meal has come at a high price -- the life of the king (John C. Reilly) -- that was willingly paid because shes been promised it will lead to a child.Its the kind of deal that usually comes back to bite you in fairy tales in which a careful-what-you-wish-for lesson tends to accompany most instances of magical fulfillment. But Tale of Tales which just had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and doesnt yet have U.S. distribution draws from the Pentamerone a set of stories that are older and less familiar than the versions the Brothers Grimm would later publish -- theyre tales that dont always come around to the expected morals. View this image > Tale of Tales Le Pacte ID 5743630 The queen for instance gets her child a beloved son with albino-white hair but then has to contend with the identical twin born to a servant girl who helped with the conception spell. In another castle a lascivious king (Vincent Cassel) falls for a woman based on the loveliness of her singing not realizing that she is actually one of two dye-stained spinster sisters (Hayley Carmichael and Shirley Henderson) who most decidedly are not the nubile beauty of his imagination. A third king (Toby Jones) adopts an unusual pet and following its death comes up with a plan to keep his impatient daughter (Bebe Cave) from marrying and leaving home -- a plan that backfires spectacularly.Garrone whose last two films took on organized crime (Gomorrah) and reality TV obsession (Reality) has ventured into considerably more fanciful territory for Tale of Tales which intercuts its three stories but only occasionally lets them touch. Hes created such a lush world with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky and composer Alexandre Desplat that it takes a while to settle into the fact that theres little underneath its strange stunning surfaces. An ogre makes off with a princess a mother chases her son through a stone maze a witch nurses a weeping woman at her breast two brothers hide beneath the water like merfolk. Sometimes uniting themes threaten to emerge about arrogance or controlling parents or vanity but they never really do and in the end the tales are really just three separate phantasmagoric ones pretty but never fitting together as a greater whole. View this image > Our Little Sister Akimi Yoshida / Shogakukan ID 5743664 Theres no trace of the fantastic in the perfectly pleasant family drama Our Little Sister. Instead this movie which was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics for a U.S. release just after its Cannes premiere grounds itself firmly in cozy domestic details. Like most films from Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda (Nobody Knows and the wonderful Still Walking) its resolutely understated though it has a sentimental streak that sometimes makes it a little too sticky sweet. Based on a manga by Akimi Yoshida Our Little Sister tells the story of the three Koda sisters who range in age from their late teens to late twenties and who impulsively invite the half-sister theyve only just met to live with them in their rambling family home in the picturesque seaside city of Kamakura.Suzu (Suzu Hirose) is a 15-year-old whos serious beyond her years after caring for her dying father when her frivolous stepmother passed on the responsibility. But she slowly blossoms in the care of her older siblings -- motherly Sachi (Haruka Ayase) fun-loving Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) and quirky Chika (Kaho). The sisters joke about how their house is a womens dormitory but its really a home theyve shored up themselves in the face of parental neglect and have strengthened with rituals of homemade plum wine shared breakfasts and battles over borrowed items of clothing. View this image > Our Little Sister Akimi Yoshida / Shogakukan ID 5743885 Over the course of the movie we learn that the Kodas mother also left Kamakura and her children when her marriage ended because her husband left her for another woman -- Suzus mother. The finest parts of Our Little Sister are when we see the cracks through which the girls repressed anger frustration and grief bubble up when we understand just how stable and strong the sisters have grown up to be despite parents who chased their own desires rather than standing by their daughters.The movie is gentle with this feckless older generation including the four girls never seen ""kind but hopeless"" affair-prone father -- its gentle with everyone a generosity thats admirable but that also leaves it short on conflict and forward motion. Still the Kodas initial gesture of inclusion of offering up their hard-won home and refusing to let Suzu be saddled with her parents baggage grows more and more breathtaking in retrospect a quiet act of grace and love that the film provides just the right showcase for.

One of writer-director Hirokazu Kore-edas marvelous early films After Life (1998) unfolds a vision of limbo where the recently deceased collaborate with angelic filmmakers to recreate treasured moments -- a cherry blossom shower a plane ride through clouds and so on -- from their lives before they pass on into oblivion. His latest film Cannes competitor Our Little Sister sometimes seems to consist of solely of happy weightless moments like those. Nearly all the conflict is in the films past tense as it observes three grown sisters (played by Haruka Ayase Masami Nagasawa and Kaho) welcome their teenage half-sibling (Suzu Hirose) into the family fold after the death of their common father. The result is an episodic generous-spirited pristinely shot and quite frankly somewhat dull effort which will probably play well in Japan where the leads are big stars and the graphic novel its based on is well-known. However its unlikely to have the same appeal to audiences offshore except for hardcore Kore-eda fans and committed Japanophiles. In the photogenic seaside city of Kamakura near Tokyo the three Koda sisters all roughly in their 20s live relatively harmoniously together apart from the odd spat over clothes borrowed without permission. Responsible eldest Sachi (Ayase from Ichi) a nurse at the local hospital is having a relationship with a married pediatrician (Shinichi Tsutsumi). Ever since the girls mother (Shinobu Ohtake) moved away and their grandmother died Sachi has been the de facto matriarch of the family for her younger sisters party-girl bank clerk Yoshino (Nagasawa on her second Kore-eda outing after I Wish) and the quirkily dressed but less well-defined Chika (Kaho). See more Cannes The Red-Carpet Arrivals (Photos) When their father who skedaddled when Chika was a toddler dies in a distant province the three sisters attend the funeral and meet their half-sibling 15-year-old Suzu (Hirose) for the first time. Since Suzus own mother whom the father went off to be with years ago is now dead and Suzu doesnt get on with her stepmother she gladly accepts when Sachi invites her to come and live with them all in their capacious homestead. Viewers primed to expect from more conventional movies that spats or at least complications would arise from this inciting incident will be nonplussed by Suzus seamless assimilation into the Koda family. Before long shes making friends at school and finding her niche on the local teen soccer team. The passage of time is marked by a procession of seasonal vignettes like pages from a medieval book of hours brought to life. Suzu rides pillion on a friends bicycle through a frothy tunnel of cherry blossom trees to mark the coming of spring and soon its time to prick kanji characters in the skin of greengages as the sisters prepare their annual batch of plum wine. (A great deal of the running time is spent watching characters preparing food eating meals and discussing the virtues of say whitebait toast or the local cafes preparation of marinated horse mackerel making this a film one shouldnt see on an empty stomach.) As the season turns its time for the women to dress in their best summer kimonos to enjoy an entirely nonmetaphorical fireworks display. As if grudgingly aware that he must provide at least a modicum of drama Kore-eda warms up the emotional temperature in the last few reels when the original trios mother shows up to make vague threats about selling the house and the older girls find a way to forgive the father they barely knew but Suzu loved deeply. The sometimes self-righteous Sachi finally has an epiphany when she realizes her own extramarital goings-on make her no better a person than Suzus mother who supposedly stole her father away. Its not really a spoiler to report that by the end like Chekhovs three sisters but without any of the Slavic melancholy or frustration the women are exactly in the same place as where they started if anything just a little happier. And like the children in Kore-edas much more tragic but punchier effort Nobody Knows they find the inner resources to survive without parents forming a somewhat unconventional family unit. Our Little Sister certainly marks a change from the heavy melodramatics of the swapped-at-birth storyline of the directors last Like Father Like Son but it feels ineffably slight even if its a consistent pleasure to spend time in the company of these three likeable women. The actors have a breezy unforced and entirely credible sisterly chemistry together and working once again with Like Fathers DoP Takimoto Mikiya Kore-eda often groups them together in midrange shots all the better to showcase their private economy of exchanged smiles and amused raised eyebrows. But pleasant though that is its not quite enough to sustain interest in a film that could easily be half an hour shorter than it is. The thing that was so inspired about the central conceit of After Life was that everyone has experienced just one moment of perfect happiness in her life. This film proves that if nearly every moment is pretty happy then no one moment feels particularly special. Production companies An Akimi Yoshida Shogakukan Fuji Television Network Inc.

Marking the subtle transitions in the lives of three sisters after they take under their wing a teenage half-sibling they never knew ""Our Little Sister"" is so meticulously shot and gracefully orchestrated that it can be considered a worthy contempo successor to Kon Ichikawas masterpiece ""The Makioka Sisters."" Yet in attempting to evoke an overwhelmingly femme-centric universe for the first time Hirokazu Kore-eda adopts an approach so serene that his protagonists pain as well as their personalities remain largely muffled as they drift soulfully through the seasons. While gently engaging throughout the pic nonetheless doesnt reverberate as deeply as the helmers 2013 Cannes jury prizewinner ""Like Father Like Son"" but Kore-edas standing among the worldwide culturati will ensure a warm response at festivals and arthouse cinemas.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival ""Our Little Sister"" is Kore-edas fourth film (after ""Nobody Knows"" ""I Wish"" and ""Like Father Like Son"") to center on abandoned children. This time the protagonists have grown up and seem to cope better in their cozy provincial life but their trauma is also buried deeper and the story explores their subconscious desire to reclaim their childhood. In adapting shojo manga artist Akimi Yoshidas ""Umimachi Diary"" (""Diary of a Seaside Town"") published sporadically since 2006 and still going Kore-eda (who also wrote and edited) has wrought certain changes Most significantly the central perspective has shifted from the little sister Suzu to the eldest Sachi. Consequently the film emerges as less a coming-of-ager than a pensive drama about how adults come to terms with the mess their parents made of their lives. The Koda sisters -- Sachi (Haruka Ayase) 29 Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa) 22 and Chika (Kaho) 19 live in their late grandmothers sprawling ancestral home in the historical city of Kamakura an hours train ride from Tokyo. One day they receive news of their fathers death but appear indifferent to it since hehad  left them to elope with another woman in Sendai Tohohoku; since her death he had again remarried and relocated to Yamagata further north. Using work as an excuse Sachi dispatches her younger sisters to attend the funeral where they meet 13-year-old Suzu (Suzu Hirose) a daughter from their fathers second marriage. Sachi arrives unexpectedly and within minutes having sussed out that Yoko her dads widow is an attention-seeking flake whos not fit to be Suzus guardian. On a whim she invites the shy crestfallen Suzu to move to their Kamakura home. Sachi a nurse at the local hospital has been taking care of Yoshino and Chika since their parents divorce and she conducts her daily interactions with them like both a fretful mother and a stern headmistress. Shes smugly dismissive of her sisters taste in men and irritated with their more laidback ways and her playful arguments with them reflect Kore-edas lucid eye for the dynamics of family interaction. As the sisters drift through their mundane jobs and not entirely stable love affairs the oceans throbbing presence the rhapsodic seasonal changes and familys cherished culinary traditions are lyrically embedded into the narrative. Like the wine they make with fruits picked from their 55-year-old plum tree Kore-eda implies a familys memories and bonds must be preserved with the utmost care. Such scenes provide ineffable pleasure for patient audiences in tune with the understated emotions and softly undulating rhythms of classical Japanese family dramas. Some viewers however might understandably be bored by the storys lack of drama or left cold by the time the protags anger and passion finally bleeds through. Were 80 minutes into the film before the first major conflict happens when the Koda sisters mother Miyako (Shinobu Otake) resurfaces after having left them to run off with a man some 15 years earlier. In ""Still Walking"" and ""Like Father Like Son"" the sense of catharsis was so powerful that it lent depth and meaning to the characters prior repression; here the characters attend funerals like theyre bridge-club gatherings and critical decisions are made over a leisurely stroll. While most of the protags are ultimately reconciled with themselves and others in a quietly moving way their Zen-like equanimity sometimes lacks conviction. Koreedas sensitive yet lucid helming keeps the performances precise yet natural and the presence of character actors in supporting roles -- like Kirin Kiki Lily Franky Jun Fubuki and Shinobu Otake -- adds flavor to the cast even if they arent given much centrality in the story. Although theyre excellent actors in their own right Shinichi Tsutsumi Ryo Kase and Takashi Ikeda are short-changed as the Koda sisters love interests to minimal emotional effect. The four distaff leads hold the screen by dint of their sheer beauty but theirs are not career-breakthrough performances. Still Ayase who exudes a vivacious personality in most of the films shes starred in successfully conveys Sachis tightly wound mental state with her imposing posture and strong sense of self-discipline. This makes it hard for viewers to get under her skin most of the time but she is radiant in scenes with Hiroses Suzu revealing another side of empathy and gentleness to the person she sees as her younger mirror image. Craft contributions as expected of a Kore-eda film is superb in an entirely unostentatious way. Especially worth noting is Yoko Kannos music whose dulcet melodies and classical edge has a softening effect on the helmers usually austere tone. Lenser Mikiya Takimoto (""Like Father Like Son"") captures the genteel charm of Kamakura while filtering out its more touristy spots; his pristine visuals enhanced by an elegant color palette of blue gray and olive has none of the artificial glossiness suggested by his long career in commercials. However some of the framing notably the sisters upright poses and profile shots strain to reference Ozus compositions. Kore-edas professed homage to the master of family drama (a longtime Kamakura resident) feels a little superficial compared with ""Still Walking"" which captures Ozus spirit rather than rigidly adhering to his technique.
