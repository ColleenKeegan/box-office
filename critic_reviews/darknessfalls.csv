Forty years ago a group of children were brought to a country cottage where they were subjected to a brutal ritual something or other at the hands of evil adults who had a master plan to do...something. Terrified yet? We know that the house is haunted because the family whos just moved in has to deal with the lights always flickering out. They should have called the movie The Fuse Box Horror. Darkness was clearly tossed together like salad in the editing room since its little more than the sum of its unshocking shock cuts. As the mom in distress Lena Olin trying on an American accent looks ready to star in some radical spin-off of Desperate Housewives where the characters are actually allowed more than one facial crease and idiosyncrasy apiece.

Comments Darkness Falls This idiot horror movie has the earmarks of a disastrous shoot patched up in editing It begins with not one but two prologues; one character turns up out of nowhere his introduction no doubt left on the cutting-room floor; and the paltry 85-minute running time includes 15 minutes of end credits. An old woman lynched by her neighbors in 1840 returns as the ""Tooth Fairy"" terrorizing children on the night they lose their last baby teeth. Jonathan Liebesman directed his first feature from a script by John Fasano James Vanderbilt and Joe Harris; with Chaney Kley Emma Caulfield and Lee Cormie. By J.R.

"Darkness Fails washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Darkness Fails Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday January 24 2003 ""Darkness Falls."" Oy how it falls. A horror thriller that makes audiences jumpy not with genuine suspense but with big in-your-face whomps of sound and visual shocks it falls prey to predictability preposterousness and a hectic pace. It falls way behind such obvious inspirations as ""Scream"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" And it falls firmly under the categorical heading of B-minus movies -- not good enough to qualify as classic Gothic horror not nearly fun enough to qualify as great B-movie camp. Set in the fictional town of Darkness Falls Maine (played in the film by various coastal locations in Australia) the film opens with a creepy expository prelude during which a narrator explains that in the 19th century a woman was wrongly hanged for abducting two boys and ever since has haunted the town snatching children as soon as they lose their last baby tooth. One who escaped her talonlike clutches was Kyle Walsh who as a 10-year-old came shockingly close to the keening banshee. Most of ""Darkness Falls"" transpires 20 years later when the still-traumatized Kyle (Chaney Kley) returns to his home town to help his childhood best friend (Emma Caulfield) and her little brother (Lee Cormie) cope with the boys fear of the dark. Of course Kyle knows that the fear is entirely justified -- he doesnt go anywhere without an arsenal of flashlights -- and as the body count rises in ""Darkness Falls"" the entire town comes to realize that he isnt the lunatic the folks took him for. Taking a page from the aforementioned ""Blair Witch Project"" director Jonathan Liebesman stages much of the action in the spooky woods on the outskirts of town where a formless moaning wraith swoops down from the trees to claw up her prey -- now apparently extended to adults. But where ""Blair Witch"" succeeded -- by keeping the witch tantalizingly out of view -- ""Darkness"" fails as Liebesman chooses to show more and more of the monster who with every sighting becomes that much less terrifying. Liebesmans cast of virtually unknown actors do their best to retain their dignity even as they play second banana to the films special effects bombastic musical score and a creature designed by master makeup artist Stan Winston. Kley especially deserves sympathy for having to participate in such verbal pas de deux as ""The police are dead."" ""All of them?"" ""Pretty much."" Delivering its whammies at an average of every six minutes ""Darkness Falls"" is nothing if not efficient. Filmgoers addicted to the peculiar adrenaline rush of being clonked over the head with loud jarring noises and furiously edited images may find its just the ticket in times that presumably just arent scary enough. But viewers are more likely to emerge from ""Darkness Falls"" muttering the same thing as one of the storys gruesomely dispatched characters ""All this over a [expletive] tooth."" Darkness Falls (85 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for disturbing images and vulgar language.

Its up to a grown orphan (the justly little-known Chaney Kley) whose mother was slaughtered by the creature and his childhood sweetheart (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""s vapid Emma Caulfield) to extract the evil force from town. Director Jonathan Liebesman confuses scaring the audience with simply startling them. Every shock is accompanied by a loud crash - and telegraphed by having the victim utter some quasi-ironic line like ""See theres nothing to be afraid of."" Oh but there is.

Police drama meets monster movie in ""Patlabor WXIII"" an animated film that centers around -- it is Japanese after all -- giant robots. FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery DARKNESS FALLS Horror. Starring Chaney Kley  Emma Caulfield . Directed by Jonathan Liebesman . (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Tooth Fairy has to be the most beneficent and least controversial of childhood legends. Of no particular religious affiliation shes simply a generous spirit who replaces gnarly baby teeth with shiny coins. The dumb horror movie ""Darkness Falls"" has the bad taste to turn the Tooth Fairy into a killing machine -- the ghost of an old woman extracting revenge for her wrongful hanging 150 years ago. She terrorizes the cheerily named town of Darkness Falls where doctors are stumped when a little boy has night terrors. ""Did Michael recently lose a tooth?"" asks a troubled young man (Chaney Kley) whos been summoned by the boys sister (Emma Caulfield from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") to help solve the mystery. Instead of keeping on the lights and curling up next to the boy at home the sister who for unexplained reasons is in charge of the kid has put him in a dreary hospital straight out of ""Frances."" The doctors want to put the boy in an isolation tank(?) but the young man whose mother was killed by the Fairy knows the spook only strikes in darkness. Thus ensues a tiresome parade of dropped flashlights extinguished lanterns and finally -- you guessed it -- a blackout. Announcing her presence with a phlegmy wheeze the Fairy strikes swiftly and sometimes even scarily thanks to Stan Winstons ace special effects. But the movies premise -- that she attacks when the lights go out -- telegraphs her appearances and eliminates suspense. Lights out she kills. Over and over. Kley who resembles Mark Wahlberg shows some talent in his movie debut. Exuding a haunted determination he achieves the near impossible creating a believable character in a schlock horror film. . This film contains scenes of terror raw language. -- Carla Meyer BLACKBOARDS Drama. Starring Said Mohamadi Bahman Ghobadi. Directed by Samira Makhmalbaf. Written by Samira Makhmalbaf and Mohsen Makhmalbaf. (Not rated. In Kurdish with English subtitles. 85 minutes. At Opera Plaza and Shattuck in Berkeley.) . In the slyly powerful Iranian film ""Blackboards"" unemployed Kurdish schoolteachers find multiple uses for the tools of their trade -- portable blackboards. They carry sick people on them employ them as shields from Iraqi gunfire and sometimes even use them to teach. Director Samira Makhmalbafs seriocomic approach to a harrowing situation -- that of inundated Kurds living in the rugged terrain along the Iran-Iraq border -- yields a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope. Makhmalbaf daughter of director Mohsen Makhmalbaf (""Kandahar"") also elicits engaging performances from her two leads Said Mohamadi and Bahman Ghobadi. Teachers Said (Mohamadi) and Reeboir (Ghobadi) toting wooden blackboards on their backs take different paths to search for pupils. Said finds a group of old men displaced from their border homeland and left to wander and Reeboir falls in with some boys who act as ""mules"" for contraband goods. Neither situation is ideal obviously but instead of taking on the larger Kurdish crisis Makhmalbaf who wrote the script with her father shows pockets of Kurds finding purpose in an impossible situation. The nomads for instance want to marry off the daughter of an ailing man so he can die happy. Saids blackboard finds yet another use as a dowry for the daughter. Their hastily arranged marriage the kind that springs from desperation and knowing time is limited provides some warm comic moments. The nomads build a shelter on a mountain ridge to allow the couple to consummate their marriage. Director Makhmalbaf teases the setup showing the older men distract the womans child with a game and then returning to the love nest where a fully clothed Said is trying to teach his bride to write ""I love you."" As Said Mohamadi beams self-confidence imbuing his character with the purposeful bearing required of a man who has to ingratiate himself with strangers in order to eat. Ghobadi who wrote and directed ""A Time for Drunken Horses"" lends a similar forthrightness to Reeboir who bargains with the boys to get them to learn. Its fine to be smugglers he tells them but they should learn math so they wont get cheated. His enthusiasm rubs off on at least one boy who practices rolling his ""rs"" even as gunfire crackles around him. -- Carla Meyer PATLABOR WXIII Animation. Directed by Fumihiko Takayama. Written by Tori-Miki. (R. In Japanese with English subtitles. 100 minutes. At the Galaxy.) . A weird thing happens about a third of the way through ""Patlabor WXIII"" an animated movie from Japan. A giant people eater shows up and immediately transforms what had been a moody involving police drama into a cheesy monster movie. Its not just the monsters presence thats disconcerting but how the thing is rendered. Shadowy and thinly drawn the dragonlike figure seems entirely fake. Its like those moments in ""The Two Towers"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" when the action looks too digitally enhanced. Only this tale of giant robots is completely animated with some of its animation literally more distinguished than the rest. The anemic-looking monster is at odds with the vividly drawn backdrops of Tokyo Bay that lend the movie a liquidly ominous feel. Two detectives are investigating why the robots built to move earth and fight the rising tide of the bay have been getting into deadly accidents. One detective is a crusty vet the other a younger man -- mismatched ""types"" familiar from TV cop shows. But ""Patlabor"" animators and director Fumihiko Takayama give the pair such nuanced physical attributes -- a bouncy gait for the young man fatherly concern on the face of the curmudgeon -- that their fates matter when the monster comes after them. ""Patlabor"" follows the Japanese tradition of humanizing movie monsters this time in a rather disturbing way. The monster which masquerades as a robot is actually a biological weapon created using quickly duplicating cancer cells from a little girl. Unfortunately the picture tips off the perpetrator too early robbing the audience of a sense of justice when the culprit fesses up. . This movie contains violence raw language. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 6 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 9 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 10 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Family to sue Oakland over mans fatal shooting by police Police Vallejo woman run over by man who stole her car Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed Apple CEO to host fundraiser for Hillary Clinton E.

Even though its conspicuous lack of full-bore gore may disappoint many genre fans ""Darkness Falls"" could click with ticket buyers who prefer some restraint in their scary stories. Its an instantly disposable and shamelessly derivative piece of work -- call it petit guignol and you wont be far off the mark -- but first-time feature helmer Jonathan Liebesman shows a savvy flair for atmospheric visuals. Unrestrictive PG-13 rating should allow for beaucoup teen date biz during opening weekend. Expect even more impressive biz once pic starts to haunt vidstore shelves. Artfully minimalist intro sets spooky mood with clever commingling of narration flames and shadow-streaked photos. More than 150 years ago in the New England town of Darkness Falls a kindly old woman named Matilda Dixon offered gold coins to children who would give her their baby teeth. Naturally her beneficence earned her the nickname of ""Tooth Fairy."" After a terrible conflagration in her home however Matilda became a recluse hiding her fire-scarred face behind a white porcelain mask. And when two local children vanished one evening the unfortunate widow was wrongly blamed for their disappearance and lynched by an angry mob. With her dying breath she left a curse on Darkness Falls. Liebesman smoothly segues from exposition to suspenseful prologue as young Kyle Walsh (Joshua Anderson) learns the hard way that local legends about a murderous Tooth Fairy are all too true. The terrified youngster watches helplessly as Matilda swooping down from the darkness like a mammoth bird of prey pounces upon his mother. Unfortunately the cops dont believe in ghosts -- despite a long history of unsolved child murders in the area -- so Kyle is blamed for his moms demise. Twelve years later pic intros grownup Kyle (Chaney Kley) as a skittish paranoid who barely keeps himself together with strong medication. Mindful that Matilda will never venture out except in darkness and can in fact be repelled with any kind of illumination he keeps his Las Vegas apartment stocked with dozens of flashlights hundreds of batteries and scores of emergency backup lamps. (Pic does nothing with provocative idea that the neon-lit 24/7 razzle-dazzle of Vegas would be a godsend for someone afraid of the dark.) But Kyle must return to the scene of the crime when Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) his childhood sweetheart tells him that Michael (Lee Cormie) her 9-year-old brother is having the same sort of nightmares Kyle used to have Specifically nightmares about a wraith-like figure in a white mask that hovers over his bed. Not surprisingly Michael is afraid of the dark. Trouble is the doctors treating him fail to realize his fears are justified. Working from a script by James Vanderbilt Joe Harris and producer John Fasano Liebesman does a reasonably efficient job of maintaining a brisk pace -- the movie is scarcely 75 minutes long plus 10 minutes of extended credits -- while hitting all the predictable plot points and scoring a few cheap scares. Few cliches are left unturned -- chase sequences through dark corridors of an oddly underpopulated hospital appear to be lifted from ""Halloween II"" and dozens of similar pics -- and yes quite a few prove effective in this context. Overall though ""Darkness Falls"" is creepiest when it relies on the power of suggestion to thrill and chill. Liebesman wisely refrains from giving aud a clear view of the Tooth Fairy until the very end preferring to offer only fleeting glimpses of the vengeful phantasm as it stalks anyone who makes the mistake of looking at it. Best scene is a frantic police station shootout involving an initially incredulous deputy (Sullivan Stapleton) who becomes a believer in wide-awake nightmares. In his first major film role Kley scores strong impact with sympathetic portrayal of profoundly spooked-out Kyle while moppet thesp Cormie is credibly terrified. Pay close attention to Cormie and a few other supporting players however and youll note tell-tale vocal clues that pic was shot in Australia -- with largely Aussie cast -- and not in New England. Cinematographer Dan Laustsen and production designer George Liddle greatly enhance the overall mood of dread. Finale in long-abandoned lighthouse is somewhat muddled by hysterical quick-cutting but climactic f/x extravaganza -- including an aptly grisly Tooth Fairy designed and created by Stan Winston Studio -- is mildly impressive. Ironic coda represents admirable attempt to tweak genre conventions but falls flat.

Better Keep the Light On By STEPHEN HOLDEN Published January 24 2003 arkness Falls"" is an efficient little horror movie that doesnt waste its time getting down to business. About as scary as a ride on a minor roller coaster it unrolls its amplified butcher-block shock effects within the first five minutes. (The opening salvo of course is a false alarm.) From here those familiar metallic blows suggesting an electronic meat cleaver hacking away at your ears pierce the soundtrack with a metronomic regularity and with diminishing dramatic returns. Their overabundance is intended to compensate for a deliberate sparseness of gore. Although the movie has a fairly high body count it has so little blood to show for it that the film which opens nationwide today has earned a mild PG-13 rating. The efficient pace of the movie directed by Jonathan Liebesman is established early in the film when a mother reassures her frightened 10-year-old son that theres nothing to be afraid of and is proven wrong within two seconds. The attacker weve learned in an unctuous prologue is the avenging ghost of Matilda Dixon a kindly old woman who was unjustly blamed for the disappearance of two children more than 150 years earlier in Darkness Falls a New England town. The day after she was hanged by a mob of angry townspeople the missing children were discovered unharmed. With her dying breath Matilda put a curse on Darkness Falls. The movies cleverest notion is its demonization of a benign childhood phantom. Before Matildas face was hideously disfigured in a fire she was known around town as the Tooth Fairy because she passed out gold coins to children when they lost their baby teeth. After the fire she became a reclusive pariah hiding behind a porcelain mask. Now when the children of Darkness Falls lose their baby teeth the screeching airborne hag returns to enforce her curse. Anyone who sees behind the mask is doomed. Her preferred method of disposal is to scoop up and murder a victim in midair then drop the body back to the ground. But once her ire is provoked anyone who stands in her way is in danger and that includes the entire local police force. As the drama escalates ""Darkness Falls"" turns into a prolonged hissy fit. The only defense against Matilda is light. Twelve years after witnessing the death of his mother Kyle (Chaney Kley) who was blamed for her murder and spent nine years in a mental hospital has succeeded in staying alive by surrounding himself with electric light. He is summoned back to the town by his childhood sweetheart Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) whose younger brother Michael (Lee Cormie) is also psychotically obsessed with staying in the light. Michael who has just lost his last baby tooth knows hes a goner should the lights go out but no one believes him. Inevitably the electric power in Darkness Falls fails. At this point the movie becomes a fantasy about the unreliability of flashlights. Theyre forever being dropped or mysteriously malfunctioning just as Matilda is about to fly into the room. The fury culminates in (where else?) a lighthouse. The movies one genuinely scary moment has nothing to do with conventional shock effects or with the anticlimactic appearance of Matilda without her mask. (Its just another ravaged zombielike face.) It arrives when a pompous psychiatrist who has come up with a fancy name for Michaels distress decrees that the best therapy would be a sensory-deprivation session. As the boy is injected with a tranquilizer and strapped down on a bed that is wheeled toward a shadowy chamber that resembles the inside of a giant vacuum cleaner the movie evokes the terrifying prospect of a child subjected to physical torture while traumatized by claustrophobia. ""Darkness Falls"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of violence but most of them take place in semi-darkness.
