This is a brave voiceover with which to open a movie that consists of two-and-a-half hours of almost nonstop violence injury and privation. In context it serves as a fathers comforting words to his son. But it could as easily represent a filmmakers warning to his audience.Fortunately while Alejandro G. Inarritus The Revenant is frequently a grueling experience it is also a profoundly rewarding one a film that balances beauty and brutality in extraordinary equipoise. Related Story The Hateful Eight Is a Gory Epic in Search of Meaning Based on the 2002 novel by Michael Punke (itself based on the experiences of the real-life fur trapper Hugh Glass) the movie tells a primal story of survival and vengeance. In 1823 a large hunting party is on the verge of completing its six-month mission in the wintry wildernesses of Montana and South Dakota when its set upon by a band of warriors from the Ree tribe. After most of the men are killed in the encounter those remaining ask their experienced tracker Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) to guide them safely back to their barracks outpost.Glass however is soon mauled by a bear and though he manages to kill the animal hes direly wounded--his throat slashed open and his back torn to ribbons. Presuming his imminent death the leader of the expedition Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) leaves him behind with three men to bury him when the time comes Glasss half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck); another young hunter Jim Bridger (Will Poulter); and an older man John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) with mercenary motives and no love for Glass. In short order Fitzgerald kills Hawk and tricks Bridger into leaving Glass for dead.But Glass does not die. He rises from his shallow grave and like Hercules with the Nemean lion wraps himself in the pelt of his bear. He then crawls floats and hobbles across hundreds of frozen desolate miles in a quest to find Fitzgerald and avenge his son. Along the way hes hounded by hostile natives (more than once) tumbles down cliffs (more than once) and faces death by starvation and exposure (more or less continuously).From this simple tale Inarritu has constructed an epic fable of uncommon grace and resonance a film that like its hero achieves a kind of transcendence. The director is immeasurably aided in this achievement by his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Shooting exclusively with natural light Inarritu and Lubezki craft a winter landscape at once pitiless and ravishing a universe of muted grays gray skies gray snow gray rock. (If these vistas recall Terrence Malick its no coincidence Lubezki shot the directors last four films.)As with Lubezkis last two major projects Gravity and Birdman this isnt merely an aesthetic achievement but a technical one as well. The attack that opens the film is a tour de force of action choreography with tracking shots reminiscent of Lubezkis work on Children of Men. And the bear attack is a complete stunner without any true parallel that I can name. Moreover the demands of weather and natural light forced principal photography to take place in a dozen locations in Canada Argentina and the United States and a number of crew members quit or were fired over the course of the grueling shoot. The resulting film however has made Lubezki the odds-on favorite to win an unprecedented third consecutive Oscar for cinematography.Hardy is marvelous as Fitzgerald a self-justifying brute of a man with twitchy eyes and deep scars (some of them literal Hes the survivor of an incomplete scalping). As hes done in the past Hardy vanishes utterly into the role; those unaware of his participation in the film might struggle even to recognize him.Inarritu has constructed an epic fable of uncommon grace and resonance a film that like its hero achieves a kind of transcendence.And Leo? He is a more complicated case. Hes surely worthy of the many accolades that are being thrown his way. But Im not certain how much of his work onscreen--and he is present in nearly every scene--is properly categorized as ""acting."" DiCaprios commitment to the role is beyond dispute. The actor spent nine months in remote locales in the snow and in icy water frequently on the verge of hypothermia. He is completely persuasive in the role but perhaps this is in part because onscreen he is enduring--obviously in lesser ways--the travails endured by Glass. Factor in that his character is largely mute throughout the film and that the emotions he conveys are inevitably both large in scale and limited in variety and I am again unsure of how exactly to categorize the performance. It is however unquestionably a powerful one.The Revenant is not without its flaws. Though there are intimations of moral complexity and ambiguity early on they are abandoned in favor of disappointing dichotomies Characters are gradually sorted into the uniformly kind tolerant and trustworthy on one side; and the lying venal and bigoted on the other.And then there is its length. As stunning and immersive as The Revenant may be 156 minutes is a long time for viewers to endure a portrait of endurance. (After all that has come before it the movies final bloody confrontation veers dangerously close to comedy.) Inarritus film is one very much worth seeing but be forewarned You--like DiCaprio and like the real Glass before him--will be out in the cold for a long time.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

And even if -- through some astonishing combination of luck pluck superior firepower and emergency medicine -- you manage to survive the attack you will be scarred by the experience. This is quite literally nature red in tooth and claw. (Nature in the rest of the film is mostly white in ice and snow perhaps less deadly but just as hostile and rendered with impassive majesty by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.) It isnt long before Glass finds himself in the role of the bear fiercely stalking the skulking sonofabitch Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who got too near to his own boy -- even as he struggles to survive. The journey is long and painstaking the better to give you a sense of just what is being opposed to what. As Glass heals he progresses from a moaning crawling beast to a cunning horseman man rising to mastery over nature by wits and will. But eventually a man comes up against his humanity his power to choose to plunge into the savage world of urge and instinct or to step outside and dwell -- however briefly however painfully -- in some more rarefied realm. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 08 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 08 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu Written by Mark L. Smith and Alejandro G. Inarritu Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy and Will Poulter Classification 14A Year 2015 Country USA Language English In 1823 the American frontiersman Hugh Glass was working as a trapper and guide with the Rocky Mountain Fur Co. on the Upper Missouri when he was attacked by a grizzly and viciously mauled. Assuming he would succumb to his wounds the party left him behind with two companions who were to bury his body when the seemingly inevitable transpired. Instead they stole his kit and his gun and left him to die. But Glass survived and crawled 320 kilometres on a broken leg across what is now South Dakota to retrieve his belongings and take his revenge. Believe it or not the difficulty in turning that true story into art is that it lacks drama. Specifically it lacks a strong through-line for the amazingly resilient Glass since its unclear whether he was mainly motivated by the theft or by the abandonment; Michael Punkes 2002 novel The Revenant a surprisingly flat fictionalization of Glasss feat may leave readers scratching their heads as to how a story so remarkable could prove so anticlimactic.What is needed here is some professional myth-making and who better to provide that than Hollywood? The Revenant Alejandro G. Inarritus powerful follow-up to last years Oscar-winning Birdman is an admirable exercise in cinematic storytelling strategically scripted by the director and his co-writer Mark L. Smith movingly performed by Leonardo DiCaprio and magnificently filmed by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.Inarritu and Smith have made many changes to Punkes speculative but more-or-less historical account of Glasss revenge but the most significant is this Here Glass has had a native American wife (she is dead and shown occasionally in flashback) and he is accompanied on the fateful trapping expedition by his half-Pawnee son. To abandon him his colleagues have to murder the teenage boy first.And so the good guys and the bad guys are clearly delineated in this movie. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy makes him powerfully unrepentant) is not merely a thief hes also a murderer; the young and much-coerced James Bridger (the wonderfully gawky Will Poulter) is an accessory after the fact forced to follow Fitzgerald or get left behind himself. (Bridger became a well-known mountain man in his own right; exactly which men were left to tend Glass is a subject of some debate among historians.) Most importantly in Inarritus version Glass is not some crazed obsessive risking his miraculously preserved life just to retrieve his gun but rather a justifiably vengeful father.Although much of The Revenant was actually shot in British Columbia and Alberta the film follows that vengeful father across the vast landscapes of the American West and finds its integrity in depicting the grandeur of the land and the harshness of living on it. From the opening shot of a forest weirdly submerged in a river of flowing water to a remarkable scene where Glass stumbles upon a bison herd The Revenant is visually breathtaking thanks to Lubezkis cinematography. Reportedly Inarritu insisted on shooting most of the film in natural light and the payoff is a remarkable naturalism both hard and sweeping.Another intriguing aspect of the film is its depiction of the indigenous people divided into various competing tribes sometimes viciously attacking each other and the Europeans sometimes happy to engage in peaceful trade. The Americans mainly shoot first and ask questions later and Glasss uniquely sympathetic interactions with aboriginal characters seem more a function of making him a likeable figure than of crafting a believable depiction of his milieu.Meanwhile the wily French traders are more interested in conducting business with the natives - or enslaving their women. It would seem theres more than a few cultural stereotypes there but its a testament to Inarritus film that they never overwhelm his depiction of the complex and varying relationships between aboriginal and European.And then theres the issue of whether the Oscar-less DiCaprio will finally get his Academy Award for this role. He deserves it. Glasss throat is mauled by the bear so he cant speak and he spends most of the film alone DiCaprio is called on to depict the mans desperation grief and searing anger almost entirely through his eyes and he does it with remarkable depth turning Glasss endurance into a steadfastness both physical and emotional.Still the film is imperfect. Occasionally Inarritu as though indulging the manifest talents of his cinematographer creates scenes where Glasss survival in the midst of this dangerous land is so improbable a viewer has to laugh. DiCaprio has many mighty moments here; he also has one or two near-misses that are worthy of the Road Runner.Finally there is the puzzling ending in which the director who has laboured so successfully to create the unrelenting hardness of this piece seems uncertain how to extract himself from Glasss bloodthirsty quest. Inarritu is Mexican Perhaps even as he positions himself for another Oscar nomination he is still enough of an outsider to Hollywood to be sensitive to its potentially abusive cultural power as it elevates heroes and banishes villains. Certainly he declines to resolve the dramatic conundrum that is the revenge of Hugh Glass.

That means that this version of the story with Leonardo DiCaprio emerging as a slam-dunk to earn a best actor Oscar nomination for his guts-out performance as Glass is actually as much a fiction as much as it is fact. But no one should ever see a feature film thinking that it will be an absolutely authentic representation of anything from history. If it is a strong ""spiritual"" representation -- with a realistic setting proper period dialogue accurate costuming and naturalistic performances -- then that is the best we can and should ask for. In that case The Revenant is a stunning piece of cinema because it offers all those qualities. The only reason that I am not ranking it even higher is that the brutal bloody violence -- however real that might be for a depiction of lawless frontier life of the 1820s -- will drive some viewers out of the theatre squirming in discomfort and emotional pain. Yes it is that excessive in particular in its disturbing and not wholly satisfying climax. That said there is so much to like and admire and study closely including DiCaprios mature committed ruthless and yet empathetic performance. In addition the technical achievements are remarkable. This includes Emmanuel Lubezkis raw cinematography shooting exclusively with natural light mostly on locations in western Canada during short winter days. Other scenes were filmed in the U.S. and -- for the climax after the snow had melted in British Columbia -- in southern Argentina. The Revenant is the latest American film from Mexican-born filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who personally won three Oscars for his work on Birdman and saw his masterwork win the top Academy Award as best picture of 2015. I doubt if The Revenant will repeat the shocking and wonderful triumph of Birdman. But it certainly will be nominated as best picture and many other cast and crew will be honoured with noms too DiCaprio not least among them. The saga of Hugh Glass has been explored repeatedly in the past. This film is based on the historic fiction The Revenant written by Michael Punke and published in 2002. Inarritu and Mark L. Smith are credited with co-authoring the screenplay. In this version Glass does get attacked and nearly killed by a grizzly bear during a fur trapping expedition. That part is true. So are many details of the harrowing account of his survival and desire for revenge against the men who left him for dead. Much of the rest of the film including his dead First Nations wife his mixed-blood son and that youths fate and the surreal flashback scenes that Inarritu uses to heighten The Revenant into a magic realism reverie are pure fiction and creative cinema. Glass represents a kind of progressive frontier man. His primary opponent fellow trapper Thomas Fitzpatrick represents the old order. He is racist selfish uneducated brutish and a killer at least as depicted here. Tom Hardy in yet another of his stirring transformations plays him unsparingly. Will Poulters youthful work as future frontier legend Jim Bridger is our way inside the drama. One of the fascinating parts of The Revenant is the depiction of First Nations people. Unlike their appearances in the Hollywood movies of old these varied peoples are shown neither as murderous vermin nor as noble savages. Instead they are accorded the same complexities with the same range of human emotions and qualities as other peoples in the story. The difference is as significant scenes demonstrate the French and Euro-American trappers are the invaders and the First Nations people are defending their territories and natural resources. Inarritu shows what one chapter in that struggle might have been like with iconic Hugh Glass caught in the midst of the violent madness as he crawls out of his grave.

Comments click to enlarge The Revenant Recommended Video Rated R  156 minutes  2016 Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is the nominal director of The Revenant a historical drama set in the American wilderness of the early 19th century but the movie doesnt resemble any of his previous work. Prior to his Oscar-winning Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) his films--Amores Perros (2000) 21 Grams (2003) Babel (2006) Biutiful (2010)--were unbearably dour and self-important with gimmicky overlapping plots filmmaking techniques cribbed from Steven Soderbergh and a message that boiled down to ""its a small world after all."" By contrast the world portrayed in The Revenant is gigantic vast landscapes mile-high trees and infinite horizons. But the auteur of that vision isnt Inarritu--its cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.

"The Revenant revenge epic chills the very soul review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Revenant revenge epic chills the very soul reviewOscar-worthy performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy enliven The Revenant a wilderness revenge saga thatseeps into the soul like the coldest chill ever experienced. Leonardo DiCaprio is Hugh Glass in The Revenant.  (Twentieth Century Fox)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 7 2016The Revenant Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter. Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu. At GTA theatres. 156 minutes. 14AThe Revenant seeps into the soul like the coldest chill ever experienced.This wilderness revenge epic featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy in Oscar-worthy performances as mortal combatants across the frozen American frontier doesnt require a giant-sized or 3D-enhanced screen to make an impact.Article Continued BelowAn extra sweater might help though since you feel this most elemental of films as much as watch it. Alejandro G. Inarritu (Birdman) directs with brutal grace using phases of the moon to mark the passage of time on a screen that cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki fills with trees snow blood and the tortured progress of a man presumed dead.This is the wildest west of 1823 long before the cowboys and before maps and laws claimed total control of the land and its native inhabitants. White men are a minority on these Great Plains (B.C. Alberta and Argentina supply the screen vistas). They are mostly fur trappers like Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) and John Fitzgerald (Hardy) who risk death from the elements or Arikara tribe arrows to collect the pelts they sell to European traders.This latter threat jolt-starts the narrative which Inarritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith loosely base on historical fact and Michael Punkes 2002 novel of the same name. Arikara warriors ambush a hunting party along the Upper Missouri River led by Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) whose belief in civilization seems at odds with his environment and this bloody assault which greatly reduces his ranks.The survivors include two clean-shaven rookies Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) the teenage son Glass had with a Pawnee wife (Grace Dove seen in Malickian flashbacks); and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) another teen whose loyalties will be tested.The land favours the bearded and the brusque men like seasoned woodsman Glass and greedy grifter Fitzgerald whom DiCaprio and Hardy invest with a realism born of raw skill and a gruelling film shoot. These two men warily share the common capitalist cause until Glass is left near death by a grizzly bear defending her cubs in a forest attack that makes for astonishing (and excruciating) viewing. Here the revenge part of the story begins and plot summation must cease but so must our standard definition of ""savages"" the epithet the white men hurl at the rightful inhabitants of the land.Who are the real barbarians the men defending their homes and families or the ones stripping the land for heedless profit? An icy wind howls the answer across the blood-soaked plain.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Revenant"" is not just a visually arresting emotionally jolting film it is an important one. With significant tragedy and thrilling drama it offers the kind of bold risky unconventional filmmaking that Americas movie industry has all but abandoned. A brooding western on an epic scale it surely will be ranked as one of the great films of this decade. It is impeccably directed by the Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu a filmmaker with a flair for making imaginative structurally complex sagas following the somber quartet ""Amores Perros"" ""21 Grams"" ""Babel"" and ""Biutiful"" with last years best picture ""Birdman."" Neither he nor his versatile star Leonardo DiCaprio have been attached to a project this close to an elemental action adventure story. To re-create the brutal frontier life of 1823 with a sense of absolute truth they avoided digital artifice. They filmed exclusively in natural light almost entirely outdoors in ice and Arctic cold creating an astonishing work of magical realism. At times it almost feels like some impossibly discovered film from a period before filming existed an earth-scorching artifact of an icebound hell. Emmanuel Lubezkis breathtaking cinematography shows each player dwarfed by towering trees scaling soaring cliffs merging landscape and character with unforgettable tension. It turns warlike attacks by natives against the white men trespassing on their land into muscular battles unequaled since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Singular talents working as a team pushed further than they have ever been pushed the filmmakers prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that no genre is beyond their mastery. ""The Revenant"" is loosely inspired by Michael Punkes fact-based novel about legendary frontier guide Hugh Glass. While leading a fur companys trappers across the Northwest he was savagely injured by a grizzly. Two members were assigned extra pay to stay at his side help him recover if he could or provide a decent burial. 20th Century Fox DF-05287R n Leonardo DiCaprio stars as legendary explorer Hugh Glass. Astonished that the bloodied Glass could breathe at all the bodyguards soon left him for dead in the wilderness. Without rations or weapons Glass clawed his way inexorably across the subzero no mans land for weeks in obsessive pursuit of the ones who abandoned him. DiCaprio creates his prairie Captain Ahab through a hauntingly spare performance with a dark emotional core. He has made many movies before this but here we see the full power of his presence for the first time. He projects a stoicism and near-silent strength that feels natural to a frontier milieu a rock-hard force that will not deviate from its determined course. Nothing will stop him not horrible wounds hypothermia or near-starvation. His desire to survive is driven by vengeance. His main adversary is a tough mercenary type (played with wonderful blustery soliloquies by Tom Hardy) who takes one look at the ravaged Glass and sees a corpse in the making. Hardy projects the mans hubris without melodramatic exaggeration. His self-importance is there from the start the lies growing as circumstances change and he refuses to admit his treachery. Will Poulter is perfectly cast as his callow young cohort wrestling with credible naivete and regret. Every character has his damning blind spots. The film is far more than a survival story about human endurance. We seem to be witnesses to an impressionistic vision of the past. It echoes the biblical message that we brought nothing into this world and we can take nothing out of it. The urgency of Glass quest the likelihood that he will find his enemies and the rightness of his goal may all be entirely in his mind. Many westerns build toward a showdown but few are so wise about the limited value of revenge. The men here have no philosophical outlook about the correctness of seized land and resources only survival skills with guns and hatchets and horses. One fascinating detail is the number of non-Caucasian players in the cast. While none get a major speaking role their presence alone separates ""The Revenant"" from traditional westerns which tend to divide into simplistic rival teams of cowboys and Indians. Nor does the Fort Kiowa settlement where the trappers retreat from cold and marauding natives resemble the usual shelter. Its crudely uncivilized mud-grimy and ramshackle at best an impermanent foundation against primeval forces. ""The Revenant"" is a comment about the western and the Old West as it really was about newborn America and aggressive capitalism about community and strong-arm violence life and afterlife. Characters die as everybody does few of them with dignity. The novels title a synonym for ghost refers to Glass return from the abyss. Co-writing the screenplay Inarritu has created a pessimistic film about the fragility of community truth civilization and well everything. He introduces plot devices giving Glass a Native American wife and young son whose spirits hover in his recollection. ""The Revenant"" will burrow into many viewers memories as well. Its strengths arent narrative or intellectual so much as emotional what it makes us feel the visceral simplicity of great myth like Joseph Conrads ""Heart of Darkness."" It carries us to uncharted places that remain etched into our imagination as if we had watched something deeper than a fictionalized drama. On that level alone this is not just an excellent film it is an essential one. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Courtesy Twentieth Century Fox via AP) The Associated Press This photo provided by Twentieth Century Fox shows Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from the film ""The Revenant."" (Twentieth Century Fox via AP) If your goal is gathering beaver pelts in the 19th century you could hardly have a better guide than frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). A man of few words but formidable skills Glass knows his way around the Rockies. But even he has his limitations.Glass can do nothing to prevent a confrontation with a Pawnee tribe whose arrows more often than not find their targets. In short order the ground beneath the hunters and fur trappers is a horrifying mix of mud and blood. But Glass is less concerned with their survival than with the safety of his son a half-Pawnee teen named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).In such a harsh environment theres no shortage of potential enemies. One of them is a bear that Glass has the bad luck to stumble across. The other is trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) whos purely out for himself and takes a deep dislike to Glass and his son. Glasss encounter with the bear leads to game-changing circumstances that ultimately provide the frontiersman with justification to hunt Fitzgerald down. Only one of the two men is likely to come away alive. And considering his background and motivation most people would bet on Glass.Based in part on a novel by Michael Punke ""The Revenant"" may be too offbeat for some moviegoers. But those who welcome the challenge of something different will be rewarded with a film thats thrillingly visceral and thoroughly mesmerizing. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu (""Birdman"") delivers a tale of the American frontier thats boundlessly ambitious. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Mark L. Smith Inarritu drops us into a cold brutal unforgiving reality -- and makes the experience exhilarating. As Glass DiCaprio is determination personified -- and continents away from ""Titanic."" Its an uncompromising performance thats virtually guaranteed to snag an Oscar nomination.Boldly original ""The Revenant"" puts everything else playing at the multiplexes in the shade.What ""The Revenant""  Four stars out of four  Run time 236  Rating R  Content Violence sexual assault language nudity Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Joes St. Louis Leonardo DiCaprios 10 best performances Jan 6 2016 (...)

But at heart its a survival story.The stories of how difficult it was for the actors on the frigid set of ""The Revenant"" are already the stuff of Hollywood legend.(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars out of 5DiCaprio is intense certainly and may well win an Oscar but he has been betterInarritus film is beautiful on an epic scale but the story doesnt match the cinematographyMovies exist on the screen not in the stories written about them.Did Leonardo DiCaprio a fine and committed actor really betray his vegetarian beliefs to eat a real animal liver or kidney or whatever organ it is in ""The Revenant"" as a sign of his commitment to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus film?Who cares? Were props not available? Theres the famous maybe apocryphal story of Dustin Hoffman telling Laurence Olivier that he stayed up three days to prepare for a scene in ""Marathon Man"" and Olivier replying ""Why dont you just try acting?"" If eating raw meat helped DiCaprio fine. But does that kind of reality make ""The Revenant"" a better film?It does not.Things like the stunning cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki do. Along with yes DiCaprios performance which is intense and may well win him his first Oscar as the wags are predicting but really its not his best work. (See ""The Departed."") And there is the sheer force of the story survival against the odds that goes back to ""The Odyssey"" if not before told here on a massive scale. Director and co-writer Inarritu is aiming high with this film based on a true story -- and he never lets you forget it.AZCENTRAL2016 movie guide A preview of films opening January-AprilThe movie is set in the 1820s in the Great Plains; DiCaprios character Hugh Glass is hunting with others who like him are part of a fur company seeking pelts. The sequence is stunning icy water roiling and trees as high as forever mere men walking among them with rifles. But this gives way quickly to an even more awe-inspiring scene in which Native Americans attack the company drawing Glass and his companions back to camp to defend it. It is chaotic and horrifying and this being an Inarritu film done in a single unbroken shot (or at least made to look like it).Survivors including Glass and his son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) whose mother a Pawnee woman (Grace Dove seen in flashbacks) is dead scramble aboard a boat and head for safer ground -- ""safer"" being a relative term in these unforgiving parts.Among the group is John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a mercenary sort who wants his money period. Hardy is one of the two or three greatest actors working today but here his meanness is telegraphed not just by his vile actions but by his accent which he evidently based on Mr. Haney from the old ""Green Acres"" television show. (""Well Mr. Douglas. ..."") Hes more cartoon than character.John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) hunts for the man he left for dead in the wilderness in ""The Revenant."" (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)A bear attacks Glass in a brutal how-did-they-do-that scene and after slogging him around for a while the good-hearted but inexperienced leader of the expedition (Domhnall Gleeson) decides they must move on without Glass. They leave Fitzgerald Hawk and the young Bridger (Will Poulter) behind to give him a proper burial when the time comes.But Fitzgerald is impatient. One thing leads to another and next thing you know there is a filthy horribly wounded Glass lying in a shallow grave. But small details have been overlooked such as Hes not dead. The movie then becomes his Herculean effort not just to survive but to make it back to camp where he can face Fitzgerald and engage in a little frontier justice.AZCENTRALThe Revenant (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe trek will include jaw-dropping scenes of brutal beauty as well as unbelievably heroic scenes of survival on Glass part. Hes a backwoods superman evidently indestructible. One scene involving a horse a cliff and a big tree is straight out of Wile E. Coyote. If it werent so well made it would be ludicrous and sometimes it is anyway.But there is no denying that it is that well made. Inarritu makes beautiful often bleak films and ""The Revenant"" is no different. Its scale and ambition at times makes it seem like more than it is a survival story. Theres nothing wrong with that and its a good one. Its just not a whole lot more.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh In this bloody frostbitten winter at the movies at least The Hateful Eight has the luxury of sitting inside by the fire as its carnage unfolds. The Revenant by comparison is roughing it. The ravenously beautiful revenge saga from Alejandro GonzA!lez IA+-A!rritu plays like the meanest Jack London short story imaginable. Its thrills chill to the bone. This is not a movie you attend to feel better about the human condition or to leave the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Many of the humans are just as ruthless and indifferent as the films natural world which overshadows Leonardo DiCaprio as the star of the show. I cant think of a movie that dramatizes more viscerally or lyrically the extremes of winter and the animal instinct to survive. The year is 1823 and the bickering trappers of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company have seen better days. The movie opens with a stunning combat scene as a party of the Arikara tribe ambushes the frontiersmen and sets the brutality in motion. From the very start Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography gets jaws dropping with swirling but fluid camera movement and a mastery of open space and natural light. Lubezki won the cinematography Oscar last year for Birdman (and the year before that for Gravity). Here his eye is given free rein over some of the most majestic terrain ever captured on film. Then theres the bear. Basic summaries of The Revenant have gone something like this DiCaprio (playing the real-life trapper Hugh Glass) endures a grizzly bear mauling gets left for dead and embarks on a trail of revenge. The mauling itself is one of many ""How in the world did they film that?"" sequences in The Revenant. Its also surprisingly tender in its depiction of a powerful graceful mammal defending its young. Which doesnt change the fact that Glasss body is left with ravine-like gashes claw punctures and crushed bones. The man who leads the movement to leave Glass behind for the non-human animals is Fitzgerald a wily brute played by Tom Hardy with a lithesome swagger and Cajun-inflected cadences. Glass has a half-Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) and a deceased Pawnee wife. To Fitzgerald these attributes make him all the more expendable. The Revenant cast boasts several American Indian actors and Glass can be seen as a variation on Natty Bumppo the novelist James Fennimore Coopers prototypical ""man who knows Indians."" Based on the novel by Michael Punke The Revenant is ill-served by a recounting of plot devices; its a film that envelops you with a shudder. Much has been made of the arduous shoot most of it in a remote region of the Rocky Mountains near Calgary all of it done in sequence to capture the transition from tolerable autumn to deadly winter. None of that would matter if the movie didnt feel both authentic and otherworldly. As Glass crawls swims and staggers back to the companys fort we feel as if weve stumbled upon a lonely edge of the world. Even if The Revenant doesnt have the most human touch as some have argued it still commits with absolute conviction to forging a breathtaking movie universe from first shot to last. Its purely cinematic yet as elemental and timeless as an ancient myth.THE REVENANT (A-) Directed by Alejandro GonzA!lez IA+-A!rritu.

His companions then rob him and murder his young half-Native American son. Glass sets out on a 200-mile trek to get revenge. (20th Century Fox) Leonardo DiCaprio grunts wheezes crawls and brawls his way through an Oscar-caliber performance in a film designed as a monument to the greed venality and Darwinian aggression through which this country was forged. Its called ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and its available for viewing on a digital platform near you. As in that 2013 movie about a rapacious Wall Street executive DiCaprio delivers a commanding physically daunting turn in ""The Revenant"" as a man whose surpassing strengths and near-fatal flaws beg for larger allegorical meaning. Playing Hugh Glass a 19th-century trapper whos attacked by a grizzly and left for dead in the Missouri Territory DiCaprio seeks once and for all to push himself and his audience to the limit. Banishing all memories of the blue-eyed teen idol of ""Titanic"" he hides the baby face hes been cursed with into his 40s behind a fastidiously unpretty rictus of physical suffering and existential despair. [""The Revenant"" is turning Leonardo DiCaprio into a legend] Based on Michael Punkes novel about the real-life Glass -- who in 1823 was mauled by a bear then limped hundreds of miles to confront the men who abandoned him without food or supplies -- ""The Revenant"" takes an already larger-than-life story into the preposterous dimensions of a tall tale simultaneously inflating and reducing Glass to a Paul Bunyan-like figure of superhuman strength and stamina. But because this movie has been directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"") its not content with those outsize if simplistic contours. Punctuated by dreamy imagery and moments of arty transcendence ""The Revenant"" ultimately lacks the courage of its most voyeuristically barbarous even sadistic convictions. Its a death trip disguised as spiritual awakening its breathtaking sweep and scale belying an essential pettiness at its core. [Meet the author of ""The Revenant"" -- except you cant because of his federal job] [For ""Revenant"" filmmaker gore isnt the core of his movie] Admittedly even viewers who dont buy Inarritus ersatz depth will find themselves bowled over by the sheer aesthetic and technical firepower he throws at it. ""The Revenant"" opens with a magnificently filmed and choreographed fight scene during which a group of trappers is trapped by native Arikara fighters in a chaotic ambush every move captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki with startling fluidity and intimacy. Unfolding in a graceful mirroring of hand-to-hand combat the sequence possesses an unmistakable grandeur that Lubezki reprises throughout ""The Revenant"" whether Glass and his men are dwarfed by soaring spire-like trees imposing snow-covered mountain ranges or icy river gorges -- all of which they traverse mostly on foot. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as 19th-century trapper Hugh Glass in ""The Revenant."" After an Indian ambush and a bear attack the real-life Glass was left for dead by his fellow trappers. (Kimberley French/Twentieth Century Fox) Tom Hardy stars as trapper John Fitzgerald in director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus film. (Kimberley French/Twentieth Century Fox) Glasss story has been told before on film most notably by Richard Harris in the 1971 drama ""Man in the Wilderness."" But ""The Revenant"" shares DNA with a raft of other movies from the classic exploration adventure ""Black Robe"" and Terrence Malicks lyrical odes to the natural world to John Fords ""The Searchers"" whose narrative of captivity is turned on its head here in a subplot involving a Native American warrior searching for a daughter whos been kidnapped by a group of French trappers. Working with co-screenwriter Mark L. Smith Inarritu also sees fit to give Glass a Native American wife and mixed-race son who provide convenient emotional cover for a story that otherwise would have been propelled merely by that tried and true -- and tired and trite -- motivator revenge. The monumentality of ""The Revenant"" combined with DiCaprios bravura virtually wordless performance suggests a film thats About Something in this case mans inhumanity to man the brutality of Manifest Destiny the primal fight between honor and cowardice and the enduring power of the human spirit. Were meant to believe that Glass embodies the latter -- an assumption suggested by comparing him to a fellow trapper named Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy with drawling murderous venom) and underlined by daydreams in which Glass communes beatifically with the spirit of his absent wife (Grace Dove). Those helpful nudges notwithstanding the audience is less likely to care about where Glass stands on the ethical gray scale than to revel in what ""The Revenant"" ultimately seems to be about which is physical duress at its most agonizing and repellent. Thanks to Lubezkis stunning cinematography and Ryuichi Sakamotos hauntingly dispassionate score the fight thats most compelling throughout ""The Revenant"" is the one between the beauty of its cinema and the brutality of its tale. The much-heralded bear attack is indeed staged with panting slobbering bloodletting verisimilitude but in case that isnt excruciating enough Inarritu confects all manner of ways to make Glass suffer from cauterizing his own throat wound with a boiling slurry of buckshot and dirt to a stunt involving a horse that recalls Jack Londons snowy state of nature at its most pitilessly indifferent. In fact its at this moment in ""The Revenant"" -- when the story goes over a literal cliff -- that many viewers are likely to feel that the movie has gone off its own deep end entering an unforgiving territory of visceral shocks and hopelessly diminishing returns. This is when Inarritu seems less interested in telling a superbly crafted story than proving something about his own creative prowess which has been fetishized in recent interviews that recount the physical extremes he and his star suffered in the name of artistic commitment. Inarritu is so consumed by virtuosity that he makes it nearly impossible not to be impressed by ""The Revenant."" But thats not the same as being moved or even convinced by it -- just as the most savage spectacle of manly endurance doesnt automatically confer deeper meaning or moral weight. Despite the literal and figurative pains it takes to persuade viewers of its own importance ""The Revenant"" cant escape the clutches of crippling self-regard.

Tom Hardy plays villainous fur-trapper John Fitzgerald. Photo Associated Press Icy wilderness of The Revenant even better in cozy theater 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Lets start with the bear attack because its one of the most amazing spectacles of the movie year 2015. On its own its reason enough to see ""The Revenant"" and there are plenty of other reasons. For weeks there have been rumors that the scene shows Leonardo DiCaprio getting sexually assaulted by a bear. That does not happen. What happens is even worse. DiCaprio plays a fur trapper in 1820 out in the Northwest wilderness who thinks it might be a good idea to shoot a couple of bear cubs. He doesnt notice the enormous mama bear running up behind him until he turns around just as hes getting pounced on. What follows is a scene that delivers in a number of extreme and wonderfully conflicting ways. It is harrowing. It is technically remarkable because there is no doubt in any viewers mind that DiCaprio really does have a bear throwing him around and stepping on his head. It is a beautiful piece of bear-fight choreography -- its clear that serious thought went into how this fight would progress for maximum impact. Theres also just enough emotional distance for us to enjoy whats happening. The bear after all does have a point. And this distance allows us to notice and experience the scenes other great pleasure Its funny. Bears are so cute and cuddly that to see one go berserk on a guy particularly one who has it coming has a certain absurd satisfaction. ""The Revenant"" is loosely based on the real story of Hugh Glass an American fur trapper who was abandoned by his companions after the unfortunate bear incident and left to die. Despite infections and festering flesh he somehow survived and navigated his way across 200 miles of hostile wilderness. Its an amazing survival tale and the movie itself looks like a survival chronicle. That really is DiCaprio with ice stuck in his beard. That really is DiCaprio wading through and immersing himself in freezing water over and over. Part of the pleasure of ""The Revenant"" is in watching freezing people from a warm cushy seat in a theater. The film is directed by Alejandro Inarritu in a Terrence Malick (""The New World"") vein with shots of the sky through the trees silhouettes against the setting sun and omniscient overviews of the entire landscape. The difference is that with Inarritu these are not occasions for philosophical contemplation. Instead the sky might have arrows flying through it signaling a new phase in an Indian battle. And the overviews usually with some lone antlike figure in their midst are there to remind you that this environment may be breathtaking but people dont belong here. Like ""Birdman"" and even more than ""Birdman"" ""The Revenant"" is a directors movie a showcase for a filmmakers vision and innovation. Inarritu employs long complicated shots that make full use of the wide screen. Early in the movie he films an Indian attack in ways that make you realize that every previous director has done it all wrong. The attack comes without warning from all sides. A character starts calmly barking out orders and is killed mid-sentence. Every moment is a horrible surprise which of course it would be. There is no safe place to look no safe character to follow. Even a great innovator though has his limits and in attempting to make an endlessly riveting film about a guy trying to crawl and limp for 200 miles Inarritu has given himself a daunting assignment. He succeeds in the sense that his 156-minute movie maintains interest but the interest is maintained through a series of escalating catastrophes -- Glass cant just go over one waterfall but several -- and stock action-movie situations such as the lust for revenge. The fresh brilliance of the first hour fades into something more familiar. Tom Hardy exudes an awesome perversity as Glass most villainous colleague but he probably would be more effective if he got past the idea that doing an American accent means talking as if there were marbles in his mouth. Still hes a terrific presence. DiCaprio doesnt get to say much in ""The Revenant"" but he does get to cauterize a neck wound with gunpowder (dont try this at home) the most slapstick improvised health care procedure since Tom Hanks (""Cast Away"") extracted a tooth using an ice skate. And he does get to eat a live fish and dive face first into a buffalo liver. Its hard to talk about this as a performance because theres nothing to compare it to. But if I were an Oscar voter I might be tempted to vote DiCaprio best actor -- or at least to propose a new category be inaugurated the acting equivalent of the Purple Heart.

"The Revenant (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Revenant (R) Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a man struggling to survive in the wilderness directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/7/2016 Editor rating 3.5 Is there another filmmaker making movies today with a bigger God complex than Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu? Beginning with his Spanish-language debut the masterful Amores Perros in 2000 Inarritu has taken an omniscient I-know-better-than-you tone that came off as draggy self-important arrogance when the movies didnt work (21 Grams Biutiful) and creative prowess when they did (Babel Birdman). In his sixth film The Revenant which was famously (infamously?) shot on location in inhospitable climates using only natural light and minimal special effects -- a creative decision that led to a troubled production and budget overruns -- Inarritu puts his actors through ordeals that would make even the notoriously tyrannical James Cameron balk. Was the end result worth all the trouble? The answer comes in the first 10 minutes when a group of fur trappers preparing to sail home on the Missouri River in the early 1800s after months hunting in the wild is  set upon by an Arikara tribe. Arrows and tomahawks fly rifles fire and men die in horrific ways. Inarritu reuniting with his Birdman cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki shoots the mayhem in long takes the camera swinging and zooming around in a way youve never seen before placing you in the middle of the battle with such intensity that you duck and cower in your seat. The sequence is extraordinary but thats not the last time The Revenant startles you with images that seem impossible  (theres a stunning shot of a man on horseback riding off a cliff the camera following him like a trailing kite). Here is a movie about survival in the wilderness in which the filmmakers too seem to have been fending off grave danger. But all that stuff works subconsciously; Inarritu doesnt dwell on his own derring-do. The focus is on Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) a member of the hunting party who is teaching his half-Pawnee teenage son (Forrest Goodluck) to become a tracker. While on a scouting mission apart from the other men Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear and badly mauled. When transporting Glass by stretcher across rocky terrain becomes too much of a burden the captain (Domhnall Gleeson) decides to leave him behind in the company of three men -- Glass son another young man (Will Poulter) and a cantankerous treacherous lout named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) -- so they can give their fallen comrade a proper burial once he dies from his injuries as he almost surely will. But Fitzgerald unhappy about being left behind to care for a man who is beyond help hatches a different plan. The Revenant is partly based on Michael Punkes novel which was inspired by the true story of the real-life Glass a frontiersman who lived through an extraordinary ordeal. But Inarritu who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark L. Smith appropriates the premise of the story and turns it into something else -- a primal tale of survival and revenge leavened with touches of spirituality and the otherworldly (""I ought to be God"" Fitzgerald mutters in one of the films many references to a higher power). The weakest moments in The Revenant are the ones in which Inarritu puts too much trust in his artistic impulses The sight of a little bird flying out of a womans chest as she dies comes off clunky instead of poetic even if it takes place during a dream sequence. Some of the other visions Glass experiences while in a state of near-death (the way he spends half the movie really) stand out as unnecessary artistic flourishes in a movie already filled with natural savage beauty. Lubezki often shoots scenes with a wide-angle lens that pulls more visual information into the frame than a regular lens When the camera pans up to show us the immense trees towering over the characters you feel like youre in the forest with them. And the forest at least in The Revenant is an awful place to be. DiCaprio doesnt so much act in the movie as endure it -- half of his dialogue consists of grunts and ""Arrgh"" and ""Ugh"" -- but he brings more to the role than sheer physicality. Glass relationship with his son which is intended to form the movies emotional center is too thinly rendered to make an impression. But DiCaprio is too lively too resourceful to allow the movie to sink into grim solemn horror. His character may be a metaphor -- a personification of our innate instinct to survive -- but DiCaprio also gives him a soul. As his gnarled inhuman antagonist Hardy has a lot more to work with The actor relishes the profound odiousness of the character hes playing. But Inarritu is ultimately the main attraction of The Revenant Everything in this giant harrowing film is at the service of his vision (even the score written in part by the eclectic Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto sounds like music from inside someones head). The fact that the last line of dialogue is spoken five minutes before the end credits roll is telling Words matter little in a movie that favors seeing and feeling above all else. Its a work of pure furious sensation. Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Domhnall Gleeson Will Poulter Forrest Goodluck Duane Howard Arthur Redcloud. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.

Twentienth Century Fox The Revenant     1/2 (out of five) Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Domhnall Gleeson Rated R (strong frontier combat and violence including gory images sexual assault language brief nudity) Running time 156 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1208pm on Thursday Jan. 07 2016 Thursday Jan. 07 2016 Thursday Jan. 07 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Everything youve heard about the bear is true. The frenzied grizzly-on-man attack in The Revenant director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus brutal and beautiful gut-punch of a film is such an explosion of ursine rage that is both hard to watch and fascinating (how did they do that?).And that is The Revenant in a nutshell -- a grueling portrait of nature and man at their most unrelenting and unforgiving.Based on a novel by Michael Punke which was based on the real experiences of 19th-century frontiersman Hugh Glass -- a man who sought retribution against his compatriots who left him to die in the wilderness after a bear mauling -- the film may be easy to knock as a self-indulgent showcase for DiCaprio and his Oscar ambitions. But that would be selling it short. Combining the awe-inspiring vistas of a John Ford Western (it was filmed in rugged western Canada Argentina and Montana) with the blood-soaked justice of a Sam Peckinpah film The Revenant is a gorgeously shot exercise in survival and revenge thats definitely not for the squeamish.DiCaprio is Glass part of a group of hard-pressed fur traders somewhere in the wild wild west. Its a large unruly squad of men headed by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) the fair-minded but put-upon leader. An attack by Indians slaughters many of them and sends the rest fleeing.Expert tracker Glass leads the way but then he runs across that bear. The rest of the group is left with the decision of carrying a nearly dead Glass and thus slowing them down or leaving him alone to let nature finish what the bear started.Glass son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) whose mother is Indian doesnt want him left behind but hes not taken seriously by the group. The only reason hes around is because of who his father is and he is outweighed by cantankerous and scarred John Fitzgerald (a nearly unrecognizable Tom Hardy) a man who just wants to get paid and get out of there.What no one expects is that Glass would not just survive but thrive on the thirst of payback.Its a riveting story made all the more persuasive by Inarritus quest for realism. Much has been made of the physically demanding shoot that had many on the production quitting. According to The Hollywood Reporter the set was called ""a living hell"" by one crew member.All that effort shows onscreen. The actors look as if they really have been fighting for their lives and DiCaprio turns in a visceral unforgettable performance.Celebrated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ( Gravity The Tree of Life) turns the West into a series of striking tableaux that rival Ansel Adams.Meanwhile Inarritu has created a panoramic foreboding natural world thats completely the opposite of the claustrophobic backstage theatricality of his last film Birdman. Whereas that movie was all about language much of the beauty of The Revenant is in the way it uses silence.The director also deserves a nod for not making the Indians faceless violent villains as that opening attack implies. Their back story gets filled in during the 156-minute running time and their motives become clear. The Revenant is shot through with a spirituality as when Glass stumbles across an Indian Hikuc (Arthur Redcloud) who helps heal him.While comparisons are inevitable to The Hateful Eight this years other long violent Western about people trying to kill each other The Revenant lacks Quentin Tarantinos tongue-in-cheek sensibilities -- and its all the better for it.Inarritu keeps it straight simple and deadly. Just like the bear. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

In The Revenant the wild woolly transcendentally cinematic wilderness survival thriller Leonardo DiCaprios 19th-century fur trapper has his own facetime with a bar a ferocious grizzly protecting her cubs. Its not a spoiler really to say who eats whom in Alejandro G. Inarritus rip-roaring follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman. DiCaprio bearded and bloodied wears a bearskin through much of the movie. But the encounter is staggering - not just for DiCaprios Hugh Glass mauled and mutilated to within an inch of his life but for the audience beholding an interspecies confrontation rendered with unnerving realism. And the quiet beats between the violent combat - the parties stopping to take a breath consider their fates - make it all the more visceral suspenseful. Oscar for best bar fight The Revenant (the title means someone who returns from the dead) wins hands-down. An epic tale of revenge set in the unforgiving and unendingly beautiful frontier of 1820s Montana and South Dakota (the film was shot by the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki mostly in western Canada) The Revenant is exhilarating cinema. Tom Hardy chewing his words in deep guttural ways is the other craftier nemesis of the film. The British actor minus the postapocalyptic bondage gear of Mad Max Fury Road plays John Fitzgerald a fellow trapper who leaves Glass for dead in the middle of the woods. Woods ringed by attacking Arikara tribesmen. But Glass isnt dead and haunted by visions of his deceased (American Indian) wife and his son he somehow pulls his wounded self up and soldiers on. His purpose is without sway Track Fitzgerald down and bring his life to an end. Although tonally and contextwise completely different from one another there is much in common between Inarritus The Revenant and Ridley Scotts The Martian. Both boast box-office stars with serious Oscar cred (Matt Damon and DiCaprio costars in fact in Scorseses The Departed) and both films offer accounts of almost superhuman strength resilience and resolve. Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt have a cold-blooded killer to contend with (or a bar) but he does have to dig deep into his soul to find the will and the wiles to survive. Ditto DiCaprios Glass. And nature is a force to be reckoned with whether its the brutal terrain of the Red Planet or the wintry forests jagged mountains and raging rivers of Big Sky country. In fact one of the reasons to see The Revenant - and to see it on as big a screen as possible - is to take in the splendor and stunning majesty of these unspoiled landscapes. They are breathtaking. And they give Inarritus film a spiritual quality a life force looming over the mere humans trudging through the snow.

To be sure DiCaprio -- who grunts gets mauled and shows steely fortitude weathering tundralike conditions -- is formidable in a performance that demands more physically than artistically. Leonardo DiCaprio as explorer Hugh Glass in The Revenant. (Kimberley French/Twentieth Century Fox) ( Kimberley French/Twentieth Centu ) Playing the determined 19th-century frontiersman Hugh Glass who virtually rises from the dead (the very definition of a revenant) to pursue the men who abandoned him the actor flings himself into the part. But the truth is he shot off more acting fireworks in ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""The films real stars are Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and his expert behind-the-scenes team. They have crafted a full-on sensory experience thats so intense you practically feel your own teeth chattering as you slog through the snow with Glass. Every scene is imbued with a stirring mix of artistry and authenticity whether its the camera patiently meandering up a stream or performing a sweeping panoramic pirouette to convey the chaos and madness of an attack by Native Americans. Award-winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") in particular astonishes and awes yet again.Advertisement In fact ""The Revenant"" -- which was shot and reshot in Canada and Argentina -- is at its best when it re-creates the storys volatile natural setting and explores the treachery of its brutal unforgiving landscape. What keeps the film from being a classic is its venturing into emotional territory. There its almost as frozen as its setting.The story is based in part on a novel in turn based on the true account of how Glass endured herculean challenges that included an angry bear furious blizzards and greedy men to avenge wrongs perpetrated on him and his family. But while DiCaprio painfully conveys Glass turmoil and intense resolve as he goes after the odious fur trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy in the films best performance) theres an absence of emotional heft at points. A crucial element -- the bond between Glass and his half-Native American son -- is never satisfactorily explored in the stark screenplay by Inarritu and Mark L. Smith that renders DiCaprio mostly speechless. While the actor gives his all here more verbal exchanges between him and his son would have given ""The Revenant"" added visceral force. On nearly every other level ""The Revenant"" works magnificently particularly the now-famous scene in which Glass is savagely attacked by a grizzly an astonishing sequence that seamlessly melds sound effects and acting. It left me breathless.After the attack Glass is abandoned by Fitzgerald who had agreed to carry him to safety as the team of explorers and trappers hes with move ahead. Nearly dead at this point Glass begins relentlessly pursuing his betrayer resulting in a miserable odyssey through extreme weather conditions and encounters with foes and friends man and beast. Shooting in the brutal natural environment created tremendous headaches. The actors while game for the experience fully immersed themselves in frostbite conditions to the extent that DiCaprio later related how he ate raw bison liver to convey an honest reaction. While thats as impressive as it is nauseating it is Hardys Shakespearean turn as a villain that grabbed me the most. Hes chilling. The films biggest acting surprise comes from Will Poulter (""Were the Millers"") who portrays the moral ambiguity of the impressionable Jim Bridger whom Fitzgerald persuades to leave Glass for dead. Both actors deserve as much Oscar buzz as DiCaprio.Since ""The Revenant"" amounts to an endurance test it will sharply divide audiences. The liver-eating bit can do that sort of thing. Some will dismiss it as a standard-issue revenge flick done up with undeniable style from the director who gave us ""Birdman."" Others myself included see much more. It is a unique journey that tells a timeless parable about greed redemption and the dawning realization that man might be even more dangerous than nature.the revenant    1/2Rating R (for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images a sexual assault language and brief nudity)Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Will PoulterDirector and co-screenwriter Alejandro Gonzalez InarrituRunning time 2 hours 36 minutesOpens Jan. 8 in Bay Area theatersPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

By Anthony Lane Quentin Tarantino directs Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson.   Credit Illustration by Zohar Lazar Combine two films released on Christmas Day Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus ""The Revenant"" and what have you got? Five hours and thirty-eight minutes of malice and mistrust in which the characters--mostly men--are trapped in extreme weather conditions and settle their differences with extreme violence. So much for peace and good will. If I said that my thoughts during those long and bloody hours didnt stray now and then to Bing Crosby Id be lying. ""The Hateful Eight"" takes place in postbellum Wyoming. The film is of epic duration and like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" includes an intermission yet its settings could not be more cramped. Much of the first half is spent in a stagecoach and the rest--barring brief trips to a stable and an outhouse plus a few flashbacks--is spent in Minnies Haberdashery a lonely hangout which also serves coffee and stew. As for Wyoming we see it in fits and starts icy plains and peaks whose purpose is less to dazzle us than to wall in the dramatis personae. At selected theatres the movie will be screened in 70 mm. which sounds grandiose but as with Paul Thomas Andersons ""The Master"" in the same format what absorbs the director is the ever-changing landscape of the human face. Nothing was as daunting in Andersons film as his closeups of Amy Adams and Tarantino grants an equal honor to Jennifer Jason Leigh. She plays an outlaw Daisy Domergue and one slow look that she gives raising her face with a black eye and a crinkled grin to fill the screen may be the most convincing portrait of wickedness--and of its demonic appeal--in all of Tarantino. With that smile alone Leigh possesses the film. To say that Daisy is going to meet her doom is not quite right because her doom is travelling beside her in the person of John Ruth (Kurt Russell) a bounty hunter. He is bringing her to be hanged in the town of Red Rock where he will collect a handsome reward. En route they pick up a couple of wayfarers--Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is in the same trade as Ruth and Mannix (Walton Goggins) who says ""Ill be double dog damned"" and who will soon be assuming the post of Red Rocks sheriff  The coach arrives at Minnies where the rest of the lineup is assembled a Mexican named Bob (Demian Bichir) an old Confederate general (Bruce Dern) a near-wordless hulk (Michael Madsen) and a fussy little Brit who introduces himself as Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth). They are said to be random strangers but we have our doubts. From the start of the film theres a creepy--not to say ridiculous--sense of everybody wherever they hail from being cuffed and tied by circumstance. ""Considerin theres a blizzard goin on theres a whole lot of fellows wanderin around"" Ruth says on sighting Mannix. The line gets a laugh but its a ruse Tarantino is palming off the convolutions of his plot as a knowing gag. Not content with mustering his suspects as if they were the snowbound passengers in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" he needs to be sure that we appreciate his cunning--even addressing us in voice-over after the intermission and showing us a clue we may have missed. What a wag. The movie billed in the opening credits as ""The 8th Film by Quentin Tarantino"" is a beastly brew a blend of Agatha Christie and Sergio Leone spiked with postmodernist poison. We get an Ennio Morricone score--sadly no match for ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" where his musical glories washed in sadness against Leones array of sombre deeds. We get a lot of talk about Civil War treachery and payback; as in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" history is something to be toyed with not explored--a chance for boyish fantasies of revenge as if enormous crimes could be undone after the event by lone and wanton acts of humiliation. We get plenty of ripe performances with Jackson and Russell enjoying a tight battle of whiskers and pipe smoke. Above all we get confirmation of the directors preeminent perversity patient and elaborate in his racking up of tension he knows only one way to resolve it and that is through carnage displayed in unmerciful detail. To be fair the more blood is spilled the more some people lap it up; the audience at my screening howled with glee as Daisys face was showered with the contents of someone elses head. Chacun a son gout. By the end of ""The Hateful Eight"" its status as a tale of mystery and its deference to classic Westerns have all but disappeared worn down by the grind of its sadistic vision. That is the Tarantino deal by blowing out folks brains he wants to blow our minds. There you are somewhere near the Missouri River on a freezing day. Youve got no place to stay so what do you do? You check into a horse. If youre Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) the hero of ""The Revenant"" that is your preferred method and its hard to quarrel with though it cant be much fun for the horse. You slit open the belly tug out the guts strip naked crawl inside read a little light fiction for a while and nod off. The basics of life--clothing and food as well as accommodation--are much to the fore in ""The Revenant"" which is set in the eighteen-twenties. Glasss principal outfit is a shaggy animal pelt that he wears as a poncho. For nourishment he sucks marrow from the skeleton of something horned; catches a writhing fish and tears the flesh off with his teeth (all in a single shot); and chows down on a nameless hunk of bison also uncooked. You can experience that type of cuisine nowadays but only if you order the foraging menu at a restaurant in Copenhagen whereas Glass is dining for free on the borders of civilization. Not that Inarritus movie has much faith in the civilized. Glass belongs to a motley band of hunters and fur trappers ravaging the land and its fauna for profit. They number forty or so in a rough hierarchy with Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) just about keeping charge. Also present are a cussed crook named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy); Bridger (Will Poulter) whos barely more than a kid; and another youngster Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) who is Glasss son by a Native American woman. The whole plot is impelled by Glasss paternal loyalty to Hawk but that is thinly sketched and I never quite believed in them as father and child. The first twenty minutes are the best. As we contemplate the hides stretched out to dry or baled up for shipping downriver the hunters are suddenly ambushed on every flank by Arikara who resent the rape of their country. When one of them on horseback rides into the frame we stay with him galloping onward until he is felled whereupon we switch our attention--our sensory allegiance as it were--to the man who brought him low. Then he is downed too and the camera is trained on his aggressor; and so forth in a roundelay of horror that feels as if it could go on forever. Thanks to that fluency the scene becomes a savage sequel to Inarritus ""Birdman"" which also ducked and darted from one figure to the next. The survivors of the fray take to the river in a graceless boat that resembles a log cabin and then continue their trek to the fur traders camp on foot. Glass out on a morning foray falls afoul of a bear who is protecting her cubs an astounding sequence not just because her claw swipes are so murderously fierce but because the ferocity rises and fades--she stops mauling sniffs him licks his face ambles off and then just when you think the onslaught is over comes back and swipes anew. Once it is over at last Glass is in shreds strung between life and death. Henry decides to carry on without him leaving him in the care of Bridger Fitzgerald and Hawk. That arrangement falters and soon it is Glass alone who must like a tattered Odysseus make his way home. The hitch with tales of endurance onscreen is their unfortunate habit of becoming endurance tests for the viewer and after a while ""The Revenant"" turns into a slog. Make no mistake its a very beautiful slog. Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography summons a wealth of wonders and there is one image of a Pawnee warrior arcing his bow beside a fire in a whirring squall of snow that I will not forget. But some of the beauty has a willful air and seldom do we feel that the moments of transcendence have been happened upon as we do with a film like Werner Herzogs ""Aguirre the Wrath of God."" What Inarritu has created is less an adventure than a solemn pilgrimage suppressing the giddy flights of ""Birdman"" and as for DiCaprio his forte--a comic impishness last released in ""The Wolf of Wall Street""--is sternly curbed. Awed reports of what he went through on the set of ""The Revenant"" cannot disguise the fact that his character is a moral monotone who suffers great afflictions but no change. Although the wild world is thrown at him how much really stirs in the heart of Glass?  An earlier version of this article misstated Mannixs future post.

Kimberley French/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass bears the elements in a scene from The Revenant. Kimberley French/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film An Oscar-winning director a major star a survival saga that makes Heart of Darkness look like a pleasure cruise... and all anyone wants to talk about is the bear attack. And in fact its hard not to start there. It comes about comes 24 minutes in. Fur-trapper Hugh Glass played by a hirsute bundled-up Leonardo DiCaprio has helped his fellow trappers escape a harrowing Arikara massacre. In most movies that would be the scene everyones talking about -- arrows piercing vocal cords in mid-cry death raining down from trees. But a few men get away and are hellbent on getting to the comparative safety of a far-off fort before winter hits. Glass separated from the others has spotted two bear cubs in the woods. He raises his rifle then hears a loud snuffling behind him Mama bear...who has correctly figured out what Glass has in mind for her cubs charges before he can swing his rifle around. In one horrifying continuous take she knocks him down claws bites stomps and shakes his body ripping his flesh breaking his bones. Only when Glass is motionless after a long long mauling does she pause in her attack -- sizing him up stepping on his head sniffing his skin until the call of her cubs distracts her. And you think its over. And its not. By the time Glass son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the other trappers come upon him Glass is barely clinging to life. Carrying him over rough terrain as winter approaches will doom them all realizes Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). He offers a bit of extra pay to two men who will stay to watch over him and then bury him when the time comes. A young trapper about Hawks age volunteers to stay as does John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) whos been grousing about Glass and his son (whose mother was Pawnee) since the Indian attack. Alas Fitzgerald is not someone you want in your corner. Once the others have moved on he stabs Hawk all but buries Glass alive then leaves them to the elements. At which point a survival/revenge saga begins thats every bit as breathtaking to behold as it is punishing to watch. Filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu fresh off the Oscar-winning Birdman and working with the same cinematographer who made Birdmans long continuous camera takes so fluid spent eight winter months in the Canadian and Argentine wilderness with a cast that didnt have to fake being freezing or exhausted. DiCaprio in particular gets swept over waterfalls rides his horse off cliffs drags himself by his fingernails across icy landscapes and endures Indian attacks mostly in natural light ice in his beard the camera getting so close to him that his breath fogs the lens. What elevates this standard if relentless plot line is that The Revenant feels like high-wire work without a net. Audiences have gotten used to seeing actors doing what look like dangerous things but in the full knowledge that those actors are not actually in danger...that theyre on a soundstage somewhere in front of a green screen. To shoot The Revenant DiCaprio aided by the occasional stuntman actually dragged himself against genuinely frozen ground and plunged into a raging river with ice in it and I dont care how advanced the wetsuit is that was hidden under his clothes that makes a difference you can feel. Hes exposed at the mercy of the elements in a cruelly brutal way and so is the storytelling. Yes theres some digital work here. The filmmakers did not actually turn a grizzly loose on one of the most valuable talents in Hollywood. But the effects are used to make things more real not more fantastic and that also makes a difference. The dictionary definition of ""revenant"" is ""one who returns after death or a long absence."" Applies to the main character obviously. But watching The Revenant youre aware that a kind of filmmaking -- raw and visceral -- is returning after a long absence too.

Its set in a huge seemingly endless snowy wilderness. And it runs more than 2 1/2 hours. Beyond that its comprised of big moments upon big moments.All of which means while its a rich film its also something of an endurance test. Every time you think nothing worse could happen to poor Leo something worse happens. Talk about not being able to catch a break.The film is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu who won three Oscars last year -- best screenplay director and picture -- for the uncharacteristically goofy ""Birdman."" Here hes traveling in more familiar heavy territory with a raw tale of revenge redemption and isolation. Dont go expecting a lot of laughs.DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass scout for a trapping expedition sent out to the wilds in 1820s northern America. Glass is accompanied by his half-Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and they are out hunting when a swarm of Indians attack the trappers who are under the command of young officer Andrew Henry (Domnhall Gleeson).Glass and Hawk hurry back and join in the melee which leaves dozens of the trappers dead. The survivors race to a boat and take off downriver fully aware that the Indians can watch them from the shores and attack when the river narrows. The Indians it turns out are looking for the chiefs daughter who was taken in the night by white guys -- but not these white guys. Unfortunately the Indians dont know that.Glass convinces Henry that their safest bet is to get off the boat and hike across land even though winter is settling in. The trappers do just that and Glass goes off to scout the area. He comes upon a mother bear and her cubs and before he knows it the mother is upon him.This is easily the greatest bear-mauling in film history. The bear shreds Glass and tosses him about like a rag doll. Then she takes a break to check out the kids only to come back for more time and again. Luckily this gives Glass the opportunity to reach for his rifle and then his knife. Eventually the bear is done but Glass is grievously injured head to toe.The trappers find him and build a stretcher to carry him. But Glass cant speak and seems sure to die. Eventually one particularly disgruntled trapper Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy gritty as dirt) suggests they leave him behind to die. Henry wont agree to that but he will leave a few men to care for Glass and then assumably bury him. Fitzgerald volunteers for the duty waits a while performs some dastardly deeds and then leaves Glass behind to die.But Glass doesnt die. He lingers in the snow. And then he moves painfully. And unarmed he begins a long long journey battling man and nature encountering calamity after calamity with two things in mind Surviving and killing Fitzgerald.Inarritu gets a bit too caught up in symbolic dreams and memories -- hes directing with a capital D -- but the long slog Glass endures is undeniably strong stuff and the beaten-down but never conquered Glass is near unrecognizable as the baby-faced movie star DiCaprios been for so long.""The Revenant"" is both draining and rewarding and its power lingers long after its last gasp.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongThe RevenantGRADE ARated R for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images a sexual assault language and brief nudityRunning time 156 minutes 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1OqsUp8 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/24/review-calamity-calamity-rough-revenant/77900794/,200,therevenant19,therevenant,detroitnews
"Review The Revenant is a survival tale of beautiful brute strength - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Revenant is a survival tale of beautiful brute strength The Revenant is a survival tale of beautiful brute strength Kimberley French / 20th Century Fox Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Revenant."" Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Revenant."" (Kimberley French / 20th Century Fox) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Previous Alejandro G. Inarritu films such as ""21 Grams"" ""Babel"" and the Oscar-winning ""Birdman"" have not lacked for pretension and self-importance so it comes as something of a pleasant surprise possibly even to the director himself that what hes come up with in ""The Revenant"" is a classic B picture fortified with all manner of Grade A resources.Its not that this inspired-by-fact story of celebrated scout and mountain man Hugh Glass and his battle for survival after being chewed up spit out and left for dead by a particularly enraged bear completely avoids inflated moments including but not limited to dreams visions and folk wisdom of ""the wind cannot affect a tree with strong roots"" variety. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Its rather that the combined exceptional work of star Leonardo DiCaprio and nonpareil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki create so much verisimilitude and beauty that it compels us to pay more attention to this glimpse of a dark unsettling kill-or-be-killed world more than we otherwise would.And points do go to Inarritu (who co-wrote the screenplay loosely adapted from the Michael Punke novel with Mark L. Smith) for being obsessive enough to insist on taking the cast and crew to the far corners of Alberta Canada and Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to ensure that locations would look and feel as remote and forbidding as theyre supposed to. Though versions of Glass story have appeared on film before most notably with the 1971 Richard Harris-starring ""Man in the Wilderness"" its never been told with Inarritus insistence on a degree of authenticity that truly makes you feel present in the films time and place.

Leonardo DiCaprio talks about how conditions at each location played a part in his performance. That would be 1823 in a trackless area in what is now the state of South Dakota where way-capable scout Glass (DiCaprio) is guiding a group of fur trappers employed by the Rocky Mountain Trading Co. under the command of Capt. Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson).After an opening dream sequence establishing that Glass has had a Native American wife Lubezkis gliding camera work circulates among the trappers camped at a riverside much as it moved in his Oscar-winning ""Birdman.""A sudden attack by the Arikara tribe portrayed considerably more convincingly than this kind of sequence usually is changes everything. Yes the scene is violent but unlike what we have to endure in Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" the violence here and elsewhere in the film (including Glass crawling inside a disemboweled horse) is intrinsic to the situation and done with an absence of glee. Most of the trappers are killed and those who remain alive are persuaded by Glass to attempt an overland route back to their Fort Kiowa headquarters. The inevitable malcontent and naysayer is John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a trapper from Texas whose impenetrable accent and surly disposition were not improved by having been unsuccessfully scalped back in the day.Out alone hunting for food Glass is attacked by that enormous incensed bear. Given that peerless ursine actor Bart the Bear has passed on this totally convincing beasts attack was created via a combination of stunt work and computer-generated images.

If such traction is mystifying to us regular... (Steven Zeitchik) Alive but barely Glass is carried in a litter for a while but Capt. Henry convinced that the scouts death is near leaves him behind with three men detailed to ensure that he gets a proper burial when the time comes. These are Glass son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) a young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and that surly malcontent Fitzgerald.Though it has the least dialogue of any of DiCaprios adult portrayals Hugh Glass has to be one of the most powerful and convincing roles the actor has had a part thats taken hold of him to such an extent that its the equal of any of his four Oscar-nominated roles.Full-bearded capable of expressing rage with only his eyes determined to survive to take revenge on those who did him dirty even if he has to literally crawl to do it DiCaprio makes us believe that he has the will and the skills to turn himself into a revenant a man who has managed to come back from the dead with blood in his eye.The actors great ally here is double Oscar-winning cinematographer Lubezki who brilliantly captures the unnerving beauty of a virgin wilderness and Glass agonizing attempts to stay alive in it.

"Revenant The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; revenant-the ) Revenant The (United States 2015) December 23 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Revenant Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman plays like a cross between Terrence Malick and Sam Peckinpah. As unlikely as such a conflation might seem the result works - sometimes to stunning effect. In a year when no fewer than five films have dealt with themes of man vs. nature and survival (including The Martian Everest In the Heart of the Sea and A Walk in the Woods) The Revenant is by far the most brutal challenging and astounding of these. The Revenant is adapted from the novel by Michael Punke which in turn is a fictionalized account of the life of frontier legend Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who survived a bear mauling and badly injured traveled more than 200 miles across the 1823 wilderness to safety. The script (co-written by Inarritu and Mark L. Smith) using material from the book enhances Glass journey both physical and emotional by giving him a Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and a more tangible reason for revenge against the men who left him behind John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter). The Revenant is at times dreamlike with gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki who turns the frigid wintry backcountry into a land that is equal parts forbidding and beautiful. The film is peppered with ground shots looking up at the sky through the trees and there are numerous extended takes (although nothing to compare with the ""one-shot"" of Birdman for which Lubezki won his second consecutive Oscar). The comparison to Malick is not coincidental; Lubezki has lensed Malicks five most recent features dating back to The New World. This was by all accounts a difficult shoot with Inarritu driving cast and crew with a James Cameron-like unwillingness to compromise. (DiCaprio who participated in Camerons shoot for Titanic was apparently unfazed by some of what Inarritu asked him to do.) The movie was shot on location in cold climes using natural light (no cozy studio scenes with wintry conditions imposed via CGI). The realism permeating the screen seeps into the theater. The urge to put on a coat and hunker down in the seat is almost overpowering. The word ""revenant"" refers to an animated corpse that has returned from death to haunt the living. Its an apt descriptor for the film. The title character Glass is attacked and nearly killed by a bear while leading a small group of trackers to safety after a fur gathering expedition is ambushed by Arikara warriors. Although Glass manages to kill the grizzly he is believed by the other members of the party to have suffered mortal injuries.  The commander Andrew Henry (Domnhall Gleeson considerably more subdued than in The Force Awakens) decides to press on but leaves three men behind to care for Glass while he lives (and to bury him when he dies). They are Glass half-Pawnee son Hawk; the young and impressionable Jim Bridger; and the cynical John Fitzgerald. Not long after the companys departure Fitzgerald determines that the best solution for all would be to put Glass out of his misery. When Hawk objects Fitzgerald stabs him to death then buries Glass alive. He and Bridger depart but Glass is able to crawl out of the grave cauterize his most serious wounds set his broken leg and start the long trek to civilized lands.  This journey occupies approximately half of the movies 150+ minute running time and showcases the most raw primal performance DiCaprio has ever given. For an actor who made his reputation being a box office idol theres nothing attractive or physically alluring about him in this role. In a movie replete with unsettling moments and memorable scenes the one most likely to disturb is the mauling. Presented without cutting away The Revenant gives a realistic view of what can happen when a man comes face to face with an enraged mother bear protecting her cubs. The scene is bloody and brutal and some viewers may find it too intense to watch to completion. Fair warning to those who choose to see The Revenant this sequence spares neither the character nor the audience. Inarritu opts for a somber tone. Revenge films are often fueled by testosterone and anticipation. Neither is much in evidence here. Its a slower more serious-minded motion picture. Technically The Revenant is a Western but like most recent films of that genre it can be considered a ""revisionist Western"" in that it dispenses with the traditional ""cowboys and Indians"" stereotypes in favor of more balanced interpretations based on human nature. That is some of the Native Americans are warlike and bloodthirsty but others come to Glass aid. On the other side Henry is helpful and sympathetic while Fitzgerald is the movies chief villain. The Revenant is an experience - a more visceral and devastating look at seemingly impossible survival than even The Martian (although I would argue that the latter is on balance a slightly better film). Perhaps whats most impressive about this film is how different it is from Birdman - an indication that Inarritu continues to challenge himself and his actors. The Revenant isnt for everyone - it asks more from its audience than the average motion picture - but for those to whom the subject matter appeals it will be among 2015s most memorable theatrical options.

Inarritus operatic ultraviolent revenge western. DiCaprio spends the entire movie escaping one near-death situation after the other fleeing from (and/or pursuing) wild animals natural phenomena vengeful Native American warriors French soldiers and a mumbling redneck villain played by Tom Hardy. Once I had got hold of the idea that this was the most elaborate Roadrunner cartoon of all time I couldnt get rid of it. (Hardys shipment from the Acme Dynamite Corp. must have gotten stuck in the snow somewhere.)""The Revenant"" is the big Oscar-flavored follow-up to Inarritus Oscar-winning ""Birdman"" and like that film it was shot by Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki a cinematographer whose impact on 21st-century film has been almost immeasurable. (Consider the resume ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" ""The New World"" ""Children of Men"" ""The Tree of Life"" ""Gravity"" and at least two more Terrence Malick films to come.) For a while at least this one feels like Inarritus masterpiece until that familiar too-muchness begins to take over. It features all the cinematic bravado and enormous narrative ambition that have made the Mexican director ... well whatever it is that he is. A flawed genius? A guy who bakes spectacular cakes but always forgets some crucial ingredient? Or maybe just a talented filmmaker who needs to get over trying to be Orson Welles Stanley Kubrick and Boccaccio in every second of every movie.In one of those strange coincidences that starts to make you believe that there is a God and that his/her sense of humor is refreshingly straightforward ""The Revenant"" is one of two ultraviolent revenge westerns being released on Christmas Day. (At 156 minutes this one is the shorter of the two - by half an hour) Because nothing quite goes along with honey-glazed ham and a crackling Yule log like watching someone get scalped alive or have his nuts shot off by way of a reminder that our entire civilization was founded on ruthless carnage. While ""The Revenant"" and Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" are different stories told in extremely different modes - one a swashbuckling outdoor adventure the other a claustrophobic indoor mystery - theyre both set in the Mountain West during the 19th century outside the established borders of the United States and both preach roughly the same dire text on American history.Mind you the 19th century in the American West covers a whole lot of territory. ""The Revenant"" is set half a century before Tarantinos film during the chaotic Western expansion of the 1820s when hunters trappers and the ragtag troops of the brand new United States Army began to explore the virtually unknown regions west of the Missouri River. One of the films themes or subjects I would say - as in any Inarritu movie you could identify dozens of them - is the idea that our continents history had not yet been written and things didnt have to end up as they did.DiCaprios character Hugh Glass is a white frontiersman and wilderness guide who has lived among Native Americans for years and can understand several Native languages. (The realism on that front is unusual and commendable We hear Pawnee Arikara and Lakota spoken in the film reflecting the fact that numerous different groups speaking mutually incomprehensible languages came into collision with each other as well as with the Americans and the French during that period of intense cultural disruption.) His late wife was a Native woman who died in a village massacre that we experience in a series of overly mystical Inarritu flashbacks and that was apparently carried out by white troops. Hugh is now guiding a band of military beaver trappers alongside his teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) a ""half-breed"" viewed with near-universal distrust. You Might Also Like In the real history of the American West there were numerous men like Hugh Glass who sought peaceful coexistence with Native Americans in the first instance as a matter of survival and commercial advantage and who came to understand and embrace Native culture to some degree. (The screenplay by Inarritu and Mark L. Smith is ""based in part"" on Michael Punkes novel which in turn was inspired by a historical episode.) But as someone may previously have observed the road to hell is paved with good intentions.Hugh represents the road not taken of peaceful cultural fusion and Capt. Andrew Henry the military officer in charge of his expedition (played by Domhnall Gleeson who has had one hell of a year between this movie ""Ex Machina"" ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Force Awakens"") is presented as a decent and honorable man facing terrible circumstances. John Fitzgerald Hardys character stands as the moral nemesis to both Henry and Glass an overtly racist mercenary whose only interest is No. 1. But one of the cleverest subthemes of ""The Revenant"" is the suggestion that Fitzgerald may be the most honest and clear-headed of these guys. Once you accept his view of the world - Western expansion is a huge wealth-grab driven by the wealthy and powerful; conflict between whites and Natives is inevitable - then everything he does is driven by logic rather than cruelty.Very minor spoiler coming That includes Fitzs decision to abandon Glass in the wilderness after the latter has been critically wounded in that non-sexual ursine episode even though he has been ordered to stay with the injured man (and promised a considerable payday for doing so). So theres a historical irony at work as Glass literally claws his way across the frozen wastelands of what will one day be called Montana or Wyoming sleeping naked inside deer carcasses and outwitting drunken Frenchmen and begging scraps from doomed Pawnee wanderers and dodging an enraged Arikara chief whose daughter has been kidnapped by whites and isnt much interested in enlightened cultural dialogue. As Fitz actually tells Glass late in the film the blood vengeance he seeks is thoroughly pointless and arguably directed at the wrong target. Its a monumental performance by DiCaprio even if he is playing a filthy hirsute Frankenstein-monster version of the Roadrunner with roughly the same amount of dialogue. If he wins his Oscar at last I certainly have no objection. Gleeson and Hardy are also tremendous and Lubezkis breathtaking long-take action scenes exemplify the positive effects of digital photography in mainstream cinema. (I remain unsure about ""Gravity"" on the other hand.) But as nearly often happens in Inarritus films these elements operate at cross purposes and the point of the whole thing - the reason this movie was made and the reason were watching it - gets drowned beneath a series of memorable but disconnected images and moments.Furthermore at least once in my life I would like to see a western that strives for complex portrayals of Native Americans without defaulting to a phony-baloney spiritual vision-quest toward the end of the second act in which insects and amphibians speak the dead return beautiful maidens sit alone in a field of waving grass and the hero wakes at last his fever broken. Its a sure sign that a filmmaker thought he had something to say but has lost track of it - we can stick with the masculine pronoun for this one - and that if hes not actually Terrence Malick making a Terrence Malick movie hes in grave peril of becoming Kevin Costner making ""Dances With Wolves.""

Verisimilitude. Correspondent with the rise of the computers and the ability to show us any place that filmmakers can imagine has been the fall of immersiveness -- that sense that the actors are in a place you cant go yourself rather than just standing against a digitized mock-up of one.Contrast the rugged New Zealand beauty of The Fellowship of the Ring with the garish cartoonscapes of The Battle of the Five Armies and youll see what weve lost. The backbreaking finger-freezing shoot for Alejandro G. Inarritus frostbitten survival thriller The Revenant is as good an explanation as any for why todays movies so often fail to get us to imagine were someplace we couldnt be the one baseline thing the studios used to get right. Theyre made by actors in front of green screens for the same reason your mother prefers to get that family portrait at Sears A flat and stiff final product is a small price for ease and control. Film Details The Revenant RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time156 min. More Info Whats marvelous about The Revenant is the improbable amount of control Inarritu and director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki seem to wield even out in the wild. (Few scenes take place indoors.) To tell this simplest of revenge stories set in the American Rockies in the 1820s the production shot for months in inhospitable stretches of Canada and Argentina relying on natural light and the cruel whims of the weather. But the camera glides and snakes through this wintry hell with all the dazzling fluidity Inarritu displayed in Birdman. But here the dexterous long shots dont play like they are themselves the point. Inarritu employs them when a moment benefits from being extended often when to cut would be to offer us relief.Early on Pawnee ambush Leonardo DiCaprios Hugh Glass and his band of trappers; an intimate and ugly battle threads through the poplars rich with brutal incident. In one wheeling and impossible shot Inarritu follows a trapper or a Pawnee then another coming from another direction and then another still. Its a nerve-racking breakthrough for depictions of battlefield chaos and watching it is something like trying to drive for the first time through a Boston roundabout Death can come from any direction.Not long after the routed trappers bicker at a makeshift mountain campsite with raw sky and stone behind and below them. Theyre furious terrified spitting lines at each other we dont quite catch and the shots length -- its multiple setups and multiple dramas -- seems to press in on them This moment has carried on far too long. They need to run. We need them to run.Not long after that comes the bear scene you might have heard about. Its another scene of bravura technique whose technique comes to be invisible -- its just an endless horror the Bear Mauling Simulation App you never thought you could download stretching on with a grim patience. Inarritu is operating here not at the pace of movie set pieces but at the pace of a bear. DiCaprios character doesnt get raped as that trolling nonsense site the Drudge Report claimed but the exhaustive panting up-closeness of the scene is legitimately horrifying. Its not a sequence you watch; its an encounter you get through.Thats the first of several instances in which Inarritu seems to dare audiences to vacate the theater. Theres an actual rape later visited upon the only woman Glass meets; there are many long slogging minutes of near-death Glass crawling through snow or wheezing with ice in his beard; theres the Malickian zone-out shots of the moon and sun burning through clouds; theres the grunting lead performance from DiCaprio who barely speaks as he grinds through the wilderness; theres Inarritus best-in-class take on the survive-the-night-in-a-carcass routine with a steaming abundance of horse innards -- its Matthew Barney meets The Empire Strikes Back. The Revenant was famously hard to shoot but the filmmaking has a rare and confident vigor -- you are always aware youre seeing the real world even as Inarritus camera bounds through it like its Skyrim. Birdman was impressive but the technique always seemed to me to limit its actors who had to deliver their monologues while constantly accommodating that cameras stunt work -- and denied the benefits of conventional editing were stuck trying to power through the films every mood-shift and transition on their own in something like real time. Not so here.The sad thing then is that the story honored with such mastery is familiar journey/revenge stuff. Tom Hardy bracing in a heel turn plays the sumbitch who left DiCaprios Glass to die. Glass has to heal and then hunt him down. As usual DiCaprios character has a dead-wife backstory; hes the old-school Disney hero of millennial prestige pictures always robbed of his family so that he can have an adventure. Still his performance is commanding even when hes just lying there freezing to death and theres power in his slow transformation from fragile Leo-cicle to vengeful snowbeast.If you can work up interest in such meager material the film is a chilling stirring experiential immersion in what life-and-death drama might actually feel like. DiCaprios final showdown with Hardy crashing through snowdrifts to an iced-over creek is one of the great screen fights. Youve sat through variations on every scene in The Revenant before but youve probably never believed them. Inarritu puts you there.Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu. Written by Alejandro G. Inarritu and Mark L. Smith. Based ""in part"" on the novel by Michael Punke. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Domhnall Gleeson Will Poulter Forrest Goodluck and Duane Howard. Opens December 25.

Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu may have fashioned The Revenant as the ultimate endurance test but its star Leonardo DiCaprio simply endures Never has film suffering looked so ravishing as in The Revenant Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus true-life tale of one mans terrible adventures in unforgiving 1820s Wyoming. Leonardo DiCaprio plays frontiersman Hugh Glass who suffers a mauling at the meaty paws of an angry mama bear only to learn that the cruelty of man is much colder. Lord how he suffers But beautifully. Blood oozes from the artfully placed gashes in his skin tiny icicles dangle like molten jewels from his mountain-man mustache the belly of the fish hes just caught glimmers gently just before he tears into it with his teeth. Pristine in its grittiness The Revenant is a hyperrealist Where the Wild Things Are for depressive grownups. Which is not to say the movie--adapted from Michael Punkes 2002 novel itself based on true events--doesnt have its share of sick downbeat thrills or visually wondrous moments. Its just that by forcing his actors to work under ungodly conditions on location in both Argentina and frigid Alberta the better to capture the day-to-day desperation of trappers in the wilderness Inarritu--director of Birdman winner of Best Picture at last years Oscars--broke a covenant with his performers. When you push your actors to the brink youre not directing youre just failing to let them do what they do best Act. Keeping them working in temperatures so frigid they cant even move their lips as Inarritu did isnt a method-acting strategy--its just brutal. Still the cast rallies surviving even the showiest filmmaking Inarritu and superstar cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki can dish out--and they dish out a lot. DiCaprios Hugh Glass is a man of principles and fortitude charged with guiding a group of trappers through the perilous west his half-Pawnee teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) in tow. When the men arent simply suffering the effects of the elements theyre in danger of being attacked by understandably angry Arikara warriors--early in the picture an increasingly tense stretch of serenity is broken when an arrow whizzes through the air piercing some poor sods throat. One trapper in particular John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a mean mass of sinew and whiskers has it out for both Glass and Hawk. After Glass is attacked by that bear--an assault he barely survives--the head of the expedition Domhnall Gleesons stalwart Captain Andrew Henry unwisely entrusts him to Fitzgeralds care while the rest of the gang moves on. Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) a sweetheart of a greenhorn also stays behind though he fails to prevent Fitzgerald from betraying Glass after committing one heartless unforgivable act Fitzgerald moves on to another leaving his dazed bloodied colleague for dead. But Glass wont be vanquished so easily He survives a seemingly endless string of gruesome trials (including a DIY neck-wound cauterization) eventually clawing his way back to civilization to wreak his revenge. The Revenant is supposed to be relentless though you may find it tiresome the movie equivalent of tigers circling a tree so single-mindedly that they churn themselves into butter. Lubezki was the cinematographer on Birdman and in The Revenant he and Inarritu engage in yet more feats of DP derring-do. For better or worse were always aware of what the cameras doing. Lubezki is an astonishingly gifted cinematographer--his better less-hotdogging work includes Alfonso Cuarons Children of Men a picture of fierce simmering elegance--but in The Revenant hes working overtime to channel the spirit of Terrence Malick another filmmaker with whom hes collaborated. There are about ten too many shots of treetops waving listlessly in the breeze probably intended to symbolize the Isolation of Man or some other graduate thesis topic. Contrast all that fussiness with the solid old-fashioned work of acting which the whole cast of The Revenant stubbornly insist on doing punitive on-set conditions be damned. And that bear attack a sequence of vicious haunting beauty sure is something the great brown she-beast charges DiCaprios Glass with clumsy fury. All her strength is in her awkwardness--she doesnt need precision. As she gnaws shakes and claws at her victim her noisy snorting and snuffling is a primitive forest symphony. Glass doesnt go down without a fight but eventually--minutes later though it seems like an eternity--hes reduced to an exhausted mangled heap. Yet even in that near-lifeless state Glass seems filled with life. Later he comes close to both suffocation and starvation. At one point he guts a dead horse and climbs inside the carcass for warmth. He also gains sustenance by eating buffalo innards. Inarritu may have fashioned The Revenant as the ultimate endurance test but as Glass DiCaprio simply endures. He gives the movie a beating heart offering it up figuratively speaking alive and bloody on a platter. It--he--is the most visceral effect in the movie revenge served warm. Bon appetit.

And Leonardo DiCaprio his usual movie-star good looks hidden under a wild beard gives a ferocious effort as a real-life frontiersman seeking to survive and avenge.The Revenant is based on the harrowing true story of ace tracker Hugh Glass and his wintry journey through Montana in 1823. Glass (DiCaprio) his half-Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the rest of a group of fur trappers are collecting pelts when theyre attacked by a swarm of Native Americans a sequence captured by Inarritu with a sensational yet violent tracking shot.USA TODAYLeonardo DiCaprio could see awards metal for his Revenant mettleThings get worse from there Glass is severely mauled by a mama bear trying to protect her cubs whove wandered nearby. The men carry Glass seemingly close to a visit from the Grim Reaper for a while but the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) wants to leave him get home and get paid. When Fitzgerald tries to kill Glass Hawk intervenes and is murdered as his father looks on in horror.Fitzgerald tells their crew that Glass is dead and they continue on while Glass slowly recovers and tracks the men down to find his sons killer.USA TODAYYes Leonardo is psyched for Star Wars tooThe Revenant shot in all natural light is as visually stunning as Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkis Oscar-winning Birdman. It didnt make for the easiest production schedule but looks absolutely amazing onscreen especially with some horizon shots that make the natural world around these men seem almost heavenly while they go through hell.The filmmakers also capture the constant sense of danger that pervaded the lives of men such as Glass and the results are not for the squeamish. The scene where Glass gets ripped apart like a chew toy is lengthy but well done and DiCaprio sells every painful bite and clawing completely.USA TODAYThe Revenant captures Leonardo DiCaprios true gritDiCaprio has long fostered an impressive body of work yet this is on another level He has very little dialogue given that Glass spends much of the movie alone and trying not to die. He guts a horse so he can climb in and stay warm through the night he grows more emaciated as the story progresses toward a bloody conclusion but DiCaprios powerful performance keeps you immersed in Glass quest and rooting for the man.Hardy is superbly villainous as Fitzgerald -- theres not much backstory with him which is fine since its better that he doesnt have any redeeming qualities. Will Poulter gets a nice supporting turn as Jim Bridger a man caught between helping Glass and facing Fitzgeralds mighty wrath and Domhnall Gleeson contrasts his Star Wars The Force Awakens bad guy with a role here as good-hearted fur-trapper leader Andrew Henry.The Revenant is a throwback look at a wild time in American history and the team-up of Inarritu and DiCaprio gives this era a deserving epic. 9388 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 36 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Om615X,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/22/revenant-movie-review-leonardo-dicaprio/77714800/,200,therevenant27,therevenant,usatoday

Photo Regency Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW The Revenant Running time 156 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sexual assault brief nudity). A film I admired but didnt especially like ""The Revenant"" is a master class in craftsmanship marrying the ethos of 1970s Hollywood with its beaten-dog heroes forever roughed up by a brutal system to the technological prowess of todays digitally obsessed blockbusters. Too rarely are visual effects used in the service of harshness and grit rather than fantasy and silliness -- to take us back to nature and the past rather than to realms fanciful and the future. ""The Revenant"" (someone who returns as from the dead) is one rough day at the office for Leonardo DiCaprio. He turns the untamed West into his Calvary as Glass a Rocky Mountains fur trapper on a group expedition in a dire 19th-century winter wilderness. All he wants is to go back with his son to his Indian wife but things dont work out that way. Glass finds himself in his own grave betrayed by a fellow trapper. Between the two men there is so much enmity that we could almost be talking about Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. Deep into the film I realized hey thats Tom Hardy -- champion changeling -- as the bad guy. In the same moment it occurred to me that this is about the fifth Tom Hardy movie in which I couldnt understand half of what Tom Hardy says. His respect for mastering accents is admirable but how about going back to mastering speech? Not that he or anyone else has much of interest to say The script tends to veer from banality (""This man is the only reason were still alive"") to cliche (one Indian actually complains about how the white men have ""stolen everything from us""). Tom Hardy.Photo Twentieth Century Fox So why do I want to see ""The Revenant"" again? Its an experience a moonshine blast of pure cinema lushly designed and evocatively photographed (by Emmanuel Lubezki who wins the Oscar every year and will probably win it again).

Inarritu (the ""Birdman"" auteur who has yet to make a film I wholeheartedly enjoyed although this one is easily my pick of the bunch) builds the picture around gory frighteningly vivid set pieces such as an Indian raid and a bear mauling (not despite rumors to the contrary rape). ""The Revenant"" succeeds in its quest which is to overwhelm the senses to transport us to a world as far removed from our experience as (the Lubezki-photographed) outer space in ""Gravity."" Its intoxicating even as long stretches separate plot developments. ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" and the impressionistic rambles of Terrence Malick films such as ""Days of Heaven"" come to mind. Inarritu isnt really out to tell a great yarn -- the story could fit on one sheet of paper and not the legal-size kind. No the point is to pose important questions like ""Whats it like to ride your horse off a cliff plummet into a tree then scoop out the insides of your mount and crawl in?"" (Actually that last part was pretty well settled in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" but its harder to do when you dont have a lightsaber.) By the end Inarritu had done so little to establish an emotional core that I was utterly indifferent as to which man would prevail. The film doesnt touch the heart but its grip on the viscera is relentless.

Credit Kimberly French By Peter Travers December 22 2015 More News The Soaring Superheroic Making of Birdman Is Tom Hardy Our Last Strong-Silent-Type Star? The Rolling Stone Interview Leonardo DiCaprio All Stories >> Note to movie pussies The Revenant is not for you. Life put the screws to Hugh Glass the real-life tracker and fur trapper played to the hilt and beyond by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. Inarritu a groundbreaker from Amores Perros to Birdman damn near tortures his cast and his audience in telling the story of Glass revenge against the varmints headed by John Fitzgerald (a wicked-nasty Tom Hardy) who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823 its one brutal badass epic. But hang on for its unforgiving 156 minutes and you get to experience the power of cinema unleashed. Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki -- a true artist of light and shadow -- shot on locations in Canada and Argentina. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw you can see the breath of the freezing actors some of whom referred to the filming as a living hell.

The Rolling Stone Interview Leonardo DiCaprio All Stories >> Related Leonardo DiCaprios Movies Ranked Worst to Best From Titanic to Django Unchained rating the good bad and WTF ugly of Leos big-screen career Watching the movie you feel their pain. In loosely adapting Michael Punkes 2002 novel Inarritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith spare nothing in immersing us in the savagery of Glass narrative. Before we can even get our bearings Glass and his expedition led by Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) are attacked arrow to the jugular by Arikara Indians. Casualties are great though Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck). In a style reminiscent of Terrence Malick Glass hallucinates about his dead wife. But the scenes feel more arty than artful. Were relieved when Glass heads into the forest and a scene that will surely blow you away. Im talking about the bear a mama grizzly who lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Early on The Drudge Report mistakenly implied that DiCaprios character was raped by the bear. Everything but. Mama is just defending her cubs. But when she flips Glass over on his back you can hear his bones crack. And then she comes back for more. When she claws at his face Glass looks like something Freddy Krueger left for dead. The sequence is spectacular in every sense of the word. OK the bear is a product of an expert visual-effects team. But not for a second will you doubt youre seeing the real thing. This is one for the time capsule. And the wonders rarely cease. Though Glass resembles a hacked side of beef Henry instructs Fitzgerald and young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) to stay by his side if only to provide a proper burial. Fitzgeralds mercenary reaction can be summed up in two words Fuck that. No one does villainy laced with traces of humanity like Hardy. Pleased to bury Glass alive Fitzgerald heads off to line his pockets. But Glass wont stay buried. He drags his carcass across mountains rivers and rapids to exact retribution for the evil done to him.

You could gripe about the excess of carnage and lack of philosophical substance. But surviving nature is Inarritus subject and he delivers with magisterial brilliance. As does the haunting score by Ryuichi Sakamoto Alva Noto and Bryce Dessner. And then theres DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard his words mostly reduced to grunts he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. Its a virtuoso performance thrilling in its brute force and silent eloquence. Nominated by the Academy for Whats Eating Gilbert Grape The Aviator Blood Diamond and The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio is favored to win this time. But thats not the point. His talent is.

The ones with soaring music blood-thirsty Apache warriors on the march and a clean-cut hero riding hard for justice? Well forget them. Because ""The Revenant"" is more like the pictures we saw during the Nixon years - when the concept of civilization was a dirty joke and the only ""savages"" we saw on screen waved the American flag. Set during the 1820s it stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a stoic back-to-nature guide whos quietly leading a company of fur trappers. Then he runs into a grizzly.The bear gets the worst of it but DiCaprio is badly mauled. At first the rest of the men try to get him home - but he slows them down and theyre worried about attacking tribes. Finally they leave him behind to die. Except DiCaprio survives. And then angrily sets out after them. Its a good story with a basis in fact (it already inspired one of those 70s Westerns Richard Harris ""Man in the Wilderness""). And here director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu adds another layer of mystical meaning with flashbacks hallucinations and some musing on nature. That all feels a bit like Terrence Malick Lite but luckily theyre only brief interruptions in a narrative that DiCaprio pushes forward vigorously and often on his own. Its a fiercely physical nearly silent performance and the taut terse actor conveys endless pain with every wince dogged determination in every squint. Tom Hardy is good too as Fitzgerald the duplicitous trapper whos the most eager to abandon DiCaprio. Once again though hes nearly indecipherable. At least in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Bane had the excuse of that gas mask to talk though - here Hardy sounds like he has a mouth full of cornpone. But theyre locked together fatally - pursuer and pursued - early on and drive the drama as the grimly insistent DiCaprio survives hunger illness and an unexpected ride down the rapids and Hardy retreats further and further into cowardice and deceit. Its all extremely effective culminating in a hand-to-hand battle thats nearly as brutal as the bloody bear attack that begins the film. Still you may find yourself wishing the film werent so unremittingly unforgiving and stubbornly stoic. We learn next to nothing about DiCaprios character and the film rarely pauses for any personal insight into his enemies. As gorgeous as the landscapes are the men who march across them are small and mean and violent. But then again this is not ""How the West Was Won."" This is mostly perhaps how it was. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence gore strong language and a sexual assault. The Revenant (R) Fox (156 min.) (R) Fox (156 min.) Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet How many great scenes does it take to make a great movie? The Revenant a ravishingly violent Western survival yarn from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has a healthy few scattered like acorns across its two-and-a-half-hour canvas. The first is a harrowing woodland skirmish as Ree warriors ambush a hunting party from all sides. Arrows whizz into frame and flesh. Musket fire sends sniping archers tumbling from the treetops. Its like the D-Day invasion of Saving Private Ryan but in reverse with the beleaguered troops retreating to the water instead of charging onto land. And thats arguably just an appetizer for the sequence that arrives a few minutes later when one of the survivors of the massacre famous frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) stumbles into the radius of a mama grizzly and her cubs. Hes mauled half to death for his troubles the grueling battle with the bear unfolding through one of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkis signature single takes.Getting brutalized by a grizzly is the real Hugh Glass claim to fame though his standing in the history books probably rests more comfortably on what (according to legend) happened next Living to tell the (tall?) tale Glass traversed some 200 miles on a broken leg all in pursuit of the companions who left him for dead. To dramatize this 1823 odyssey Inarritu dragged celebrated cast and crew to the rural reaches of Canada and Argentina; over budget and behind schedule he braved inclement weather and shot only by natural light. The Revenant is his Fitzcarraldo a film whose behind-the-scenes agony has become indistinguishable from that of the characters. And yet as with the fractured nonlinear ensemble dramas he used to make with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga theres a sense that the whole doesnt quite equal the sum of the parts no matter how spectacular some of them are. (Even Birdman the directors newly minted Best Picture winner operates best in the moment the illusion of an unbroken shot notwithstanding.)Working loosely from Michael Punkes fictionalized novel The Revenant embellishes some portions of the Glass mythology and chucks others entirely. (One curious omission the hearsay that he staved off gangrene by letting insects feast on his rotten flesh which sounds like exactly the sort of vivid anecdote youd want to preserve.) The most significant liberty concerns the introduction of a fictional half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) whos there when his father is discovered in the South Dakota woods a dead bear collapsed on top of him. Convinced that Glass wont survive more than a couple days the leader of his fur-trapping outfit Captain Henry (a miscast Domhnall Gleeson) assigns two men--the young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and the duplicitous John Fitzgerald (a perfectly cast Tom Hardy)--to stay behind with Hawk and help him bury his old man after he dies. Greed and fear speed that timetable up and soon Glass finds himself in a shallow grave his sons body nearby Fitzgerald and Bridger fleeing the scene of the crime. The real Glass reportedly just wanted his stolen possessions back; this version is out for blood and wont let a few gashes and broken bones stand in his way.And so The Revenant ends up uncomfortably perched between a kind of 19th-century Death Wish movie and a whispery Terrence Malick meditation on the relationship between man and nature. (There are heavy shades of The New World provided not just by Lubezki but also by fellow Malick mainstay Jack Fisk the go-to production designer for ancient American encampments.) Part of the schizophrenia is inherent to the films conception of Glass who comes across both as a mythic force of pure determination and a flesh-and-blood person nursing some serious wounds. His ageless baby face concealed behind a bushy Grizzly Adams beard DiCaprio has been hired to endure endless Method-actor torments to crawl screaming through the mud to bloodily reenact the tauntaun scene from The Empire Strikes Back. What he hasnt been hired to do is play much of a character; though The Revenant supplies Glass with plenty of wordless dreams spiritual visions and flashbacks to his dead loved ones his family life remains as abstract as his psychology. Hes more macho concept than man.Instead of immersing the audience in the six-week journey of this unstoppable folk hero Inarritu crosscuts among several different parties leaving Glass side to periodically check in on Captain Henry and his men closing in on shelter; Fitzgerald and Bridger bickering about the morality of what they did; a largely faceless group of French trappers; and the marauding Ree who its eventually revealed are tracking a kidnapped daughter of the tribe like the stars of an inverted The Searchers. (As with a lot of modern Westerns The Revenant finds a middle ground between the racist vilifying depictions of Native Americans in old Hollywood movies and the romanticized conception of them in films like Dances With Wolves.) Though the chronology remains linear all this geographic leapfrogging recalls the structural strategy of Babel wherein Inarritu labored to draw connections between characters of different cultures. Here its bloodshed and the unforgiving nature of the environment that links everyone; the filmmaker presents an unchained dog-eat-dog America--at once filthy and stunningly beautiful realistically rendered but populated by CGI animals--where everyone is always hunting and/or being hunted.Does such a scattered focus represent a failure of nerve? The Revenant revels in striking imagery (a bell swaying in a hollowed-out church) and bursts of virtuosic violence (a climactic showdown of almost parodic extremity) but it cant seem to commit to the meat of its ""true"" story--namely that long lonely and arduous pilgrimage Glass took from the brink of death to what passed for civilization in his all-but-lawless age. On the other hand given that the solitary procedural passages of The Revenant are among its least distinctive perhaps its for the best that Inarritu didnt try to go the full Werner Herzog (to name another primary influence). Besides keeping the camera locked on DiCaprio would ultimately have deprived us of the films true standout performance Tom Hardy as the weak-willed Fitzgerald. Mumbling in an accent thats somewhere between Bane and Bronson on the intelligibility scale Hardy is the most fascinatingly human character on screen--a rationalizing scoundrel whose selfish behavior lends him more dimension than the impossibly driven superman on his tail. Every time were sharing company with this flawed villain crouched nervously over a fire or scheming in the foliage the wait between jaw-dropping set pieces doesnt seem so protracted.

Entertainment Chris Hemsworth And Leonardo DiCaprio Suffer For Oscars In Their New Movies Both stars try to prove their seriousness as actors in old-timey survival tales In the Heart of the Sea and The Revenant but there is a winner. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Grime-off Chris Hemsworth in In the Heart of the Sea and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant. Warner Bros. Kimberley French / Twentieth Century Fox ID 7539718 Owen Chase a swashbuckling sulky seaman played by Chris Hemsworth has a rough day at work in In the Heart of the Sea. Actually he has a whole bunch of them. To start he gets stuck playing first mate under an inexperienced captain (Benjamin Walker) from a fancy Nantucket family on a voyage he was promised hed get to lead. Then their ship is forced to venture into unknown waters thousands of miles west of South America in search of the whales from which they aim to harvest oil. When the vessel called the Essex is attacked and sunk by a particularly large and ornery whale the remaining sailors starve over months lost at sea eventually resorting to cannibalism to survive.Rough But Chases hardship pales in comparison to what Hugh Glass a gruff frontiersman played by Leonardo DiCaprio goes through in The Revenant. Hes guiding a group of fur trappers through the Dakotas when their numbers are decimated by an Arikara war party and then he gets attacked and energetically mauled by a protective mother bear out in the woods. Hes stitched up and left to die but instead its his kid who passes knifed by the treacherous John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy even less intelligible than usual). Glass crawls his way out of a grave and back through the frigid terrain eating raw meat and tucking himself inside animal corpses Tauntaun-style to keep warm all in order to avenge his sons death. View this image > In the Heart of the Sea Warner Bros. ID 7541923 Why all this lavish hardship in the historical outdoors? Well it is awards season when misery is looked at fondly and misery that takes place safely in the past is looked at with even more affection. In their respective movies Hemsworth and DiCaprio dont just reenact these ordeals they both put themselves through their own minor actorly versions of deprivation in order to play these roles. Hemsworth braved a 500-calorie-a-day diet to pare himself down from Thor-sized to a (more lithe than gaunt honestly) lost-at-sea size. DiCaprio grew a bushy (and as was hilariously rumored by one tabloid possibly flea-infested) beard and weathered a grueling snowy shoot in Canada and Argentina that was supposed to take seven months but ended up spanning closer to a year. They lightly martyred themselves as proof of their dedication to the craft. DiCaprio at least will get another Oscar nomination out of it and in a weak year for leading men he could quite possibly win.The more important question to ask is why anyone would want to watch these man vs. nature endurance trials in which shapeless suffering is offered up as if it has inherent worth. The self-seriousness of these struggles is underscored by the fact that Chase and Glass were both real dudes -- the Essex ordeal would provide fuel for Moby Dick while Glasss life inspired the 2002 Michael Punke novel on which The Revenant is based. Actual men withstood these travails these movies insist and therefore they are worth witnessing even if these men are treated like handsome but grimy hunks of meat desiccating in the South Pacific sun or shivering in a damp bear hide. There is little to them aside from their ability to stay alive even after being menaced by computer-generated beasties a quality that cant even be spun as life-affirming given the grim context in both stories. View this image > In the Heart of the Sea Jonathan Prime / Warner Bros. ID 7541951 Its Hemsworth who gets the lamer deal with In the Heart of the Sea which is directed unmemorably by Ron Howard. The Aussie actor remains better at playing golden gods than he is at scaling down. In Howards last movie the underseen excellent racing rivals drama Rush Hemsworth played James Hunt as a magnetic hedonist. The lazy jungle cat of a man was capable of snapping to attention and totally confident in his skills on the track. In In the Heart of the Sea the actor is splendid when swinging from the sail rigging or harpooning a whale for what the men euphemistically call a ""Nantucket sleighride"" as the wounded animal tries frantically to escape and ends up pulling the boat along with it. But the charisma dissipates when hes bickering with his captain or promising his pregnant wife (Charlotte Riley) hell come home. Chase is a highly resistible working schmo and his angst about being an outsider trying to break into Nantuckets closed society (hes dismissively labeled a ""landsman"") feels as abstract as his clashes with the company men by which hes employed. Hes boring at rest and thats what so much of the latter part of the film is filled with waiting and enduring.The vintage grotesquerie of the regular old whaling process turns out to be more disturbing than the dark adventures that are In the Heart of the Seas reason for being -- the details about stripping the carcass while sharks make the ocean boil then sending the smallest crew member crawling into the head to get the really valuable oil. Once upon a time the world was illuminated by boiled whale -- imagine that. View this image > The Revenant Twentieth Century Fox ID 7542562 Or imagine pelts worth dying for which is the case in the equally archaic industry in which the characters in The Revenant work. Glass and his crew risk their lives trapping in hostile territory and when the Arikara attack them early in the film its to take their skins and sell them to the French. That battle is a sickeningly violent wondrously photographed thing the brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkis camera lurching from one character to another as men are shot or scalped or flee from the melee while also taking the time to look up to where the trees and sky remain impassive to the deaths below. Its a sequence thats as gorgeous as it is terrible.The Revenant which is directed by Birdmans Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is without question a brawny display of filmic beauty that leaves In the Heart of the Sea in the doldroms its unforgiving wilderness shot in stunning unwelcoming natural light. But beneath that its a whole lot of sub-Hemingway tough-guy posturing Another white hero whos more native than the natives lectures his half-Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) on how to keep himself safe among men who despise him because of his race. Glass has a touch of the wounded and otherworldly to him even before his brush with death -- he dreams of his wife murdered by American soldiers whose voiceover whispers give The Revenant the feel of a particularly gory Terrence Malick knockoff. View this image > The Revenant Twentieth Century Fox ID 7542735 Glass is in other words pretty insufferable and you understand why Fitzgerald loathes the guy even though the more refined Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) the man in charge respects him utterly. The wounds Glass receives in the grizzly attack -- another wrenching showy long take -- bring him to a near-animal state DiCaprio drags himself across the snow rasping and groaning in pain cauterizing his own wound with gunpowder.Its visceral and gross like so much of the action that follows but its also so grubbily severely macho that it trembles right on the verge of funny. Thats hardly the only time The Revenants dourness is awfully close to humor -- theres a scene in which Glass and another man eat raw buffalo in the snow while maintaining heated eye contact and another in which he cozily tucks the edges of an eviscerated horse around his head like a hoodie. DiCaprios performance is more an act of athleticism than it is one of any nuance. Glass is a mass of feral reactions crazed eyes staring out of a dirt-smeared face.The Revenant is so prettily constructed that its painful to admit how ridiculous it actually is and how empty it feels to watch a gruff pseudo-mystical Western consisting of two actors method-style grunting their way toward an inevitable showdown in the snow. Like In the Heart of the Sea The Revenant is set in a realm thats entirely female-free save for Glasss ghost wife and an Arikara woman whos kidnapped and raped. Movies dont have to have a gender balance to be good but The Revenants monotonous manliness is part of its weakness -- it isnt about anything other than the savage violent world its so convinced has innate weight to it. Its revenge plot brings no satisfaction and its observations about the indifference of nature are prosaic. Its a movie about survival in which survival seems as meaningless as everything else in its universe.Though The Revenant is a more ambitious film than In the Heart of the Sea in the end the two survival dramas do the same thing They treat struggle as synonymous with substance even though one definitely doesnt guarantee the other.

EntertainmentMovies The Revenant Chills thrills with riveting Leonardo DiCaprio Originally published December 14 2015 at 600 am Updated January 7 2016 at 1109 am A mountain man (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is left for dead in the frigid and harshly beautiful wilderness of ""The Revenant."" (AP) Movie review of ""The Revenant"" In the film Leonardo DiCaprio throws himself into the role of a 19th-century mountain man who is mauled by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions. Rating 4 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Planning to see ""The Revenant""? Wear mittens. Wear also a big thick coat. Preferably one made of bearskin. Ideally one made from the skin of a grizzly like the one that shreds Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) at the start of the picture and leaves him a bloody quivering ruin in a frigid and harshly beautiful wilderness. Leaves him at the brink of death. And then two men -- a weaselly John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and a callow young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) tasked to care for him until he dies -- bury him and leave. And leave behind as well Glass murdered half-Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck). Movie Review    The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Will Poulter Forrest Goodluck. Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu from a screenplay by Inarritu and Mark L. Smith based on a novel by Michael Punke. 156 minutes. Rated R for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images a sexual assault language and brief nudity. Several theaters. Nietzsches declaration ""What does not kill me makes me stronger"" kicks in here because Glass a tough bird is not dead. And being thus abandoned gives him the strength to crawl from his grave and defenseless and damaged lunge forward on his belly through the forest primeval with one all-consuming thought to track down the men who left him and kill them.

Inarritu (""Birdman"") ""The Revenant"" is a tale of man in a state of nature -- a nature in the words of Tennyson ""red in tooth and claw."" Dangers in its tangled woods include hostile Indians rapacious rival fur traders and wild beasts (theres that bear for example a mama defending her cubs from a human interloper). And then theres the weather implacably cold. It seems as if the whole subzero world wants to kill Glass. But stubborn cuss he will not die. Gets off his belly and back on his feet. Falls in rivers. Falls off a cliff. Freezes in a blizzard. Continues forward. Ever forward. DiCaprios performance is an astonishing testament to his commitment to a role. Thats really him plunging into that river. Thats him staggering half-naked through the teeth-chattering cold. Thats him grabbing a fish out of icy waters and eating it raw. Its a performance largely devoid for long periods of words where agony is conveyed by spittle-flecked cries gasps and moans emerging from a torn throat. Filming in remote corners of Alberta Canada; Argentina and Montana director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki captures the wildness of wilderness in a way that leaves the viewer awed and chilled. The frontier of ""The Revenant"" -- mountainous traversed by fast-running rivers covered in woods and filmed using natural light only -- is a pitiless place that inspires astonishment and a kind of reverence at what Inarritu and DiCaprio have accomplished here.

Photo Kimberley French/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Early in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus survival saga The Revenant I gasped ""Bloody hell"" meaning both ""What an amazing filmmaker"" and ""Get me out of here"" The movie is visceral with a side of viscera. The Hollywood columnist who wrote that it was too ""unflinchingly brutal"" for women was justly ridiculed but he did pick up on something thats there Watching it is meant to be a test of a certain kind of ""manliness."" FromA Amores PerrosA to last years award-winningA BirdmanA Inarritu has labored to prove that hes an artist whoA will not flinchA and now hes into nervy swervy single takes (or expert simulations thereof) to intensify your fight-or-flight instincts. He has found a hero ripe for mangling in Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) a real 19th-century explorer and trapper who became famous for surviving an 1823 grizzly attack and abandonment by two members of his expedition tasked to stay with him (they had thought he was a goner). Glass staggered 200 miles over six weeks to inform them of their misperception and was evidently pissed off. But Inarritu ups the vengeance stakes exponentiallyA piling primal horrorA upon primal horror. Hes out to create a frontier myth of biblical proportions. The RevenantA opens with arty flashbacks to an attack on a Pawnee village follows with a soupcon of Native American mysticism and goes in for the kill with an attack on a group of trappers by the Arikara tribe (dubbed the ""Ree""). The ""one-shot"" ballet of butchery begins with an arrow bisecting a mans throat --A thockA -- and then gets more ferocious the camera spinning tilting toward treetops and only just veering clear of arterial spray. This is the sort of sequence in which every time the camera moves close to someone you mentally prepare for a projectile to zoom in from offscreen and tear a path through his kidney. Its almost a relief when the Ree get off their horses and start scalping people -- at least you get a heads up so to speak. But the movies showstopper is the ""one-shot"" mauling of the hero by that mama grizzly who takes a break to check on her cubs before lumbering back for more ripping and chewing. Ive seen thousands of heroes thrown about by thousands of giant monsters and this throwing-about has no equal. (I dont care how it was done -- Id like to keep it a mystery.) Now the bear is deep in the frame now so close that her snout mists the lens (nice touch) her great body rippling with a terrible kind of beauty as she takes her time with her prey -- whos busy trying to reach a musket and insert a bullet with bloodied fingers though you know a single bullet will only make the mammoth creature madder. For Inarritu editing would offer too much existential relief You have to live through it in ""real time."" Every damn second of it. Related Stories What Critics Are Saying About The Revenant What Does aRevenanta Even Mean Anyway? The bulk of the film features the shattered Glass dragging himself across mile after mile of barren tundra somehow staying alive despite roaming Ree freezing temperatures and his own festering infections driven by the need for revenge against a trapper named John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who took something precious from him. Just when you think the ordeal cant last much longer Glass rounds another bend the gray wilderness stretches into the horizon and you know youre in for at least five more minutes of Leo lurching and grunting. Then he comes to the next bend. Many artists make a point of compressing time going from point A to point D to point H while preserving the illusion of fluidity. Inarritu is an A-to-B man. It should be said that there is more than survival at stake. Inarritu has given his hero a fictional teenage Pawnee son named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) whose mother was murdered by white soldiers and whose mistreatment at the hands of Fitzgerald Glass is too incapacitated to stop. The bond with Hawk gives Glass a sort of guest-access pass to the Pawnee spirit world which enables Inarritu to do what he does worst floating apparitions messages from beyond magic realism so clunky that it would embarrass a first-year film student. Hes great with the rough textures of the material world; hes far too literal-minded for the higher realm. In my press notes Inarritu says ""Glasss story asks the questions Who are we when we are completely stripped of everything? What are we made of and what are we capable of?"" I would answer that some of us are capable of crawling a long way with grievous wounds while others are not. Me probably not. Louis Zamperini fromA UnbrokenA certainly. The guy played by James Franco who sawed off his own arm obviously. Matt Damon ""scienc[ing] the shit out of"" something on Mars maybe with help from the global village on Earth. Glass does some self-surgery (though he doesnt treat himself with maggots as the real man reportedly did) falls in with a helpful Native American wanders into a ruined church for the inevitable glimpse of Jesus suffering amid the inhumanity and shoots some people. But mostly he limps and grunts. Stripped of everything hes not thatA interesting. How is DiCaprio? Not much to look at when half-dead but fine when fighting or falling. Hardys character -- hes partially scalped which helps him justify looking out for No.a-1 -- is more fun but the actors face is once again half hidden this time by a heavy beard and his usual muddy diction creates a further layer of distance. Will Poulter has a few anguished moments as the young guy forced to watch Fitzgerald throw Glass in a hole and Domhnall Gleeson supplies some clear-eyed decency as a captain. A subplot that features a Ree warrior searching for his daughter -- likely kidnapped by vile French pig-dogs -- feels shoehorned in. I wont spoil the climax although its spoiled anyway by a bogus have-it-morally-both-ways vengeance. I thinkA The RevenantA is on the whole pain without gain but its certainly a tour ade force -- literally a feat of strength. DiCaprio Inarritu cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubekzi and their collaborators hauled themselves through the Canadian Rockies and deserve what respect one can muster although their artistry is finite a test of will and pyrotechnics and yes traditional masculinity instead of a search for what illuminates mans inhumanity to man. In some ways I prefer Quentin Tarantinos gleeful nihilism to Inarritus holy splatter -- at least Tarantino knows how silly he is. The Revenant. Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Fox. R.

With ""The Revenant"" a revenge saga starring Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life 19th century American frontiersman Hugh Glass Inarritu has brought that kind of intensive focus to the uncharted wilderness and the payoff is a nerve-wracking marvel. A long gripping journey through an unforgiving landscape of exploration and brutal survival ""The Revenant"" is all the more incredible for not needing 3D glasses or a virtual reality helmet to let moviegoers feel fully dropped into the beautiful cold bloody thick of it. Also Read The Revenant Wins Raves at First Screenings As Leonardo DiCaprio Calls It a Beautiful Blur Inspired by Michael Punkes novel which was itself drawn from a true story the movie opens on an encampment of fur trappers on the Upper Missouri led by Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). DiCaprios gruff Glass is the expedition groups expert tracker accompanied by a half-Pawnee son named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) whom he fiercely protects from the taunts and insinuations of Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) an ex-soldier only concerned about pelts-for-cash. After a decimating shoreline attack by Arikara Indians that kills 33 of their men the remaining trappers escape downriver. But when Glass embarks on his own solo scouting mission into the forest hes nearly slaughtered by a cub-defending grizzly in a visceral one-take sequence that ranks as the most horrifying beast-versus-human showdown since Quints bad end in ""Jaws."" (The audio alone might bring nightmares.) Also Read Victor Frankenstein Writer Rips The Revenant as Ultimate in Cinematic Overkill Though still alive the torn-up Glass is considered a goner so Henry tasks Fitzgerald and a young trapper named Bridger (Will Poulter) with staying behind on deathwatch and following through with a proper burial. The mercenary Fitzgerald has other plans though abandoning Glass with an act of betrayal so terrible it gives our mauled hero the Herculean will to live heal and trudge through a treacherous winter until he can exact his vengeance. ""The Revenant"" can perhaps be summed up as elemental plot meet the elements. As basic as the story is (Inarritu adapted with Mark L. Smith) its rendered with an unyielding emphasis on the physical hardship of simply not dying in the face of punishing weather topography and human venality. (Which also sounds like the testimonials that notoriously emerged from the reportedly fraught production.) The bearded DiCaprio long an underrated physical actor throws himself so completely into Glasss never-give-up struggle that his scarred wheezes - much like Timothy Spalls grunts in ""Mr. Turner"" - become their own language of sorts. (Theres not a lot of talking to do when no ones around most of the time.) Hes so convincing as a bear-attack victim driven to animalistic ends that youll believe hed set his own throat on fire with gunpowder to cauterize a wound or conversely stick out his tongue to catch a snowflake in a rare moment of restful levity with helpful Indian Hikuc (Arthur Redcloud) whose path he crosses. DiCaprios ably matched by Hardy turning in another of his gristly portraits of wild-eyed ruthlessness. What more is there to say about two-time Oscar-winner Lubezkis lensing skills that countless moviegoer gasps over the years havent already said? ""The Revenant"" filmed entirely at magic hour is in one sense a painterly ode to that brief time when the sun is either newly emergent or eerily on the wane. But theres more to the visuals than spectacular views (of in this case Argentina Montana and Canada) at optimal moments. For Inarritu and Lubezki the camera is a sinuous probe which in terrain this merciless makes it one more curious creature assessing every image -- Hardys cornered-looking firelit gaze a frozen clearing marked by thin sunlight a thick and misty wood dotted with far off movement -- as threat or lifeline or source of unimaginable wonder. Also Read The Revenant Budget Soars to 135 Million As New Regency Foots the Bill (Exclusive) Consequently the power of this filmmaking pair with their unbroken 360-degree action scenes is in conveying frontline danger so primal you forget about the virtuosic feats of shot-making choreography involved. The technical achievements extend too to veteran production designer Jack Fisks evocative frontier structures Jacqueline Wests richly textured harsh-climate clothing and the seamless effects work. Credit must also go to the melange of atmospheric music by the trio of Bryce Dessner Alva Noto and the great Ryuchi Sakamoto. Is the relentlessness too much? At two and a half hours perhaps but inventiveness abounds. Rather than deliver one more triumph-of-the-human-spirit yarn Inarritu wisely sticks to the convulsive hot-breath bleakness of determined endurance. Less successful in fact are Inarritus holistic Malick-ian moments in which Glass hallucinates about his dead Pawnee wife. They reach for consciously arty spirituality when the sheer totality of Glasss return from deaths door -- as gory and violent as it often is -- allows ""The Revenant"" one of the years best pictures to make cinematic fire and to forge its own strange rugged thrilling grace.

His character does however get savagely mauled and torn to bloody ribbons by a giant grizzly - and its one of the most terrifyingly realistic relentlessly brutal and astoundingly conjured scenes Ive seen in any movie this year. When it was over it took me a few minutes to lift my jaw off my lap. Released less than a year after he walked off with Best Picture and Best Director Oscars for Birdman his whirligig meta-parlor game about the wages of fame The Revenant marks Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus return to the big screen with a vengeance. Literally. Its an epic about the existential extremes human beings will go to for revenge. Well that and witnessing one of Hollywoods biggest stars endure a Passion of the Christ-style beating from man beast and nature. DiCaprio plays a real-life 19th century hunter named Hugh Glass whos first shown stalking along a stream in some untamed corner of the American West staring down the barrel of a rifle at a moose. The majestic quiet of the outdoors the gentle burbling of the water the whispered voiceovers on the soundtrack - all of these cues seem to be Inarritus way of signaling that for the next two-and-a-half hours he will be working in the key of Terrence Malick. But before the audience can settle in and commune with the divine glory of nature the director just as suddenly hurls us into a bloody scrum of man-made chaos and violence. Glass camp of white fur trappers is raided by Native Americans who seem to appear from nowhere. The carnage is violent and crazed and sloppy with blood like the opening moments of Saving Private Ryan with arrows instead of bullets. Glass and everyone sitting in the theater watching is lucky to make it out alive. Glass is and isnt a member of this ornery group of pelt traders. He and his young half-Native American son (whom he speaks to in Pawnee) have been hired to guide them to ""the edge of the world."" (The film was shot in the snowy wilderness outside of Calgary). And over time as Glass tragic backstory including the savage death of his Native American wife is gradually revealed (although never enough of it) its clear that this rugged Jeremiah Johnson figure stands apart from the trappers greed and self-interest most menacingly embodied by Tom Hardys half-scalped and half-mad Fitzgerald. While Glass tries to lead the men back to the warmth and safety of civilization hes viciously attacked by the grizzly bear and barely escapes alive. His throat is slashed his back is butterflied open and his bones are pulverized all of which is enough for Hardys Fitzgerald to quickly suggest they leave him for dead. But the groups leader (played by Domhnall Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald and a shell-shocked greenhorn (Will Poulter) to stay behind with Glass nurse him back to health and join back up if and when he recovers. The two men carry Glass as far as they can but Fitzgerald is really just buying time until he can get rid of their wounded guide and his son. He wants to collect his money and move on. At the risk of spoiling too much Fitzgerald gives Glass more than enough reason to will himself back from the dead so he can track the heartless avaricious bastard down and get payback. Thats more or less the story. Its an epic adventure writ small. And for some that may be enough. But I suspect others will leave The Revenant wishing there was a little more narrative meat on the bone. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Inarritus savage endurance test of a film almost works better as a series of stunning images and surreal sequences than as an emotionally satisfying story. Like their collaboration on Birdman Inarritu and Lubezki are taking chances with their camera--chances no doubt made even more difficult by working with only natural light in frigid conditions. But it pays off giving the film a singularly strange and haunting beauty. DiCaprio immerses himself into the nearly silent role of Glass. Hes like Job in a fur coat being put through natures wringer with nothing but a few lines of dialogue and the agony etched onto his face at his disposal. When he does talk his voice reduced to a pained rasp you feel the weight of his words ""I aint afraid to die anymore ... I done it already."" What made Inarritus Birdman so singular and magical was the way his characters frantic inner lives meshed with the virtuosic chaos of the directors bob-and-weave shooting style. They worked in harmony to help tell the story of a man coming undone. Here story and style never quite get on the same page. Theyre not even really in the same chapter. The Revenant is full of indelible images and unforgettable scenes but theres also a frustrating chilliness that seems to gust in right off the screen. Its a movie thats so focused on dazzling your eyes that it never quite finds its way into your heart.

TWITTER 12/25/2015 Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a man struggling to survive in the wild in Alejandro G. Inarritus bloody bruising frontier epic. A traditional Old West survival-and-revenge tale assumes the dimensions of a harrowing voyage to the American frontiers heart of darkness in The Revenant. Pushing both brutal realism and extravagant visual poetry to the edges of what one customarily finds in mainstream American filmmaking director/co-writer Alejandro G. Inarritu cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and a vast team of visual effects wizards have created a sensationally vivid and visceral portrait of human endurance under very nearly intolerable conditions; this is a film that makes you quite glad to have been born in a century with insulation and central heating. The combination of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy the director and critical enthusiasm in most quarters will make this Fox release a must for audiences in search of cinematic red meat (something the story offers up in abundance and mostly uncooked) although vegetarians and viewers with otherwise delicate constitutions could spend half their time squirming with their sweaters pulled up over their eyes. For a director who normally takes several years between films Inarritu has remarkably turned around his most ambitious physical production within just one year of his awards-laden Birdman. Even the untutored eye would quickly recognize this as the work of the same key talents; The Revenant may use plenty of cuts and is set nearly entirely outdoors but the fluid prowling sometimes gasp-inducing camera moves along with the great depth of field are the same. And both films are about men on the brink in severe extremis a condition that helps justify and sustain Inarritus artistic high-wire act. Its Jeremiah Johnson meets Apocalypse Now. Read more Leonardo DiCaprios The Revenant Debuts Brutal Gory Oscar-Bound? (Analysis) Set in 1823 in the Rockies less than two decades after Lewis and Clark led their map-altering continent-opening expedition through the territory the story is based on actual people whose real names are used in the film as well as in Michael Punkes 2002 novel upon which the script is quite accurately described as being ""based in part."" In a way the biggest difference between the novel and the film is that the former is aided by a map very specific descriptions of the proximity of rivers forts and other landmarks which provide clear indications of how far the gravely injured hero must travel to get to what might pass for civilization in this context but certainly not in any other. Inarritu shares screenplay credit with Mark L. Smith whose prior creative endeavors lie in the realm of low-budget horror (Seance the Vacancy duo The Hole) and the script immediately ups the storys existential ante by deliberately not revealing how long a journey mountain man Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) might be facing or whether he has any realistic hope of finding any place with a roof over it. On top of this any temptation to provide the central character with interior monologues to reveal his anguished thoughts and feelings has been resisted; for most of the running time he is limited to expressing himself via painful grunts and cries and very heavy breathing. A startling early skirmish between the local Pawnee tribe and a contingent of white trappers serves notice as to the level of brutal realism the film intends to deliver; the whoosh and sudden impact of arrows may never have been more vividly rendered nor perhaps the sense of panic confusion horse speed and arbitrariness of who survives and who does not. Glass who previously served as the inspiration for the title character played by Richard Harris in director Richard C. Sarafians conspicuously less compelling Man in the Wilderness in 1971 is a man of two worlds. He has lived with the Pawnees for some time speaks their language married a native woman and is raising their son but by virtue of knowledge of the territory hes highly valued by the hunting expedition led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Read more The Revenant and The Hateful Eight How Much Blood and Guts Will Oscar Voters Endure? Their ranks decimated and with winter closing in the white men decide to head back which brings on the scene 25 minutes in that which no one who sees it will soon forget (and which will certainly pass through the mind of any viewer who in future takes a hike through bear country). While taking a rest in the forest Glass is charged by a mother grizzly bear. The man injures her with the one shot he gets off from his long-barreled rifle but then can do nothing as the incensed creature slaps claws bites rips open and steps on him with her giant paws before retreating. Beyond the sheer terror she provokes the bears behavior is fascinating to observe; for a good while she sniffs and assesses her adversary closely both in the manner of a cook judging the seasoning of a dish and a kid deciding about whether to play with a toy any longer. She retreats ... and then comes back for more. Previous renditions of such interspecies hand-to-hand battles have invariably been conveyed via a flurry of quick cutting to convey violent action while concealing the lack of real contact. Thanks to extraordinary visual effects work Inarritu can deliver this scene with an unprecedented degree of realism in a single shot the impact of which is devastating. Its the latest and most startling example of the most sophisticated technology used in the cause of ultrarealism as opposed to fantasy. The physical result of the bears assault looks like something you normally find hanging in a meat locker. The last words Glasss wife said to him before she died were ""keep breathing"" and its a command the man struggles to obey even when no one expects him to live. When weather and steep terrain make carrying the invalid impossible the departing party leaves two men to tend to him the hulking ill-tempered John Fitzgerald (Hardy) and earnest youngster Jim Bridger (Will Poulter). But after a couple of days the duplicitous Fitzgerald all but buries Glass alive and abandons him as winter begins to close in eventually lying to Henry that Glass died. Glass struggle to survive occupies the core of the story and its a compelling harrowing sometimes challenging ordeal to behold something beyond the reach of most mortals. Deprived even of his weapons by Fitzgerald wracked with pain and wheezing with every breath the man cant even walk at first and is reduced to dragging himself inch by excruciating inch in search of food places to rest and ways to keep himself from freezing. Little by little he finds ways to cope starting a small fire catching fish by hand curling up inside a warm animal carcass. Glass encounters evidence of other violence involving the Sioux as well as a French trapping expedition and there are visually astounding moments when the man gets swept down a series of rapids in a frigid river (DiCaprio and five personal stunt doubles doubtless suffered the consequences) and goes over a cliff on horseback (which Inarritu and Lubezki contrived to cover in an uncut take). The wonders never cease. Read more Leonardo DiCaprio on ""Agonizing"" Revenant Shoot I Was ""Sleeping in Animal Carcasses"" After about an hour of screen time Glass manages to make his way to the fort exposing Fitzgeralds lie. But his deceptions know no limits and he makes his escape which obliges Glass to set out once again in attempt to achieve revenge and justice in an elaborate and gory Western mano a mano. The very different settings may disguise the fact but the recent film The Revenant actually resembles a great deal is Gravity the outer space smash directed by Inarritus friend and colleague Alfonso Cuaron. Both are solitary survival stories set in deeply inhospitable environments where human beings cannot survive without the aid of man-made equipment not to mention uncanny resourcefulness. Both are projects dependent upon the long-term commitment and charisma of a top star to get them made the advances in special visual effects to make them seamlessly credible and the brilliance of cinematographer Lubezki to provide the highest level of visual astonishment. Both projects were big gambles even for filmmakers as accomplished as these two to take on. And they both pulled them off. Obscured by heavy animal skins a scruffy beard and even longer hair DiCaprio perseveres with a deeply committed characterization that embodies reserves of strength resilience imagination fortitude and righteousness all attributes required for long-term survival in the earliest days on the North American frontier. Sporting a bizarre accent that could be described as pre-hillbilly specked with traces of indeterminate lower-class 19th century urban the equally disheveled-looking Hardy creates a genuinely disturbing character whose primary trait is untrustworthiness on a psychotic level. This year alone the actor has created at least four memorable big screen characterizations in which you cant really understand everything he says and Hardy far exceeds the basic requirement for this role which was to portray a man so despicable that the audience desperately wants to see him get his just desserts. Gleeson and Poulter are very good in the principal other roles of note. Inarritu makes the interesting decision to break the fourth wall so to speak in three instances to acknowledge the presence of the camera in relation to the actors. Not once but twice he gets in so close to DiCaprio that the actors breath fogs the lens. The director presumably could have chosen alternate takes but decided to use these; its difficult to think of other examples of this happening in a major Hollywood feature. Then at a very key moment DiCaprio looks right into the lens a move that throws you for a split-second but then achieves the greater effect of establishing a more intense relationship with the suffering Glass has endured. Lubezkis camera wizardry has been duly noted and rewarded for years and his extraordinary work here under hugely difficult conditions will only add to his laurels. Inarritu went out of his way to select locations (mostly in the mountains north of Calgary Alberta then in Argentina for the climactic sequence when the snow melted early in Canada) that had never been seen in the cinema before. The intention was to create the feeling of virgin territory land unfamiliar to the white characters as well as the audience. Using very short lenses to produce great depth of field Lubezki shot entirely with natural light which mostly but not entirely results in soft grayish skies that due to the season seem only half-lit. It has been noted before but The Revenant indicates more than any film Lubezki has shot the influence of the Russian team of director Mikhail Kalatozov and cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky on his work. The Cranes Are Flying and I Am Cuba are well known in the United States Letter Never Sent (1959) less so but its the latter films amazing long often hand-held takes moving through dense brush forests (at one point on fire) lakes downpours and snow storms that clearly look like early models for what Lubezki achieves and admittedly surpasses here. Having handled such notable prior evocations of frontier America as Days of Heaven The New World and There Will Be Blood production designer Jack Fisk is entirely in his element here as is another Terrence Malick regular costume designer Jacqueline West. The score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto with additional music by Bryce Dessner is effectively ominous and grim.

Review The Revenant is Brilliantly Directed But Does That Make It a Great Movie? Eric Kohn Dec 4 2015 400 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk READ MORE Go Behind the Scenes of The Revenant ""The Revenant"" marks the rare instance of a brilliantly directed half-baked movie. Director Alejandro G. Inarritus highly anticipated followup to ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" trades that movies ironic wit for a bloody revenge tale thats self-serious and absurd at once pitting top-notch craft with muddled ideas. An obvious bid for next-level action-survivalist material ""The Revenant"" so aggressively pursues that task that its impossible not to get yanked into the wild viscerally unnerving ride. The grisly account of nineteenth century explorer Hugh Glass -- left for dead in the South Dakota wilderness after a near-fatal bear attack -- it presents that dilemma in wonderfully dynamic terms The ever-reliable Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki reteams with Inarritu to craft a series of astoundingly intense sequences aided in large part by a ferocious turn by Leonardo DiCaprio as the abandoned lead. Its a bracing alternative to unimaginative studio blockbusters but marred by the lingering sense that its never much more than that. Glass provides a fascinating entry point for reexamining the American frontier and not only because of the unusual conditions of his heavily mythologized plight. When the movie begins the explorer has been tasked with aiding a group of fur traders through the trepidatious forest as winter sets in; his teenage son the offspring of an ill-fated marriage to a Native American woman stays close by. That unlikely combo provides a compelling opportunity for DiCaprio to sample a few lines of indigenous dialogue with his characters offspring and suggests a unique complication of the traditional cowboys-and-Indians trope through a revisionist lens. But such a possibility is short-lived Soon enough Glass is left alone to fend for himself at which point most of the Native American figures are reduced to little more than scowling vicious plot devices. Needless to say ""Meeks Cutoff"" this is not Rather than complicating the relationship between American settlers and various tribes ""The Revenant"" presents the latter group as fearsome one-note companions wielding vicious tools and beastly tempers. This mainly points to a lack of sophistication in the storytelling as a whole since the movie does contain attempts to convey genuine bonds between the two groups. But these token acknowledgments feel oddly forced particularly once Glass teams up with another nomadic sort whose world has been destroyed by the white man. The abrupt music cue when the pair realize they have something in common plays like the worst kind of dime store political correctness. Still ""The Revenant"" remains deeply involving so long as it grimly focuses on Glass largely wordless tribulations as he crawls and limps his way through the frosty landscape surviving various physical ordeals in the process. Nearly every possible permutation of wilderness problems get tossed his way That harrowing protracted bear showdown; daunting cliffs; streaming arrows; merciless streams; you name it. Lubezkis camera gets close to the action and never flinches which underscores Inarritus commitment to excessive mayhem at every turn. The bear attack stands out as the essence of the central filmmaking scheme The monstrous creature destroys Glass body in grotesque detail not once or twice but three times -- look out here it comes again -- and its both extraordinary and exhausting to sit with Glass the whole way through. Buried under a mangy beard and frozen grimace DiCaprio delivers the most physically involving role of his career and if the two-and-half-hour narrative were more tightly contained its easy to imagine him carrying it on his bloody shoulders alone. But the movie struggles with opposing tendencies by simultaneously reaching for heavy-handed lyricism and amping up ridiculous archetypes of anti-heroes and villains like a Terrence Malick movie stuffed into the mold of ""Apocalypto."" Subtlety has never been Inarritus strong suit. Previous efforts ""Biutiful"" and ""Babel"" attempted to craft sullen drama out of crude scenario with infuriating simplicity. That shortcoming was mollified in ""Birdman"" due to the playful manner in which overstatement was baked into the material. At times ""The Revenant"" gets away with that too. Inarritu delivers a series of macabre encounters but falls short on surrounding them with a compelling story. At one point Glass witnesses a fiery arrow plummeting downward which mirrors a recurring image from ""Birdman."" Here however the connotations of an overeager creator whose outsized intentions come crashing down to earth seem accidental. Eventually ""The Revenant"" settles into a basic routine. With Glass on the mend the plot essentially comes down to his path toward vengeance as he sets his sights on the two-bit criminal (Tom Hardy) responsible for leaving him behind. Other men of varying ethical standing such as Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) as the groups well-intentioned leader suffer from underwritten material. The strengths of ""The Revenant"" lie with Glass and any cutaway automatically lowers its appeal. Thats not to say it doesnt generate plenty of anticipation throughout but the story keeps sagging until the unimaginative climactic showdown. Accept it as one of the best-directed action movies of the year (second only to ""Mad Max Fury Road"") and Inarritu has done a great service to an underserved genre. Yet no amount of ingenious camerawork and breakneck pacing can obscure a simplistic core. Ultimately the ambition of ""The Revenant"" overshadows its big moments. If ""Birdman"" is about the quest for artistic transcendence ""The Revenant"" illustrates the never-ending conundrum of chasing it. Grade B ""The Revenant"" opens wide on December 25.

Reply Greg Collins May 12 2016 352 pm I just saw ""The Revenant"". Your review might have upset me more if I hadnt enjoyed the movie so much. Compared to the experience of the movie your critique shrivels into an exercise in ""but this"" and ""but that"". Youve ground your axe; now shut up. Reply Sam May 12 2016 352 pm Good review. The movie was a bunch of epic macho drivel. Reply Nick May 12 2016 352 pm Great review here I cant disagree with any point made. The movie was enjoyable but suffered from far too many cliches and lack of imagination throughout. Beautifully filmed simplistically written. ""Subtlety has never been Inarritus strong suit"" summed up my thoughts exactly. Reply Mik May 12 2016 352 pm I want to be dumb as Inarritu and make great experiences. Mr. Khon please do other things you are not good at this. Reply A.J. May 12 2016 352 pm Mr. Kohn your article asks if it is a great movie. Your article also says review. Nobody wants to know who you think is going to win Best Picture or what you think about Mad Max because lets face it the films could not be more different. Just like both movies cannot compare to Carol Spotlight or Inside Out. You owe it to your readers to offer objective journalistic reviews and keep your obsessions with yourself.

If this guy thinks that The Revenant is a mediocre movie in any way i recommend to start watching more movies Reply Juan May 12 2016 352 pm What a pretentious review. Does everyone in Indiewire thinks that the script in a movie is just the dialogue written on paper??? Because it seems like it. This guy says the history is simplistic you mean that having and spiritual journey through nature in extreme conditions to find the man who kill your son and left you to die is simplistic??? Reply Argos May 12 2016 352 pm I was very excited when I first saw the trailer for ""The Revenant"" but once it said it was a movie from Inarritu my excitement went down considerably as I kinda knew the type of movie it was going to be and I was not wrong a pretentious slow tedious movie for cinema hipsters that like to put extra mustard on their hot dog and boast about it. Some people are making a big deal about the visuals but even those got pretentious with the use of some weird wide lens on some scenes that is too distracting and over the top; and if youre like some people that saw the movie with me youre going to get headaches. Lubezki is a great cinematographer but it seems like some of the self grandeur of Inarritu is also rubbing on him. The story is nothing special either revenge and not a even a good one. The only scene that I liked was the one with the bear and thats about it. By the time the movie was over I was glad; and unlike some movies that are longer than 2 hours but go by fast and you end up all excited and kinda let down that its over this one really did feel the drag of two hours and then some. And of course theres the question about this possibly being the one that gives DiCaprio the Oscar an issue that has become something like the elephant in the room. If you ask me no this is not the one and if he gets it then it confirms that the Oscars are more a popularity contest -or hes a ""winner by pitty""- than about actually deserving the statue. The Oscar is about acting first and being physical later if required but it was the other way around with The Revenant. He did a better job in The Wolf of Wall Street as far as pure acting goes. In short another movie from Inarritu. If you like his grandeur awww my gawwddd the seventh art worship house of cinemaaaa style go for it. I obviously dont like it and hence I didnt like this movie either. Reply Dave May 12 2016 352 pm t was a physically and emotionally demanding role for every actor and if Leo deserves a nomination than definitely Tom Hardy should; damn good performance Reply yizus May 12 2016 352 pm Zamp;EACUTE; tu eres el imbecil no sabes de cine y tienes tan poco criterio como el autor de este post no saben de cine eso se nota pero lo mas notorio es su estupidez cero credibilidad a indie were asi como tabatha dickinson en birdman mete tu critica por el culo. Reply J.C May 12 2016 352 pm ""What does it take to become a critic anyway?"" - Birdman. Thats for you sir. An overstatement baked into the material. Reply QBlume May 12 2016 352 pm ...ripped to shreds for this Reply QBlume May 12 2016 352 pm I know Im probably gonna get ripped to shreds for in most of the years DiCaprio has been nominated he was out-performed by the person who he lost to (cant speak for 1994 because I havent seen The Fugitive) but this seem like it could be the role that finally gets him the win (hes become a critical darling this will be his 5th try Its a physically and emotionally demanding role and hes being directed by another critic darling who just won this year). Reply Kevin May 12 2016 352 pm The comment about Native Americans is odd since it ignores a key role played by a Native American and also the motivation of the larger group. The Revenant is indeed a simple movie and I could see it winning Best Director Best Cinematography Best Score Best Actor but not Best Picture. But the sheer technical majestry and the degree of difficulty of shooting with nothing but natural light make it a must see for any film fan. Reply David Topper May 12 2016 352 pm enrique no I wont. He is my fourth favourite director of all time and Mirror is in my top 10 films. So your arguement is invalid. To me Birdman felt like an annoying rehash of the brilliant All That Jazz. Now thats a perfect film about the stage Reply chickmitchell May 12 2016 352 pm But you guys The Revenant really isnt that good. Its like that movie THE EDGE with Anthony Hopkins except imagine if that movie was interrupted like 20 times throughout with that one scene from GLADIATOR where Russell Crowe is in that wheat field dreaming about his dead family over and over again and each time the scene happens again it gets more absurd. Thats what The Revenant is like. It wouldve been better if it didnt try to act like it was anything more than a pulpy gritty revenge movie in the wilderness. But since Innaritu is the Oscar golden boy now he feels the need to make everything in his movies ""deep"" and ""important"" but only in a strictly superficial sense that blatantly calls attention to its own ""deepness"" and ""importance"". Birdman was better. Reply Jose esparza May 12 2016 352 pm Im still going to go see it. Some critics want movies there way . they act like they know about filming . they know nothing about filming thats why they only critics Reply Soroush May 12 2016 352 pm Stop hating on the critic guys. Different critics have different tastes and its the audiences job to find a critic that suites them individually. A review like this actually supports the movie as Nicholas Winding Refn put it you know youve made a great a movie when you divide the audience... All the greatest films have had this effect (from Kubrick to Malick). Innarritu and chivo are much the same and will be recognised decades from now for their supremacy. Reply Avenger07 May 12 2016 352 pm Whats boring is to even try to read trough this review misleading since you open almost praising it and then you trash it since I know that once you find a darling film like you guys did with last years boyhood and trash the rest it is very obvious and pathetic how youve decided The Revenant is not your cup of tea this year. Reply Josh May 12 2016 352 pm Oh great. Indiewire has been invaded by the attack of the Little Leo Fangurls... I hope your idol gets an Oscar so all of you can shut the f up. Reply Enrique May 12 2016 352 pm David Topper You seem like the kind of guy who would even call Tarkovskys films ""too full of themselves"" Reply Enrique May 12 2016 352 pm This review contains political correctness. Reply David Topper May 12 2016 352 pm Well birdman was so overrated annoying and full of itself and inaritus films so far have been mostly far too full of themselves as well so I think this might be as well. Ill still see this though seeing as I liked amores perros and 21 grams Reply Erik Garcia May 12 2016 352 pm So you have a gripe with the fact that the Native American warrior tribe is portrayed as warriors? Do you think that wasnt a reality back in the day? Granted the Americans did the same thing to the Natives but The Revenent talks about that as well with the ""friendly"" native character. Ugh political correctness Reply E May 12 2016 352 pm This reviews need to find flaws in the film is transparent. Too high expectations perhaps? Movie is what it is and damn does it look awesome. I just dont feel like its a good thing watching half a dozen of there trailers and clips and tv-spots and whatever before actually seeing the movie. I think there is no need posting these trailer breakdowns rumours and set photos at all because they change the values we expect from the final product. You guys overhype a lot I tell you. Reply lulu May 12 2016 352 pm Its Inarritus deadly seriousness I usually have a problem with 21 Grams Babel amp; Biutiful just sank for me under the weight of earnest self importance. Also the Malick comparisons Im hearing dont help convince me this is the vibrant unique movie I was hoping for after Birdman. Reply Em May 12 2016 352 pm I dont know why we should trust you guys to give this film a fair review. The way that you tore into Birdman last year was hilarious. Your endorsement of Boyhood made for extra negativity towards the other films. I chose to skip actually reading the review and will wait to see the film to make a proper judgment. Reply No May 12 2016 352 pm ""Yet no amount of ingenious camerawork and breakneck pacing can obscure a simplistic core."" All due respect nobody placing Mad Max Fury Road as their 6 film of the year has any business leveling a complaint like that at The Revenant. Like come on. Mad Max is a glorified Michael Bay movie with a dash of more elegant formal panache but an even more one-note and repetitive premise. Reply ze May 12 2016 352 pm those comments are almost as dumb as inarritu Reply Jon May 12 2016 352 pm I agree with both of you John and Elena. Ive learned not to take these reviews too seriously as I have also noticed a trend of hyping up a movie all year and then tearing it apart I the review. Makes me think of the scene in Birdman when Riggan tears into the critic lol. Reply Elena May 12 2016 352 pm Oh goody So nice to sit in you ""Ivory Tower"" (film critique) and spew out all this garble. I challenge YOU to physically go out there and make it all HAPPEN. I know. Thats your Job. To critique. But hell - this has gone beyond the pale. The story - as well as Di DiCaprios highly emotive interpretation of the story - is what movie goers want to see and experience -not an intellectual breakdown of each and every scene. Most of all; do I walk out of the cinema a changed person after having watched this movie or not? I would hope so This is whats storytelling is all about (not some ""pen-pushers"" muddled idea of what it should be. Well done to Director Alejandro G. Inarritus Keep being creative expanding and trans formativejust as the way you are. Bugger the rest (- Great story brilliant performance excellent execution Reply John Doe May 12 2016 352 pm Oh look more pretentious clickbait Boring review.

Inarritus Survival Epic | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Revenant Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 100 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of 20th Century Fox December 4 2015 | 0100PM PT Leonardo DiCaprio plays an avenging 19th-century frontiersman in Alejandro G. Inarritus brutal beautiful yet emotionally stunted epic. Few prestige directors have so fully committed to the notion of cinema as an endurance test as Alejandro G. Inarritu and he pushes himself the audience and an aggrieved 19th-century frontiersman well beyond their usual limits in ""The Revenant."" Bleak as hell but considerably more beautiful this nightmarish plunge into a frigid forbidding American outback is a movie of pitiless violence grueling intensity and continually breathtaking imagery a feat of high-wire filmmaking to surpass even Inarritu and d.p. Emmanuel Lubezkis work on last years Oscar-winning ""Birdman."" Yet in attempting to merge a Western revenge thriller a meditative epic in the Terrence Malick mold and a lost-in-the-wilderness production of near-Herzogian insanity ""The Revenant"" increasingly succumbs to the air of grim overdetermination that has marred much of Inarritus past work Its an imposing vision to be sure but also an inflated and emotionally stunted one despite an anchoring performance of ferocious 200% commitment from Leonardo DiCaprio. Hard to recognize though he may be under so much blood grime and unwashed mountain-man mane DiCaprio will boost the commercial prospects of Foxs not-so-merry Christmas Day release which will lean heavily on its award-friendly pedigree to overcome audience resistance to its considerable length and extreme carnage. While the many many acts of human and animal savagery are doled out judiciously over the 156-minute running time theyre attenuated to a brutal can-you-top-this degree captured in the long unbroken takes that have become Inarritu and Lubezkis visual signature (though minus the one-shot digital gimmickry of ""Birdman""). The result is a film of robust overwhelming physicality filled with striking passages of pure cinema yet ultimately in thrall to a crude self-admiring sensibility that keeps catharsis at bay. The film was adapted by Inarritu and Mark L. Smith from Michael Punkes 2002 fact-based novel which is set in 1823-24 in the territories that now make up the Dakotas Montana Wyoming and Nebraska. While the film never specifies exactly where and when its taking place (shooting took place in Canada and Argentina) it faithfully centers around a fictionalized version of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) a real-life man of the West who works for the Rocky Mountain Fur Co. skillfully guiding beaver trappers deep into hostile terrain. Theirs is a life of hard work scarce rations and frequent peril as we witness firsthand when the men are attacked without warning by Arikara warriors. The film establishes its stylistic approach immediately in this harrowing early sequence beginning with a single unbroken shot in which tension mounts by the second only to be relieved by the arrow that comes hurtling out of nowhere to connect with a mans throat. As the surviving trappers flee with whatever pelts they can salvage we feel not just ambushed but surrounded -- by the attackers lurking just off screen by the dense trees looming in Lubezkis deep-focus compositions and perhaps most of all by the astonishing sound design which transforms the music of babbling brooks rustling trees thunderous hoofbeats falling bodies and anguished screams into a wild symphony of woodland chaos. These sounds will be joined in due course by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Notos artfully modulated never-repetitive score which begins as a series of low synth-like rumbles that gather melodic force and power as the film progresses. In short ""The Revenant"" must be appreciated first and foremost as a sensory and aesthetic marvel a brutal hymn to the beauty and terror of the natural world that exerts a hypnotic pull from the opening frame. Its deficiencies as a human drama and a metaphysical meditation will take a bit longer to emerge. Glass is traveling with his teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) a descendant of the Pawnee tribe on his mothers side and the two regard each other with an understandably fierce protectiveness. The other trappers led by the principled Capt. Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) prove respectful enough of father and son with the singular exception of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a nasty neer-do-well who makes no secret of the fact that his commitment to the partys mission is purely mercenary. And so theres trouble afoot even before Glass ventures out alone and is mauled by a mammoth grizzly bear in what must surely be the most squirmingly visceral scene of an animal attack on a human committed to the screen all the more realistic and protracted for being shot in a single take. Glass kills the bear but not before it all but kills him leaving horrific wounds in his chest back and throat and rendering him unable to speak or walk. The arduous task of carrying the injured party over the rocky and eventually snowy terrain soon threatens the partys safety and its decided that Glass will be left behind with Hawk Fitzgerald and a young man Jim Bridger (Will Poulter excellent) so that he can receive a proper burial when he inevitably dies. Things dont go according to plan to say the least and the full murderous measure of Fitzgeralds ruthlessness is revealed as he kills Hawk and leaves Glass for dead with the pitiably naive Bridger in tow. But the lust for vengeance becomes its own form of survival instinct and Glass manages to claw his way out of a shallow grave find food water and shelter and stay alive long enough for his wounds to begin to heal. Since his character can barely talk -- and has almost no one to talk to -- DiCaprio must convey Glass interior journey almost entirely through grunts wheezes and sharp pained exhalations of breath (often misting up the camera in poetic closeups). Often he does this while dragging his clawed and battered body over rocks and soil -- a preferrable method of transport really to being washed downstream by a turbulent river or vaulted off a cliff on the back of a horse. These and other unimaginable detours plus the near-constant threat of death from predators starvation and exposure coalesce into a potent study of human endurance and isolation that makes up the films strong midsection (finely assembled by Inarritus regular editor Stephen Mirrione). An unofficial retread of Richard C. Safarians ""Man in the Wilderness"" (1971) which starred Richard Harris as Glass Inarritus film deviates enough from Punkes novel to have warranted a ""based in part"" credit and several of the changes involve the various indigenous characters hovering on the periphery of the drama -- including Hikuc (Navajo actor Arthur Redcloud) a traveler who comes to Glass aid and Elk Dog (Duane Howard) an Arikara warrior trying to track down his daughter Powaqa (Melaw Nakehko) who has been captured by a band of French trappers. But the most significant alteration here is the wholesale invention of Hawk -- a touch that aims to humanize Glass nudge him closer to the right side of history and instill in him an even more primal hunger for revenge. Yet through no fault of DiCaprios or Goodlucks the father-son relationship never develops sufficient emotional conviction to achieve the desired impact; its immediately clear that Hawk exists solely so he can die and as in any melodrama pivoting on the loss of a child provide an extra twist of the emotional knife. Here and there Inarritu employs ghostly flashbacks and hallucinations to convey Glass love for Hawk and his Pawnee mother but these visions feel like spectral banalities -- and a reminder in some respects of the communing-with-the-dead antihero of ""Biutiful."" While ""The Revenant"" is many cuts above that career nadir it does mark the directors return to the same glum mood of near-cosmic despair (also apparent in ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"") after his rare foray into cynical showbiz comedy with ""Birdman."" In all these films the virtuosity of the storytelling cant quite disguise a leadenness and lack of modulation that suggest Inarritus chief talent is for bludgeoning his audience -- sometimes artfully sometimes merely artily -- into submission. The final reckoning between Glass and Fitzgerald is grippingly staged and audiences hoping to see payback exacted in full will find satisfaction. But here and elsewhere Lubezkis camera with its creeping darting movements and stealthy 360-degree turns doesnt seem to observe the action so much as instigate it. The long-take action sequences begin to feel almost sadistic in their pre-planning. Developments that should be shocking instead take on an air of grinding predictability. And at every step the performances suggest a behind-the-scenes experience that couldnt have been much less arduous than the characters on-screen ordeal. Whether hes sinking his teeth into freshly killed meat cauterizing his wounds with a torch or stripping naked and sheathing himself in a still-warm animal carcass DiCaprio has never been this feral or suffered for his art quite so vividly on screen. His frequently wordless stripped-to-the-bone turn may not match the live-wire energy and inventiveness of his histrionics in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" but its as scrupulously agonizingly detailed a portrait of human suffering as you could ever want to see. Hardy whose dialogue is perhaps the least intelligible element of the sound design makes a coolly unnerving villain whose ruthlessness lies in his gift for bullying persuasion as well as his brute strength. He has another excellent on-screen opponent in Gleeson (having quite a year with ""Ex Machina"" ""Brooklyn"" and the forthcoming ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"") cast very effectively against type as a righteous man who takes Glass mistreatment as a personal insult. And Howard makes a fleeting impression as the Arikara hunter who emerges every now and then to assert the presence of his people in a movie that is ultimately not a tale of an indigenous tragedy but of a white mans retribution. Perhaps the most useful comparison in that respect is with ""The New World"" Malicks 2005 film about the initially charmed ultimately tragic first encounter between the Jamestown settlers and the Native American tribes whose way of life they so drastically upended. (Both films were shot by Lubezki and feature ace contributions by production designer Jack Fisk and costume designer Jacqueline West.) Those relations have soured irretrievably by the time Inarritus movie picks up roughly two centuries later when the scourge of American imperialism has long since bloodied and corrupted this once-Edenic paradise. But the key difference here is not just of setting but also of sensibility. The title of ""The Revenant"" aims to give this renascent avenger a spiritual dimension but in attempting to steer his dark fatalistic vision toward something genuinely contemplative and cathartic Inarritu has managed to appropriate the beauty of Malicks filmmaking but none of its sublimity -- another word for which might be humility. There is plenty of amazement here to be sure but all too little in the way of grace. Film Review The RevenantReviewed at Samuel Goldwyn Theater Beverly Hills Nov. 23 2015. MPAA Rating R.

News for you -- it was never ""Edenic"" (nothing ever is). That ""scourge of American imperialism"" simply replaced the numberless scourges which came before and will always come in the human race including cruelty and conquest (yes imperialism) imposed by indigenous cultures on one another. And you are always free to disown and remove yourself from the fruits of that ""scourge.""

Waist of time and money to say the least. This director has a frightfully warped sense of life. Reply Guy says February 16 2016 at 817 am The movie was implausible on so many levels- the large mountain ranges are only prevelant in western north America- French fur traders operated in eastern north America- any northwoodsmen knows getting wet in frigid conditions can be a death sentence- the whole movie people are entering cold water and soakin their clothes equipment and horses- was ree Indians supposed to mean cree Indians- were they ever in proximity to the paunee and rocky mountains nothing in this movie makes sense if you know anything about early American history end frontier life - its total hollywood Reply Daniel Carvalho says February 14 2016 at 1005 pm Truly a precise review. Thank you Sir Justin Chang. Reply Kris says February 16 2016 at 656 pm I agree excellent review that sums up my viewing experience perfectly. Reply Boris-TheSeries says February 14 2016 at 1153 am visually stunning (please make yourself a favour watch it at a theater not on TV of any size) many scenes provides plenty of emotions. What I most disliked is that the resilience of Glass is strecthed a bit too far given how torn is skin is shown to be how long he stays in icy water how much he does (not) sleep in closed places. Maybe a less injured Glass would have added that bit of realism that is lacking (plus some more father-son relationship until the death of Hawk that the viewer hardly perceive as having a special connection with the father). In any case definitely this is art worth watching this truly seventh art. Reply Frank McLaughlin says February 8 2016 at 607 am Excellent cinematography and soundthe scenery is superb but lacking in just about every other aspect. Not much of a story and in reality hypothermia would probably claimed most of the cast given their proclivity for wallowing in icy waters;gangrene and hypothermia would likely have seen off Hugh Glass long before any human attackers had the opportunity. One has to suspend their disbelief in order to sit through this film. Reply Lang Thomas says February 13 2016 at 818 pm Perfect analysis. Sound track engineers must have worked hard to make understanding what little dialogue exists most unintelligible. Oh yeah three shots from flint action pistol whilst riding horse give me a break. Man killing bear with knife after being mauled most difficult Reply William Mitchell says February 2 2016 at 342 pm Technically brilliant but seriously lacking in substance beyond the predictable Hollywood ""revenge"" theme. Reply Greg Ven Osdel says January 31 2016 at 710 pm I would really like to know how a black powder single shot pistol can fire 3 times without reloading and where in South Dakota looks like the secenery in the film. Typical hollywood film not worth a dang. Ive seen vintage westerns that were better than this movie. Reply Star Thornton says January 31 2016 at 232 pm Tom Hardy was outstanding. He does a great job with his part. The movie was too long way too long. Great scenery. Awful fake horses bears and wolves. DiCaprio cant ride and looks silly on a horse. As far as his performance being Oscar worthy...no way. He had a few lines and suffered a lot. The movie was hyped and frankly its boring. Michael Fassbender had a vastly more complex part in Steve Jobs and far outshines. Reply Anjelica says January 30 2016 at 834 pm Worst movie ever. Feel like I was sucked in by the media hype. Dont see this as Leonardos best role. Save your money Reply David says June 10 2016 at 515 pm It may not be DiCaprios best role but it was the best performance of those who were nominated. He stole the show. Dicaprio is great in this. Reply Arline says January 27 2016 at 1121 am DiCaprio was wonderful Film not so much. Reply David Vale says January 26 2016 at 329 pm Answer to Bradford I have a good attention span but the film was so disjointed. For example as Mr glass managed to just crawl by using just his arms to the top of a cliff to look down to water the next scene by some MIRACLE he is actually drinking from the water. Was I watching the bioni cman. What a load of drivel. He was near death one moment and a mountaineer the next. Utter tosh Reply David Vale says January 25 2016 at 1135 am Just seen the revenant what a load of rubbish. 2 hours I cant believe they could stretch it out so long. Stay at home. Reply Bradford says January 26 2016 at 1045 am This movie isnt meant for people with low attention spans. And unfortunately those are the people who gripe and moan that this drama isnt action packed for each of its 156 minute run-time. Its a shame that people cannot focus long enough to appreciate good cinema. Reply Daniel Carvalho says February 14 2016 at 1002 pm Thank you Mr.Branford You are absolutely correct. A lot of people who complain about this movie not being an action film or for it being too long seem to be quite the impatient and hyperactive(short attention span). We must admire the detail and the works put into this filma DJ to see the process of this film. nico says January 24 2016 at 1044 am This review says it all Reply Debbe says January 24 2016 at 729 am An excellently written review of The Revenant. However I feel that the lack of grace mentioned at the end of the review was intentional. The movie clearly illustrates the philosophy behind Naturalism and I feel it was also an allegory for the brutal things humans have done and continue to do to each other for stuff. The beauty of the natural world which provides sustenance while at the same time operates with violent indifference to mankind was breathtaking and mystical. It was brilliantly juxtaposed against the violent indifference of mankind towards mankind but there was no beauty or mystical elements in that aspect - just right-in-your-face realism.The relentlessness of the violence caused the man sitting a few seats away from me in the theatre to moan ""Oh no."" If only people would moan ""Oh no"" in the real world. Until we can feel the same repulsion and exhaustion brought on by The Reverent when we consider the way we treat each other there can be no grace. Reply austin says February 7 2016 at 1240 am I agree. The reviewers bias at the end about the white man upheaving nature ""when the scourge of American imperialism has long since bloodied and corrupted this once-Edenic paradise"" completely misses the point of the movie. Its not about White man or Indian its about brutality vs beauty that is present in all nature. I mean the symbolism was almost knocking us over the head about how DiCaprio is basically reduced to an animal wearing a bearskin 90% of the movie literally going inside a horse etc. Humans turn into beasts when letting our animalistic urges for violence overtake us Reply Old Salt says January 23 2016 at 505 pm Was not an OSCAR performance by DiCaprio.... Reply Lisa says January 21 2016 at 235 pm This movie is boring youll be sleep in no time LoL Reply Heather Moore says January 21 2016 at 550 am Saw the movie yesterday. Could not disagree more with this review. You will be on the edge of your seat for the full 156 minutes. This movie is destined for an Oscar. This movie is so bad.. I had to purchase my tickets in advance to ensure a seat (sold out on past attempts). If I were to critique Changs review of the Revenant ..I would give it 5 thumbs down. Reply excellentbird2 says January 16 2016 at 257 am I could not disagree with Justin Chang more. I was left wondering if we saw the same movie. I am not a big fan of wilderness films nor really of Leonardo DiCaprio. I attended the film with my husband simply because it was late and few other films were showing near midnight. Each of us probably watches 50 films a year. Were both critical educated people and cinema is our major form of entertainment. We were mesmerized by the beauty and suspense of this film which we both found to have moments of true transcendence and grace...exactly what Chang insisted was absent from the film. We viewed a late-night showing but were never bored nor sleepy during the 156 minutes of the film. I was annoyed by the fact that Chang attributed every strength of the film to those working in collaboration with Inarritu such as the editing of Mirrione. Most Directors use editors but we rarely see the success of various sequences attributed to them nor their names even mentioned in reviews. The bleakness of the film was another strength. Perhaps Chang simply prefers more cheerful fare. I dont go to a film like The Revenant expecting to be cheered and you shouldnt either. But this film is cinema at its best - from the bleakly beautiful cinematography to extraordinary performances by everyone involved. See the film yourself. Chang is way off the mark here. Reply Old Salt says January 23 2016 at 507 pm Revenant was Hollywood PHONEY as HELL... The frontiersman Hugh Glass didnt FREEZE to death in the river...etc... No frostbite...no loss of fingers toes hands or even a foot to Gangrene. Crawled into a carcass...naked...and survived... After everything he went through and survived it seems he died at the end of the movie in the freezing snow as he sees an apparition of his dead Indian wife...? Is that what it takes to win a Golden Globe award...? The acting wasnt that great Reply Maggie says January 15 2016 at 902 pm Geez why dont you spoil it for those who havent seen it? Did you leave any part of the film out? Plus quite the Debbie Downer ""review."" Ive seen it and thought it amazing. Boo hiss Reply ilexlass says January 17 2016 at 821 pm I would not recommend it... left me feeling quite wilted... probably the intent ... too brutally violent for my liking... and seemed to me the main point of the movie... also would have liked to have seen better character development between father and son... scenery was beautiful however Reply andrewgallowayrolls says January 15 2016 at 103 am The award nominaters didnt seem to have your reservations on this work... being particularly impressed with Di Caprios contribution on which I do acknowledge your complimentary comments. Reply Dane says January 14 2016 at 944 am Really it was an Edenic paradise prior to European arrival? I guess we should tell that to the tribes that were mercilessly wiped out - man woman and child - by each other the massively unbalanced power relationships among tribes (does anyone talk about the Iroquois Confederation ""imperialism""?) the cultural embrace of torture (capturing enemis so they can be slowly tortured often stripping their skin off slowly then burning them at the stake sound Edenic?)...the purposeful kidnapping and enslavement by tribes or the massive amount of starvation and death as natives struggled from one winter into another with little in the way of food supply. Im always astonished by the perceptions and biases that make their way into media that have no basis is actual history. Edenic paradise? One can describe a scourge of American imperialismor even equate the tortures inflicted by Europeans and natives but going to the extreme and talking about an Edenic paradise lost is just a self-indulgent romantic fantasy viewed through a clouded contemporary lens as much in excess as the grim aspects of the movie just reviewed. Reply don sykes says January 13 2016 at 824 pm How about that ending when the Indian party along with the Chiefs daughter that Glass had gallantly saved just happened to be passing by at the crucial moment? Reply sharpe12 says January 13 2016 at 1149 am Saw it last night. Outside of the bear scene it was total snooze fest. I kept looking at my watch begging for Glass to bite the dust. It was just a fancy remake of a million other movies. Good guy has something bad happen to him he overcomes obstacles to get in position to take revenge and then kills the bad guy. Real creative. Reply Bradford says January 26 2016 at 1048 am You do know that it is based off of a true story right? Reply Lesa Holley says January 13 2016 at 248 pm You nailed it. It was way too long and just dull. Yes nature is beautiful but what about the story? WHY should I care about these characters? Because I did not. I was rooting for the bear and Glasss death would have saved me some time that I will now never get back. Reply vermontave says January 12 2016 at 657 pm Ok so watched The Revenant screener a second time after watching it the first time last year. The good -Great locations. -Great stunt choreography (not as good as Fury Road but still pretty great) -Hardy was solid and had excellent accent; supporting cast was solid The bad -Some of the acting -- Sorry but the whole Glass avenging his adopted son seemed off for some reason. Maybe the kids acting maybe the directing -- ""act like sulky teenager"" -- I dont know. DiCaprio was there but you park the guy behind a whisker ski-mask like that and half your communication with the audience just left the building. Hardy pulled it off (thanks voice coach) DiCaprio didnt. -Some of the CGI was weak. The CGI bear was too big and moving too fast for too long. That and some other scenes distracted from otherwise authentic scenery and decent action. -A lot of story-implausibilities. I think the original 19th century dude Glass probably had a rough go on several occasions -- he undoubtedly had bear scars to display -- but otherwise wove-in some hear-say-based ""fish-stories"" to dress things up for the big story we saw depicted here. ""Woodsman Detectives"" would have interrogated Glass and tore his story to bits -- my guess lol. -More on implausibilities Didnt buy the sleep-in-the-horse deal -- bears would have been hibernating but with all the wind depicted hungry wolves would have picked up the scent easy despite the cold and had themselves an easy meal; and its pretty obvious that all the actors had dry suits on or something because they wouldnt have lasted long walking around floating around in that near freezing water otherwise wearing their wool pants and buffalo skins and what not. -""Sons a girly little bizatch"" -- you know that always brings out the axes lol. Come on really? See that was the weakness there between DiCaprio and the kids performances -- kids death wasnt emotionally enough fully spur the revenge fight they needed to throw in an extra line because nobody was super pissed off yet. Weak lol. Anyway I give The Revenant an OK rating. But could have been WAY better -- a gift that kept on giving for decades. Oh well... Reply C Kelly says January 17 2016 at 953 pm Excellent analysis. You nailed it. Loved Hardy/supporting cast but not thrilled by the rest. I felt the same way. Reply Ron says January 11 2016 at 435 am The spiritual dimension the director brings in The Revenant is its strength in my opinion. The banality of revenge adventurer stories has been told time again and well enough. However the harshness and indifference of the primitive world seems to force the metaphysical to surface. His hallucination of purpose as revenge is as real as his hallucinations of his dead family. The almost pathetic hacking away between the two opposing characters does seem to be ""grinding predictability"". However it is within the context of an imposing yet indifferent presence Nature. Witnessed from the film it seems life purpose narrative all become insignificant juxtaposed with the primitive force that caused our creation. And what we (or for heightened effect think Hugh Glass) go through whether the work we exert or the experiences we suffer for begs the question of existence why? We the audience each become an individual revenant. The modernist aspect relying deeply on existentialism breathes new life into an otherwise exhausted genre (Western). And it wouldnt have been possible without the insidious infusion of desperate spirituality with cutting catharsis. Especially at the end. Yikes Reply vermontave says January 12 2016 at 704 pm Edit The good -Cinematography was excellent Reply Ron says January 11 2016 at 441 am Edits unintentional comma  ""The almost"". Also forgot to bring together the ""grinding predictability"" as a metaphor for our own existence our lives and some may argue our stories are completely characterized by ""grinding predictability"". I believe that the film is almost aware of this and poignantly points it out. Reply Al Eng says January 10 2016 at 317 pm It seems professional reviewers want to see if they can top the movie in creativity. They fall short. This movie was a pleasure of the senses. Every scene is and was a work of art. They created a whole atmosphere in the story with special effects that viewed as no special effect. What I mean is all the scenes looked natural so you could not tell they were special effects. At least I think they were special effects. Colorful Rich Survival and a conclusion this film lives up to. I am no Decaprio fan but now I am. The costar Tom Hardy as well gives an award winning performance. I cant say enough about this experience called The Revenant. Reply kc says January 10 2016 at 901 pm Exactly. Well said. This was the best movie Ive seen in years. Not liking this you should seek some other line of employment if youre a ""film critic."" This was a total classic like ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Dr. Zhivago."" Reply Maggie says January 15 2016 at 905 pm Arent movie critics usually disgruntled actors writers or directors anyway? I agree with you KC and John B. John Blaska says January 9 2016 at 215 am If this is your job to critique movies and offer an educated/professional opinion or ratingyoy should QUIT IMMEDIATELY. This was an incredible movie and anyone expecting to see what they imagine of this story and think about Dicaprio will leave well pleased. You sir and your inflated ego need be ground beneath heal. You obviously wouldnt know what a great movie is If it came up behind you and bit you on your dumb ass. Reply bensonsmusic says January 9 2016 at 145 am If Hawks relationship with his dad would have been developed further then it would have a different film. The art of Revenant was painted with a larger brush. The plot wasnt the point. Reply ilexlass says January 17 2016 at 826 pm hes not alone in his opinion... Reply ilexlass says January 17 2016 at 828 pm agree with you totally bensonsmusic Kerri Moore says January 9 2016 at 1259 am Just got home from watching this today a bit disappointed could not understand some of the dialog the Americans dont speak clearly amp; I had trouble understanding the story line got lost 6 out of 10 amp; thats only because of the scenery Reply jeanne says January 11 2016 at 129 pm I also found it hard to understand what little talking there was in this film. I really dont know what all the hub bub is about this movie? I have seen way better cinematography none of the scenes of the terrain took my breath away. I found it unbelievable at times ie sleeping with no blankets in frigid temperatures etc. Was puzzled about where they were one moment they are in a lush rain forest with fern the next dry land country?? I didnt know why opening scene couldnt have said where/who they were.......I am a DiCaprio fan but was very disappointed in this film. I found it brutal boring and way too long. I get it the guy survived to avenge his sons death a bit dramatic. Reply Maggie says January 15 2016 at 908 pm Haha The ""Americans"" dialogue was the least important part. Al Eng says January 10 2016 at 320 pm What you missed in dialog does not matter. The film was not much on words. The film was about the beauty and savageness of man. The story line was about survival and revenge. It was really that simple. And simple to follow. Reply Ron says January 11 2016 at 438 am Simple yet magnanimous. Truly great in my opinion. Im glad someone else got it. Michelle Earhart says January 6 2016 at 1225 am Im not a critic nor am I a big Decaprio fan here. I see this commercial often and every time I see it? I know this is Leonardo Decaprios Oscar period. He looks feels wears and owns that role. Give the man credit where its due Its due Reply ilexlass says January 17 2016 at 834 pm I think what the story is about is clear... but the use of violence was WAY over the top and there was not enough character development imho ... more a film for men Im guessing... I am a Leonardo DiCaprio fan but would not place this up with his other works which were again imho more worthy of an Oscar Reply Eddie Murphy says January 3 2016 at 104 am I agree completely with this reviewers impression of The Revenant. I would add that as one very familiar with life in the frozen wilderness as well as life under the pain of spinal injury and other insults to the nervous system theres no way under the stars that Glass would have recovered so quickly from his wounds. In fact I would have expected to see him languishing as best he could for at least two weeks before finding the strength and energy to begin his monumental quest. Another very odd time-warp plays out when Glass crawls to the edge of a cliff to view the beautiful mountain stream below. Way way way below. So far below the tops of trees growing near the stream look a hundred yards away. And the climb down would be one met with no clear trail or path and loads of rocks in the way. It would take a man in good physical condition the better part of several hours to find his way down. It would take Glass the better part of two or three days. Yet we cut from Glass at the top of the cliff to Glass at the bottom of the cliff getting water. Its still bright daylight. Hard to believe a man in his condition would recover strength and stamina so quickly. Because he wouldnt. As the reviewer reflected much of the plot is predictable. If it werent for the incredibly beautiful scenery I would not have been as interested in finishing the film. Reply Khellan says January 8 2016 at 919 pm Regardless history says he did. It took him six weeks to crawl scratch and slide his way back to Fort Kiowa and the movie doesnt portray this passage of time as well as it could have but Hugh Glass really did survive being left to die by his companions after a savage bear attack 200 miles from even the crudest of civilization with no weapons and wounds that would have killed 95% of people. Reply NHBill says December 30 2015 at 1228 pm I wanted to love this movie but the abundant flaws marred what could have been a gem. First there are the absurd healing properties of the Magical Indian. Not only did his herbs cure raging infections to a 22nd century degree it apparently cured a broken leg. That leg would have taken 6 months to heal under the care of a 21st Century Orthopedic. And yet with the ground still covered in snow our hero is running and riding horses. Then the many anachronisms became too much to bare. One of the more glaring the pyramid of Buffalo skulls. That level of slaughter did not take place for another 50 years well after the Civil War. What ruined the stunning cinematography and excellent performances were the several scenes of actors in closeup riding rocking horses being pulled on dolly track. Somehow John Ford found a way to make movies without using rocking horses in the 1930s. If all that didnt ruin your suspension of disbelief the idea that he would have not only survived a grizzly attack but he would have survived TWO ATTACKS will do the trick. Reply Francis T. Manns says January 6 2016 at 1034 am I thought he was a goner when the Titanic sank. Reply Khellan says January 8 2016 at 922 pm Except the movie actually downplays what happened to Hugh Glass. Go look him up. Its one of the most shocking most brutal and most amazing stories of surviving the impossible that we have on record. After the attack he had completely exposed ribs on his back and had to use maggots to eat the rotting flesh from his body so gangrene wouldnt set in. M. C. Lawrence says December 29 2015 at 139 pm Between the one-two punch of Lubezkis breathtaking cinematography and DiCaprios riveting performance this film knocked me out. Cant wait to see it again. I loved the added dimension of Inarritus mystical dream sequences which suggest that no matter how dismal this life may appear there is a reason for everything. The Revenant transcends the genre Western and stands as a powerful testimony to humanitys search for meaning. Reply Adam Klugman says December 29 2015 at 933 am This is not only a spot on assessment of failed albeit well intended film - it is also one of the best most articulate film reviews Ive ever read. It functions like literary criticism that is not just an expressed opinion but an essential part of the artistic whole. Bravo Mr Chang Im quite impressed And thank you Reply Kat says December 25 2015 at 930 am Totally agree about the contrast to Malick. Inarritus film is pseudo spiritual and attempts to be sublime only for the directors self-glory and prestige. There is nothing humble or graceful about this kind of cinema. Inarritu needs to tone down his ego. Reply Dan Olson says December 24 2015 at 145 pm Thorough review. Loved the movie. I think for me what stood out and remains after all the splendor is the fact that I felt the physical environment as if I were there. It made it very real to me. Made me miss Alaska. Reply Simon says December 23 2015 at 1239 am I saw it last night and I agree with every word of your excellent review Reply Sytze says December 22 2015 at 822 am This movie does what Hollywood fails to do. This is to innovate. Using the drawbacks of close up camera work the condens on the lens to flow into the next shot is sheer brilliance. This movie does not ask for character development so much. Inarritu leaves his signature which is one of a kind. Your review completely misses the point of the movie and reeks of political influence. Reply Tom says December 21 2015 at 301 pm so in other words this version made the novel more politically correct by inventing characters. White man bad. Red man good. Oops. Cant say that latter anymore. Reply Joe Joe Mcblowblow says December 19 2015 at 1129 pm Jesus. Spoilers everywhere. I bet you were the kid who told his friends how Fight Club The Usual Suspects and The 6th Sense ended just to be a dick. Luckily Ive watched it before reading this. Reply Bertie says December 19 2015 at 833 am God damn with that sudden barrage of spoilers in the middle of a review. The mark of a bad reviewer when he cant describe the film without spoiling it to the audience. Reply capellan2000 says December 17 2015 at 413 pm Interesting enough after this detailed and very smart review I want to see this movie. But I will try to watch first the movies named in this review. Reply Duke says December 16 2015 at 319 am Thanks for giving away the entire plot. No need to see this film now. Seriously what hack wrote this review? Reply Bradford says January 26 2016 at 1050 am Its a story that happened over two hundred years ago. If it hasnt been spoiled already then there is a problem. Just like the Titanic. No one gripes and moans when someone spoils the fact that the Titanic sank because it is considered common knowledge. Same principle. Reply John Th says December 21 2015 at 210 pm The trailer gave away the entire plot...stop whining. Who wants to watch Leo get ""raped"" by a bear anyway?? Reply Carol says December 15 2015 at 607 pm Cant wait to see this movie. Big fan of Leo. wish I was that bearDamnn Leonardo is sexy. Reply Clara L says December 14 2015 at 110 pm This film bears resemblance to the 1995 film Zero Kelvin(1001 films you must see before you die) with Stellan Skarsgaard.

"The Revenant review Leonardo DiCaprios out for vengeance in Inarritu epic - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Revenant review Leonardo DiCaprios out for vengeance in Inarritu epic Trailer The Revenant Official trailer for ""The Revenant."" Official trailer for ""The Revenant."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Or ""One damn thing after another."" The gorgeously brutal first hour of ""The Revenant"" marks the peak of director Alejandro G. Inarritus glittering if not quite golden career. For a while his new movies really something. Then as Leonardo DiCaprio crawls across miles and miles of mighty pretty scenery filmed in Canada Montana and Argentina gradually it turns into not much of anything.Screenwriter and director Inarritu gave us the 10-ton granite pretensions of ""Babel"" ""Biutiful"" as well as less grandiose (and better) pictures such as his debut feature ""Amores Perros"" and last years Academy Award winner ""Birdman."" He co-wrote this loose adaptation of Michael Punkes 2002 historical novel ""The Revenant"" with Mark L. Smith. The storys set in 1823 focusing on a true-life character frontiersman and tracker Hugh Glass. For aficionados of survivalist lore Glass has become a symbol of fierce American resilience. Working for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company trading in beaver pelts he was left for dead by his cohorts following a near-fatal grizzly attack. Miraculously Glass survived but historical record is vague on what happened next.Punkes novel its title referring to someone returning from the dead took the liberty of fictionalizing Glass ordeal. The movie version of ""The Revenant"" flings it further into the realm of bloody allegory where Americas genocidal sins haunt the characters every mile. Already DiCaprio is favored to snare his first Oscar in this largely non-verbal role. The actor risked icy rivers freezing cold and nibbling on raw bison liver. The protagonist of Inarritus ""Revenant"" has a Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) whose mother a casualty of the Indian wars appears to Glass as a spectral reminder of his losses. The trapping expeditions leader (Domhnall Gleeson looking ghostly before his time) dispatches two men to bury Glass whos not quite dead and rejoin whats left of the team after an attack waged by the local Arikara tribe. This scene dazzlingly fluid and exciting recalls the Omaha Beach sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" among other inspirations. Leonardo DiCaprio Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio plays frontiersman Hugh Glass who wasleft for dead after a bear attack in ""The Revenant."" Leonardo DiCaprio plays frontiersman Hugh Glass who wasleft for dead after a bear attack in ""The Revenant."" The injured Glass reluctant guardians are a good young man (Will Poulter as the real-life Jim Bridger) and a bad older one (Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald another factual personage). In the film Fitzgeralds craven instincts know no boundaries. The same can be said of Hardys sometimes puzzling dialect. Fitzgeralds willing to kill (the sniveling he throws in for free) in order to get on with his life; he is every weak and inferior thing his presumed-dead adversary Glass is not.""The Revenant"" recounts Glass tortures of the damned which include a plunge down a waterfall; near-hypothermia (at one point he uses a gutted horse carcass as a sleeping bag); and a digitally rendered leap on horseback straight off a cliff. This guys not a garden-variety revenant; hes a serial revenant. Before long the films conception of Glass as invincible enlightened white man in tune with the land being stolen and ravaged by his fellow plunderers turns ""The Revenant"" into a travelogue with emblems rather than characters. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Many have said the same about Terrence Malicks dreamy visions of a lost America especially ""The New World."" Malick is a poet; Inarritus more of an entrails guy. Like ""The New World"" ""The Revenant"" was photographed by the remarkable Emmanuel Lubezki who fully deserved his back-to-back Oscars for his work on ""Gravity"" and ""Birdman."" Hes a maestro of ravishing natural light along with flowing extended lines of action unfolding in both real and brilliantly fabricated single takes. Inarritus film is worth seeing on balance largely for Lubezkis contributions though it has many other fine elements notably a subtly powerful musical score by Bryce Dessner Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto. In some respects ""The Revenant"" is a product of the 70s revisionist Western genre one that gives the Native American characters some of their due at least after so many decades of humiliation and stereotype. There was in fact a 1971 film based on Glass life and times The Richard Harris vehicle ""Man in the Wilderness"" which got to the bear mauling less than two minutes after the opening credits. That film didnt focus on gut-level retribution. In Punkes novel Glass grueling trek wears him down to a nub living only for ""the full carnal pleasure of revenge"" though his conscience saves him in the nick of time.The new movie seethes revenge. It comes down to two animals trying to hack each other to death in a scene of such protracted excess all you can do is laugh. Inarritus brand of intensity allows for zero emotional complexity. This is why even his better films have a hard time getting over the hump. Its hard to respond completely to a filmmaker who hits every beat every note with the same bug-eyed determination.DiCaprios very good. You believe his characters suffering. Theres not much more to Glass. The Glass we meet here is supernatural American exceptionalism personified and up to a point that works because DiCaprio has an otherness to him that you wouldnt characterize as relatably human. ""The Revenant"" is a small gripping story -- steroidal Jack London -- stretched to two hours and 36 minutes. That first hour is big and imposing. The rest grows smaller with the scripts self-conscious deeper meanings either layered on top like pelts or -- more successfully -- left to Lubezkis meticulous images of a sun-dappled 19th century Eden now home to one too many Wal-Mart stores.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""The Revenant"" -- 2.5 starsMPAA rating R (for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images a sexual assault language and brief nudity)Running time 236Opens Jan. 8 Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune A version of this article appeared in print on January 08 2016 in the Arts + Entertainment section of the Chicago Tribune with the headline ""DiCaprios frontiersman seeks vengeance - `THE REVENANT 1/2"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe The Revenant Alejandro Inarritu Leonardo DiCaprio Tom Hardy Wont you please just give Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar already?

Based on a 2002 Michael Punke novel about real-life folk hero Hugh Glass The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio (gruff committed unreadable) as a fur trapper and frontiersman left for dead by his colleagues in a wintry American landscape after he is viciously shredded by a grizzly bear. Glass survives and he hauls his damaged body through snow across rivers up rocks and over plains driven by revenge. In his sights is John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy savage with a dash of black humour) the man responsible for abandoning him to die and for forcing him to watch as his young son (of mixed-race parentage) is murdered in front of his eyes. So no its not a happy tale. But what survives from Birdman is a compelling forward-moving simple approach to storytelling that grips us through stretches of silence and misery. The films relentlessness itself becomes magnetic. There are times when The Revenant feels like one long and unforgiving act of sadism mostly directed at its lead character but occasionally at us (a warning the film is long the dialogue is minimal and the violence is sharp). There are moments too that feel like parodies of awards-hungry acting such as when we see DiCaprio chomping on raw animal organs or climbing into the steaming carcass of a dead horse. But what makes this more than just a punishing fearful expertly crafted thriller focused on one mans endurance is heavily down to Emmanuel Lubezkis attractive thoughtful photography. Lubezkis work will be familiar to viewers of Terrence Malicks recent films (including The Tree of Life) for the timeless sense of soulfulness that he can lend to a landscape. Here that same visual style coupled with the films concern for the Native American experience and its compassion for the father-child bond makes The Revenant not just gruelling but often gorgeous and quietly spiritual.

Some are difficult to watch and harder to wade through than year old treacle. The Revenant falls squarely into camp one an absolute dream of a film that I wanted to hunker down and watch again even as the credits were still rolling. The trailer doesnt do this movie justice; swathes of snow covered landscapes and an often incoherent Tom Hardy dont always make for the most appealing of film premises even to lovers of both icy winters and grizzly Brits. It is long - a good two and a half hours - but it never ever feels slow or tedious; there is a momentum that feels entirely appropriate allowing you to fall into the bewitching panoramas without wallowing. Beautiful swells of strings provide a soundtrack which tugs at the heart but never manipulatively and the cinematography here is stunning. Shot using 100% natural light for a few hours each day its both testament to the visionary film-making genius of both director Alejandro G Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and reassurance to film lovers everywhere that in a world of Dirty Grandpa and Wedding Ringer movies like this can still be made. The script is minimal with no words un-necessary and the action scenes are utterly absorbing; be prepared to flinch and feel your stomach turn over as though you were beside the actors in their moments of deepest adversity.The acting is universally flawless with Leonard diCaprio and Tom Hardy deserving of every accolade that has been lauded on them. Chewing the scenery up and spitting it out behind him Hardy is unquestionably deeply flawed but never one dimensional which makes him a refreshing sort of villain while diCaprio possesses the sort of tenacity and quiet dignity which makes you root for him deeply and personally. Yes its his time to win that Oscar and yes hes waited but actually its the fact that his performance is worthy of the win which makes it something to be sincerely pleased about for him. Will Poulter is also excellent in a supporting role with real meat on the bones and Domnhall Gleeson puts the ghost of his Star Wars travesty to rest getting back to the kind of performance that made him such a standout in Ex Machina and About Time.Theres a purity and a rawness about The Revenant which I loved and which doesnt come along very often; when it does you owe it to yourself to sit back and absorb every brutal bloody still dramatic hopeful and peaceful moment.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore12 hours agojulio brunomoderatorFeaturedI wasnt expecting the sublime beauty in this otherwise gruesome film. The music the scenery the sounds accompanying every scene whether running water cold wind or the shallow breathing of the main character. It all adds up to a master movie that took me by surprise. The Oscar for Leo is in the bag already. The last close-up looking at the camera breaking the 4th wall was sublime. Hardy is menacing and complex and adds to the great tension and drama of this movie.The cinematography is beyond Oscar-worthy violent and spiritual at the same time.

It is beyond me that elements of the film can be even remotely based on truth which is what makes it so powerful and enables you to reflect on human nature culture and tradition.

Just sheer beauty all around even in the harshness of those severe winters.  Some of the scenes are hard to watch knowing that the movie is based on a true story.  The will of man to survive against all odds is very clearly shown through this story. Delighted that Leo finally got an Oscar for this magnificent portrayal/acting.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 16 2016Puking PastilleFeaturedIf ever an actor deserved an Oscar its Leonardo Dicaprio for the sheer commitment to this epic film. While most people could barely function in these kinds of conditions Leo pulled another superb performance out of the bag to deliver an award-winning performance of a man whose endurance is almost unbelievable. A couple of my friends thought it was too long and ""arty"" but I loved the contrast of brutality with sweeping scenes of the stunning landscape. As a couple of other reviewers have said I could barely understand what Tom Hardy was saying for most of the film but didnt feel as though this took away from my enjoyment. Would definitely recommend seeing The Revenant on the big screen if you can.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 7 2016JKFeaturedWatching this movie gave me a chill - the experience is that immersive.

So convincing as a man surviving the wilderness against all odds. Surely the Oscars will be calling his name this year? The landscape and cinematography is simply stunning too almost like a work of art. The story pulls you in and makes you feel like you are living every moment with Hugh.

The cinematrography is great and the landscape shots just amazing. The story is alright I was a bit disappointed as I had higher expectations. I wish people hadnt been speaking so much about Leos performance as this was all I could think about when I watched the film. I really didnt get all the fuss though. I think Tom Hardy is at least as good as Di Caprio.Overall a film worth watching but Im not sure I need to see again too soon. And I hope Leo doesnt get an Oscar for this performance hes done and Im sure will do much better filmsHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 26 2016Katie FTastemakerFeaturedMeh. The cinematography is beautiful but then the scenery is so stunning it would be difficult to make it look bad. In terms of the acting theres lots of pondering silences and I found myself looking at my watch to see how long wed been in the cinema and how long might be to go (never a good sign). I agree with many of the reviews posted all over the internet already - this is an Oscar hungry performance from Leo and I didnt see anything that really stood out to win him that accolade apart from perhaps desperation long stares painful expressions. I realise he put his body through extremes in filming but many actors do this these days and was the acting superior to that in other films this year? Im not convinced personally. Should he win. Probably not. Will he win. Probably. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 24 2016GeorgeXTastemakerFeaturedLoved this play.

It is a bit too long and there should have been a bit more back story to how the characters linked up at the start.  Hardy was basically a cardboard cutout and reminded me of Tom Berenger in Platoon.  His character was too underwritten.  The violence was hard and brutal THAT bear scene a little OTT but for the most part it was a well made piece of cinema.   Im just not really sure what exactly it was trying to say...Helpful?Yes|No1 ReplyShareMoreFeb 12 2016Rosie TStaff WriterFeaturedI went to the cinema not quite knowing whether or not I wanted see this film. I mainly went because of Leo (not just because of his gorgeousness) he is an incredible actor and hasnt disappointed me in any film Ive seen him in. Once again Leonardo DiCaprio was brilliant. This is quite a long film (3 hours I think) but I did not get bored or long for the next scene. Instead I was pulled into every moment even the silent ones. Parts made me feel like I was watching a piece of art the landscape shots were beautiful and in some ways moments of peace in a film of savage. And then there was the action Im sure that you will all know by now of the bear attack- this was shot and performed fantastically and had me cringing a few times indeed. Tom Hardy was brilliant in this also he really made me want to punch him (and Im not a violent person- never actually been in a fight). He played John Fitzgeral the man who abandons Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and leaves him to die amongst other things. As the film went on the growth of anger grew towards Fitzgeral who is a nasty piece of work. A great film.

You all know by now he gets attacked by a bear which is brutal - and its not the only thing brutal here. Blood is spilled and life is cheap out in the Frontier in the 1820s. Shot in Argentina over a period of three years apparently they only filmed this during a magical window when the natural light was just right and the result is breathtaking. The movie lingers on snowy vistas and landscapes as it draws you in to this savage wilderness and DiCaprio does a fantastic job of showing off his emotions despite the fact he doesnt actually say many words in the movie. Tom Hardy is the villain here and hes as chameleon-like as usual as a soldier who escaped a scalping from the Native Americans. Oddly despite an awesome sound mix the ADR on the native spoken language seems to be off - it doesnt match the lip syncing which is quite off-putting. Definitely worth a watch if you dont mind the sight of blood.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 4 2016Luisa GTastemakerFeaturedIt was a good film but it wasnt as amazing as everyone is making out There was a lot of DiCaprio moaning grunting and groaning.

The film although a little long kept me engaged squirming in my seat a few times (a bit gruesome in some places) and had some beautiful cinematography. My only complaint about the film would be how quickly Hugh Glasss character recovers from his wounds-wont say anymore in case of spoiling it but everything else was greatHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 25 2016Niomi HarrisTastemakerFeatured""The poor guy cant catch a break"" is what I found myself yelling at the screen whilst watching The Revanant. And no Im not talking about Leonardo DiCaprios failure to bag that most coveted Oscar but of his character Hugh Glasss series of misfortunes (and thats putting it lightly). The fur-trapper along with his son and fellow frontiersmen are firstly targeted by some really angry bow amp; arrow yielding Native Americans; then after escaping Leo and his son gets picked on by a shabby looking and utterly unintelligible Tom Hardy. And then if that wasnt bad enough poor old Glass gets mauled by a great big grizzly bear whom might I add at least deserves the nod for Best Supporting Animal (and if that isnt a category then it needs to be. OscarsSoHuman). But things get worse for Glass as battered broken and bound to a stretcher hes then abandoned by his group almost strangled to death by Hardys character Fitzgerald forced to watch helplessly as Fitzgerald murders his son and then finally buried alive and left for dead.What follows are several ""The poor guy cant catch a break"" moments as Glass battles the elements and flees those pesky Native Americans determined to catch up with Fitzgerald and revenge the death of his beloved son Hawk. Be warned this film is long and I feel that I deserve some sort of reward for sitting through the whole thing but it is rather good. Good enough for me to want it on DVD? Not quite. But its defo worth a look just to see what all the hype is about. I havent seen the other films up for Best Picture or any of those with Leos fellow Best Actor Nominees but from what Ive seen I think this just might be his year. There are some truly harrowing scenes here which are very well acted and equally well directed so Alejandro GonzalezInarritu may want to clear a space on his trophy cabinet too. And the scenery? Oh my the scenery is just stunning Is there an award for that too? Im not a film aficionado but if you like intense harrowing films with action and bloody violence with lots of snow mountains bears and a horse carcass then this is the film for you. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 21 2016Tom BruceTastemakerFeaturedA brutal loosely factual retelling of the Missouri folk legend of Hugh Glass a fur trapping scout of the early 1800s whose near-death experience at the paws of a bear and doing-over by a compatriot led to a Lazarus-esque journey to get some paybackDuring several pinnacle moments of The Revenant as the camera closes onto Leonardo DiCaprios bearded battered face it is tempting to imagine the long suffering actor turning to the camera eyes glossing over with tears of desperation and whispering ""Guys. Come on now. Is this not enough? What more do you want? What more can I do? Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it... to me"". He doesnt do it but his haunted soul tells it all. Leos odyssey of a performance as betrayed fur trapper Hugh Glass is undoubtedly the most painful and sacrificial given by any actor in some time - he has deserved the Academy Award  in previous years and he does again now. It seems a sure thing. At the very least itd be nice to have him win just to get all the hoopla about him not winning out of the way.""Give the man a proper burial hes earned it"" shouts a gruff captain to his men during the first act of The Revenant falsely believing Leos character to be down for the count. Little did he know it was just getting started. Well what I say is ""Give the man his Oscar hes earned it"". So too has Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu as best director. He put himself and his cast through hell on Earth to complete this film to his vision and it pays off because it looks and feels real. CGI included; though not exactly uncanny to  the genuine article the computerised effects are tactfully limited and there was no way to get certain shots besides having an actual bear maul an A-list actor which was not on the cards (though Leo wouldve blatantly been up for it). Some of the action scenes in this film appear to defy logistic possibility they are so whirlwind fast and chaotic yet flow with a savage beauty that makes some sort of primal sense. Like a fight to the death between a troupe of ballet dancers. Arrows thud whirl pierce flesh; men are pounded to the ground and beat into the mud with animal rage; the strongest and the luckiest get out with their lives and carry on - this is human survival on the edge the foundations of civilisation laid bare. The scenery plays a huge part in the film - nature presents as much difficulty as the villainy of man for Leos broken vengeful father to overcome. Going up mountains going down mountains going around mountains - it all takes its toll. Coupled with river rapids and blizzards it can seem that the odds are insurmountable that god (or say the universe) doesnt want the hero to survive. But it presents as many blessings when the time is right. Innaritu takes a leaf (more like a branch) out of Terrence Malicks Tree of Life in his depiction of the elements showing at once a great sense of wonder and respect and a heightened awareness of their unbending apathy.  The only thing distracting from an otherwise gripping ride was the inclusion of fever dream hallucinations of Glass wife and past life which are a little too Gladiator-soppy for the story. Another comparison must be made between made with Malick for his film the The New World which recreated the discovery of the Americas and the initial pillaging of the Native American lands - The Revenant is something of a spiritual sequel then revealing what happened when the Natives fought back.The film is an ordeal at times. It is tough to watch. There is heart thumping violence and as much abject misery as you could care to behold. Yet its sheer perseverance is to be applauded. Life is pain The Revenant tells us but it is sometimes worth it. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 19 2016Jeremy VFeaturedThis powerful film should carry a health warning.  The violence is not just what you see as the very effective sound track allows you to feel the thud of each arrow the groan of each wind blown tree the creak of each floor board. This violence comes with the territory and men fighting over it.  It is very realistic but is not glorified.There are many memorable moments in this magnificent film.  For me the camera tracks up from the body of a dead horse surrounded by trees and snow and I can see a cave painting.

What follows is the long struggle from Main guy to find incomprehensible guy to have his revenge. Main guy should have died. The bear (who I personally think it is the only award nomination worthy character in the whole movie) should have killed him infection should have killed him the fact he had a gaping hole in his throat that water was passing through while he drank that he sewed together should have killed him the cold should have killed him the lack of food while incredibly infected should have killed him. He should have died but he manages to carry on. There is nearly no dialogue and it is long. The only reason I am giving two stars is that it is quite funny seeing Leo battle with a Bear and the scenery is stunning. Otherwise I did not like this movie.
