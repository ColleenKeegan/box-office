That said director Catherine Hardwicke a veteran of two movies about American teenagers Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown strives to break with school-play conventions by stressing the human as well as spiritual side of the story of the immaculate conception and virgin birth. Hardwickes Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes the lead from Whale Rider) is fully flesh and not a little concerned by the unexpected gift in her womb; her Joseph (Oscar Isaac) meanwhile is rightly suspicious when his new wife still a virgin announces that she is carrying the Lords child. There are further hints of realism Mary and Joseph find their trek across the desert hard-going and theres even a birthing scene with sweaty brows and groaning although the camera doesnt dare venture below Marys shoulders and Hardwicke stops at having Joseph grab Marys hand and yell Push.Still the earnest Christmas-card spin on the nativity wins out and Hardwicke more serves her material than shapes it. You expect Charlton Heston to wander out from the shadows there are shafts of light from the heavens; a murky and stodgy sense of time and place; and costumes straight from Frankie Goes to Hollywoods video for The Power of Love. For all the directors nods at realism this is biblical reconstruction of the sort that will only fully engage those who can invest religious meaning in its narrative. For non-believers its a bit of a snooze.

Directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a screenplay by Mike Rich. 102 minutes. Rated PG for some violent content. Several theaters. Its hard to imagine much ""Passion of the Christ""-style controversy swirling around ""The Nativity Story"" Catherine Hardwickes gentle depiction of the events surrounding the birth of Jesus. Prettily filmed with silver-blue light and soaring music (in which you can hear hints of Christmas carols) its a careful respectful retelling of a story familiar to many. And yet by being so careful and familiar its almost lifeless. Hardwicke and screenwriter Mike Rich dont find a way to energize the material; instead theyre almost too reverent. The movie never rises beyond a certain calm competence -- its subject matter is inspirational but the filmmaking often is uninspired. The story familiar from countless church readings and Sunday-school pageants here is carefully drawn out to feature-film length. We meet teenage Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) and her poverty-stricken family in the town of Nazareth and witness her betrothal to the young carpenter Joseph (Oscar Isaac) which she accepts even though she does not love him. From there all is familiar the visit of the angel Gabriel the pregnancy the journey to Bethlehem the birth in a stable the baby in a manger the Wise Men the glorious star. Castle-Hughes Oscar-nominated in 2004 for ""Whale Rider"" (a film she made when only 11 years old) gives an understated performance; so much so that its difficult to discern anything about Mary other than her obedience and quiet -- very quiet -- strength. Perhaps shes hampered by the accent work; perhaps in adolescence acting seems less natural than before; perhaps shes simply overwhelmed by the iconic power of the character shes playing. In ""Whale Rider"" Castle-Hughes had a toughness and direct gaze that jumped off the screen. Here shes softer and less distinct. Her face registers little emotion instead looking resigned and solemnly serene. By contrast the husky-voiced almost wry warmth of Shohreh Aghdashloo as Marys older cousin Elizabeth (mother of John the Baptist) comes as a welcome ray of light. (The Wise Men who are given a bit of comic business seem a misfire; you cant help but think of ""Life of Brian."") Mary and Josephs arduous travels to Bethlehem assisted only by a weakening donkey make up much of the last third of the film as they traverse deserts mountains and rivers on the 100-mile journey. You feel their exhaustion but it seems to carry too much of the films weight. The scene in the stable is beautifully staged with blue light streaming down on the angelic child; its a lovely moment particularly as we see Marys parents Elizabeth and other far-off characters caught up in the magic of the star. ""The Nativity Story"" has a quiet sincerity to it thats sometimes quite moving and sometimes just too quiet.

Starring Keisha Castle-Hughes Oscar Isaac and Shohreh Aghdashloo. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) So what did Mary and Joseph say to each other on their slow journey to Bethlehem? Quick write some dialogue. Have it not be irreverent and not be corny. Have it fit with their stature as Christian saints and not sound stiff or ridiculous. After five minutes of effort (""Whew Looks like another scorcher huh Mary?"") youll be in a position to appreciate the achievement of ""The Nativity Story."" [Podcast Mick LaSalle discusses ""Nativity Story"" ""Turistas"" and ""Dreamland.""] What could have been an after-school special or some somber straight-to-video exercise becomes in the hands of screenwriter Mike Rich and director Catherine Hardwicke a gritty and affecting picture that takes the story of Jesus Christs conception and birth and depicts it as it might have happened. Its hard edges and unabashed piety will remind some of ""The Passion of the Christ"" but ""The Nativity Story"" has none of the neurosis or fetishism of the Mel Gibson film. Its also not a closed shop catering to one specific vision of Christianity. Its a lovely thing aimed at everybody. Hardwicke is best known as the director of ""Thirteen"" about two seventh-grade girls who descend into shoplifting drug abuse and sexual experimentation. That might sound like the wrong resume for the director of ""The Nativity Story"" but its exactly right. Hardwicke is no sentimentalist. She is concerned with moral issues. And she has insight into teenagers. ""The Nativity Story"" is after all the story of a teenage girl who gets pregnant. Mary has nothing to do with it -- an angel tells her that shell conceive through a visitation of the Holy Spirit -- but she has little hope that anyone in her community will believe her. Hardwicke and Rich do a number of very intelligent things. First they take whatever is in the Bible and fortify it through research. So the Jewishness of Marys village in Nazareth is emphasized and so is Roman oppression in the form of cruel taxation. As in the Bible there are shepherds but theyre not the shepherds that you see on Christmas cards. These are the real shepherds of history terribly poor people practically outcasts who are filthy and lead lives of utter loneliness and poverty. On their way to Bethlehem Mary and Joseph meet a shepherd a scruffy sweet guy who looks desperate to talk to somebody. A second smart thing Hardwicke and Rich do is take characters from history and then fill them out in imaginative ways that humanize them explain their actions and yet dont detract from spiritual significance. Here the Three Wise Men are a fussy trio of devout scholars specifically defined each with his strengths and weaknesses. Elizabeth a mature woman miraculously pregnant with the child wholl become John the Baptist is a joyful and warm presence as played by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is just an average girl but with a nice simplicity and purity. Joseph (Oscar Isaac) is the films most impressive creation. In the Bible hes almost a complete blank a nice guy who is upstaged by God the ultimate case of a fellow getting cut into on the dance floor and making the best of it. But here hes a tough guy with a strong moral nature -- protective feisty and capable a real hero. One of the incidental points of the film particularly powerful is that doing the right thing isnt easy even in the face of divine assurance. Angels may show up but if they show up in dreams you have a choice whether to believe them. Even when the instruction is explicit its not as though heavenly signs are showering in every day. Mostly its silence and people left to their own devices. So what does Joseph say to Mary on the journey? He says ""I wonder if Ill be able to teach him anything."" Basically theyre two people improvising trying to do right. By grounding everything that went before in an earthy realism Hardwicke earns the elevation of the nativity sequence one of the more beautiful scenes in this years cinema. Its the same crew youll find under any Christmas tree -- the holy family the shepherds the wise men -- all very human and bathed in starlight. -- Advisory There is some violence but this is essentially a family film.

The Three Wise Men journey to see Jesus in The Nativity Story. Photo New Line Cinema The Nativity Story 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Imagine being in Marys sandals. Shes maybe 14 years old betrothed to an older man in an austere religious community. One day an angel materializes out of nowhere and says God wants her to have his baby boy. Just like that teenage mother. This cannot be welcome news. Yet she agrees to this arrangement. She says yes knowing full well the scandal it might cause. Her courage her husbands courage and their biblical bundle of joy are the subject of Catherine Hardwickes The Nativity Story a reverent retelling of the birth of Jesus that should satisfy viewers who mourn the secularization of Christmas and the fat-suit vulgarization of Christmas movies. It might not hook nonbelievers but the choir might sing hosannas. Opening with a blurb from the prophet Jeremiah (""when I shall raise up for David a righteous branch"") closing with the Magnificat (""the Almighty has done great things"") The Nativity Story isnt quite the output one might expect from Hardwicke whose previous movies chronicled skateboard heroics (Lords of Dogtown) and depressingly precocious teenage girls (Thirteen) of the type who would likely rebuff uninvited messengers of God. The director who grew up Presbyterian has said her new film isnt designed to ""push religion"" but it doesnt pull back from it either. This isnt exactly an atheists take on the Christmas story. If the film betrays any scrappiness at all its in the casting of Keisha Castle-Hughes (at 16 an actual teenager and now actually pregnant) best known as the tough-nut Maori girl in Whale Rider. She makes an inspired Mary her dark expressive brow quirked upward in amazement or devotion or concern. As Joseph Oscar Isaac provides the unwavering menschy empathy that the part demands while Ciaran Hinds exudes urbane sliminess as the power-crazed baby-killing King Herod. Hardwicke and screenwriter Mike Rich (The Rookie) humanize the story here and there too much in some places (the nyucky Wise Men-as-Wise Guys) too little in others (what no morning sickness?). The films main strength -- and main novelty for anyone weaned on a blue-eyed goyishe Jesus -- is the way it places Mary and Joseph in a faithfully Jewish context marked by prayer shawls and blessings over bread. Thank the Lord for small miracles. While the movie falls short as great art or even as great entertainment it isnt a failure of intent. If Mel Gibsons The Passion ofthe Christ was an overbloodied passion play Hardwickes contribution falls squarely in the tradition of third-grade Christmas pageants -- with the added benefit of decent costumes and CGI. Those in turn sprang from the even hoarier tradition of medieval nativity plays in which shepherds and kings and various hoofed animals all convened on a manger in a stylized rendition of the Gospels. In all such genres the aim is not to rouse the audience or engage it in anything remotely outre. The aim is to inspire the faithful and affirm shared religious tenets. Hardwickes film watches Mary and Joseph on their dusty trek to Bethlehem listens to their confidences by the fire asks whether they might have felt afraid. It presents the birth of Jesus as a celluloid creche that venerates and celebrates if not thrills. Its a nativity scene strung with fancy lights. Those who prefer their Advents secular and Santa Clausy should pay their devotions elsewhere. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Ozark Trail 10x10-Foot Gazebo Top for 25 + pickup at Walmart Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Samsonite Leather Dowel 16"" Flapover Case for 60 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the beginning we already know the ending. The birth of Jesus may be the cinemas greatest story never told and Catherine Hardwickes ""The Nativity Story"" aims to fill that glaring hole in the film library of religion and folklore. ""The Nativity Story"" is the first movie whose posable action figures were marketed centuries before the actual film. Hardwicke and screenwriter Mark Rich attempt to breathe life into the iconic manger scene a tableaux whose back story millions of children learn by age 4. There will be no surprises in plot. What we may hope for is a satisfying and moving animation of a long-static image reminding us in the Christmas season that a religion practiced by 2 billion people rests on the flesh and promise of a newborn child. In that sense Hardwicke and Rich largely succeed. Parts of ""The Nativity"" feel stilted and off-key as if the Hollywood players involved couldnt quite surrender themselves to un-ironic reverence. But a story about the - not a but the - mother and child can work when Mary is given the very real ethereally beatific face of Keisha Castle-Hughes. Castle-Hughes brought the same look to ""Whale Rider"" four years ago and that haunting gaze was what won her an Oscar nomination at age 12. Directors choose Castle-Hughes because without a word her face announces that she is aware of this world without being quite of it. The Mary played by Castle-Hughes is at once innocent skeptical joyous sad and eternal. The mostly gentle ""Nativity"" opens on the most horrific scene of the times King Herods soldiers on a midnight raid in Bethlehem killing the newborn boys to deter the prophecy of a coming Jewish messiah. The story then cuts to a year earlier in Nazareth where Mary and her family struggle to scrape together enough money to satisfy Herods looming tax collection. Though presented on a fairly rudimentary level for a family-oriented PG movie Hardwicke does outline the injustices of the taxation and Roman occupation overseen by Herod. This is the background that would have elevated Mel Gibsons ""The Passion of the Christ"" from a brutal showpiece to a rich biography. The revolutionary nature of Jesus adult speeches to his dirt-poor countrymen needs setting up for the modern audience and Rich and Hardwicke give it a try. Mary is quickly married off to the kind carpenter Joseph (Oscar Isaac). Local custom requires Mary to stay chaste at home for another year before they live together. The angel Gabriel doesnt show much concern for the annunciations subsequent dilemma; a prematurely pregnant Mary had better have a good story to tell. She does of course - the best story something about this guy in this grove with some wings and a miracle. Mary eventually returns home very pregnant and Joseph shares the miracle in his own dream. They then set off to Bethlehem under Roman orders for every man to return to his birthplace to be counted. The silliness that mars the proceedings a bit comes from the three wise men whose progress we follow in parallel. They seem like sidekicks straight from a Disney cartoon - thankfully Hardwicke left out the drummer boy. The most touching part of the movie is not so much the manger scene though that is well done. Instead Hardwicke focuses on Mary and Joseph previously strangers married under a formality quietly learning about each other on their journey to Bethlehem. Richs script addresses the miracles through the more prosaic conversation of a budding marriage ""Do you ever wonder when well know?"" Joseph asks. ""Know what?"" Mary responds. ""Know when hes more than just a child."" The beauty of Lukes writing in the King James telling of the story is reflected by this Rich passage as a lowly shepherd addresses Mary. ""Everyone was given a gift"" the shepherd says. ""What was your gift"" Mary asks. ""Nothing. Nothing but the hope of waiting for one."" Scenes like these give ""The Nativity"" a solidity and appropriate sense of wonder. People complain Hollywood rarely gets religion right and they have a point. What ""The Nativity"" proves is that good writers and directors can tell such stories in a way that is respectful and professional. The movie itself is not a miracle. But its working with pretty good material. Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at mboothdenverpost.com.

"The Nativity Story a reverent retelling - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Faithful The Nativity Story a reverent retelling By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 1 2006 ""The Nativity Story"" is the first major Christian-themed film since ""The Passion of the Christ"" commercially revived the genre two years ago. Its also from the director of the 2003 lock-up-your-rampaging-daughters melodrama ""Thirteen."" One thus approaches this new telling of Jesus birth with trepidation especially given the news that its 16-year-old star has since gotten pregnant (by her boyfriend not God). Is this the story of Mother Mary Riot Grrrl?Hardly. The devoted can breathe a sigh of relief and bring the kids; the curious will find a handsome disarmingly tender visualization of the original Christmas that relies more on faith than on filmmaking inspiration. If ""Passion"" was the Gospel According to Mel ""The Nativity Story"" is strictly by the Book.As such your engagement with the movie will depend on your own level of belief; at the very least its refreshing to see a holiday film that doesnt involve Tim Allen wearing 80 pounds of rubber padding. Earnest stilted rapturous ""Nativity Story"" takes advantage of the new biblical realism pioneered by ""Passion"" -- Mary is appropriately adolescent the setting appropriately harsh -- while keeping one foot in the cliches of the old Hollywood epics. Its ""The Song of Bernadette"" for the iPod generation.As played by Keisha Castle-Hughes (""Whale Rider"") Mary of Nazareth is just one of the teenage girls and boys helping their parents dig out a hardscrabble existence in the stony landscape; more somber than most she ducks the ardent glances of Joseph (Oscar Isaac) even after her father (Shaun Toub) betroths her to the young man.Over in Jerusalem King Herod (the fine Irish actor Ciaran Hinds making with the crazy eyes and generally behaving as if he were in a Cecil B. DeMille silent) wants to nullify the prophecy of a coming Messiah for all mankind; he bides his time while his soldiers bleed the poor to pay for the kings gold-tiled waterfalls. And in far-off Persia three wise men named Balthasar (Eriq Ebouaney) Melchior (Nadim Sawalha) and Gaspar (Stefan Kalipha) fiddle with their astrolabes and predicting the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter saddle up their camels.These are sideshows; the Magi come off as a sort of sandy agreeable Manny Moe and Jack. ""Nativity Story"" focuses mostly on the drama of a young woman who has been told by the Angel Gabriel (played by Alexander Siddig when not being played by a hawk) that shes bearing the Son of God.Castle-Hughes gives an initially passive performance that broadens and deepens as Mary acquires a sense of divine mission and a will of her own -- among other things the movies about a girl growing away from her small-minded community while facing her own doubts. ""Why is it me God has asked? I am nothing"" Mary says before coming to understand thats exactly why. It helps that her husbands a mensch. Even before Gabriel appears to Joseph this sensitive spouse -- Matthews ""just man"" -- is inclined to trust his new wifes claims of godly impregnation. When the couple makes the 90-mile trek to Bethlehem (the Emperor Augustuss census requires Joseph to return to the village of his birth) the ordeal is shared by the two in body and spirit the couple worrying about their unborn child like any expectant parents.Heres where director Catherine Hardwicke does try for something new ""Nativity Story"" understands that the larger miracle is that of reproduction and birth -- not just that Jesus is born but that any child is born. Mary is the films heroine and so are all women including her mother Anna (the great Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass) and her aunt Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo). In a real sense "" Nativity Story"" is the female other to Gibsons ""Passion"" Dedicated to life rather than death its suffused with a sense of the womanly divine.The filmmaking feels increasingly hemmed in though perhaps by a fear of giving offense to the touchy evangelical audience. ""Nativity Story"" rolls forward with Classics Illustrated fidelity and never strays far from the Gospels and after a while it becomes more pageantry than cinema. (Or maybe its just that Gabriels summons to the shepherds of Bethlehem reminded me of Linus giving the Bible reading in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas."")Elliot Daviss cinematography is picture-postcard gorgeous; Mychael Dannas score is reasonably subtle when its not weaving in Christmas carols. The movies going to make a bundle because it doesnt challenge anything and certainly the moviegoers who will be most moved by it dont want it to. They want splendidly produced orthodoxy.Good moviemaking challenges by its very nature of course and thats beside the point here. By the time Mary and Joseph reach the manger -- a small cave really -- and the Christmas star beams in through the hole above ""Nativity Story"" has officially turned into a creche.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog. Correction Because of a reporting error an article about the making of ""The Nativity Story"" in yesterdays Weekend section incorrectly used the term ""Immaculate Conception"" to refer to the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.

"The Nativity Story reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Nativity Story reviewed. The Nativity Story reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 30 2006 700 PM Bored in a Manger The unceasing drabness of The Nativity Story. By Dana Stevens Keisha Castle-Hughes and Oscar Isaac in The Nativity Story In the run-up to the 2004 presidential election common wisdom had it that there was something you were supposed to understand about The Passion of the Christ in order to understand the voters of the heartland or the return to old-fashioned values or whatever it was the liberal elite (remember them?) just didnt get about the wholesome populism of Red America. To observe that The Passion was simply a bad movie was far from a simple gesture; it positioned you willy-nilly in a camp with Michael Moore and Cindy Sheehan and SpongeBob SquarePants and all manner of lefty agitators. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Two years later theres no longer any imperative to pay lip service to bad religious kitsch and for that Lord Im deeply grateful. Advertisement Not mind you that Im equating Catherine Hardwicke director of The Nativity Story(Buena Vista) with Mel Gibson. Hardwickes new retelling of the Gospel account of the conception and birth of Jesus is fatuous sappy and dull but its neither sadistic nor bigoted. I dont doubt that Hardwicke and her screenwriter Mike Rich whos an avowed believer were uncynically earnest in their desire to translate the Gospel story to the screen. Its just that the best of intentions and a 2000-year-old heartbreaker of a story are not enough to make a compelling film. You need a point of view and something to say two things that the ploddingly pious Nativity Story never manages to conjure. Like an uninspired altarpiece or a by-the-numbers religious pamphlet the movie simply checks off one by one the well-known stations of the Biblical tale. Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a teenager in a Judaean village whose parents have arranged her marriage to Joseph (Oscar Isaac) out of financial necessity. The news comes that Marys cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) long past the age of fertility has miraculously conceived a child who will grow up to be John the Baptist. Soon after the angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) appears to Mary to announce that she has been chosen to bear the son of God. From there its an interminable donkey ride to Bethlehem where Mary will decorously give birth to our savior in a set backlit to look like a Christmas paperweight (though the newborn Jesus strangely is scarcely seen at all). Meanwhile the cruel King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) fearing the Old Testament prophecy of the Messiah orders the slaughter of firstborn children throughout the land. It seems odd that Hardwicke who coaxed superb performances from both Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter in the emotionally raw coming-of-age story Thirteen would be content with such a placid even submissive Mary. As she proved in Whale Rider Castle-Hughes has no shortage of spark. If only the movie had tweaked expectations enough to give her Mary a Gethsemane moment in which she struggled to reconcile the directive of her God with her natural adolescent desire to rebel to have fun maybe even to taste the pleasures of the flesh. Oscar Isaacs Joseph gets just a hint of such a moment when a merchant woman in Jerusalem blessing him and his pregnant wife assures him that ""To see yourself in a young face there is no greater joy."" For just a moment we think about Josephs daily trials squiring around a wife that everyone believes has cuckolded him denied even the simple joys of fatherhood. Sure he gets a couple of moments of tormented doubt but wouldnt it be great if Mary and Joseph had one big squabble en route to Bethlehem the road-trip fight to end all road-trip fights? The movies best scenes are the few that dare to risk a little playfulness usually involving the Three Wise Men Larry Curly and Moe ... I mean Balthasar (Eriq Ebouaney) Gaspar (Stefan Kalipha) and Melchior (Nadim Sawalha) . I liked watching the three kings pack for their journey to follow the northern star lovingly bundling their frankincense and myrrh as Balthasar gripes ""I need my dates and nuts"" But forget about iconoclasm; The Nativity Story is so cautious it lacks even a theology. When Mary asks Elizabeth ""Why is it me God has asked?"" neither her cousin nor the movie has any answer or seemingly much interest in the question. Its this drably devotional quality and not the use of religious subject matter per se thats the problem with the movie. Films like Scorseses The Last Temptation of Christ or Michael Tolkins The Rapture however flawed take scripture as the occasion for a wild flight of imagination. Even The Passion in its sick way seemed legitimately curious about its subject What did it feel like for Jesus to get that umpteenth lash from the Romans or have a nail driven into his hand? The Nativity Story which ends with a solemn Latin version of the 19th-century German hymn ""Silent Night"" is as lively and thought-provoking as a plaster Christmas creche on a churchyard lawn.

"Chapter and Verse washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Chapter and Verse Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) and Joseph (Oscar Isaac) on their way to the first Christmas in a film that carefully treads on familiar ground. (By Jaimie Trueblood -- New Line Cinema Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 1 2006 With the blockbuster success of Mel Gibsons ""The Passion of the Christ"" it should surprise no one that Hollywood has glommed onto Jesus in a big way. And what better biblical story to reenact than the Saviors birth made immortal everywhere from millions of pulpits to Linuss annual speech in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""? ""The Nativity Story"" made me think of Linus and reminded me why he makes me cry every year. Starchy where Linus is spontaneous stagy where Linus is sincere this drab exercise in glum piety slumps where it should soar sapping the story of its mystery and transcendence with an overriding sense of literality. As the familiar characters take their famous journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem it often looks like theyre treading on eggshells painstakingly trying to avoid offense misinterpretation or controversy with every careful step. To its credit ""The Nativity Story"" which was written by Mike Rich and directed by Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"" ""Lords of Dogtown"") puts the virgin birth in personal and historical context. The film reminds us that Mary -- played by Keisha Castle-Hughes -- was betrothed to Joseph (Oscar Isaac) as a result of an arranged marriage; here shes skeptical and a bit sullen at the prospect of marrying a guy she doesnt love. Cutting away from Marys difficult life in the desert Hardwicke portrays the three wise men prophesying the birth of a Jewish messiah and also the court of King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) who when he gets wind that such a king is on the way orders all male children of a certain age in his kingdom killed. (Fans of ""Rome"" will no doubt find it a bit jarring to hear Hinds who played Caesar in the HBO series invoke himself as Herod.) ""The Nativity Story"" thus sets up the journey on which these paths will inexorably cross; indeed with Herods dreadful plan in motion the story has all the makings of a groundbreaking spiritual thriller. But Hardwicke plays it safe duly hitting all the familiar marks and trotting out all the familiar tropes from the gauzily filmed Gabriel during the Annunciation scene to a manger that looks like it was recently confiscated from a town square in an ACLU raid. The marvelous Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo brings earthy realism to her performance as Marys cousin Elizabeth whose own late-in-life pregnancy augurs the miracle to come. But Castle-Hughes who was so vibrant in her 2002 debut ""Whale Rider"" is disappointing as Mary whom she portrays in an affectless performance that seems of a piece with the monochrome olive palette of the desert backdrop. There are fleeting attempts at humor -- the three kings and their banter while following yonder star suggest the origins of the term ""cracking wise"" -- but for the most part ""The Nativity Story"" serves mostly to illustrate rather than illuminate the rote story. Theres one exception to this and its the focus the filmmakers put on Joseph who enjoys a pride of place usually missing from the Mary-centric narrative. Here Joseph is portrayed as an honorable hardworking man patient with his future wifes ambivalence and understanding when she presents him with the virgin birth a circumstance most men would reject out of hand or more likely at the time punish with the back of it. The most intriguing thing about ""The Nativity Story"" transpires during the couples extraordinary personal journey advancing a radical idea in an otherwise long slog of a cinematic Sunday school lesson that Jesus became who He was not only because He was the son of God but because He was the son of a good man. The Nativity Story (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some violent content.

With Heath Ledger Abbie Cornish Geoffrey Rush. (108 min.)Movies about junkies always seem to resemble one another probably because the clinical nature of addiction is so predictable. There has to be a good reason to put yourself through yet another junkie odyssey and ""Candy"" flunks the test. Heath Ledger plays a sort of poet who gets romantically involved with the beautiful Candy (Abbie Cornish) a painter who comes from an upscale conservative background.

The Vatican recently hosted the world premiere of this film the first time the Holy See has officially approved a mainstream Hollywood production. From an ecclesiastical standpoint there is certainly less to object to here than say ""The Da Vinci Code"" but its a rather lifeless re-telling of the Nativity with greeting-card imagery and stiff performances. Keisha Castle-Hughes who was so wonderful in ""Whale Rider"" plays Mary and she seems pinioned by the filmmakers blandly reverential approach. Grade C+ - P.R.

It wasnt French it wasnt Italian it wasnt Yiddish or Bulgarian or Swahili -- it was some ungodly mixture of all of the above a pidgin foreign sub-Arte Johnson mishmash that a much wittier pal of mine dubbed my ""Esperanto accent."" Thats the way the characters talk in The Nativity Story. They speak in Serious Ancient Movie-ese -- a vaguely Middle Eastern vaguely Borat-ish sound in which the word God comes out as ""goat"" gift is ""geeft"" dark is ""dod-k"" and so forth. The accents are meant to carry a ring of authenticity but given that the mostly Jewish characters are speaking English rather than Hebrew or Aramaic you really do have to wonder what difference it makes that the stiff-backed dialogue is uttered like something you would expect to hear at an international fusion yogurt restaurant. The accents like the rest of The Nativity Story are a come-on a token of middlebrow highmindedness. Theyre Bible-movie decor like the dirty rumpled robes and head scarves the rocky-road villages. Dear God it is all so respectable and dull I went into The Nativity Story which is drawn from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as a fan of the director Catherine Hardwicke who has made two startlingly close-to-the-bone youth-rebel pictures the brilliant lacerating Thirteen and the 70s skate-punk fantasia Lords of Dogtown. I figured or hoped that Hardwicke might apply her antennae for the troubles of teen misfits to the tale of Mary and Joseph and when we first glimpse the face of Keisha Castle-Hughes the 16-year-old New Zealand star of Whale Rider (shes like a tough-nut Jennifer Beals) there is much promise in her olive-skinned beatific yet sloe-eyed look -- the image of an ancient statue that has come to life. In Nazareth Mary is told that a husband an eager carpenter named Joseph (Oscar Isaac) has been chosen for her and her prickly sullen response feels bold right. This is the way to draw an audience to a Bible spectacle -- to humanize and yes modernize Mary lending her a streak of vibrant stubbornness the quality shell need to carry the son of God in her womb. To our surprise and disappointment though Castle-Hughes never finds another shade another nuance -- heck another facial expression -- within that stoic riot grrrl of Judaea resolve. The old Hollywood biblical epics had a kitsch eroticism with actors like Charlton Heston and Hedy Lamarr turning scripture into a chaste pinup parade. The Nativity Story as if embarrassed to fall into that trap reduces its heroine after a few token rebel gestures to a saintly cipher. Having learned of her arranged union Mary according to the films press notes ""takes refuge in an ancient olive grove to collect her thoughts"" and if ever I wished that press notes were less accurate its here Mary spends the entire movie collecting her thoughts. In that olive grove shes visited by the angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) who looks disarmingly like Cat Stevens as he delivers the prophecy that Mary will give birth to the Messiah and that her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) is about to become miraculously pregnant as well. If Scorseses wrenching faith-splattered The Last Temptation of Christ portrayed Jesus relationship with his divinity as a profound human struggle then surely Mary as a mere mortal a naive and parochial village girl might greet the knowledge of her holy destiny with confusion or even a note of distress. But no Hardwicke and Castle-Hughes make her a coolly blank and passive soul. The movie that results isnt inept but its about as dramatic as a wall calendar. When the dastardly egotist King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) orders Mary and Joseph along with everyone in their region to return to the place of their birth for a census the couple now united must journey to Bethlehem. And journey they do on horseback through deserts and valleys along beaches. Yet thats all that happens. They ride. Its a trek to test the patience of the faithful relieved only by the three magi who are like infomercial astrologers.lt; /pgt; Hollywood now has a paradoxical relationship with evangelical America. The movie industry is eager to beckon and serve Christian viewers yet as long as it thinks of those viewers as another market slice a demo it may end up pandering to them with cautious and stultifying reverence. The Nativity Story is a film of tame picture-book sincerity but thats not the same thing as devotion. The movie is too tepid to feel or see the light.

"Nativity Story The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nativity-story-the ) Nativity Story The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli There are two ways in which one can consider The Nativity Story. As a piece of religious instruction or an animated version of a crA""che it accomplishes its aims. As a movie however its slow plodding and not terribly interesting. Theres also an unmistakable whiff of exploitation to be found. Although Im sure the people directly involved with the making of the movie came to it with the best intentions one can scent what smells suspiciously like greed coming from the corporate level. (Keep in mind that New Line Cinema is best known for its horror franchises - it owns both Freddy and Jason.) The desire to ride The Passion of the Christs coattails is understandable - that movie was a bona fide blockbuster. However The Nativity Story isnt in the same league. Its an uninspired re-telling of a Bible story that every Christian knows by heart. Part of the problem is the story material. The tale of Jesus birth isnt as interesting or compelling as the story of his death. Early Christians didnt care much about the Nativity - two of the Gospels (Mark John) dont mention it. The others offer only sketchy details that provide little more than an outline for a screenplay. Writer Mike Rich pulled information from other sources (many apocryphal) and used his imagination to fill in the blanks. The result isnt stellar. The narrative is straightforward but not interesting. Theres no dramatic tension the characters are poorly developed (its always difficult to humanize icons and Rich does a bad job) and the dialogue is wooden. I dont know if it would ever be possible to make the Nativity as engrossing as the Passion but theres no hope with Richs script. The movie opens in Nazarath with teenager Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) working in the fields and worrying about the tax collectors harassing her father. She soon learns she has been betrothed (against her will) to Joseph (Oscar Issac) a ""good man."" Shortly thereafter she receives a visit from the Archangel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) who informs her that she will become impregnated by the Holy Spirit and will give birth to Jesus the Son of God. She goes to visit her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Agdashloo) who is pregnant at an advanced age with a boy who will become John the Baptist. When she returns to Nazarath she becomes the subject of scandal due to her obvious state. Joseph is close to rejecting her but the angel appears to him in a dream. When King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) calls for a census at the behest of his Roman masters Joseph and Mary must return to the village of Josephs birth Bethlehem. It is there that the baby is born and a motley assortment of shepherds and magi come to visit the manger where he lies. The Herod subplot is the most interesting but it is given short shrift. As portrayed by Ciaran Hinds (who recently played Julius Caesar in the HBO series Rome) Herod has untapped depths. He tries to be a good ruler but is obsessed with the possibility that the Messiah might usurp his position. So he uses ruthless means including the ""slaughter of the innocents"" (killing all males in Bethlehem under the age of two) in an attempt to secure his position. He could not know that Jesus as a man of peace with a spiritual kingdom was no threat to his reign. An inordinate amount of time is devoted to the trek from Nazarath to Bethlehem. It seems to be as long as the road traveled by Frodo and Sam to Mordor only less interesting. The most momentous occurrence is when Mary nearly drowns while trying to cross a river. I dont remember that happening in the Bible but its the kind of license many Christians wont mind. The three magi (although the Bible never specifies their number or their names) provide the ""comic relief."" At times theyre more like The Three Stooges than The Three Wise Men. Director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) is an odd choice for the film. This is her first attempt at a period epic and her weaknesses show. Although she does an excellent job re-creating the look and feel of the time and place (set design and costumes are superlative) she is unable to provide us with compelling characters. Her decisions in developing the narrative make The Nativity Story seem like one of those illustrated childrens books of Bible stories come to life. The cast includes a number of respected actors although no stars. Kiesha Castle-Hughes Oscar nominated for Whale Rider is an adequate Mary. Apparently she found the idea of a young woman being pregnant so appealing that she tried it in real life. Shortly after completing filming of The Nativity Story the 16-year old Castle-Hughes became pregnant by her boyfriend. (New Line is not publicizing this fact.) The movies other previous Oscar nominee Shoreh Agdashloo is ridiculously over-the-top. Ciaran Hinds is one of the few performers who escapes with his reputation intact. For Christians in search of something wholesome and non-controversial The Nativity Story represents a reason to visit theaters this holiday season. Unlike the ultra-violent The Passion of the Christ this movie is family friendly. Although about 75% of the material in the movie is extra-Biblical (including most of the dialogue) The Nativity Story uses a fusion of the Matthew/Luke account as its blueprint. However for those who are not pulled to this movie for its religious slant theres no reason to go. Theres nothing here for a serious movie-goer. Despite the sizeable budget this is little more than a glossy Christmas tract.

Memories of dreary Sunday school classes come flooding back courtesy of ""The Nativity Story."" Earnestly Hallmark-worthy to a fault this stodgy addition to the cinematic religious revival gravy train offers only a bit of Year One location realism to distinguish it from films of its kind made in the 50s and early 60s though at least then it might have had the advantage of a score by the likes of Miklos Rozsa Franz Waxman or Alfred Newman. All the same New Line should be able to sell this pic effectively to the faithful over the holiday season and B.O. could be very strong indeed in Catholic territories such as Latin America where devotion to the Virgin Mary runs high. Admirers of Catherine Hardwicke will be particularly surprised that the director of ""Thirteen"" and ""Lords of Dogtown"" could make something this conventional and unspontaneous. Despite the presence of young vital actors the humdrum lines in Mike Richs script are spoken in a stilted pan-Mediterranean/Middle Eastern accent and with a stiffness that stifles all vitality and emotion resulting in a dry run-through of events plausibly extrapolated from the little actually known about the family of Jesus Christ. Just two of the four gospels Matthew and Luke include the story of the nativity and only the former notes the difficulty Marys intended husband Joseph and others in Nazareth may initially have had accepting the young womans claim of purity despite her pregnancy. Aside from this most of the drama stems from the threat posed by King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) who is obsessed with an ancient prophecy concerning the birth of a future Jewish king. Inspired by Matthew screenplay foreshadows Marys immaculate conception with the surprise pregnancy of her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) a woman past childbearing years. Unfortunately the promise of this miracle is announced in a vast temple to Elizabeths husband Jewish elder Zechariah (Stanley Townsend) in a manner that recalls nothing so much as the wizard speaking to Dorothy amp; Co. in Oz. As for Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) the serious-visaged teenager is none too thrilled to be abruptly thrown into an arranged marriage with the admiring Joseph (Oscar Isaac) whos at least a decade older. But no sooner is Mary told to remain chaste for a year than she is visited by the angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) in an olive grove and informed ""You have found favor with God."" Theres no question what this means. Mary goes to Jerusalem for a spell to bond with Elizabeth and figure out how to explain all this to Joseph who needs a holy visitation of his own to embrace his fate. In due course Joseph is obliged by the coming Roman census to return to his native Bethlehem which is so crowded that he and the ready-to-burst Mary are forced to make do in a cave artfully graced with a hole in the top to allow in celestial illumination. This guiding light proves invaluable to the Three Wise Men lightly comic figures who spend months making their way from Persia to Judea in order to attend the birth of the promised messiah. Hardwickes background as a production designer asserts itself in the vivid if fleeting depiction of quotidian life in Nazareth the maze of one-story stone huts that comprises Bethlehem and the imposing temple of Jerusalem. Otherwise however she evinces no feeling for antiquity the epic format or the dramatic presentation of epochal events. In addition to the mundane realism pic sorely needs some visual heightening to exalt its images and characters to suggest a spiritual dimension. Instead the films banal sensibility is suggested by its dependence upon ""startling"" transitions such as cutting away pointlessly to exotic animals or loud sounds and upon the recurring motif of heavy drum beats to signal the arrival of Roman soldiers. Castle-Hughes so effective in ""Whale Rider"" spends nearly the entire film furrowing her brow to express a mixture of anxiety and determination. Isaac seems ready and eager to combust at any moment but never gets the chance while Hinds all uptight paranoia as the Judean monarch no doubt becomes the first actor to portray both Herod and Julius Caesar in as many seasons. Visuals have been drained of vibrant colors which may serve to accommodate the extensive CGI backgrounds but dulls the overall look. Locations are very good; Matera the ancient southern Italian town used in ""The Passion of the Christ"" again fills in evocatively as Jerusalem and environs while Ouarzazate and other Moroccan locales provide diverse topography for the major treks involved.
