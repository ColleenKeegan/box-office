Comments (1) click to enlarge Endless Love Video Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2014 Previously adapted by Franco Zeffirelli in 1981 Scott Spencers 1979 novel returns to the screen as a glossy teen soap opera in the Aaron Spelling vein. Upon graduating high school a sheltered rich girl (Gabriella Wilde) enters into a passionate romance with a mechanics son (Alex Pettyfer) despite her fathers efforts to keep them apart. None of the players exhibits much personality but its hard to fault them given how thinly the characters have been imagined by screenwriters Shana Feste and Joshua Safran. Bruce Greenwood seems particularly constricted by the role of the villainous father a heart specialist who (ugh) doesnt understand the nature of the heart. Feste directed.

Ah yes our subject matter is puppy love so fresh and pure juxtaposed against a mean father who wont let nature take its course. ""Endless Love"" a remake of the 1981 movie starring Brooke Shields itself an adaptation of the 1979 novel by Scott Spencer is here to make you fondly reminisce on those first tender days of youthful relationships. That by the end youll be cringing is an unfortunate side effect of some structural choices down the line a tough break for everyone involved. The one positive attribute ""Endless Love"" has going for it in abundance is the sizzling duo at the center of the film. Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer truly do seem meant for each other especially in the sense that they are both better looking than everyone else at every party youve been to. In classic Hollywood fashion they are playing an 18 and 17-year-old just as all 20-something actors must and we begin our story at their high school graduation. Jade (Wilde) has been a reclusive shut-in for her entire teenage experience due to a tragedy in her family while David (Pettyfer) has admired her from afar. These opening few minutes already start to feel like a stretch mostly because Jade looks like a Seventeen model but were saved by the easy friendship of David and Mace (Dayo Okeniyi) before things get too out of hand. Theyre valets at a local country club in the heart of Georgia so of course they get into the sorts of easy shenanigans perfected by ""Ferris Buellers Day Off."" ""Endless Love"" does well initially to reasonably avoid pointless melodrama choosing a lighthearted and earnest vibe instead; this makes the first half of the film relatively watchable. Sadly things go desperately wrong after the opening promise; by the end of the film ""oh no"" events are being thrown on the screen one after another until its hard not to feel fatigued. Tonally ""Endless Love"" is all over the place wildly diverging from second to second from scene to scene. Its if huge chucks of movie are missing only those parts wouldnt do anything to help the movie so they just cut them and hoped no one would notice. From the beginning ""Endless Love"" establishes that a somewhat predictable pattern will arise in the form of ""dad frowns followed by couples montage."" Remarkably this isnt nearly as horrid as it sounds because the interplay and chemistry between the actors involved feels authentic and sturdy. However ""Endless Love"" then commits a crime against film that no lover of cinema should ever have to endure it gets markedly worse as it nears its culmination. Rapid-fire plot points are thrown at the audience a hodgepodge of supposed ""tension"" that any 12-year-old could see right through. If the original novels theme was obsessive love and the Brooke Shields film was forbidden love then Id say this one comes down squarely in the category of ""herky-jerky plot induced waffling teen love"" which isnt quite as compelling. Some of the unevenness comes from the role Bruce Greenwood is asked to play that of Jades father Hugh. Hes tasked with being the reason that Jade and David cant possibly be together while also maintaining the emotional center for the aforementioned family tragedy. This constant switch from soap opera villain to ""concerned dad"" to ""terrible husband"" to ""guy working his issues out"" is an impossible ask of any performer. Hes playing about six parts while Jade David and the audience all look at him with a confused apprehension. For the record the novel and the 1981 film avoided this conundrum altogether by not having it exist the idea that Jades father has to be the main action verb of ""Endless Love"" seems to be an entirely modern (and ill-conceived) decision. Logically ""Endless Love"" also suffers greatly from a general unease with the world we inhabit. In a reality where email wasnt a thing ""Endless Love"" makes a little bit of sense. In this theoretical throwback parents have the ability to physically separate a duo they disapprove of say their daughter and a boy from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" severing all ties causing the star-crossed duo to thrash and cry to the heavens on screen. This bedrock narrative foundation familial love vs. burgeoning romantic love has been done for hundreds of years but its only in the last two decades or so that storytellers have had to make the disconnect digital as well as physical. It doesnt make much sense to throw out an occasional ""Oh my phone was dead"" or yell at a parent ""well what did he say?"" when communication is pretty much instant and taken for granted these days. You cant have David and Jade wondering what the other is thinking to the level ""Endless Love"" aspires to because any reasonable person will say ""Why wouldnt she just email/text/Facebook/tweet/telegram him?"" Once that question becomes unanswerable our patience with ""Endless Love"" expires. Director Shana Feste (""Country Strong"") certainly has something of note happening in her directorial style and I look forward to seeing more from her. At its best ""Endless Love"" does have moments that work even within the montages where its clear theres a real affection for the characters on screen. That its not totally dialed in throughout makes it a victim of the same thing most bad movies fall prey to having the spark of a great idea rested awkwardly on top of a spinning mess of execution.

What a silly idea. Apart from the title the names of the characters and a fire theres no connection between Spencers tortured portrait of a kid who cant let go and this anemic sub-soap washout of a teen pic. Its actually worse than the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli-Brooke Shields version -- which is worse than being waterboarded but at least bears some resemblance to the book and its brilliantly addled 70s vibe. Spencer nailed the tension between the overly permissive counterculture and the reemergence of an angry patriarch. His hero might be out of control but hes justifiably confused. In this one Jade Butterfield is played by Gabriella Wilde a blonde with symmetrical features wide-apart eyes and endless stems. On the evidence of the last wretched remake she did --A CarrieA -- shes not a terrible actress but the only connection she and Alex Pettyfers David have is that theyre reading from the same script. Both Wilde and Pettyfer are Brits and its possible that they lost whatever snap they had in the course of transforming themselves into ultrabland midwestern Americans. Its also possible that no one -- Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet the original Romeo and Juliet -- could get blood from material this stone-dead. Director Shana Feste was responsible for Country Strong a.k.a.A Goopster Agonistes but even that looks good beside Endless Love. At a certain point she must have stopped fending off stupid studio notes and shot the movie they wanted -- the 100 percent inauthentic one. Graduating senior Jade -- who has evidently had no boyfriend until now -- prepares to leave for pre-med studies at Brown when she meets David a valet at her posh country club. They connect in spite of the disapproval of her straitlaced controlling father (Bruce Greenwood). David is working-class -- he helps his dad (Robert Patrick) repair cars -- and says hes not going to college. But he did take the SATs. ""I got a 2090"" he says which opens Jades eyes even wider. As Jade drifts further from her dad he says ""We used to talk."" Hes not all bad. Its just that hes still in mourning for his eldest son a high-school star who died of cancer. Jade regards her dead brothers picture while David looks on. ""Whats it like to have lost him?"" he asks. Three guesses. The book opens with a fire which is great emotional kindling. Banished from the Butterfield house David has set fire to the familys porch in the hopes that by saving them hell be a hero. In this Endless Love David saves Jade from being arrested for a dumb prank and then her dad knocks over a candle. The whole movie is on that level. And it raises the question If you remove all dissonances from a story -- to the point that its less offensive than a 70s Afterschool SpecialA -- then what the hell is left? Nada y nada y pues nada. Endless Love lives up to its name. Its purgatory.

"(Re)Made for Love << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The B.S. Report Anthony Davis  Next The Road Not Taken Facebook Twitter Print Movies (Re)Made for Love Hollywoods on the rebound for Valentines Day by Wesley Morris on February 14 2014 Valentines Day is intermittently a big deal to the movie industry. The more aligned February 14 is with a Wednesday or a weekend the crazier it gets. But for every Nicholas Sparks bulls-eye theres something with Adam Sandler Hannibal Lecter or a passel of soon-to-be-dead teens. This year the 14th is a Friday and that means movies are those partners who show they care by totally going overboard. Not only are there a pair of romances and a sex comedy this week but 75 percent of the new major-studio releases are based on movies that already exist. You may love love stories. Hollywood loves remakes. The new RoboCop stars Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy a Detroit detective and family man whos killed by crooks and revivified by corporate science. Gary Oldman preserves Murphys brain lungs and long handsome face and builds them an elaborate armor. A slick defense contractor (Michael Keaton) wants to sell the result -- a multibillion-dollar walking tank -- to the government. Theres a liberal moral-minded senator (Zach Grenier) breathing down Keatons neck and Oldmans scientist suspects he might have a Frankenstein situation on his hands. His creation -- RoboCop -- yearns for wife Abbie Cornish and their son while remaining determined to solve his own murder. All this goes on after Iranian insurgents strike back against the U.S. government robot soldiers that roam the streets of Tehran. A quick Google search would have informed our hero that the same thing happened to another guy named Murphy back in 1987. He was shot dead reborn and fought crime and they called that movie RoboCop too. It was a lean mean satire machine that opened 27 years ago in July. The screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a black comedy about Orwellian capitalism and the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven turned it into a strange mockery of Hollywood action priorities. His RoboCop played by Peter Weller embodied and rebuked the law-enforcement avengers of the 70s and the steroidal action figures of the 80s. Verhoeven gave us a literal killing machine. But his film -- with its droll depiction of a complicit media subplot of beat cops on the verge of a strike and myriad flavors of corrupt CEO -- collapsed the future into the present. In 2014 Verhoevens then still feels like now. This remake is like someone breaking into an ATM. It takes less than 20 seconds to find Verhoevens movie which still feels as if it doesnt have a pure genre. This new version directed by Jose Padilha and written by Joshua Zetumer gives it one. Its more of a straight-up action film about a man fighting for his humanity (and against having his dopamine levels manipulated). Thats not nearly as interesting as the anarchic drollery of the original. You miss Verhoevens borderline heartlessness and his inability to tell the difference between good acting and bad (Nancy Allen played Murphys police partner like an 80s sitcom kid sister). That sounds like a put-down but with Verhoeven it just means theres no artifice to the performances. Theres a rawness to everything and the rawness feels real. This new version goes for realness too. This time Michael K. Williams is Murphys partner -- hes the sort of no-frills actor Verhoeven would love. The movie also tries to make a character of Detroit but that doesnt go far. Murphy is engineered in a Chinese factory and exported to the erstwhile Motor City. The irony is cruel and cruelly unexamined. But you never resent it as much as you might want to; the new RoboCop is smart in its limited way. Jennifer Ehle plays an icy corporate lawyer and Jay Baruchel is perfect as Keatons sleazy marketing man. Meanwhile Samuel L. Jackson hosts a hawkish cable-news show in an Al Sharpton perm and the movie grazes todays unique ideological scramble of a liberal presidential administration embracing right-leaning security stances. Happily Padilha is more than a hack. He doesnt fear long shots for one thing. They give RoboCop his due as a physical specimen. In a moment of post-traumatic stress he breaks out of the lab and on to a vast factory floor packed with Chinese workers in pink lab coats then into a rice paddy. The camera trails below him then above. Padilha also gets the movies satire of defense capitalism. When insurgent martyrs strike back against whatever it is the film has the U.S. doing in Tehran the Pentagon cuts the feed to Jacksons news program. This is a thinking action thriller. You laugh at the baldness of a conspiracy whose ladder spans the top of the government down into the Detroit Police Department. Padilha is Brazilian and its interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries curdled politics. Padilha devised the hostage documentary Bus 174 and two Elite Squad action-thrillers and they all deftly asserted that systemic government corruption and neglect of the lower classes breed criminality. Padilhas RoboCop runs on a sentimentality absent from both his other work and Verhoevens original. Murphy just wants to get home to his family and his family needs him to come home to them. But the movie has no idea what to do with the perversity of this new dynamic which seems ripe for a returning-war-veteran allegory. But the movie does something Verhoeven couldnt have in 1987 It loosens up racial and political positions. The liberal anti-drone senator has the humorless doggedness the entertainment industry usually saves for conservatives. And the conservative here is Samuel L. Jackson who more than meets his contractually obligated use of ""motherfucker."" Kinnaman plays pre-RoboCop Murphy in the same black tones he used to play an ex-junkie detective on AMCs The Killing. When Williamss character sees Murphy in ebony armor he says ""Least I know you the right color now."" Which is to say Kinnamans RoboCop gives the action franchise something else thats timely its own Macklemore.  I didnt think of the Endless Love remake as an old Hollywood melodrama. But it is Social mores are breached social mores erupt. Its just never interesting enough to get you thinking about anything. Like the original this version is based on Scott Spencers 1979 novel which was turned into a notorious 1981 Franco Zeffirelli movie with Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt as two different kinds of rich kids in love. (""She is 15. He is 17"" read the poster. ""The love every parent fears."") Spencers book is a good overblown adult novel that Zeffirelli and screenwriter Judith Rascoe turned into an extra-strength after-school special about sexual obsession. Charmingly Zeffirelli didnt seem to get that he wasnt doing Verdi or Shakespeare but he didnt seem to know he was making a movie either. His direction was unruly and arbitrary two hours of unmowed lawn. But this remake has almost nothing to do with Spencers novel. Its the kind of film you make when youve run out of Nicholas Sparks books. Its set in the South instead of Chicago. The story -- in which a hot working-class kid (Alex Pettyfer) fights for a rich virginal blonde (Gabriella Wilde) -- has Sparks flavoring. There are Secrets. When the boys thrown in jail the girl screams at her father ""Get him out I love him"" The father is played by Bruce Greenwood who tries to make this all seem emotionally plausible as is a good actors wont. But the movie needs him to swap plain old paternity for villainous tiger-dadding -- you know No boys for you daughter just this medical internship. And Why cant you be more like my other son? Whos dead Shana Feste is the director. Shes the one who put the ""try"" in Country Strong -- but that movie at least coughed up a few wonders mostly with the actors. Feste was going for Nashville authenticity there. This time she appears to be aiming for the top of the box office. All of the books bizarre psychological behavior is gone the come-ons the arson the mental illness the sexual assault that downbeat ending. The stars are British models doing American accents and you never believe them. Wilde just spends the movie galloping in and out of rooms. This isnt acting so much as steeplechase. The new movie throws in one friend (Dayo Okeniyi) for comic relief and one (Emma Rigby) for sexual comedy. The latter is a jealous ex -- and brunette -- who at some point finds herself on the edge of a bed with her chest and lips puffed out and stomach sucked in while in the right of the frame Pettyfer stands in the bathroom staring forlornly into a mirror. Thats not a movie scene. Its a Guess Jeans ad. Zeffirelli gave his version heat that you almost never see in movies with young actors now. When Hewitt kissed Shields you were amazed there was anything left of her face. He was hungry for love. Too many actors in the remake just look hungry.  Im no fan of turning one book into 16 movies. But on the way out of Winters Tale the other night I rode the escalator with a woman who said it should have been a series. I didnt read the Mark Helprin novel the movies based on but I did just lift up a hardback copy and nearly threw out my back. Its 672 pages which is to say the woman who loved the book and disliked the movie had a point. Still I dont know that six more hours of Colin Farrell riding a white horse with aurora borealis wings would help. This is a time-travel love fantasy featuring a consumptive English virgin (Jessica Brown Findlay) an Irish burglar (Farrell) his equine spirit animal and a demon gangster (Russell Crowe). There are also an American publishing baron (William Hurt) a dour New York food reporter (Jennifer Connelly) a totally different dying girl (Ripley Sobo) a high-powered newspaper scion (Eva Marie Saint) and two appearances by Lucifer whos played wearing a blazer T-shirt and vest by a Very Famous Movie Star in a not-so-secret cameo. I wont detail how these people connect to each other because should you wind up at this mess youll need a reason to laugh. The director and writer is the veteran Hollywood screenwriter and producer Akiva Goldsman whos done it all -- The Client Batman amp; Robin Cinderella Man A Beautiful Mind The Da Vinci Code I Am Legend. This is his debut as a director and I wish there were more to say about it than ""Come again now?"" He cant make you care about one world let alone the cosmic collision of two. Whenever someone asks why something happens to be the response tends to be something like ""Those are the rules."" Theyre just never made clear to us so it seems as though Goldsman is simply making things up as he goes. We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy. Most of the actors here have previously worked with Goldsman who it seems has called in several favors. (Would Connelly have her Oscar without him?) They all give their roles lots of tears and passion -- even the Very Famous Movie Star. But its a waste. If youve got these actors in your movie why are you bothering with magic at all? The magic should be them.  The best of this weeks remakes and the best of this weeks romances is also the least likely combination of the two. About Last Night is just like the 1986 movie of the same name (but without any ellipses). Now Michael Ealy Joy Bryant Kevin Hart and Regina Hall are in roles that Rob Lowe Demi Moore James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins were all miscast in. Both movies are based on David Mamets 1974 play Sexual Perversity in Chicago. The play now feels like Mamet for beginners but the foundation is still solid enough for a sex comedy. In the new movie directed by Steve Pink and written by Leslye Headland who wrote and directed Bachelorette two coworkers (Ealy and Hart) have drinks with two roommates (Bryant and Hall). Hart and Hall have slept together once before. The movie delivers a play-by-play of the sex and just listening to Hall exclaim to Bryant that Harts pecker is the ""John Legend of penises"" is like going to sitcom-banter heaven. The whole movie is like that loud fast quippy made-for-TV. When Hart and Hall get fantastically drunk before going to have more sex in a bathroom Ealy walks Bryant home and a more traditional relationship starts. Hart and Hall fight and fuck and then fight some more while Ealy and Bryant who are both elegant natural actors drift into domestic malaise. None of what follows is profound. But the movies got energy and lewdness and warmth.1 Headlands script expands the parameters of Mamets play to make the women as funny as the men in the play think they are. This film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. Theyre the undercard that takes over the movie. Hall was Anna Fariss copilot in out-on-a-limb nonsense at the start of the Scary Movie series. And I always worry that the studios forget what she can do with a so-so comedy -- like knock Hart to the floor with laughter as she does toward the end of this movie. Shes great here using her body and her voice to bring something newly human out of her costar. So much of Harts shtick asks us to believe in his sexiness before he pulls a rug out from under it. What hes lacked are partners as credible as Ealy and Hall. He had his moments with Alan Arkin in Grudge Match but Arkin wast sparring with him -- he was flyswatting. Ride Along has made him a box office star but About Last Night makes a case for Hart as the kind of romantic comedian wholl stop humping your leg long enough to ask how your day was. The movie also has Ealy and Bryant in Ike and Tina Halloween costumes which means that after Jay Zs reference to them on Beyonces ""Drunk in Love"" it might be time to revisit why thats too loaded an allusion for so much glibness.

Inside Halseys Troubled Past Chaotic Present How Son of Sam Changed America Endless Love By Peter Travers February 14 2014 More News 3 Tragically Awful Valentines Day Movies All Stories >> More News 3 Tragically Awful Valentines Day Movies All Stories >> Why does Hollywood continue to starve audiences longing for a good romantic tearjerker? Endless Love didnt have to be this godawful. In 1979 Scott Spencers novel about impediments to the true love between a teen girl and a mental patient won deserved raves. As Spencer said ""It may be time for serious literary novelists to take back some of the subject matter we abandoned to hack novelists and the movies."" Amen to that brother. Expectations were high when the great filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli (Romeo and Juliet) took on Spencers book in 1981 with young stars Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt. But the film was a notorious botch job best remembered for spawning a title song duet by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie. Now more than three decades later Hollywood again steps up to the plate and sends Spencers book down in flames. Shana Feste director of the lame Country Strong doesnt just serve Spencers tale of erotic obsession with a spoonful of sugar she pours on the whole effing bowl. Poor boy David (Alex Pettyfer) falls for rich girl Jade (Gabriella Wilde) and the only craziness belongs to Jades doctor dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) who is obsessed with making Jade a fill-in for her dead brother. The movie offers prettiness personified in Pettyfer and Wilde (both Brits) as they pose and preen in various states of undress as a substitute for acting. No go. This Endless Love is a photo shoot not a movie. Itd play better as a slideshow of jpgs. Even nine-year-old girls ought to cry foul on this movies endless blandness.

"Review As a Valentines music video Endless Love delivers the hearts and flowers - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review As a Valentines music video Endless Love delivers the hearts and flowers Endless Love Quantrell Colbert / Universal Pictures Alex Pettyfer as David and Gabriella Wilde as Jade in ""Endless Love."" Alex Pettyfer as David and Gabriella Wilde as Jade in ""Endless Love."" (Quantrell Colbert / Universal Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In ""Endless Love"" the gauzy new romantic drama starring Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde as the meant-to-be-togethers one thing is certain -- sometimes beauty is only skin deep.Directed by Shana Feste and delivering its breaking hearts and fragrant flowers just in time for Valentines Day the film is filled with interesting ideas about love loss self-esteem and social class particularly as they define still malleable graduating seniors. But in adapting Scott Spencers novel for the big screen Feste and Joshua Safran (""Gossip Girl"") barely skim the surface. With maddening musical wild abandon. Every time things between blue-collar David (Pettyfer) and pretty privileged Jade (Wilde) get sticky -- either kissy/gooey or teary/hurt-y -- and the film could go deep ""Endless"" morphs into music video territory.Director of photography Andrew Dunn has a field day with slow-mo kissing dancing hugging swimming gazing and running through verdant fields gardens parks and pastures on days and nights that are rain-drenched wind-swept sun-washed moonlit. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenAll of the veteran cinematographers loverly images are set to a moody indie-pop soundtrack saturated with tunes that tell the story as often as the dialogue ""All of Me"" ""I Know Its You"" ""Leading Me Now"" ""Ends of the Earth"" ""Dont Find Another Love"" ""I Know You Can Hear Me"" ""All Our Endless Love.""The film is a harmless frothy confection but you wonder Can Jade and David survive the conflicts and the lyrics?The lines are starkly drawn from the beginning for the star-crossed pair. It is graduation day as the lens zooms in on the beautiful Jade as David narrates poetically about the girl he loves from afar. Same school but class divides and the death of Jades beloved older brother a couple of years earlier are the great gulf that separates them. Or so one might think. But we havent been introduced to Hugh (Bruce Greenwood).Jades dad a cardiac surgeon is still mourning the loss of his brilliant golden boy and has transferred all his hopes to the slight shoulders of his shy studious sweet daughter. Her mom Anne (Joely Richardson) spends her time struggling to reclaim her marriage and doting on her kids. Their other son Keith (Rhys Wakefield) is delightful but with a disappointing college major in ""communications"" hes Hughs favorite whipping boy. Until David comes along.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVPopular outgoing sensitive smart charismatic handsome David would be perfect boyfriend material if not for his job as a valet the occasional violent temper and those socioeconomic issues. His dad Harry (Robert Patrick) may be a decent guy but hes rough around the edges and runs a local garage. The whereabouts of Davids mom involves a really sad story that later becomes significant.A chance encounter at the country club on graduation night -- David is parking cars when Jades family arrives for dinner -- and the spark that was hinted at in the opening scenes becomes the flame that refuses to die.There are many complicating factors the couple must weather that involve car accidents college majors restraining orders and major tests of their love. Not surprisingly Hugh tries to squelch the relationship primarily by being overbearing. Anne supports the couple in a wistful I-remember-when way that also reminds us what a subtle and refined actress Richardson can be.Wilde has one of those faces cameras love thus her other career as a model. There are suggestions in ""Endless"" that she might have acting talent too. But the director rarely asks. Though the filmmaker seems intent on making romantic drama her metier if anything she seems hesitant here. While her second film 2010s ""Country Strong"" was far from perfect it allowed for more actual performance time particularly for the excellent Garrett Hedlund.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013Though Jade and David are the main attraction in ""Endless"" the most interesting relationship is David and Hughs. Their clashes have the most substance and arguably more real emotion. Greenwood is quite good at shape-shifting between decent and dastardly.But Pettyfer is the man of the moment.The British actor who along with Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum made 2012s ""Magic Mike"" so watchable continues to be a surprisingly strong presence on screen. Against all odds he comes close to carrying this film into respectable romantic range. There must be a hip indie rock/pop/folk song that would be appropriate to queue up right about now.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com----------------------Endless LoveMPAA rating PG-13 for sexual content brief partial nudity some language and teen partyingRunning time 1 hour 43 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Joely Richardson Gossip Girl (tv program) Country Strong (movie) Robert Patrick On the Set Movies and TV Colin Farrell turns romantic in the fantasy film Winters Tale Review The Returned brings new life to the zombie genre Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-endless-love-review-20140214,0,2787960.story#axzz2tFVBPr8Y",200,endlesslove(2014)7,endlesslove(2014),latimes

Colbert Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Gabriella Wilde Alex Pettyfer Bruce Greenwood Joely RichardsonRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 43 minutes; Opens Friday nationwide 45 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORETo enjoy Endless Love one must swoon over sappy greeting-card notions of affection pretty teens with empty heads and endless romantic cliches.Everyone else will be rolling their eyes at the predictability of every pseudo-twist and the timing of every longing glance.Endless Love ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) might as well be one long montage of yearning gazes tender kisses and lovers splashing in sundry bodies of water like playful otters. The dialogue relies mostly on overheated narration and by-the-book romantic declarations such as ""I know Im not good enough for you but Im going to spend my entire life proving that I am""A reworked version of the cloying 1981 Brooke Shields star vehicle might have been intriguing. But director/co-writer Shana Feste didnt bother to revise the story beyond its superficial elements.STORY A big fight looms for Valentines Day movie loversREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersFirst love is ripe for exploring obviously -- last years The Spectacular Now captured its complexity with realistic dialogue believable chemistry and convincing obstacles. The characters portrayed by Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley were recognizable and fully drawn.But Endless Loves leads Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer are attractive ciphers. We never get a sense of why the pair are drawn to each other. They rarely converse beyond a sentence or two. Instead they trace ""I love you"" on fogged-up car windows or run headlong into each others arms. No matter how young that first love is (and this romance is between graduating high school seniors) some conversation some sharing of thoughts would go on.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Endless Love daddy doesnt approve of his rich girl falling for a poor boy and digs for skeletons in the young mans closet to keep the couple apart. VPCIt turns out that David (Pettyfer) has been watching Jade (Wilde) a shy long-haired beauty through most of high school. Apparently few others have noticed her though thats hard to believe. Jade mostly goes to class and comes home and studies ever since the death of her older brother a few years before.David gives no reason why hes convinced shes the girl for him. He might as well be the handsome prince to her Cinderella seeing her from across a crowded ballroom and falling madly in love.Though hes handsome maybe David is not a storybook prince. Theres a hot-headed side to him that has gotten him into trouble. The son of a mechanic (Robert Patrick) David has no plans for college and lives on the wrong side of the tracks.Jade is a cucumber-cool princess. The privileged daughter of a wealthy doctor she lives in a mansion and has been accepted to an Ivy League school.Their vastly different backgrounds lead to the requisite class tension thats as formulaic as it is tedious. Were supposed to feel their forbidden love but it rings hollow.Were also supposed to believe Jade plans to be a doctor like her father but given Wildes limited acting range its hard to buy. She conveys a coltish exuberance and little else while Pettyfer has a blandly brooding quality. Their chemistry is tepid at best.What is most troubling is how this film can serve to shape perceptions for impressionable kids. Young girls and boys will think that non-stop make-out sessions is all it takes to sustain ""endless love."" 45 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1b0mSbj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/13/endless-love-review/4987625/,200,endlesslove(2014)8,endlesslove(2014),usatoday
"Endless Love remake a charming Valentine Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEndless Love remake a charming Valentine Review Endless Love a remake of the Brooke Shields vehicle of three decades ago casts Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde as star-crossed loversGabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer star in the remake of Endless Love a classic rich-girl-meets-poor-boy story.By Trish CrawfordMusicThu. Feb. 13 2014Starring Alex Pettyfer Gabriella Wilde Bruce Greenwood Joely Richardson Robert Patrick. Directed by Shana Feste. Opens Feb. 14 at GTA theatres. PGEndless Love tells the story of star-crossed lovers beautifully.Gabriella Wilde (TheThree Musketeers) with her long coltish legs flowing blond locks and luscious lips stars as loyal rich-girl Jade Butterfield.Hunky former model Alex Pettyfer (Magic Mike) shows off his biceps as the mechanics son David Elliot while brushing back his cowlick and looking longingly from dark eyes brimming with tears.Article Continued BelowAlthough both leads in the movie are in their 20s they convincingly play teenagers recklessly in love. The frequent close-ups employed by director Shana Feste lovingly caress their luminous faces throughout.Its the forbidden rich/poor matchup -- a common movie theme from LoveStory to Dirty Dancing. Jade lives in a spectacular home with her parents Dr. Hugh Butterfield (Canadian Bruce Greenwood) and homemaker Anne Butterfield (Joely Richardson) who appears to be a bit in love with David too. Anne writes the most inappropriate college recommendation letter ever.Theres wealth galore displayed at a graduation party with champagne and the familys luxury cottage plus Jades fashion-forward wardrobe. For contrast theres the oily garage where plaid-shirted David helps his single-parent dad (raspy Robert Patrick) fix cars.It is the summer between high school and college when the two meet and fall in love before running afoul of grumpy dad who is still mourning the death of a son (shades of Footloose). The fall-in-love montage includes a wading pool road hockey running through a sprinkler dancing and attending an outdoor rock concert from which they return in the back of a pickup truck. The certainty that David is going to scrawl ""I love U"" on the trucks window makes the journey a stress-free ride.As the lovers kiss kiss and kiss some more Hugh repeatedly throws obstacles between them because he says David ""isnt good enough"" for med school-bound Jade. David hits Hugh in the chops which pretty much solidifies dads animosity to the union. Minus the grisly melodrama of the 1981 version -- no mental asylum or prison -- Endless Love unfolds as a sweet date movie appropriate for teens without swearing or explicit sex. The unrealistic moderate drinking strong monogamous relationships between young couples respect for elders and good grades of the protagonists sets this firmly as a parent-friendly fantasy. Jades love for David is tested again and again as ""bad luck"" befalls him and he never gives up fighting for her. This is a love letter not a tragedy (unlike Romeo and Juliet which was directed by Franco Zeffirelli who also helmed the earlier Endless Love) with an upbeat tone that is consistent with sun-kissed summer days.All of the drama comes from trying to outwit dad either by sneaking out at night or having sex in the downstairs living room and also trying to make up for all of the mistakes of youth including trespassing into a zoo after Jade declares ""Lets be young and drunk just for tonight.""Greenwood has the thankless task of being a man who is hard to like and who systematically destroys his relationships with his long-suffering wife underachieving son Keith (Rhys Wakefield) whom he ridicules for studying communications at college and rebellious Jade.The vein of sentiment running throughout is the kind youd expect to find in a valentine -- ""Lets make the days we have together the best days ever.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rated PG-13 (mild sexuality language) BOTTOM LINE The bungled Brooke Shields movie from 1981 gets a total makeover and the result is a slick professional thoroughly predictable teen romance. CAST Gabriella Wilde Alex Pettyfer Bruce Greenwood LENGTH 145 There are remakes readaptations and reboots and then there is ""Endless Love"" a movie that bears almost no resemblance to its source material whatsoever. You might call this a bad thing if youre a fan of Scott Spencers 1979 novel still well-regarded for its vivid portrayal of incendiary passion. Or you might call it a good thing if you remember Franco Zeffirellis botched 1981 adaptation a soft-core melodrama that showcased Brooke Shields adolescent body and acting limitations. If you have no memory of either -- which would mean youre about 13 -- the new ""Endless Love"" will serve just fine as a glossy traditional predictable Hollywood romance. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Written by Jonathan Safran and director Shana Feste ""Endless Love"" is recast as ""Romeo and Juliet"" along a class divide. David is now a local grease monkey who falls for the wealthy but lonely Jade. Played by Alex Pettyfer (""I Am Number Four"") and Gabriella Wilde (the recent ""Carrie"" remake) theyre an attractive pair of young canoodlers. When Jade chooses David over an important summer internship her controlling father Hugh (a fine Bruce Greenwood) decides to pry them apart. Thats a more convincing premise than we got in the 1981 film whose characters were so wildly inconsistent that they bordered on psychotic (James Spader originally played Jades hostile brother). Here as the battle between youth and age grows increasingly intense we can at least comprehend Hughs concern. His wife Anne (Joely Richardson) is no longer a creepy cougar but a soothing voice of reason. As a director Feste often gets gold from her actors (Pierce Brosnan in ""The Greatest"" Leighton Meester in ""Country Strong"") but as a writer she tends to play it safe. Her David can do no wrong -- every misstep every misunderstanding is someone elses fault. In Festes hands even the books most disturbing plot point becomes an occasion for hugs and heart tugs. Thats a prime example of why ""Endless Love"" functions so smoothly yet remains so uninteresting. 121 MoviesEndless Love trailer By the way you wont hear the Oscar-nominated title song made famous by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.

Universal Pictures photo Remake of Endless Love is bottomless pit of pollution By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Feb 13 2014 (...) Quantrell Colbert Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer in ""Endless Love."" Universal Pictures photo Its not unusual for curmudgeons to say that a book was better than the movie version. Or that the first movie version was better than the second. In the case of ""Endless Love"" if there was a Branson dinner-theater version it was surely better than the bastardization that will be festering in your local multiplex for the next seven days. Do yourself and your sweetheart a favor by waiting a week for a coming attraction called ""Closed for Fumigation.""This movie is based on the acclaimed novel by Scott Spencer in roughly the same sense that ""Duck Dynasty"" is based on the Bible. The film version in 1981 directed by Franco Zeffirelli (""Romeo and Juliet"") made a star out of Brooke Shields. This one should make Gabriella Wilde a cautionary tale about eating disorders. Apparently the United States is running out of scrawny blonde starlets; Wilde is British playing Georgia peach Jade Butterfield. Jade is the prettiest and richest girl at her suburban Atlanta high school but were supposed to believe that she has no friends let alone lovers because shes spent the past two years mourning for a dead brother and preparing for pre-med at Brown.The only boy astute enough to notice her is David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer also British last seen stripping in ""Magic Mike""). Alas this latter-day James Dean is from the wrong side of the tracks where he works as a mechanic with his father (Robert Patrick). Jades father (Bruce Greenwood who is missing a mustache to villainously twirl) isnt too thrilled to have a grease monkey sniffing around the mansion and he tries to keep Jade in the jewelry box. But her mother (Joely Richardson) welcomes the hunky lad albeit not in the wanton way depicted in the book and the first movie. The most shocking deviation from the source material is the omission of the plot point mentioned in the very first line of the novel. That reckless act encapsulates Davids obsession but the only hint of obsession here is the way that the pretty protagonists mirror the mannequins in an ad for Obsession perfume.This stinker is only good for endless laughs.

February 13 2014 -- 229pm Quantrell D. Colbert Dml - Gabriella Wilde in ""Endless Love"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert A box of Valentines Day sweets thats rather too sugary ""Endless Love"" goes even milder than the campy nougat-filled 1981 Brooke Shields version. Its far gooier than Scott Spencers edgy novel of teenage obsession arson and clandestine love. Spencer recently published an apologetic open letter calling the first film ""really bad"" and the new rendition ""even worse."" As re-imagined by the producing team of the long-running teen soap operas ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl"" Spencers protagonist has been considerably tamed. Originally he was a lovesick pyromaniac who burns down his girlfriends house with the family inside when hes told he cannot see her again. The boy is now a true-blue hunkmuffin who will when provoked beyond all human endurance bop a deserving jerk on the nose. The stakes you see have been dramatically lowered. Alex Pettyfer plays the blue-collar high-school dreamboat David a country club parking valet. Jade played by Gabriella Wilde is a gorgeous wealthy brilliant wallflower who has passed through four years of school without a date. In one of many developments that defy credibility she is shunned by her classmates like the Queen of the Cooties. David long her secret admirer shows Jade the excitement of living on the edge. He takes her for a joy ride in a club-members convertible (gasp) and for a swim (double gasp). Like Krazy Glue they bond permanently. This rankles Jades overbearing father (played with an agreeably pugnacious edge by Bruce Greenwood) who sees David as an impediment to her departure for a pre-med internship. Theres a great deal of Romeo and Juliet adults-just-dont-understand business a scene of all-consuming passion in front of a roaring fireplace and a four-alarm fire that allows David to play the hero and save the day. Writer/director Shana Feste gives the proceedings the surface shimmer of a shampoo commercial. Pettyfer who has done good work as a venal male stripper in ""Magic Mike"" and a misunderstood extraterrestrial in ""I Am Number Four"" plays his vanilla nice guy role agreeably. Hes a suitable physical match for the long-stemmed Wilde who expresses youthful high spirits by gamboling and twirling a lot. Feed Loader Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in ""Endless Love."" Though their romance doesnt have any real ""Endless Love"" crises or passionate abandon it isnt a travesty either. Its sort of pleasant in a forgettable way. If youve reached the stage in your relationship where chocolate-dipped strawberries roses a giant stuffed panda and pink Champagne are no longer sufficient Valentines Day tributes this might be worth the price of two tickets. Just dont tell Scott Spencer I said so. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

(Norman Jean Roy/Universal Pictures) By Stephanie Merry February 13 2014 Follow stephmerry When Franco Zeffirelli brought Scott Spencers novel ""Endless Love"" to the big screen in 1981 the result was a corny poorly received teen romance starring Brooke Shields. More than three decades later ""Endless Love"" is back and what does this new version offer? A different set of actors a Valentines Day release date and kissing. Lots of kissing. Kissing in place of character development and dialogue even entire kissing montages where a meaningful plot should be. The movie feels like Nicholas Sparks fan fiction as David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) a wrong-side-of-the-tracks type falls for blond bookworm Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde). Both are recent high school grads but Jade is bound for Brown while David has no plans beyond valeting at the local country club and working as a mechanic in his dads shop. Jade spent high school either mourning the loss of her older brother or studying so when the beefy popular kid shows an interest she practically swoons. Not only does she fall deeply and immediately in love with David but her brother (who struggles with a raging case of middle-child syndrome) and mother (Joely Richardson) become enamored with Davids romantic outlook too. Who needs money when you have true love the teen wonders aloud to the Butterfield clan as they lounge on the porch of the family manse. And just when shooting stars should be streaking across the sky along comes Jades father Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) an epic killjoy who reminds everyone that love doesnt pay the mortgage. Hes clearly been studying the villains handbook and uses whatever means possible to drive a wedge between Jade and David. And youve got to admit he has a point. Jade and David make out at the library and in a fountain they go at it in the back of a pickup truck during an outdoor concert in a lake and in what might be the Butterfields chess room (in front of a blazing fireplace -- in the middle of summer). This movie takes us no deeper than physical attraction. In between the smooching there are loads of plot points but somehow even a car crash and house fire feel tedious. Hughs vile deeds are so over-the-top that nothing could possibly seem genuine especially when stretches of the movie look like a perfume commercial with Jade cavorting around a pasture wearing fresh-picked flowers as jewelry. ""Endless Love"" is one of three 1980s remakes this weekend. ""RoboCop"" and ""About Last Night"" are also hitting theaters but unlike those movies ""Endless Love"" didnt amount to much in 1981. And it doesnt fare better today. Like waterbeds and Betamax some things are more fun to remember than to relive.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains language brief partial nudity sexual situations and teen partying. 105 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The movie tells us that 17-year-old Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) is ""awkward"" and has no friends but all expository evidence stops there. She has just graduated from high school -- you know the one with exactly two black students who date each other -- and is bound for the Ivy Leagues when lowly but popular son-of-an-auto-mechanic David Elliot (Magic Mikes Alex Pettyfer who would need to be five years younger and drastically beefed down to pass as a teenager) spots her and pursues her with the immediate freaky prowess of a guy who would intentionally poke holes in a condom. Granted raw intensity is the point here as it was in the 1981 Brooke Shields original that this indie pop-fried nugget is remaking. But at least the old one aimed to illustrate the destructive nature of untempered passion -- with an ultra-metaphorical house fire no less. Film Details Endless Love RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time103 More Info Trailer Beside the usual disapproving parents and diverging post-school life paths the makers of this V-day teen bait clearly lose no sleep over glorifying young peoples total self-obliteration for new lovers they barely know. ""He has no future and hes going to make sure you dont have one either"" bellows a vilified father (Bruce Greenwood). Were supposed to scoff at his heartlessness although considering Jade has given up a prestigious internship nearly been arrested and gotten in a serious car accident as a result of her association with this man-boy its hard not to err on the side of Dad. But never mind; this film is a sunny overlong pastiche of tropes the kind that suggest love involves nothing more than holding hands and jumping off a dock into a lake or having slow teary-eyed sex in front of a fireplace inexplicably blazing in mid-June. We never hear the central couple have a conversation thats not centered on their unwarranted histrionic ""love."" And therein lies the kicker. They actually do make a good couple in a way. Both Jade and David are searching for the blankest of all possible slates a human void unmarred by personality onto which they can each project their weird possessive fantasies. They certainly find it in each other.1 Universal Pictures Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Heather Baysa Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Endless Love movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Endless Love  1/2 Video Endless Love a pretty bad remake indeed Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Endless Love."" (Posted on February 13 2014) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Endless Love."" (Posted on February 13 2014) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Alongside the reboots of ""RoboCop"" and ""About Last Night"" this weeks bizarre ""I Love the 80s"" multiplex tribute continues with the remake of ""Endless Love"" a movie just begging to go up in the flames of camp. If only somebody had brought a match.The film which is more about endlessness than love comes from the Scott Spencer novel about the obsessive arsonist and the rich girl he loves endlessly. Franco Zeffirelli filmed a wildly unfaithful version in 1981 to mass derision and pretty good box office. The new film leaves out most of the storys uncomfortable bits and maintains a bland glum prettiness in place of feverish desire and sociopathology. No strain or fuss here no hint of voyeuristic craziness or stalker behavior. Call it ""Endless Love Within Reasonable Limits."" The 81 version taunted audiences with ""the love every parent fears."" The remake co-written with Joshua Safran by director Shana Feste of ""Country Strong"" wont scare anybody. The ages of the teenagers have been bumped up to 17 (her) and 18 (him). The sensitive yet hunky mechanics son is played by English actor Alex Pettyfer; Gabriella Wilde also from England is the medical school-bound princess in mourning for her late brother. Wilde and Pettyfer are both in their mid-20s. If this were a movie about supermodel-ish teachers having a summer fling in the vicinity of a Georgia high school the casting might work. But it isnt and it doesnt.What happens in ""Endless Love""? The boy/man David teaches the girl/woman Jade to live. He proves his worth by fighting for their endless love against all predictable obstacles. Bruce Greenwood is obstacle No. 1 Jades controlling doctor father. With Jades summer internship looming the kids/adults make sweet love by firelight and then in a montage set to an overhelpful country-folk ballad they squirt each other with water guns. Also theres a house fire which figured rather differently into the action of the novel and the first film. Locating the remakes setting in Georgia does nothing for the story; the reasons likely had everything to do with that states generous film production tax incentives.Joely Richardson does her level best as the sympathetic mother a one-time novelist whose book David reads so he can later say over dinner ""You reminded me how much I love to read."" Elsewhere Jade makes eyes at David and says ""Lets be young and dumb just for tonight."" And then lets make a movie in that same spirit If only.""Endless Love"" conveys precious little of that crazy mixed-up feeling even with powder keg Robert Patrick (as Davids dad) in the cast. By the time restraining orders are threatened youre wondering if someone pre-issued a restraining order against the film itself.mjphillipstribune.com ""Endless Love"" - 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content brief partial nudity some language and teen partying)Running time 143Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Alex Pettyfer Country Strong (movie) Robert Patrick About Last Night (movie) Latest movie reviews REVIEW About Last Night  1/2 REVIEW RoboCop  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-endless-love-review-20140213,0,5085531.column",200,endlesslove(2014)16,endlesslove(2014),chicagotribune

Starring Alex Pettyfer Gabriella Wilde Robert Patrick and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Shana Feste. (PG-13. 104 minutes.) ""Endless Love"" is a remake of a passionate but horribly executed 1981 movie best remembered for the ubiquitous wedding song that it spawned. The update is a different kind of failure too much endless and not enough love. Perhaps worst of all the Lionel Richie/Diana Ross hit ""Endless Love"" is not included in the film. Imagine going to a San Francisco Giants game and finding out the team forgot to bring a baseball. The earlier movie based on Scott Spencers acclaimed 1979 novel was at least an interesting failure. Rated R and filled with doomed protagonists - including a young teen lover played by 16-year-old Brooke Shields - it had a Shakespearean quality. If not for the poor editing acting and a couple of narrative blunders it could have been a complex character study. The new ""Endless Love"" doesnt have those kinds of ambitions. This time David is a mechanics son and Jade is a rich doctors daughter. There are no acts of arson or stays in a mental hospital just a series of too-convenient misunderstandings that propel half the story forward. The rest of the conflict is provided by two purely evil characters Jades dad and Davids ex-girlfriend. Everyone else in the movie ranges from lovable to saint. Related Stories Classic movie couples Relationship archetypes in film Winters Tale review A different type of tale but what? About Last Night review Low-stakes love story Alex Pettyfer is solid as David (a young Andrew McCarthy comes to mind) but the rest of the actors are rarely engaged on the same level. As a love story the movie offers no moral complexity just a few montages of the kids having fun followed by a series of contrived obstacles to overcome. The PG-13 rating doesnt help leading to some awkward cuts and muted passion. Even as Jade (Gabriella Wilde) mutters a self-conscious ""I dont want to wait - I want to feel this with you"" during the centerpiece living-room love scene their bodies already seem to be dissolving into a soft filter. ""Endless Love"" is not a very good movie but it is fairly harmless. Writer/director Shana Feste has a grasp on teenagers - even ones being played by actors in their mid-20s. Its nice to see a house party that features a music-themed game of charades and cabs called for the kids instead of a drunken bacchanalia. Other plot turns are bluntly telegraphed forcing good actors to sell ridiculous lines. Robert Patrick as Davids father deserves a better centerpiece scene than the one here where he urges his son to break a restraining order in the name of love. One final note Its easy to feel sympathy for Richie and Ross who probably missed out on a huge royalty check. (Its possible ""Endless Love"" played during the credits; I left before they were finished.) But the real victim in all of this is Spencer who is still writing books and must watch his tragic novel about dangerous obsession and true heartbreak get mangled anew every two generations. Spencer will be 101 years old when the next ""Endless Love"" comes out in 2047. Lets hope the filmmakers in charge of that remake can finally get it right.

Area theaters. Of all the cheesy 80s movies one might think to remake surely ""Endless Love"" sits somewhere between ""Xanadu"" and ""Mannequin."" And yet Shana Festes flatly generic update manages to make Franco Zeffirellis gauzy 1981 romance look like a masterpiece of psychosexual intrigue. Both films took Scott Spencers 1979 novel as their initial inspiration. The original movie is nearly impossible to watch -- unless you like Zeffirelli happen to be obsessed with Brooke Shields eyebrows. But at least the earlier version had the nerve to tread into some seriously strange territory. Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in Endless Love Feste does keep the Oedipal weirdness. Controlling patriarch Hugh Butterfield (Bruce Greenwood) a successful physician used to calling the shots seems outraged when anyone in his family expresses independence. Jade (Gabriella Wilde) was an ideally dutiful daughter. But the night she graduates from high school she falls for David (Alex Pettyfer). Their intense relationship charms Jades lonely mom (Joely Richardson) but Hugh is so threatened that he does everything he can to destroy it. Gabriella Wilde in Endless Love Zeffirelli pushed this tension to the ultimate extreme turning David into a sympathetic stalker and an inadvertent murderer. Also Jades mom repeatedly tried to seduce him which was if bizarrely misguided at least diverting. Youll find nothing so daring here. For one thing the frank sexuality of the original has been tamed to a PG-13 treatise on true love. The intense Pettyfer is laughably miscast as a dewy-eyed teen. Whats worse is the way hes been stripped of his natural charisma. Youd never guess this dull hunk is the same actor whose petulant arrogance would have made him an ideal Christian (""Fifty Shades of"") Grey. Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in Endless Love Wilde is beautiful but also bland. And its a shame to see Richardson wasting her time trying to expand an empty role. On the other hand Greenwood goes all in as the monstrous Hugh and Robert Patrick provides a nice contrast as Davids down-to-earth dad. Plus just as the 1981 edition gave us unknown scene-stealers James Spader and Tom Cruise this one offers promising up-and-comers Rhys Wakefield (who plays Jades brother) and Dayo Okeniyi (Davids best friend). If youre looking for a Valentines Day date this version is probably a better choice than the uncomfortably swoony original would have been. You might be bored but at least you wont be embarrassed.

Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexuality brief partial nudity profanity). At the Empire Kips Bay Battery Park City others. Shana Festes endlessly lame ""Endless Love remake turns the obsessive sexual heat way down from the infamous 1981 Brooke Shields vehicle -- while also tossing out the tragedies of Scott Spencers acclaimed source novel (but keeping Diana Ross and Lionel Richies original theme song). Franco Zeffirellis operatic original is a pretty bad movie but it did have a clear agenda To exploit Shields notoriety as a teenage hottie coming on the heels of ""The Blue Lagoon. The films brilliant tag line ""She is 15. He is 17. The love every parent fears."" Shields actually was around 15 when she made the movie and that (plus her then-ethereal beauty) drove the story of her liberal dad going ballistic when he discovered she was having sex with a high school senior (played by the hapless Martin Hewitt who in no way was up to the demands of the role). That approach clearly wasnt going to work in todays more politically correct world -- at least not in a major studio release that tones down the R-rated hothouse sexuality of the 1981 edition to the more box-office friendly confines of a PG-13. In this hackneyed update both Jade (Gabriella Wilde) and David (Alex Pettyfer) are safely 17 and her cardiologist dad catches them exiting a closet following a brief smooch at a graduation party. Dad (Bruce Greenwood who does all of the dramatic heavy lifting with a little help from Joely Richardson as his wife) is concerned about Jades infatuation with David because hes from the wrong side of the tracks -- a trope that had whiskers on it decades before 1981. David whose thwarted obsession with Jade tipped over into psychosis in Spencers novel and the earlier movie here has a juvenile record because he beat up a man who was cuckolding his dad (Robert Patrick in a curly wig as an auto mechanic). Indie director Feste -- who traversed similar territory with far more bite in ""The Greatest -- embraces the overused cliches of contemporary romantic drama especially montages. David and Jade remain pretty ciphers -- American teenagers shakily impersonated by a pair of 24-year-old English actors in attractive Georgia settings that seem to have been dictated more by tax incentives than anything to do with the paper-thin narrative. In both Spencers novel and the earlier film of ""Endless Love David sets a fire that leads to an increasingly awful series of tragedies. Its not really spoiling anything to report that in this low-stakes version the fire is an accident that triggers a happy ending. Like I said lame.

Unlike Franco Zeffirellis notoriously over-the-top 1981 filmization of Scott Spencers novel Shana Festes ""Endless Love"" seems less a misguided adaptation than a deliberate flat-out rewrite. Feste and co-scripter Joshua Safran turn a dark tale of self-destructive romantic obsession into an innocuous fairy tale about the shining power of puppy love set in an insulated universe where head-on collisions result in a few artfully placed bruises and class differences arise merely to test the resilience of youthful affection. Universal is wisely opening this sugary confection on Valentines Day probably the only occasion on which tweens could persuade their dates to swallow it though it may prove too bland even for its target audience. Unlike Spencers troubled adolescent whose uncontrollable passion landed him in mental and penal institutions David (Alex Pettyfer) may be the politest kindest most well-adjusted yet non-nerdy teen in cinema history. Of course hes also ruggedly handsome highly intelligent and extremely popular. Hes secretly carried a torch for blonde upper-class beauty Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) but has never spoken to her; nor for that matter has anyone else as her grief for her beloved dead brother Chris and her drive to excel in school are generally mistaken for icy snobbishness. Once the ice is melted though things proceed apace and the two are soon inseparable tastefully and quasi-chastely consummating their love in front of a blazing fireplace. Yet one major obstacle threatens their loves endlessness Jades doctor dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) looks down on working-class non-college-bound David and deeply resents any attempt to distract Jade from assuming her late brothers place in a long line of Butterfield cardiologists. Jades mother Ann (Joely Richardson) on the other hand takes an immediate shine to the young man encouraging her daughters newfound liberation. For finally ""Endless Love"" is less about the hand-holding pair and their music-driven montages of carefree bliss amid Georgias verdant greenery than it is about Family. David not only restores Jades stolen childhood and her relationships with her peers (the Butterfield residence knee-deep in partying teenagers) but also heals the deep wounds that Chris death has inflicted on the upper-crust clan. Here it is not young David but father Hugh who is obsessed turning Chris room into a shrine constantly dissing younger son Keith (Rhys Wakefield) for not living up to his siblings promise and distancing his wife with polite civility. A fire at the Butterfields -- which in both the novel and 1981 film was set by David and provided the primal act that precipitated tragedy -- here ignites by accident and sets Hugh on the road to redemption. He is merely the last of the Butterfields to tell David how wonderfully his love has illuminated his life. In ""The Greatest"" (2009) and ""Country Strong"" (2010) Feste proved herself quite skilled if not especially innovative at limning her characters emotional travails. But subtlety complexity and even the slightest modicum of realism elude her here. Her teenagers come off as eerily well behaved; the speak of getting drunk or high but show no signs of rowdiness. Their idea of lawlessness is to break into a zoo at night to ride the merry-go-round. And the speed and thoroughness with which all psychological problems are solved once exposed to Davids beneficence defy analysis. Thesping is as good as the premise allows. Pettyfer incarnates the chivalrous hunk with a surprising degree of believability and if Wildes Jade proves rather one-note in her overnight socialization her flawless complexion and rapturous runs through the shrubbery sufficiently establish her princess stature. Greenwood so brilliantly nuanced as another grieving father in Atom Egoyans ""Exotica"" here injects his grief-mad doctor with a wealth of evil energy. Airbrushed-looking lensing by Andrew Dunn and a sweepingly romantic score by ""Frozen"" composer Christophe Beck round out the saccharine bill.

Havent we seen enough of dark twisted plots and superheroes? Who gives a flip if this one compares to the original movie that most people have never seen. It was a beautifully filmed classic love story with some really sweet moments of love and family thrown in. The actors were great at pulling you into the story. Has Hollywood become so jaded that they cant even remember what innocence felt or looked like? Just shut up. Reply Chris Etrata says February 16 2014 at 955 pm Critics dont hate every light romantic movie. About last night is light and romantic yet it got great reviews. My problems with this is 1. Taking the title of a novel and applying it to a different film and 2. What comes off sweets in the film comes off as dumb in the film like throwing away an internship to spend more time with your loved one. Reply lynzyallison says February 17 2014 at 548 am Yes because ""success"" is always more important than love. Leaving a movie feeling happy...what a failure. LOL says February 13 2014 at 1244 pm I wonder if its a generational thing which makes a Gen X film critic laugh at the mollycoddled nature of what todays youth whom consider ""[breaking] into a zoo at night to ride the merry-go-round"" as being lawless? Reply Joe Smart says February 13 2014 at 1219 am Why would Scott Spencer even allow his name on this thing? As bad as the 1980s film was at least it was an actual adaptation of his book. This seems to have virtually nothing to do with the source novel at all beyond the title. Reply Chris Etrata says February 16 2014 at 957 pm He sold film rights including the title in the 80s to universal.

Daily Edition Login to download Endless Love Film Review 108 AM PST 2/13/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A highly homogenized and sanitized remake thats little better than its 1981 predecessor. TWITTER Alex Pettyfer stars as a charismatic young man who falls for a privileged girl played by Gabriella Wilde in Shana Festes love story opening on Valentines Day. A blah 1981 film becomes a bland one 33 years later in Endless Love. Junking almost all the darker and more disruptive elements from Scott Spencers 1979 best-seller -- such as pyromania incarceration divorce political activism a major characters death and last but not least an unhappy ending -- the present filmmakers serve up a more overtly teen-friendly melodrama that one could argue is the polar opposite of last years Spring Breakers as a portrait of contemporary adolescence; in fact the film almost becomes more about the most disturbed adult character than about the young lovers themselves. More than a momentary Valentines Day weekend box office score would be a surprise. A misfired attempt by director Franco Zeffirelli to rekindle the adolescent ardor he had captured in his Romeo and Juliet the earlier film was a bloodless affair starring a nubile Brooke Shields fresh from playing a 12-year-old prostitute in Pretty Baby and the previously and thereafter unknown Martin Hewitt. In the long run this earlier version was notable only as the first film of an aspiring actor named Tom Cruise the second credit for James Spader and for a theme song by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie that spent nine weeks at number one. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies X-Men Days of Future Past Mockingjay Spider-Man 2 This new offering is so bright spiffy and clean-cut that you half expect Ozzie and Harriet to come popping out the door of one of the houses. In any event the term well-scrubbed certainly takes on new meaning when one observes the high school graduating class of which Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) are members. A picture-perfect blonde Jade is said to be a bookish type whos been so absorbed by her studies for four years that shes had no time to meet any of her classmates including David a pretty hunky guy who if hes attracted to Jade as much as he says he is youd think would have tried to come on to her at least once before. As it is David has to pull a stunt while parking cars at a snooty restaurant to attract her attention then goes out of his way to make a success of a party Jade throws in order to finally meet all the classmates she spent four years avoiding. Shes heading for Brown in the fall and is meant to spend the summer in a high-end internship her big-deal surgeon father Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) has arranged. Although the rest of the family which includes Hughs wife Anne (Joely Richardson) and son Keith (Rhys Wakefield) seems to have basically recovered Hugh still hasnt gotten over the death of his other son some time back; he still maintains a candlelit shrine to him in his bedroom in the gated family mansion in Atlanta. And he takes an immediate dislike to David from the outset considering him a lower-class ruffian not worthy of his beautiful daughter. VIDEO Endless Love Trailer Even here the films mindset seems off; Hugh would probably disapprove of any young man who came sniffing around his daughters door but David is such a sincere fine-looking fellow of good will that the only possible objection Hugh can have is a very silly 1950s-type wrong-side-of-the tracks prejudice; Davids working-class father (Robert Patrick) runs an auto shop. The way her dad reacts to David youd think Jade had brought home Marilyn Manson or Dennis Rodman. In fact David is so polite that when Jade encourages him to sneak into the house late one night to make love for the first time his reaction is ""I can wait."" Jade promptly overrules him thus launching a summer romance that infuriates Hugh when his headstrong daughter suddenly cancels the internship and then privately invites David to join them at their gorgeous lakeside house to which Hugh has taken the family precisely to get Jade away from her boyfriend. Crucially Jades attractive mother Anne whose own romantic instincts and shy artistic ambitions are nicely layered in by Richardson sees how happy David has made her daughter and strongly favors the match. But Hugh persists in his obstructions digs up some dirt on David and finally plays a trump card that would seem to put an end to the putative endless love. So intently does the script by director Shana Feste (Country Strong) and Joshua Safran examine the reasons for Hughs all-round disagreeableness and hostility and so much more developed an actor is Greenwood than are the kids that Hugh becomes the de facto center of the film; hes the heavy of the piece but hes also the one who makes the longest and most transformative emotional and psychological journey. Otherwise the film is larded with very mild (and drug-free) teen pranks and horseplay including partying hot-car joy rides splashing into the lake an illicit nocturnal visit to the zoo and sneaking in and out at all hours as well as momentary earnestness when its time to get it on such as during the decorous fireside sexual initiation. Its all so brightly lit and everyones so smartly turned out that almost every shot looks like a potential magazine ad. And its about as interesting dramatically. One scene of David getting into an airport far enough to meet Jade at a gate upon her arrival would seem impossible in todays world. The leads are at least livelier than were their predecessors in these roles all those years ago although they hardly seem to be burning with adolescent desire and carnality. While Wilde at 24 still passes plausibly for a teen here (this was filmed before the actress became a mother) Pettyfer the hunk from Magic Mike looks well into his twenties and decidedly more mature than his costar even if hes actually a year younger. The generic generally up-tempo teen-slanted song score is notable for its extreme banality.

Share Tweet Hollywoods ongoing addiction to casting English Irish and Australian actors has popularized and effectively codified the accent drop a flubbed take that is intentionally chosen over a more technically consistent one its imperfection signaling--like a bum note or a voice crack--the authenticity of a scene. Best exemplified by Michael Fassbender who seems to slip back into his natural Irish voice at the climax of every movie hes in the accent drop trades consistency for a punch of emotional reality. The effect is paradoxical intentional on the part of the filmmakers but unintentional on the part of the actors--a conscious act of narrative self-sabotage thats meant to make the on-screen action seem more real.There are two notable accent drops in Endless Love an American teenage romance in which almost none of the main roles are played by Americans. The first is a self-referential gag a scene where David (Alex Pettyfer) adopts a ""voice"" (actually Pettyfers real English accent) while making a prank phone call. The second comes late in the film when Davids girlfriend Jade (Gabriella Wilde) is arguing with her parents Hugh (Bruce Greenwood who as a Canadian doesnt have to mask an accent) and Anne (Joely Richardson). Tears streak down Jades face washing away her American accent in the process. Wildes performance is for the most part unexceptional--carried more by her physical presence her scrunched torso and grasshopper legs than by delivery--but goddamn if she doesnt seem to be experiencing Jades feelings in that moment.In this day and age when major studios focus almost exclusively on genre films and sci-fi/fantasy franchise-building a studio melodrama like Endless Love ends up feeling both novel and retro. Its handful of artful widescreen compositions--like the shot of Hugh and Anne talking before bed standing on opposite ends of a bathroom their faces reflected in matching mirrors--brings to mind the Hollywood of the mid-1950s. Its compartmentalized view of teenage life fascination with sports cars and country clubs and hyperbolic depiction of suburban class differences (David is the working-class son of a mechanic Jade the privileged daughter of a cardiologist) seems to come straight out of the 80s.The plotting--significantly more tame and less convoluted than that of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli original--is cliched and facile with David as the heartthrob so perfect that even his criminal record serves as proof of his moral fiber and Hugh as the irrational hypocrite who tries to destroy Davids relationship with his daughter. And yet like Wildes accent drop the movie occasionally evidences a sense of conviction. Endless Love may rely on Reagan-era characterizations (see for instance Dayo Okeniyi as the comic-relief best friend or Emma Rigby as Davids conniving froggy ex-girlfriend who endlessly twirls her ponytail between her fingers) and its characters motivations may be so simplistic that they seem unreal. But the film also contains fleeting moments of authenticity. Most of these come courtesy of Robert Patrick who plays Davids father and Greenwood. Together these two veteran actors turn could-be-thankless ""good dad/bad dad"" roles into credible depictions of wounded masculinity. Unfortunately the movie isnt about them.

"Review Endless Love 3.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Endless Love 3.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Feb 13 2014 1039 AM There really wasnt any need to remake 1981s ""Endless Love"" a forgettable Brooke Shields epic whose claim to fame was a great title tune that became a sure-fire prom favorite for a good five years. However if you had to update the film for the Instagram generation you could do a lot worse than what director Shana Feste (""Country Strong"") has come up with. She has crafted a stylish evocative journey into overheated-teenager territory. For a good chunk of the time it works. Budding mechanic David (Alex Pettyfer) has great SAT scores but no desire to go to college. Jade (Gabriella Wilde) is a rich girl who went through four years of high school as a virtual recluse after the death of her brother. Needless to say both are impossibly gorgeous in that CW kind of way. The two instantly click after graduation and soon are sleeping together in Jades family mansion. Her father (Bruce Greenwood) seethes while her mom (Joely Richardson) becomes a cheerleader for David even writing him a college recommendation letter that talks about the feelings he has awakened in her daughter. What potential freshman doesnt want that mentioned in their application? The couples passion intensifies though the movie stays away from the dark obsession that featured prominently in the original. Instead these two are more hopelessly in love as they play with fireworks (literally) and splash around in the ocean as angsty modern songs play on the soundtrack. Of course there must be bumps in the road. Those come courtesy of Jades dad whose actions get increasingly desperate as he threatens to split them apart. Thats where the movie starts to lose ground as Dad becomes a little too Snidely Whiplash to be taken seriously. The momentum dissipates leading to an ending that feels overly bright for the melodrama that has preceded it. Despite those stumbles the film isnt bad as far as these things go. A lot of it is due to the cast as the leading couple create some believable sparks. Pettyfer in particular brings a brooding sensitivity to his role. This is easily the former models best performance after such efforts as ""I Am Number Four"" and ""Beastly."" The film is gorgeously shot by Andrew Dunn who created similar imagery in the superior ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" He goes heavy on the close-ups and does interesting things with candlelight particularly in a party sequence in which David and Jade sneak off to a closet. The overall look adds to the mood of the film giving it an immediacy it might otherwise lack. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

(Quantrell D. Colbert) B Endless Love Genre Drama; Starring Alex Pettyfer Gabriella Wilde; Director Shana Feste; Release Date Wide 02/14/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Pictures Posted March 3 2014 -- 1200 AM EST In the summer of 1981 the movie Endless Love was two things at once and they meshed together not at all which is one reason the film was such a glumly gauzy and unsatisfying concoction. It was pitched to audiences as a steamy Brooke Shields heart-tugger a movie that piggybacked on her brand following the outrageous success of The Blue Lagoon the summer before. (I say outrageous because that movie was such a cheesy-porny piece of teen-pinup kitsch -- and also because it was shot when Shields was only 14.) At the same time Endless Love was also an earnest adaptation of a deeply serious and acclaimed novel by Scott Spencer (its his only great book and hes essentially rewritten it more than once). Published in 1979 its a novel that posed a vital and even dangerous question namely If a boy falls in love with a girl and they have an idyllic romance and then he isnt allowed to see her and he loves her so much that he cant deal with it so he stalks her and burns her house down and gets sent to a mental institution -- does all of that add up to an unstable obsession? Or is it what love really is? The new version of Endless Love neatly dispenses with the darker side of the novel and thats one reason I suspect that a lot of critics wont have much patience for it. Its less faithful than the Brooke Shields version but for what it is its a much better movie. In the hands of director and co-writer Shana Feste (Country Strong) Endless Love has become a solidly engaging neo-50s romantic melodrama a movie in which love may be endless but unstable obsession lies less in the heart of the lover than in the man who would stand in loves way. David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) and Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) are opposite-sides-of-the-tracks classmates who have just graduated from high school. Hes a smart sensitive grease-monkey hunk with longish hair and a soft-spoken chivalrous manner. He works in his dads auto shop and intends to keep doing so with no plans to go to college. Given his sterling SAT scores that marks him in 2014 as the kind of unstressed noble prole you tend to encounter in the movies a lot more than in life. Shes his opposite number a privileged sheltered rich girl whos been hiding in the bosom of her familys stone mansion lost in mourning after the death of her brother from cancer two years before. The British actress Gabriella Wilde at first looks too unformed to be interesting but she makes Jade a winsome and delicate pre-Raphaelite flower -- a girl who needs to wake up and does once she meets David who lights her fire. The problem is her father Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) an imperious physician who thinks that hes trying to protect her but in reality doesnt want her to grow up. Jades intense attraction to David represents the end of Daddys control over her and the bad news is that he isnt planning to let that go. The central situation comes right out of the novel but the movie plays up the father as the heavy which might have been off-puttingly reductive except that the superb Bruce Greenwood plays Hugh with an elegant chiseled malevolence and a drive for power that comes off as all too human; the character clearly isnt aware of how neurotically possessive he is. Greenwood who was brilliant as JFK in the Cuban missile crisis thriller Thirteen Days (2000) plays Hugh with a steadfast manner and a quick cutting mind that dances with secret glee whenever hes scored a point. When David in their verbal confrontations hits back Hugh looks quietly stunned as if he cant believe this kid would dare to take him on and the tension in their conflict is what sustains the movie. In Hughs mind hes on a mission to save the daughter he loves; David is his sworn enemy to war with. Theres also a snob factor at work -- the wealthy doctor doesnt think that the auto-repair guy is good enough for his daughter -- and while Ive rolled my eyes at these kinds of conflicts in movies for decades now I have to admit that the slow-motion collapse of the middle class has given a new urgency to this sort of how-deep-is-your-love vs. how-deep-are-your-pockets class-war rivalry. Alex Pettyfer who was one of the dancers in Magic Mike knows how to smolder and be cool at the same time and how to communicate what hes thinking without making a big show of it -- a gift that can take you far in the movies. In Endless Love hes like the young James Spader in the body of Hart Bochner. The film makes a token stab at giving David a murky hidden past but even here hes really a saint and the glossy 1950s overly-clean-moral-lines side of Endless Love only grows quainter as the picture goes on. If the movie works at all (and I think it does) its as a swoony love story threatened by a basic cornball Oedipal drama. But for a film thats coming out on Valentines Day that more than passes as respectable.

At least it seems endless. But the love part -- thats a little harder to feel. Oh there are teenage hormones in this movie to be sure. Some puppyish passion and a bit of softly-lit PG-13 action by the fireplace too and more bounding about in parks and fountains than you used to see in an old Summers Eve commercial. But the desperate kinky mad and eventually criminal carnality that drove the first confidently trashy ""Endless Love""? Thats nowhere to be found in a remake that manages to trim nearly 15 minutes off the first ones running time yet still stretch out like a bad blind date. The story -- based on a well-regarded novel by Scott Spencer -- stars Gabriella Wilde as a tawny toffee-sweet honor-roll teen whos apparently gotten through four years of high school without a single date. Until -- yes -- she catches the eye of Alex Pettyfer a rough-edged bad boy from the wrong side of town with knuckles made for bruising and a chin you could open beer bottles on. Of course they fall in immediate love. Of course her rich father objects. There is yes even a balcony scene of sorts. But not only is this not ""Romeo and Juliet"" this isnt even the old Brooke Shields movie. That picture was over-the top -- sometimes deliriously so -- but at least it had some dark edges and seriously twisted characters hiding in the corners. This is as safe and pink and brightly lit as a cheerleaders room all framed fishface selfies and ""Hang in There"" kitty posters. Of course the Shields movie was directed by Franco Zeffirelli who had directed ""Romeo and Juliet"" once and went on to stage grand operas; this is directed by the woman who made ""Country Strong"" the soap Opry starring Gwyneth Paltrow. She has even less to work with this time around. Although Robert Patrick Joely Richardson and Bruce Greenwood who play various parents are all old pros they dont get much to play (except Greenwood who as the mean rich father does all but twirl an invisible moustache). And her stars -- well Wilde is immediately forgettable. And although Pettyfer is handsome he makes even less of an impression here than he did in his previous attempts at stardom in ""Beastly"" and ""I Am Number Four."" This is supposed to be a movie about obsession. Instead its just cupcake meets beefcake with a big glass of milk on the side. And thats one Valentines Day dinner you can easily pass up. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language violence and teen drug use. Endless Love (PG-13) Universal (103 min.) Directed by Shana Feste. With Gabriella Wilde Alex Pettyfer.

Thwarted romance looms in this remake of the 1981 Brooke Shields movie with the traumatic Lionel Richie-Diana Ross theme tune. The intended result is an American teen love story for a tweenie audience with sexuality and drug use implied more than shown though maybe the movies also banking on a demographic too young to spot the industrial-strength cliches throughout. Pettyfer and Wilde (both Brits) look the part in a soft-drinks-commercial way but their characters might as well be called Ken and Barbie for all the depth they bring to this wish-fulfilment fantasy of social mobility. The desire of the young folk to live their own lives and their parents determination to stop them doing so provide a genuine basis for dramatic conflict but the script is so howlingly awful that adult viewers will face a tough choice between writhing in pain or laughing out loud. Come back Lionel and Diana - all is forgiven.
