Marty is a boozy Irish writer in Hollywood who complains to his livewire pal Billy (Sam Rockwell) that he needs inspiration to write a script called Seven Psychopaths. The result is more blood on the carpet than ink on paper. Billy is partly a psychopath magnet partly a writers dangerous inner voice made real. He and his cravat-sporting older pal Hans (Christopher Walken) are petty thieves who kidnap a shih tzu dog from a Mafia boss (Woody Harrelson) who wants his pup back - and Marty gets dragged into the whole violent affair. Meanwhile Billy tries to help Marty by putting an ad in the paper for psychos; and they end up with a disturbed ageing killer (Tom Waits) on the doorstep. Sundry nutters come and go (look out for a cameo from the legendary Harry Dean Stanton) as Marty finds himself at the centre of exactly the sort of bloody macho melodrama hed rather not be writing. Head-in-hands becomes Martys default position and Farrell offers a good line in manic despair and passive exasperation. Youll have guessed that were in self-reflective hall-of-mirrors movie territory for British-Irish writer McDonaghs second feature-length film (after 2008s In Bruges). Theres something a little turn-of-the-century about Seven Psychopaths with its comic approach to violence movie-in-a-movie navel-gazing and ample backstreet LA locations. The films of Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) and Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) inevitably come to mind - but McDonagh is less saturated in film and pop culture than Tarantino and less prone than Kaufman to disappear down story wormholes. What saves Seven Psychopaths from being po-faced or tedious is its sharp-as-knives humour energetic pacing knack for surprising asides and fun performances from a cast that has a certain wow factor when piled up together. Its undoubtedly a very male enterprise and McDonagh acknowledges this even if he doesnt explain it Your women characters are awful is Hanss reproach to Marty at one point. The nods to bungled creativity and winks at questions of screen violence offer something to chew on. But above all this is violent seedy farce pure and simple and its McDonaghs zippy script that keeps it ticking over until all the trousers have been dropped at knifepoint and the custard pies been lobbed with malice.

The only feeling you get is ""Huh? And? Was that really a film?"""" The filmmakers forgot that if you start out with complete and utter absent plot then good packaging wont give plot or substance where there is none.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 12 2012 639 PM Pulp Meta-Fiction Seven Psychopaths is Quentin Tarantino meets Charlie Kaufman. By Dana Stevens Sam Rockwell in Seven Psychopaths. Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Blueprint Pictures Limited/The British Film Institute/Film4 (c) 2011. All rights reserved. The bracingly weird Seven Psychopaths is the second film written and directed by the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh. His first movie In Bruges about a pair of squabbling hitmen cooling their heels in that medieval Belgian city attracted a small but passionate following for its idiosyncratic blend of semi-comic violence and bro-on-bro chitchat. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Like Quentin Tarantino McDonagh excels at writing sharp funny dialogue for people (men usually) who are just passing the time while they wait for something violent and inevitable to happen. But McDonagh has his own distinctive voice and a set of obsessions quite different from Tarantinos For one thing his characters tend to be introspective yearning types very different from the deadpan fatalists who populate Tarantinos world. McDonagh also brings up ethical and spiritual questions its hard to imagine say Uma Thurmans avenging bride in Kill Bill taking the time to ponder Is violence ever really the right answer? What happens to us after we die? Thats not to say that those questions ever get addressed satisfactorily in Seven Psychopaths. This is a movie that throws a lot of stuff at you (jokes subplots philosophical riffs arterial jets of blood) and leaves you puzzling over what to do with it all. Its at once a gangster movie a buddy comedy and a meta-fictional exploration of the limits of both genres--and if that sounds impossible to pull off well McDonagh doesnt quite. But the pure sick brio of Seven Psychopaths takes it a long way. Advertisement Colin Farrell who also co-starred in In Bruges plays an Irish screenwriter named Marty. Yes hes a same-name stand-in for the writer like Nicolas Cages Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation. And like that character Marty is suffering from epic writers block on his latest now wildly overdue script. All he has is a title one that everyone seems to agree is awesome Seven Psychopaths. But his inability to progress beyond writing ""Psychopath 1"" on a legal pad has him depressed and drinking heavily and his girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) is about to send him packing. Martys loose-cannon best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to collaborate on the script--his job as an actor is going nowhere and hes been making a living by kidnapping dogs then sending his courteous ascot-wearing buddy Hans (Christopher Walken) to return them and collect the rewards from their owners. One unlucky day Billy and Hans kidnap a Shih Tzu that turns out to be the adored pet of a notoriously ruthless crime boss Charlie (Woody Harrelson). When Billy refuses to return the dog (pointing out that ""that would defeat the purpose of kidnaping"") Charlie and his henchmen come after the dognapping duo providing Marty with an all-too-close view of the many varieties of human psychopathology. This dognapping plot is only one of multiple concurrent stories in Seven Psychopaths some of them nested inside others. A masked serial killer stalks Los Angeles leaving a Jack of Diamonds playing card at each murder scene. A dour Quaker (Harry Dean Stanton) figures out how to avenge his daughters murder while staying true to his pacifist beliefs. A Vietnamese priest (Long Nguyen) sits in his hotel room in America plotting revenge for the Vietnam War. What do these stories have to do with one another? Is Marty generating them himself as his screenplay-in-progress makes its tormented way from brain to pen? And is the increasingly unhinged Sam right when he insists that it can all end only in a no-holds-barred Hollywood-style macho shootout? All this narrative nesting and genre-skipping sounds very cerebral on the page but in practice Seven Psychopaths is as pleasurably kinetic as can be full of double-crosses and gunplay and sun-kissed SoCal locations (the last third or so of the movie takes place amid the sci-fi-worthy vegetation of Joshua Tree National Park). Theres a crisp witty score by Carter Burwell; theres (too briefly) Tom Waits telling a tale of murder and lost love while cradling a pet rabbit. Above all theres Sam Rockwell whose manic turn as the gonzo Billy steals the movie even from notorious gonzo-character specialist Woody Harrelson. Walken as the mysteriously unflappable Hans does wonderful work in a more minor low-key mode; when he turns down a proffered drink with the casual demurral ""I take peyote"" his comic timing is pure gold. Farrell has less to do as the naive audience proxy Marty but his permanently quizzical wedge-shaped eyebrows express the audiences own confusion. Theres not really time during Seven Psychopaths to think through how or if all its almost-clever narrative puzzles fit together and after the movies over it doesnt quite seem worth worrying about.

CBS FilmsTwo hitmen banter idly before fulfilling their contractual obligations""Was it Dillinger who got shot through the eyeball?"" ""Moe Green got shot through the eyeball."" ""Im talking about in real life.""Weve been here before of course--the world of the pre-carnage colloquy of ruminations on foot massages and the Royale with Cheese the world of Pulp Fiction. Tarantinos breakthrough reimagining of the crime movie has inspired countless would-be successors some rather good (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Go) others borderline unwatchable (A Life Less Ordinary Lucky Number Slevin Smokin Aces). MORE ON FILM Why You Should Have Gone to See Frankenweenie Prometheus Would Have Been Better Without Any People in It How to Explain the Disastrous The Paperboy This time around the killer conversationalists are played by Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt and--unlike Jules and Vincent--neither one will be seen again after the movies first scene. Rather they are here to make an imprint to lay down a marker and then be wiped away like the gunmen played by Jack Elam and Woody Strode in the opening of Sergio Leones classic Western deconstruction Once Upon a Time in the West. As in that case the purpose here is not merely to nod at genre predecessors but to rub them out and start anew.It takes considerable moxie for a film to advertise its ambitions so baldly and more still for it to rouse the ghost of Kurosawa with its very title Seven Psychopaths. Yet remarkably this latest outing by Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh best known to moviegoers for his 2008 picture In Bruges lives up to its own hype. It may not be Pulp Fiction but it is arguably the canniest--and almost certainly the wittiest--subversion of the crime genre to hit the big screen since.As he did in In Bruges Colin Farrell again stars for McDonagh this time as Marty an L.A. screenwriter with a mental block and a drinking problem who is working on a script entitled (of course) Seven Psychopaths. His best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is an out-of-work actor and part-time dognapper who is desperate to collaborate on the project if only the two can find a way to bridge their creative differences. Marty ""I dont want it to be violent. I want it to be life affirming."" Billy ""Life-affirming schmife-affirming. Its called Seven Fucking Psychopaths.""The movies central plot involves the accidental theft by Billy and his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) of a Shih Tzu belonging to a murderous crime boss (Woody Harrelson). But ultimately its the Billy-Marty dialectic--between low art and high violence and pacifism movie and movie critique--that provides the film with its narrative spine. Meta-story is stacked neatly atop meta-story as Martys screenplay alternates between inspiring and incorporating the lethal antics taking place all around him art imitating life imitating art. Particularly cunning are a series of neatly embedded vengeance fables in which assassins eat their own Ouroboros-style killers who target serial killers; killers who target child killers; and killers who target ""only mid- to high-ranking members of the Italian-American crime syndicate or the Yakuza.""Each time it appears that McDonagh has written himself into a cul de sac he off-roads the movie (sometimes literally) into fresh territory.In addition to Pulp Fiction McDonaghs film carries echoes of such genre demolitions as Edgar Wrights Hot Fuzz and the Robert-Downey-Jr.-comeback-launcher Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. But as sly as those movies were (in particular the latter) Seven Psychopaths laps them in self-conscious ingenuity. Each time it appears that McDonagh who also directed has written himself into a cul de sac he off-roads the movie (sometimes literally) into fresh territory.Farrell is amiably ineffectual as Marty his wondrous semaphore eyebrows delivering their best work since his last collaboration with McDonagh. Rockwell and Harrelson keep their respective manias in precise simmering balance and Tom Waits is quietly indelible as the most indisputably psychotic of the seven titular protagonists. Tucked in along the way are nice turns by Abbie Cornish Harry Dean Stanton Gabourey Sidibe and the suddenly ubiquitous Zeljko Ivanek. But ultimately its Walken who starred on Broadway in McDonaghs 2010 play A Behanding in Spokane whose mesmerizing deadpan steals the movie scene by scene line by incremental line. Late in the film as corpses are accumulating inauspiciously his Hans pigeonholes Marty ""Youre the one that thought psychopaths were so interesting. They get tiresome after a while dont you think?"" Speaking for myself and solely with regard to McDonaghs movie let me counter not in the least.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls.

At area theaters In the wickedly funny-brutal comedy ""Seven Psychopaths"" Colin Farrells character often has the look of a woodland animal caught in the headlights of oncoming demise. And well he should. Farrell of the loamy brown eyes portrays writer Marty Faranan who is at work (barely) on a script hes titled ""Seven Psychopaths."" The Irishman lives in Los Angeles with girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) already simmering when we meet the unhappy couple. Not a fan of Kayas Martys best friend Billy wants to help his buddy with his script. He even places an ad in the trades calling all psychos to help with research. Sam Rockwell appalls and endears as the neer-do-well who sincerely loves his friend but also happens to have a screw loose. Billy and Hans (Christopher Walken) run a dognapping enterprise. They snatch beloved pets and return them to their thankful owners for a reward. When Billy snags a Shih Tzu named Bonny ( portrayed by Bonny the Shih Tzu) they find themselves in rabid trouble. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Costello the mob boss who dotes on his silky-haired pup. Or so we gather from the mayhem he unleashes as he tries to find her. In addition to the Bonny problems Charlies got troubles with girlfriend Angela (Olga Kurylenko). And theres a shadowy assassin taking out his his men. Yes its a lot to keep track of but writer-director Martin McDonagh does so with deft humor as the film hurls toward a desert climax foreshadowed in one of Billy and Martys exchanges. ""Seven Psychopaths"" comes from the funny-violent-humane mind of Irishman McDonagh who has four Tony nominations and an Oscar for his 2006 live-action short the foul-mouthed ""Six Shooter."" His first feature ""In Bruges"" is a clever equally profane tale of two hitmen on holiday in Belgium. Only one of them has been contracted to kill the other. With its fluffy dog hostage and icy-veined owner ""Seven Psychopaths"" offers an even funnier premise. Yet the film rides on a surprising currrent of sorrow and fleeting joy. Walken is wonderfully sympathetic as Hans a devoted husband with a tragic past. Singer Tom Waits has a habit of showing up in deeply off-beat work. Here hes found a soulmate. Love-lorn Zachariah carries a white bunny and has a tale of woe and mayhem ""Dexter"" fans will appreciate. Women dont make much of a splash here a fact the movie teases smartly. But Linda Bright Clay leaves an impression as Hans ailing wife Myra. McDonagh points to Terrance Malicks spirituality and Sam Pekinpahs volatility as tonal influences. And a tender spirituality tangos with loopy bloodshed some of it real some of it scenes out of Martys nascent screenplay. Sometimes they overlap. No matter what one of the best McDonagh-crafted moments has Hans taking a seat across from Charlie in a hospital waiting room after visiting Myra. Its a sad and chilling moment in a crazed honed surprisingly meditative comedy.

"Seven Psychopaths | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; seven-psychopaths ) Seven Psychopaths (United Kingdom 2012) October 12 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli For about 75 minutes Seven Psychopaths is a rollicking good movie - kinetic clever funny and brutal. Then inexplicably it falls apart. Perhaps writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) didnt know how to end it or perhaps his attempts to develop a quasi-dramatic denouement clash so violently with the preceding material that the final half-hour cant satisfy. Whatever the case Seven Psychopaths falls into the category of entertaining movies undone by disapponting final acts. On balance one could argue that Seven Psychopaths warrants a better rating than a mediocre 1/2 but the aftertaste is so bitter that it diminishes the sweetness that started off the meal. Theres a ""post-Tarantino"" vibe to Seven Psychopaths. In the wake of Pulp Fictions release there were a lot of copycats - some good some bad but all seeking to emulate the rhythms of Tarantinos seminal motion picture. Seven Psychopaths has that feel although one could argue it arrived to the party about 18 years late. Many of the elements that made Pulp Fiction such a memorable experience are present in Seven Psychopaths at least during the first 1 1/4 hours witty dialogue humor derived from brutality bursts of violence and Christopher Walken. Theres also some gratuitous nudity and another delightfully nasty performance from the once-squeaky clean Woody Harrelson. Seven Psychopaths interweaves ""reality"" with ""fantasy"" by depicting segments of a screenplay-within-the-screenplay. Marty (Colin Farrell) is an alcoholic would-be screenwriter who is suffering with a case of writers block while developing his latest project a ""pacifist"" story about psychopaths. His best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) offers to help But Marty is protective of his work. Billy earns a living by kidnapping dogs who are momentarily left unattended by their owners then returning them and claiming the reward money. He is helped in this scheme by Hans (Christopher Walken) a deeply religious man with a cancer-stricken wife. The seemingly random kidnapping of a Shih Tzu named Bonny puts Billy Hans and Marty in danger. Bonny is the beloved pet of gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) and he is none-too-pleased about losing his dog. Meanwhile at large is a serial killer who goes by the name of The Jack of Diamonds and makes his name by killing hit men and murderers. Seven Psychopaths contains frequent self-referential moments (such as a commentary about how women are treated in Martys screenplay being representative of how they are presented in the actual movie) some of which are clever and some of which are too obvious. There are a lot of big laughs at unexpected times not entirely unlike the moment in Pulp Fiction when John Travolta accidentally shoots a guy in the backseat of the car spraying blood and brains over everything. The disappointment is that all of the wonderful twisted fun comes to an unexpected end long before the movie is over. The final 30 minutes with the three main characters camping in the desert isnt funny or smart and it lacks energy. The showdown is anticlimactic and although McDonagh tries to do something interesting with it he doesnt succeed. The subsequent dream sequence and inter-credits scene are equally flat. Its as if the creative juices leaked out around the 2/3 point and seeped into the sandy desertscape. Seven Psychopaths probably gives us more than seven twisted killers - its hard to keep track. Is Hans one? Depends. Christopher Walken has some good Christopher Walken moments including one of the final 30 minutes few highlights. Sam Rockwells deadpan off-kilter humor - a quality beneath which a sense of violence seems to lurk - allows Billy to be unpredictable enough to share the screen with Walkens Hans. Woody Harrelson in another bad-to-the-bone performance brings an element of redneck charm to vicious conscienceless Charlie. Colin Farrell has the unenviable job of playing the ""straight man."" One reason the final segment of Seven Psychopaths doesnt work is because it focuses on Marty whos not a lot of fun. A lot of critics loved McDonaghs previous feature In Bruges but my criticism of that movie is the same one I have of this one an inability to close things out with the same strength evident in the beginning and middle sections. The collapse is more evident in Seven Psychopaths but the films taken as a set point to an unfortunate trend. The lack of consistency is frustrating and disappointing. Had Seven Psychopaths been able to maintain its initial tone and energy level throughout it would have been a compelling and memorable experience. As it is its an illustration of how its just as important to have a solid ending as an attention-catching beginning.

""Seven Psychopaths"" is a crazy gory wild-eyed wack job of a movie that starts with Tarantino-style wiseguy talk presents a couple of Scorsesian blood brothers proceeds through lunatic Hollywood parody and climaxes in a satiric massacre. Not surprisingly I loved it. ""Seven Psychopaths"" comes from Martin McDonagh who staked a claim as Irelands bloodiest playwright with productions such as ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" (traces of which you may detect here) and made his film debut with ""In Bruges"" which starred Colin Farrell. His second film also stars Farrell this time as Marty a not-very-productive Hollywood screenwriter. Martys new script is called ""Seven Psychopaths"" -- but so far all he has is the title. And the idea that its about you know seven psychopaths. And that its going to be ""life-affirming."" Marty drinks a lot but his real problem is he has no imagination. Because he could never imagine that best friend Billy is a dognapper who just snatched a mobsters Shih Tzu. And that now theyre going to meet some real psychopaths with real guns. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a complicated script that jumps wittily between the stories of Martys fictional lunatics -- who include a Buddhist terrorist a Quaker avenger and a serial-killer killer -- and portraits of the real mad murderers around him. And when it comes to crazies this movie could single-handedly repopulate Arkham Asylum. Theres that hot-tempered dog-loving gangster. A gawky killer who carries around a white rabbit. A vigilante who leaves playing cards at the scene of his crimes. The cast itself isnt much more down to earth. Seriously Christopher Walken and Tom Waits as criminals? Plus a jaw-clenched Woody Harrelson as the dog lover? (At one point the cast included mad Mickey Rourke in Harrelsons part; he quit after fighting with the director. McDonagh waved it away but look for a tombstone inscribed ""ROURKE"" in a graveyard scene.) Theyre all wonderful but the true prize goes to the delightfully manic Sam Rockwell who has been a criminally underappreciated -- and extravagantly interesting -- character actor for decades. As Billy he pretty much walks away with the movie (after first punching it in the nose sticking a ball-gag in its mouth and throwing it over his shoulder). But this isnt a one-man show or a one-joke comedy. McDonagh sets real (and very different) moods for his stories-within-stories. The Los Angeles locations -- apart from the obligatory Hollywood sign -- seem fresh. And the laughs keep coming -- although be warned they are mostly nasty laughs accompanied by literally head-exploding gore. (This is probably the bloodiest good comedy -- and often bloody good comedy -- since that other Hollywood spoof ""Tropic Thunder""). ""Seven Psychopaths"" is not for everyone. In fact I suspect its really for very few -- mostly people with a pitch-dark sense of humor a broad tolerance for cruel jokes and a strong stomach for Peckinpah-style gunfights. Those of us who fit the bill -- well we know who we are. And were very glad we have Martin McDonagh around. Ratings note The film contains extreme violence gore nudity sexual situations and drug and alcohol abuse. Seven Psychopaths (R) CBS Films (109 min.) Directed by Martin McDonagh.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 12 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 11 2012 247PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Martin McDonagh Written by Martin McDonagh Starring Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken Woody Harrelson Classification 18A Genre comedy Year 2012 Country USA Language English If screenplays were architecture there would be no mistaking the Martin McDonagh school - hes that sacrilegiously clever fellow who makes the gargoyles the centrepiece of his church. That was the design of In Bruges and its only compounded in Seven Psychopaths. So your reaction to a McDonagh movie is pretty much a function of how you feel about those gargoyles. Since theyre smart witty and speak in crackling dialogue flecked with self-referential ironies the lads (and laddishness abounds) are awfully easy to love not least because they find it even easier to love each other. In the end cast and audience are having such fun that it seems almost mingy to complain when the church lacking a foundation collapses under the weight of its own cleverness. Youtube frame grab Film Seven Psychopaths official trailer A scene from ""Seven Psychopaths"" CP Movies Video Twisted humour drew Harrelson to Seven Psychopaths In Bruges opened and continued with an odd couple of mobsters bickering like the loquacious scamps in a Tarantino flick. Ditto here yet this time the two are dead before the credits can finish their roll. Of course were no longer in Bruges but as a glimpse of the iconic sign asserts in Hollywood. That assertion is reinforced with the introduction of Marty (Colin Farrell) whos given both McDonaghs name and his vocation. Yep this Marty is a screenwriter too trying to booze his way past the blockages in his latest venture. To date all hes got is the title and if you guessed Seven Psychopaths well award yourself a meta-star and settle in for a movie about the movie germinating within the movie.Clearly a conceit that cloying demands an anti-boredom inoculation which gives Doctor McDonagh the perfect excuse to inject massive doses of his idiosyncratic wit. And who better at idiosyncrasy than Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson plus the reigning King of Quirk Christopher Walken. In this acting company Farrell is normalcy incarnate - little wonder hes essentially reduced to the straight-man role.As for the recursive plot it seems Billy (Rockwell) is keen to help his best friend with that stalled screenplay at least when he can get away from his day job - kidnapping dogs. He swipes the pooches leaving his partner Hans (Walken) to return them to their grateful owners in the certainty of a fat reward. The scam is sure-fire until they snatch the wrong canine from the wrong guy - a shih tzu called Bonny from a gangster called Charlie (Harrelson). Whatever the psychopathic leanings of the dog-nappers this guy is the real deal with a real gun prone to put real bullets in real noggins. Imagine that.Yep the tension between the imagined and the real between the movie script in Martys head and the one unfolding on the screen is the biggest thread in the tapestry. Nothing new there. Whats refreshing though is the palpable delight of the principal cast riffing off their inside-out roles and the sheer glee of every actor except Walken playing in any scene with Walken.Inevitably his louche take on Hans is first among equals; even better McDonagh uses him to provide a sort of running commentary on the state of Marty/Martins picture. ""Your women characters are awful"" he laments and so they are. Later his screenplay assessment is upgraded to a giddy ""Its got layers"" but that might just be the peyote talking. Later still as the identified psychopaths climb toward the allotted seven he wonders aloud ""They get kind of tiresome after a while dont you think?""Yes and no. Yes because all the solipsism and the Tarantino/Scorsese homages do wear thin. But no because unlike In Bruges - which promised more substance than it delivered - this flick never pretends to be anything but a bright hall of fun-house mirrors. And there so gloriously distorted gargoyles look right at home.

By Kyle Smith View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) October 12 2012 | 400am Modal Trigger Colin Farrell (from left) Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell are three of the oddball characters in ""Seven Psychopaths."" Few legends on the poster will attract my attention as much as these ""Written and directed by Martin McDonagh."" McD once wrote a play and showed it to Woody Harrelson. Who turned it down. Because it was too dark. For the guy who starred in ""Natural Born Killers."" With his second movie ""Seven Psychopaths"" the author of such hilariously macabre plays as ""The Pillowman"" still isnt quite getting it right on the big screen. This is one crazy bastard of a movie but too many of its moments of lets-subvert-the-genre seem to leave McDonagh stranded and flailing at just the moment when a Tarantino movie or a Chuck Palahniuk novel is snapping into place. Harrelson plays a dog-loving mobster whose Shih Tzu has been kidnapped. He is not cool with this. Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) have been snapping up expensive dogs in public parks in LA then presenting themselves for the reward money. So far so swell but Billys screenwriter friend Martin (Colin Farrell not the guy who comes to mind to play a nerd) is stuck on Page One of his new script. Its called ""Seven Psychopaths."" So far his only idea is for a Buddhist psycho. Or maybe a Quaker . . . Severely brilliant stuff follows broken up by childish humor random shards of weirdness and depraved violence. If youre bothered by gore stay away. What appears to be a relatively straightforward story -- containing lots of Tarantino and a little ""Dexter"" with serial killers killing serial killers -- gets folded like origami in the second half. But instead of causing the ""Aha"" moments of ""Pulp Fiction"" McDonagh delivers lots of ""Huh?"" Theres too much going on here for me to wrap my head around but I reserve the right in 10 years to call this a masterpiece. Or a failure. There is a first-draft feel to the proceedings and McDonagh bites off more history than he can chew (Vietnam? Really?) But his rejection of cliche serves him well. Tom Waits as a loner with a sick past -- and a bunny he carries around? Sweet even when we learn of his murder habit. Then theres that McDonagh dialogue ""You cant let the animals die in the movie"" someone says. ""Just the women."" Theres ""Peace is for queers"" (dont worry its a psycho who says this) and Walkens remark that he isnt fit for a job even with the employer of last resort. ""The government?"" he says. Hed rather do nothing than be ""just stealing from folks."" Then theres the classic-sounding Chandler-esque ""Hes my writer friend."" ""Yeah I can smell the booze."" In the end (which continues into the credits) I was left thinking McDonagh can do better than this and yet I was slightly more agog with admiration than peevish with frustration. Most of all I wanted to see the film again.

Starring Collin Ferrell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken Abbie Cornish Sam Rockwell Olga Kurylenko Gabourey Sidibe Kevin Corrigan Brendan Sexton III Tom Waits Director Martin McDonagh Running time 149 Release Opened Oct 12 2012  Editorial Review An entertaining dose of overkillBy Ann HornadayFriday October 12 2012Sam Rockwell delivers a soaring scene-stealing performance as a verbose criminal low-life in ""Seven Psychopaths"" a toxic little bauble of Hollywood gestures cliches and tropes. As Billy Bickle a Los Angeles dog-napper who like everyone in the city aspires to be a screenwriter Rockwell doesnt just hold his own with such oxygen-sucking talent as Colin Farrell Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson. He takes firm possession of the screen infusing his manic scrofulous character with so much impishly inspired derangement that he almost succeeds in making ""Seven Psychopaths"" transcend itself as a glib self-referential genre exercise. Almost. As the latest hyper-talky super-stylized smart-but-shallow film from Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh ""Seven Psychopaths"" serves as a perfectly serviceable follow-up to ""In Bruges"" the similarly erudite aggressively funny and essentially vapid hit-man adventure he directed in 2008. In that film Farrell played a rookie assassin at large in the medieval Belgian city where at one point in the course of the films giddily circuitous events he shoots a young man in the eye. ""Seven Psychopaths"" takes up almost literally where that scene leaves off as two anonymous hit men -- played by Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt -- discuss their boss who has ordered them to shoot both eyes of their female victim. ""Ive got one exact word for that"" one of them says. ""Overkill."" That could well be the one exact word for ""Seven Psychopaths"" in which a screenwriter named Marty (Farrell) starts writing a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths"" having been inspired by a story told to him by his friend Billy. While Marty tries to dream up six more homicidal maniacs Billy and his partner in crime Hans (Walken) embark on their daily scam kidnapping dogs and pocketing the reward money. When Billy steals a Shih Tzu though he runs afoul of her devoted owner a pathological crime boss named Charlie (Harrelson). Trafficking in the larky dark humor of the Coen brothers and the heedless whiz-bang movie-worship of Quentin Tarantino McDonagh has never met a reference he didnt nod to (Billy does a pretty good impression of his Uncle Travis in one sequence involving a mirror). His limber verbal acrobatics studded with bursts of sordid violence and unbridled vulgarity are equaled by a vibrantly absurdist visual imagination whether its surrounding a charred corpse with a family of soft white bunnies or casually including a never-played tuba in the background of Billys living room. With Rockwell leading the way Farrell Walken and Harrelson prove to be a merry band of deadpan pranksters plunging into McDonaghs world of seamy miscreants and hallucinogenic fever dreams with gleeful abandon. (As if ""Seven Psychopaths"" needed any more cred Tom Waits shows up in a memorable cameo as one of the title characters.) As Marty Billy and Hans keep one step ahead of the vengeful Charlie ""Seven Psychopaths"" becomes a document of how the fictional ""Seven Psychopaths"" gets written with Marty and Billy arguing about story mechanics acting out pivotal scenes and above all debating cinematic morals. Marty wants his movie to be about more than just the graphic bloodshed and gratuitous depravity of most crime thrillers while Billy observes unironically that its never okay to kill animals in a film ""just the women."" Like his cinematic alter ego McDonagh insists he has something serious to say amid the slit throats bullet wounds and horrific scenes of savagery that comprise ""Seven Psychopaths"" -- about sexism self-sacrifice selective outrage and the enduring pull of screen violence. As both a burlesque and critique of male-wish fulfillment and overcompensation ""Seven Psychopaths"" is at least philosophically deeper than the pastiches hes riffing on. But the film also begins to feel like a case of a director getting to revel in the very thing hes reviling. McDonagh clearly is an astute student of Hollywoods first lesson When asked to choose between having your cake and eating it too just say yes.Contains strong violence bloody images pervasive profanity sexuality nudity and some drug use.

Photo Chuck Zlotnick CBS Films Seven Psychopaths review nutty 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Seven Psychopaths Crime comedy. Starring Kevin Farrell Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken. Directed by Martin McDonagh. (R. 105 minutes.) Compared with other movies ""Seven Psychopaths"" is clever and inventive enough to be considered a weak success or a modest failure the kind of effort that usually gets damned with the faint praise of ""not bad."" But ""Seven Psychopaths"" was written and directed by Martin McDonagh the playwright turned filmmaker who gave us the brilliant ""In Bruges."" By that standard ""Seven Psychopaths"" has to be counted as a disappointment. Worse than that its a particularly insidious variety of disappointment the kind that casts a backward glance at an artists previous work and suggests limits that were always there but disguised. Talents can grow they can stagnate and they can decay. Fortunately they can also recover and get back on track and maybe that will happen next time. Meanwhile ""Seven Psychopaths"" has the feeling of decadence of a writer imitating himself skating the surface of his ability and settling for cheap gestures. Perhaps McDonagh is not taking movies seriously enough. His new picture is a lot like Quentin Tarantino at his worst with a dash of Guy Ritchie at his best (which is still horrible). It presents a boys world with lots of sketchy but flamboyant characters inhabited by name actors and each gets his chance to be flashy. At the head of the ensemble is an appealing Colin Farrell as an Irish screenwriter named Martin who is under contract to deliver a screenplay but has writers block. All he has is the title ""Seven Psychopaths"" and a vague idea that he wants his psychopath story to be ultimately humane. So the screenwriter like McDonagh is an Irishman named Martin and throughout the movie mixes the things that Martin imagines with his frequent encounters with real-life psychopaths in his daily life. Among the latter is Martins increasingly erratic best friend played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell does his best to make sense of this broad but thin character and fights the role to a draw. McDonagh has a mastery of dialogue a streak of outrageousness and the power to surprise and these attributes buoy the early part of the film and keep the rest of it from degenerating entirely. An opening scene with Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt as a pair of hit men not only resolves in a way that will amaze and delight but the framing of the shot is so witty that it makes the audience expect great things. It takes about 45 minutes for the truth to gradually settle that those great things arent coming. Instead of expanding ""Seven Psychopaths"" contracts becoming less outrageous even as it reveals itself as trivial. Some will enjoy the connections between the real-life McDonagh and Martin the screenwriter and will find the latters writers block amusing but it becomes less amusing as you begin to suspect that McDonagh was as lost as his alter ego and as the movie takes on the quality of something made up on the fly. Likewise there is a moment when someone complains that Martins female characters are cardboard inarticulate and inevitably end up dead. But does McDonaghs admitting it make it any better? At a certain point self-deprecation becomes a form of self-assertion. Theres little to say for the actors beyond that theyre effective within the limits imposed on them. Farrell and Rockwell and also Woody Harrelson as a mob boss and Christopher Walken as a religious man with a troubled past are all fun to watch. Theyre skillful and idiosyncratic and there are flashes of real acting. But there is no overall vision and where theres no vision performances die. In the end ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an immersion in ugliness and violence barely relieved by wit. Its not a comment on an ugly crazy world nor is it a response to an ugly crazy world. Its just ugly all on its own - and not nearly as crazy as it should be. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Seven Psychopaths cant handle its own crazy Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Seven Psychopaths cant handle its own crazySeven Psychopaths with Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken is a letdown after writer-director Martin McDonaghs In Bruges.October 11 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Colin Farrell Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell must deal with the repercussions... (Chuck Zlotnick )Both literally and metaphorically ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a shaggy dog story.Not only is an actual shaggy dog a tiny Shih Tzu the cynosure of all eyes here but the films rambling narrative meanders into all kinds of haphazard story lines that are simultaneously audacious anarchic and random. If the name of writer-director Martin McDonagh is familiar you sort of know what to expect.McDonagh a celebrated Irish playwright (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane"") who was Oscar-nominated for his screenplay for 2008s ""In Bruges"" (and won one for a short film) has set his latest film in Los Angeles and its elements are every bit as blackhearted and wacky as the Bruges events were.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsBut unlike ""In Bruges"" the outlandish parts of ""Seven Psychopaths"" though often bleakly entertaining in their own right remain a collection of weird riffs that not even engaging acting by Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken and Tom Waits can bring together.Also given that this is McDonagh working somewhat in the vein of Quentin Tarantino ""Seven Psychopaths"" traffics in a good deal of bloody violence not to mention his usual gleefully profane and politically incorrect dialogue.You could argue a and people will a that the scenes of a head being graphically blown completely off and multiple individuals getting burned to death are all meant in jolly good fun but they do tend to wear a body down nevertheless.There is in fact so much violence in this film that its surprisingly easy to lose track of which characters are psychopaths and which are not even though the miscreants are identified by an on-screen number when they first appear. This is not a problem that people putting Jane Austen on screen have ever had to face.Whatever else you say about McDonagh you know immediately it is one of his films youre in. The first line of dialogue heard right after Hank Williams sings his chilling ""Angel of Death"" over the opening credits is one man asking another ""Was it Dillinger who got shot in the eyeball?""Its not long before the films first genuine psychopath appears though his identity is unknown due to his proclivity for wearing a red ski mask when he blows people away. The killer also leaves the jack of diamonds next to his victims as a calling card of sorts.Met next is Marty played by McDonaghs ""In Bruges"" star Colin Farrell. An Irish screenwriter (one of the films several self-referential touches) who likes to drink more than he likes to write Marty is not a psychopath but someone who likes to write about them.In fact hes come up with the ""Seven Psychopaths"" title for his next work but his drinking has gotten in the way of his writing anything which causes his girlfriend (an underutilized Abbie Cornish) no little despair.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsEager to help Marty with the script is his best friend Billy (Rockwell) an out-of-work actor who has in the interim partnered with Hans (Christopher Walken) in what he calls the dog-borrowing business but is actually the dog-kidnapping-for-ransom business.While Hans is preoccupied with his wifes possible breast cancer Billy kidnaps a dog that should never have been taken. That would be Bonny an adorable Shih Tzu that belongs to Charlie Costello (Harrelson) an unmistakable psychopath who loves his dog beyond reason and wont hesitate to kill anyone involved in his disappearance.Deranged as this plot clearly is it is also noticeably lacking in psychopaths and the need to work in more leads the film down some odd trails. We see a story about a vengeance-seeking Quaker (the venerable Harry Dean Stanton) that Marty has heard somewhere as well as an elaborate tale spun by a random psychopath named Zachariah (Waits) attracted by an ad in the LA Weekly (dont ask).In between the mayhem the characters get to make the kinds of bravura McDonagh speeches that actors love like one that Billy gives passionately refuting the logic of Gandhis notion that an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.If this sounds confusing its not the half of things. Like screenwriting Marty who wants to pen a violent psychopath tale that is also life-affirming this film wants to deliver genre satisfactions while simultaneously subverting them.

CBS Films Chuck Zlotnick Woody Harrelson in ""Seven Psychopaths."" CBS Films photo We love dogs because they are almost human. And so are hit men. Or at least thats what weve been told by movies since Quentin Tarantinos ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" in which killers argued about pop music and the metric system.Film history weighs a bit too heavily on ""Seven Psychopaths"" a caper comedy from Martin McDonagh the Irish director of the more likable hit-man movie ""In Bruges."" Here the hit men are camped on the American soil that gave birth to the neo-noir genre greater Hollywood.Marty (Colin Farrell) is a morose alcoholic Irishman struggling to make it as a screenwriter. He has concocted a catchy title for his new script -- ""Seven Psychopaths"" -- but he cant imagine a scenario as rich as the real-life reign of terror in which someone is bumping off bad guys. Marty has a hyperactive best friend named Billy (Sam Rockwell) who ekes out a living kidnapping dogs with dapper old con man Hans (Christopher Walken) and then returning the pets to their owners for a reward. As a denizen of the underworld Billy has ideas for Martys script starting with a suggestion that he advertise for real psychopaths whom Marty can interview. The ad produces a single suspect -- Tom Waits cradling a bunny -- along with a flashback that further blurs the line between art and reality.Meanwhile one of the dog-napping victims a local gangster named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes gunning for Billy and Hans.By the time the meta-movie and cute-dog subplots collide in the desert this high-concept vehicle has run out of gas. Movies about the filmmaking process may never get old but self-referential hit men smell like yesterdays fish story. McDonagh underscores his comedic intent with props such as a fluffy Shih Tzu named Bonny and Billys raccoon cap (a nod to Rockwells breakthrough role in the charming indie ""A Box of Moonlight""). Yet the smart one-liners are punctuated with head-shredding violence designed to delight the lowest common denominator. The whole enterprise is so misguided that the dream-come-true cast is stranded in the middle of nowhere.""Seven Psychopaths"" is a vivid illusion of fun but sane consumers can find similar sensations in the discount video bin eight days a week.

Walken his line readings a thing of bizarro beauty is reason enough to sign up. The icing on the cake is Martin McDonagh the acclaimed Irish playwright who took a winning stab at writing and directing for the screen in 2008s In Bruges. Two years ago Walken made Broadway hum with mirth and menace in McDonaghs A Behanding in Spokane. More News Peter Travers 2012 Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Now theyre back together with Walken playing a priceless McDonagh creation called Hans an L.A. con artist who teams up with Billy (Rockwell) to kidnap dogs from wealthy owners and hold them for ransom. Their big mistake is nabbing Bonny a Shih Tzu belonging to Harrelsons Charlie Costello a gangster with a sadistic streak for anything non-canine. Harrelson is hilarious especially going goo-goo over Bonny. And Walken and Rockwell have mad skills at well everything. Their byplay gets mired by a subplot involving Marty (Colin Farrell) a boozy Irish screenwriter stuck in Hollywood and blocked on his new script. He hasnt written anything but the title Seven Psychopaths. To help Billy puts out an all-points alert for scum of the earth. Not a bad idea when the great Tom Waits playing a serial killer becomes a contender. Blood splatters heads explode and McDonagh takes sassy self-mocking shots at the very notion of being literary in Hollywood. Its crazy-killer fun.

Warner Bros. Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 12 2012 118 a.m. ET A movie studio Orson Welles famously said is the best toy a boy ever had. Far from being a boy Ben Affleck is his own man a distinctive actor who in recent years directed ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"" a couple of medium-size movies that established him as an accomplished filmmaker. Now as director and star of ""Argo"" he has deployed a studios full-scale resources on an intrinsically dramatic story and the results are nothing less than sensational. This political thriller has it all a suspense plot centered on Americans in mortal peril during the Iranian hostage crisis that erupted in late 1979; a stranger-than-fiction subplot that was in fact concocted by the CIA to effect the Americans escape; and a movie within the movie thats all the funnier for being fake. The crisis began when Islamist revolutionaries stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 Americans hostage. In the midst of the terror and chaos however six of them escaped into the streets then took refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Its their tale the film tells not that of the 444-day crisis in its sprawling entirety and what a tale it turns out to be. (The factual details declassified by President Bill Clinton in 1997 are brilliantly embellished in the screenplay that Chris Terrio based on a Wired Magazine article by Joshua Bearman.) To rescue the six before their whereabouts are discovered the CIAs top ""exfiltration"" operative Tony Mendez--a real-life figure played by Mr. Affleck--devises a cloak-and-camera plan to sneak into Iran give the sequestered Americans new identities as Canadian filmmakers scouting locations for a sci-fi film called ""Argo"" then whisk them out on a regular commercial flight from Tehrans international airport. As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point a CIA exfiltration specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Its often said of incredible but true stories that you cant make such stuff up. Sure you can; youre free to do whatever you want in the wonderful world of motion pictures. But you wouldnt want to make this story up if it werent rooted in reality because Tonys plan is before anything else utterly preposterous as well as inventive and wildly daring ""This is the best bad idea we have sir"" his superior Jack ODonnell (Bryan Cranston) tells the CIAs director in a meeting at Langley headquarters. What makes the whole thing delicious in the bargain is that the CIA really did enlist Hollywoods help in creating a sham production company to give the agencys fake movie the ring of truth. John Goodman brings his droll wit to the role of John Chambers the Hollywood makeup artist who was in fact Tony Mendezs friend and co-conspirator. As the fictional director Lester Siegel an acidulous has-been who drives a gold Rolls-Royce Alan Arkin gets some of the best lines--it would take too many asterisks to quote the topper which becomes a running gag--and he turns a smallish part into a thrillers antic soul. As the hero of the enterprise Mr. Affleck is sufficiently restrained to be believable yet he provides enough of a star presence to sustain what is after all a mainstream entertainment. As the director of a large and diverse cast he has done himself proud ""Argo"" abounds in fine actors--none of them household names--who dont look like theyre acting at all. Victor Garber is the Canadian ambassador while his six involuntary houseguests are played by Tate Donovan Scoot McNairy Kerry Bishe Christopher Denham Clea DuVall and Rory Cochrane. As a filmmaker working on a large canvas in a quasidocumentary style Mr. Affleck rises to one challenge after another with a sure touch. (And with the help of such collaborators as the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto the production designer Sharon Seymour the editor William Goldenberg and Alexandre Desplat who did the original score.) Tonys crash program to teach his six frightened charges their assigned roles feels convincing and fresh. The sci-fi script billed as a ""cosmic conflagration"" for the benefit of the Hollywood trade press gets a reading by actors in full regalia at a Beverly Hills hotel during a set piece thats staged with a delightfully straight face. The action sequences with revolutionaries on a rampage in an epic conflagration combine news clips culled from archival sources--shades of Walter Cronkite and Peter Jennings plus a doggedly optimistic Jimmy Carter--with footage adeptly shot and directed to look archival. The production plays fast with events of the period but not loose. A lucid introduction puts Irans 1979 revolution in the historical context of the 1953 coup engineered by U.S. and British intelligence agencies that replaced the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mossadegh with an increasingly repressive regime headed by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The revolutionaries themselves are neither demonized nor romanticized; its quite remarkable how many of the perfervid young soldiers and gimlet-eyed bureaucrats come to life however briefly as individuals. (Its also remarkable how the advent of the film coincides with yet another crisis involving Iran.) Most studio productions these days are about nothing but entertainment; this one treats the world of volatile politics both at home and abroad with mature interest and respect. Yet it does so with a flair for showmanship. ""Argo"" is a movie about storytelling that tells its own story briskly and clearly; theres very little fat on the narrative bones. Its a movie about movies that savors the mediums silliness. Mr. Goodmans bottom-feeding makeup artist could be an escapee from ""Ed Wood"" or one of Woods sleazy productions. After listening to Tony outline his desperate scheme he asks ""So you want to come to Hollywood and act like a big shot without doing anything?"" When Tony says ""Yeah"" the makeup man replies gleefully ""Youll fit right in."" The script is smart about the mediums allure Tony wouldnt have a chance of pulling his scheme off if the Iranians like everyone else in this star-struck world werent instantly intrigued by the prospect of a movie being made. And ""Argo"" exults in what a movie can do when its story has a compelling core. Theres been no shying away from the joys of expert manipulation no reluctance to heighten the fact-based drama with fictional inventions. Whats startling is that the invented elements have been done so well. (One tolerable perhaps inevitable exception is a moist uplifting coda.) Without giving any plot points away I can tell you that a climactic scene turns on a marvelous surprise and promise you frequent spasms of suspense that will grow almost unbearable. If youve forgotten how gratifying a Hollywood studio film can be this is the best good idea you could ask for. ENLARGE Colin Farrell left Christopher Walken center and Sam Rockwell in a scene from Seven Psychopaths. CBS Films Seven Psychopaths Martin McDonagh knows how to make gratifying films. His debut feature ""In Bruges"" with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as eloquent hit men came to us four years ago with a mixed cargo of absurdist violence disarming tenderness and flashes of spirituality. ""Seven Psychopaths"" brings Mr. Farrell back as an Irish innocent and would-be screenwriter who finds himself surrounded by psycho killers in the absurdist environs of Los Angeles. ""In Bruges"" was carefully even formally structured while this new film is a rambling accretion of superviolent nihilist riffs that evoke Tarantino so making it must have been fun for the filmmaker. Some of the film is fun for moviegoers too an eerily rueful performance by Christopher Walken an amazing verbal aria (with violent visuals as accompaniment) by Sam Rockwell recurrent nonsense concerning Woody Harrelsons lethal efforts to find his kidnapped Shi Tzu. Still the violence wears you down. Like one of its nutso characters ""Seven Psychopaths"" has a death wish. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern .

CBS Films hide caption toggle caption CBS Films Seven Psychopaths Director Martin McDonagh Genre Comedy Running Time 109 minutes Rated R for strong violence bloody images pervasive language sexuality/nudity and some drug use With Colin Farrell Woody Harrelson Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken Watch Clips Ive Been Busy Ive Been Busy Credit CBS Dont Get Mad Dont Get Mad Credit CBS Films If you do the math the number of true psychopaths in Seven Psychopaths may not quite add up. Perhaps writer-director Martin McDonagh didnt want to go overboard with the murderous crazies. As it is hes peopled his whimsically brutal comic thriller with -- to name just three -- an Amish throat-slasher a dynamite-packing Buddhist and a serial killer whos fond of white bunny rabbits. Thats probably enough. Then again the killer sickos are just the gimmick in Seven Psychopaths. This is really a movie about the creative impulse and its tendency to make people nuts a subject it explores with incessant and sometimes exasperating restlessness. Colin Farrell plays Marty a Hollywood screenwriter whos behind on his latest script He has the title (""Seven Psychopaths"") and one or two characters (including the killer Buddhist though he hasnt yet figured out exactly how a Buddhist goes about killing) but beyond that hes lost. His best friend aimless actor-type Billy Bickle -- hes played by Sam Rockwell and his last name is perhaps an all-too-obvious clue regarding his psychological temperament -- begs Marty to let him co-write the screenplay going so far as to take out a ""calling all psychopaths"" newspaper ad without his buddys consent. Billy is extremely loyal to his friends He believes rightly that Marty has a drinking problem and tries to get him off the sauce. He uses up other portions of his generally empty days helping another pal Hans (Christopher Walken) kidnap dogs and return them to their owners shortly thereafter; Hans accepts with faux reluctance whatever reward money is offered and then uses it for his wifes cancer treatments so his heart is in the right place. i Charlie (Woody Harrelson) turns out to be the kind of guy whos willing to do anything to get his pet back. CBS Films hide caption toggle caption CBS Films Charlie (Woody Harrelson) turns out to be the kind of guy whos willing to do anything to get his pet back. CBS Films But one day Billy nabs a petite Shih Tzu on Hans behalf. (The dogs name in real life and in the picture is Bonny and the movies press notes describe her as a ""fur fatale"" which is about right.) He doesnt know that the winsome little puffball is the beloved pet of a ruthless Hollywood gangster named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) whos ready to break kneecaps or worse to get his pooch back. Seven Psychopaths is McDonaghs first film since his 2008 debut feature In Bruges and it shares that pictures precocious archness. Characters trade barbs and quips like crazy blue jays and the rambunctious exchanges are entertaining at first. But the picture is so aggressively clever that it becomes wearisome. What starts out as a funny-grim Hollywood noir complete with grisly razor slashings and blunt point-blank stomach shootings ends up as a semi-existential rumination on the nature of creating art as three of the major characters camp out in the desert waiting -- and waiting -- for a Peckinpah-style shootout to happen. Its probably supposed to mean something deep but what? Theres something overtly mechanical about McDonaghs approach that keeps it all from being as outrageously fun as its pretending to be. But it is enjoyable to watch the parade of actors McDonagh has assembled Farrell with his perpetually anxious brow is refreshingly low-key in the midst of all this overwritten folderol. Tom Waits appears in a small but potent role; hes scruffy and touching as earnest as a tattered valentine. And Walken -- nominated for a Tony Award for his role in McDonaghs 2010 play A Behanding in Spokane -- is something to behold thanks to his trademark Walken weirdness. When a mob baddie sticks a gun in his face and asks him to put his hands up he retorts with the bland indifference of a lizard sunning himself on a rock ""No."" When the aggressor asks him why he refuses to comply he elaborates ""Because I dont feel like it."" Walken strides through Seven Psychopaths casually gracefully like the superb dancer that he is. Everything else around him is working overtime but he doesnt seem to notice.

More about Seven Psychopaths >> McDonaghs Seven Psychopaths which likewise stars Colin Farrell as one of its pair of protagonists is on the other hand set in decidedly unpretty swaths of Los Angeles a colorfully tawdry scape occupied by hookers cross dressers senior citizens and crooks. And where Farrells character Marty is a fish in water - a Hollywood screenwriter albeit one who does more drinking than writing. (His excuse hes Irish.) Meta and messy Seven Psychopaths does not hang together like In Bruges and as Marty struggles to cobble up a compelling plotline about hit men and serial killers some of McDonaghs creative desperation seems to bleed onto the screen too. But put a gun in the hands of Woody Harrelson and some glorious gab in the mouth of Christopher Walken - the most deadpan of deadpanning thespians - and its impossible not to make something of this profanity-flying conflation. References to movies abound and the soundtracks playlist - from ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" to Hank Williams to Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys doing ""Different Drum"" - approaches genius. Sam Rockwell nattering and nervous is Martys friend and foil Billy - an out-of-work actor trying to help Marty with his script. At the same time Billy is busy assisting his buddy Hans (Walken) with a dognapping scheme. They steal a pooch when the owners not looking then return it to the bereft victim a few days later collecting a reward for finding the ""lost"" pet. This scam backfires however when a shih tzu theyve absconded with turns out to belong to the trigger-happy tattooed Charlie (Harrelson) a mobbed-up madman. Domestic animals play a significant role in McDonaghs body of work (consider the cat in The Lieutenant of Inishmore the cow in ""Six Shooter"" McDonaghs Oscar-winning short) and in Seven Psychopaths the canines run amok. And then theres Tom Waits as a homicidal nutjob who runs his murderous hands lovingly through the fluffy tufts of his bunny. (Its great to see the croaking singer-songwriter who once dabbled in acting quite a bit back on the screen.) There are scenarios-within-scenarios as Marty - his eyebrows flying - imagines bloody tales of a Quaker killer and an avenging Viet Cong. McDonagh may not want to hear it but this all owes more than a tip of the baseball cap to Quentin Tarantino. And when everyone decides to head for the desert - the otherworldly Joshua Tree - the parched tableaux evoke John Ford and Howard Hawks too. The crazy crossfires and gushes of blood that quickly ensue recall another director Sam Peckinpah. In keeping with the highly self-referential nature of Seven Psychopaths at one point Walkens Hans criticizes Farrells Marty for the screenwriters failure to create believable female roles. ""Your women characters are awful"" he declares. Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko both of whom appear on the periphery of Seven Psychopaths would likely agree.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 853am on Friday Oct. 12 2012 Friday Oct. 12 2012 Thursday Oct. 11 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram With its blend of low-rent gangster cool high-body-count hipster violence smart-mouth dialogue inspired casting and a blissfully retro soundtrack at odds with the onscreen mayhem Seven Psychopaths might have been a groundbreaking film -- in 1992. As it stands despite some clever touches and one surprisingly moving performance it just feels like leftover Quentin Tarantino or Elmore Leonard repackaged and reheated for a new generation.Colin Farrell is Marty a struggling Irish screenwriter in Hollywood who has only been able to come up with an eye-catching title for his latest work -- Seven Psychopaths -- but zero ideas to go along with it. Thats when his buddy Billy (Sam Rockwell) suggests he riff off something he read about in the paper two hit men slain in the Hollywood Hills by a masked killer.Marty and Billy who works with Hans (Christopher Walken) to steal rich peoples dogs and return them for the reward money soon find themselves dropped into the world of real-life psychopaths after the Shih Tzu of a local mob boss Charlie (Woody Harrelson) is nabbed. Charlie wants his dog back and hes willing to do anything to get it.From there the fictional world in Martys head and the real-world consequences of nabbing the wrong dog from the wrong guy collide and you end up with more psychopaths than you can shake a straitjacket at.Along the way we get a rabbit-loving Tom Waits a weirdly vengeful Harry Dean Stanton and the chance to hear Farrells real accent. Its all set in a Southern California that practically shimmers off the screen.But as envisioned by writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) Seven Psychopaths offers lots of quirks but doesnt give you any characters to care about except for one Hans. As a man whose outward eccentricities conceal the fact that hes dealing with a wife (Linda Bright Clay) battling cancer Walken digs beneath his personas odd-man caricature and reveals a tenderness and sadness not seen from him in years.If only the rest of the film were as affecting. Like Marty McDonagh came up with a great title. But also like Marty he should have realized that he needs more than that. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

"Seven Psychopaths (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Seven Psychopaths (R) Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken are aces but this wild violent comedy turns too timid and talky. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/11/2012 Editor rating 2 For a good hour Seven Psychopaths is lively bloody fun. Then the yawning starts. The second movie from Irish filmmaker/playwright Martin McDonagh reprises the combination of ironic violence and earnest sentiment from his first picture In Bruges except this time the scope is bigger and the body count is higher. Quentin Tarantino is an obvious influence here; so surprisingly is Charlie Kaufman. A screenwriter named Marty (Colin Farrell) has been drinking too much in hopes of getting inspiration for his new script which is titled Seven Psychopaths. Marty is blocked. He has come up with only one psycho thus far -- a Buddhist monk who doesnt believe in violence -- and his best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) who is an actor comes up with an unusual way to help Marty think of ideas. Billy is also involved in some shady business with Hans (Christopher Walken) a cravat-wearing oddball who steals dogs and returns them to their owner days later to collect a reward. When the dognappers snatch an adorable Shih Tzu that belongs to a crazed gangster (Woody Harrelson) their simple routine gets complicated. But the ensuing mayhem also provides Billy with plenty of fodder for his script. Suddenly there are psychos everywhere. McDonagh invests cliched situations and character types with urgency and ingenuity. Seven Psychopaths is packed with chatty murderers serial killers and lunatics but the dialogue feels natural and the conversations sound spontaneous. The opening scene in which two hit men debate whether or not its OK to kill a woman is a terrific piece of writing ably performed by two well-known actors the first of several surprise cameos throughout the film. The actors are clearly having a ball. Farrell is immensely likable as the frightened screenwriter thrust into the criminal underworld and an energized Walken gives his best performance in years making strange poetry out of lines such as ""Its impossible for someones head to explode when they get shot."" Best of all is Rockwell who lets you know from the start Billy might be a bit unhinged then gradually reveals the depth of his depravity as the movie unfolds. The performances are so good and the humor so effective (McDonagh never treats violence as a joke) that its a shame the story veers into meta territory stranding the characters in Joshua Tree for a dull peyote-fueled gabfest. Seven Psychopaths becomes a movie within a movie -- its the script that Marty will eventually write. But the film fared better when it was reenacting the contrivances of the crime genre (such as the way women serve no purpose in these stories other than to get killed) instead of having the characters talk - and talk - about them. Stranded in the desert Seven Psychopaths tells instead of showing and as one of these knuckleheads aptly puts it hanging out with psychos gets tiresome.

"Seven Psychopaths is crazy good fun - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Seven Psychopaths is crazy good fun Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 10.11.12 | 406 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Seven Psychopaths"" is many things chief among them a long-overdue love letter to Christopher Walken and a crudely drawn ransom note from Sam Rockwell. Mostly it represents playwright-turned-filmmaker Martin McDonagh trying mightily to up his game. Having disturbed theatergoers with stage dramas like ""The Cripple of Inishmaan"" and ""The Pillowman"" and having delighted movie audiences with the existential gangster comedy ""In Bruges"" (2008) the Irish bad boy of letters wants to prove he can do it all make a parody Tarantino movie while going Tarantino one better pull off a Charlie Kaufman-style meta-movie with genre film juice give a Guy Ritchie crime caper a literate spin. Basically he wants to be both Coen brothers in one body. He comes close. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is absurdly entertaining even after it disappears up its own hindquarters in the last act and it gives some of our weirder actors ample room to play. Surprisingly Colin Farrell isnt one of them As Marty (nudge-nudge) a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with a fondness for the grape hes the films straight man. McDonaghs eye and ear are equally sharp though. When Martys agent calls to ask where his latest screenplay is the camera calmly pans to an empty wine bottle. Later the hero is the subject of this exchange between two other characters ""Martys my writer friend I was telling you about."" ""I could smell the booze."" The first speaker is Billy (Rockwell) a part-time actor and full-time dog-napper who embodies the movies hyperactive chaos principle. Martys working on a script called ""Seven Psychopaths"" and Billys desperate to help him. Maybe a little too desperate. We see snippets of the movie in Martys mind -- Psychopath 1 Psychopath 2 -- or perhaps theyre playing out in real life. Hard to tell but bloody enjoyable (and joyously bloody) to watch. One of these mini-movies stars Harry Dean Stanton as a Quaker psycho and that casting almost justifies the movie by itself. Our first sight of Walken is similarly suitable for framing Hes wearing a cravat holding a lap dog and reading a pamphlet about breast cancer. All of these details will turn out to make sense. As Hans Billys fellow dog-napper -- they wait until the ""Missing"" posters go up then return the pooches for the reward -- Walken teleports in from Alpha Centauri with a performance of gentle but profound strangeness. McDonagh knows hes lucky to have the actor and he knows how truly fond of him weve all become over the decades; theres a showdown late in ""Seven Psychopaths"" where the audiences deep satisfying belly laughs come purely from Walkens way of delivering a line. Hans and Billy have stolen the prize shih tzu of Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson) a fearsome crime kingpin who is the movies third or fourth psychopath depending on where you started counting. The plot eventually comes down to Costello and his gang swearing eternal vengeance on the two while Hans visits his dying wife (a nicely weary Linda Bright Clay) in the hospital and Marty tries to finish his screenplay while ducking the falling bodies. Or is the screenplay writing him? ""Seven Psychopaths"" breaks down the walls of its own narrative early and often with a manic glee that ultimately spins out of control. McDonaghs self-referential dialogue cuts both ways When Billy tells Marty ""Your women characters are terrible. They have nothing to say"" he has a point and Abbie Cornish as the heros underwritten girlfriend (at one point wearing a winkingly gratuitous wet T-shirt) proves it. Billy also says about Martys screenplay ""The first half should be the perfect setup for a revenge flick and then the lead characters should just drive into the desert pitch a tent and talk for the rest of the movie."" Which is pretty much what happens although theres a little more gunplay toward the end. Luckily McDonagh writes dialogue thats spring-loaded with wit and he regards three characters sitting around chatting as a bet to be taken and doubled down upon. Theres so much going on in ""Seven Psychopaths"" in fact that the movie finally bursts apart at the seams. The parade of secondary characters includes Gabourey Sidibe (""Precious"") as the unfortunate dog-walker who lost Costellos beloved Bonnie Tom Waits -- clutching a bunny -- as one half of a husband-wife vigilante team (""We go around the country killing people who go around the country killing people"") and Kevin Corrigan being Kevin Corrigan. Its all delightful and exhausting and the only thing that sticks to your emotions is Walken and his moonbeam grace. Rockwell meanwhile plays Billy crazier and crazier -- and McDonagh lets him -- and the performance ends up hijacking the film. By the time several of the characters get their just deserts youre more than ready for the check. Its a hell of a meal nonetheless and worth a little acid indigestion. And McDonagh proves he can juggle multiple bowling balls and only drop a few of them on his toes and ours. Still as high-spirited and inventive as it is ""Seven Psychopaths"" represents a case of more equaling less. If he can ever turn that formula around Martin McDonagh may yet be a director of real consequence. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Inspiration arrives in unwelcome form when a friends dog-kidnapping scheme nabs the beloved pooch of a Mafia boss. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Every so often -- not very often at that -- you see a movie that leaves you stumbling out of the theater in a state of giddy elated vertigo. Thats what you get from ""Seven Psychopaths"" a howlingly funny Los Angeles crime farce overstuffed with flaky comedy gore idiosyncrasy genius dialogue wild cameo performances and an embarrassment of stars. Any film where you can watch Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken toss the ball around cant help but be intensely likable. When its written and directed by the absurdly gifted Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"") it approaches hipster nirvana. I put this alongside ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" as one of the all-time great ensemble crime comedies. Farrell plays Martin a blocked screenwriter. Hes past deadline on his big project which he sold on the basis of the title ""Seven Psychopaths."" He has no plot only one psychopath and the Sisyphean goal of making a psycho-killer movie with an uplifting pacifist moral. No wonder he procrastinates with his best drinking buddy Billy (Rockwell) an unemployed actor. Billy is a manic Jack-in-the-box lunatic but hes full of suggestions for the screenplay (many of which are riffs on generic multiplex nonsense we feel like weve seen before). Billy provides grist for Martins story when he sweeps him into the dog-kidnapping racket that he runs with Hans (Walken) a nice old guy whose honest demeanor compels the owners to give him a big cash reward when he returns their ""lost"" pets. After they make the mistake of scooping up a Shih Tzu belonging to trigger-happy mob boss Charlie Costello (Harrelson) Martin is up to his neck in inspiration. All he has to do is not get himself killed in the course of his research. Handout CBS Films From left Colin Farrell Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell star inc written and directed by Martin McDonagh. McDonagh knows when to let a scene digress and when to cut it short with a snap. Here hes in an expansive mood introducing a wealth of off-kilter characters (the films cameos are priceless) and letting them bounce off one another. He takes the stock parts of genre crime movies and twists them like Silly Putty. These characters just wont ""behave."" Walken has a wonderful scene when a gunman tells him to put his hands up. He nonchalantly says ""No."" Flummoxed the triggerman cant figure out how to deal with this nut. When Billy spins out his take on what Martins screenplay should become -- a hilarious travesty of action filmmaking that we see acted out onscreen -- Hans murmurs appreciatively ""Its got layers."" And so does ""Seven Psychopaths."" Its a Mobius strip of flashbacks dream sequences meta-fictional film snippets and self-referential humor. The screenwriter Martin feels like self-satire by McDonagh whose considerable talents dont include a knack for writing convincing female characters a failing thats grist for wry laughs here. The film reels back through a half-century of American history to make moral statements about real and movie violence becoming Martins Holy Grail a bloody shoot-em-up with an ethical core. Wow. Just wow.

Photo Credit Chuck Zlotnick advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An action-comedy about a struggling screenwriter a kidnapped dog and a crazed gangster. BOTTOM LINE This merry messy comedy pays slavish tribute to Quentin Tarantino who probably would have done a better job. CAST Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken LENGTH 150 They say bad artists borrow and great artists steal but ""Seven Psychopaths"" proves that theres a middle ground Sometimes pretty good artists just copy. Writer-director Martin McDonagh doesnt hide his influences in this merry violent mess of a comedy beginning with Quentin Tarantinos ""Pulp Fiction."" No really -- the movie actually begins with two hit-men making wry observations about popular culture and foreign countries. Its a way for McDonagh to cop to what hes doing but keep doing it -- and keep doing it he will. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Colin Farrell of McDonaghs ""In Bruges"" returns as a possible stand-in for the filmmaker He plays a screenwriter named Marty whos having trouble finishing a movie titled ""Seven Psychopaths."" Breaking his concentration but perhaps providing fodder is his erratic friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) who kidnaps dogs for the reward money with his partner Hans (Christopher Walken). When they kidnap a shih tzu belonging to the ruthless gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) Martin is reluctantly pulled into a maelstrom of violence. Movies about moviemaking can often feel lazy -- like rock songs about touring or poetry about sitting in cafes -- but McDonagh is such an energetic filmmaker and fancy-footed writer that he nearly pulls it off. And his actors are ridiculously good Farrell mostly plays it straight but Rockwell is wonderfully bonkers Harrelsons timing is terrific and Walken is well Walken. You might not even care that the movie is just a string of random vignettes with stunt-casting (Tom Waits as a serial killer Harry Dean Stanton as a Quaker). ""Your women characters are awful"" Hans tells Marty shortly after ""Seven Psychopaths"" has gotten rid of Olga Kurylenko and Abbie Cornish in useless bit-parts. Yes yes -- very clever. 225 VideoSeven Psychopaths with Colin Farrell PLOT An action-comedy about a struggling screenwriter a kidnapped dog and a crazed gangster.

Comments click to enlarge Seven Psychopaths Video Rated R  109 minutes  2012 The celebrated playwright-cum-filmmaker Martin McDonagh follows his debut feature In Bruges with a crime comedy thats brilliantly funny and completely full of shit. An Irish writer with a screenwriting assignment in Hollywood (Colin Farrell) goes on the run with his wacky pals (Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken) after the latter foolishly kidnap the beloved dog of a ruthless gangster (Woody Harrelson). McDonagh takes advantage of his premise to bemoan the gun violence and macho histrionics of Hollywood movies before shrugging and indulging in both of them. This hypocritical feint will probably guarantee him a rapturous reception by fanboys and critics alike but I cant remember the last time I was so sorely disappointed by a writer I liked; the movie is undeniably entertaining but as hollow as a bullet wound.

Area theaters. How do you cast a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths""? Lets count the ways. Fill in the obvious boxes first Psycho emeritus Christopher Walken? Check. Woody Harrelson Tom Waits? Check and check. Colin Farrell has done well by crazy so hes an honorary member. And Sam Rockwell one of our most watchable actors always seems one click away from a blowup. There are several others - and one psycho who deliberately gets counted twice -- in writer-director Martin McDonaghs hazy but fun meditation on friendship the art of storytelling and masculine morality gone off the rails. If its hard to keep em all straight without a scorecard just go with it. Farrell plays Marty a wanna-be Hollywood screenwriter whose best pal Billy (Rockwell) is kind of nuts and a bit of a nudge but a well-meaning one. Always ready to hang out especially when Martys girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) isnt killing the fun Billy just wants Marty to stop drinking so he can reach his potential as a writer. Billys got a million ideas and one of them is dognapping pooches with his pal Hans (Walken) then use the reward money to pay for Hans wifes medical bills. They end up grabbing the beloved Shih Tzu of a mobster (Woody Harrelson) who wants his dog back immediately. These guys inspire Marty to start a script ""Seven Psychopaths"" which draws in the duck-carrying Zachariah (Tom Waits) just at the time a psycho is going around Los Angeles killing other psycho killers. As David Byrne might say ""Quest-ce que cest?"" McDonagh the auteur of ""In Bruges"" and writer of Off-Broadway (""A Behanding in Spokane"") and Broadway (""The Beauty Queen of Lehane"") hits is after an elliptical kind of storytelling. ""Seven Psychopaths"" doesnt want to go the way audiences think which is part of its charm. Fun as it is the movies meta-conceits can be a bit trying by the time all the loose screws are gathered up. But if it does wind up in familiar cinematic territory -- ""the perfect place for a shootout"" as Billy and Marty observe Tarantino-ishly -- thats not because its lazy. Its part of the schizo flow. Each cast member helps push it along with standouts including Rockwell Harrelson and Gabourey Sidibe in a brief but memorable scene. They help make ""Seven Psychopaths"" an astute bloody and bloodshot-eyed addition to a genre it knows its part of.

Also torture immolations throat-slittings point-blank execution-style shootings and stabbings in various parts of the body. And on top of it all the titular septet of lunatics. Or maybe more than seven. Or less. It would be telling too much to go into the details. Irish playwright Martin McDonagh made a splashy feature debut as the writer-director of 2008s ""In Bruges"" which mixed brutal violence with dark humor and a testosterone-heavy brand of word jazz that felt reminiscent of both David Mamet and Quentin Tarantino without seeming to be ripping off either. This his sophomore effort sees the filmmaker slip a bit down a self-referential rabbit hole but since hes abandoned neither the witty verbiage nor the gunshots to the face its still a bloody hoot. Its not as lean and streamlined as ""In Bruges"" but it manages that neat trick of eliciting simultaneous laughs and screams. Colin Farrell stars as a screenwriter named Martin whos got a title for his new script -- ""Seven Psychopaths"" -- but nothing else. Drinking too much and ejected from the home of his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) Marty hangs out with his actor pal Billy (Sam Rockwell). Billy doesnt get a lot of gigs what with his tendency to punch directors at auditions but hes got a somewhat lucrative side job stealing dogs and then returning them to their distraught owners for reward money. Billys accomplice in this venture is Hans (Christopher Walken) who is devoted to his wife to Jesus and to ascots. Business is good for Billy and Hans until the day they make the mistake of kidnapping a shih tzu belonging to Charlie (Woody Harrelson) a crime boss who definitely qualifies as one of the films title characters. The plot just scratches the surface of whats going on here I havent even mentioned Tom Waits as a reformed serial killer of serial killers or Billys and Hans contributions to Martys unfinished screenplay or the masked murderer running around Los Angeles who leaves a Jack of Diamonds in his victims hands. ""Seven Psychopaths"" juggles all these threads and more along with inside jokes about filmmaking. (Hans tells Marty his female characters are underdeveloped a charge that could be aimed at McDonagh.) And while the film-within-a-film stuff never becomes overly precious the constant reminders that Billy and Hans are characters in a movie -- or at least they will be when Marty finally finishes his script thats at least partly based on them -- eventually leave the audience feeling distanced from the material. We cared about the gangsters in ""In Bruges"" because they both lived up to and defied stereotypes about movie criminals; the characters here do the same thing but because of the ongoing discussion about movies and screenwriting they become smaller than life and not larger. Even so McDonagh has assembled a cast that really knows its way around lines like ""The Spanish have bullfighting the French have cheese and the Irish have alcoholism"" and ""Youre the one who was so interested in psychopaths; they get kind of tiresome after a while."" Farrell is essentially the slow-burning straight man here but he does it well enough to give Jason Bateman an exasperated run for his money. Rockwells mania seems more focused and in control than usual but its Walken who really shines. The actor has often said that he removes the punctuation from his scripts before reading them and Walkens performance here feels more comma-free than anything hes done in ages. Its the kind of work that reminds you why you love what this actor does. (There are plenty of famous faces who pop in briefly to do strange and funny things; try to avoid finding out who they are before you enter the theater.) If the movie ""Seven Psychopaths"" hadnt spent so much time being about a guy writing a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths"" the results might have been better. But even if the snake winds up swallowing its own tail its a jolting spectacle youll want to keep watching. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Seven Psychopaths Smart Violent Crazy Fun Martin McDonagh convenes a killer cast for his shaggy Shih Tzu crime comedy By Richard Corliss Oct. 11 2012 Share Read Later CBS Films Seven Psychopaths Year 2012 Director Martin McDonagh Studio CBS Films Actors Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken Tom Waits Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Two killers (Boardwalk Empires Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg) are debating the niceties of their next job -- whether or not their victim should be shot in the eyeball -- when a third figure dressed in a Mexican wrestling mask walks up and BLAM blows them both away. This is the opening scene of Martin McDonaghs second feature (after the 2008 In Bruges) about lowlife characters unfortunate enough to encounter murderers even more deranged than they. Its an old-fashioned John Huston caper film extended to sulfurous comedy -- from Beat the Devil to Meet the Devil. Since its world premiere in the Midnight Madness section of last months Toronto Film Festival Seven Psychopaths has acquired a cult patina not just from its own trailer but also from an all-feline parody for a film called Seven Psychocats. That one might convince the 42-year-old McDonagh hed finally made the big time. An award-winning playwright since his mid-twenties with his 1996 The Beauty Queen of Leenane he turned to the stage only after studios had rejected all his film scripts. In 1998 for a TIME story called ""When OCasey Met Scorsese"" he told our theater critic Richard Zoglin ""I want to write plays ... that a film fan would be interested in seeing like the new De Niro movie."" (READ Richard Zoglins profile of Martin McDonagh by subscribing to TIME) Instead in Seven Psychopaths he assembles a killer cast of Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken and many other weird worthies for a Tarantinish crime comedy full of McDonaghs trademark quirky-menacing stage conversation (""Talking?"" Rockwell says in annoyed astonishment; ""What is this a f--ing French movie?"") and to pursue the authors favorite truism that life is even stranger funnier and more painful than death. McDonaghs plays -- most of them set in his ancestral Galway and dealing with family animosities that escalate to Armageddon level -- dont exactly mix the horrifying and the hilarious; they are both at once evoking laughs that might be gasps. Except for A Behanding in Spokane whose main character did lose an extremity when hooligans tied it to a roailroad track and let a train sever it McDonaghs plays tend to be remembered not by their titles but by their graphic incidents. A Skull in Connemara is the one about the corpse with a gashed cranium; The Pillowman is the one about the fairy tales that inspire a child molester; The Lieutenant of Inishmore is the one with the dead cat (not a psychocat) and buckets of stage blood. For his movies McDonagh has broadened the thematic focus from quarreling relatives to working stiffs -- thugs that is whose business is to turn suspects into stiffs -- who form their own kind of dysfunctional family. That was the story of In Bruges a tale of two killers (Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) on a Belgian holiday in Hell. The new film the script for which McDonagh wrote seven years ago could be In Bruges gone meta more and more bizarre characters in a movie that doubles back comments on and makes fun of itself. (READ Jumana Faroukys chat with McDonagh in Bruges) The one relative innocent in this L.A. vulture vita is Marty (Farrell) a screenwriter who has come up with the title for a movie -- Seven Psychopaths -- but no story. His actor pal Billy (Rockwell) helpfully places a want-ad calling on people who consider themselves psychopaths. That summons unusual visions of killers one Amish one a Buddhist monk and the third Tom Waits petting a rabbit. Billy might also qualify. A hot-tempered type with a streak of inane self-justification he says of one assault ""I didnt want to break his nose. His nose just happened to be in the middle of where I was punching."" Between acting jobs which is always Billy runs a scam with the older Hans (Walken) to steal the dogs of rich people and return them for reward money. Their mistake comes in filching a Shih Tzu named Bonnie from a gangster named Charlie (Harrelson) who loves only two things his pet and killing the people who steal it. Billy and Hans should have realized the seriousness of their dognapping when they read Bonnies dog tag ""Return to Charles Castello or you will f--ing die."" (READ Corliss on Woody Harrelson in Rampart) At one point the frazzled Marty asks ""Whatre we gonna do?"" and Billy and Hans chip in ""We could take on all the bad guys... maybe in a desert."" No Marty says ""What do you think we should do in real life?"" Of course this isnt real life; its a movie as the screenwriter doesnt know but the actor does. At first viewers may find it hard to tell whether the movie is winking at them or closing one eye for a better fatal aim at its victims in the theater. But as say Hans describes a movie scene that is soon played out on screen it should be clear that the filmmaker the actors and the characters -- the audience too -- are all meant to be in on the same rich joke. Offering dark fun under the broiling California sun the movie is essentially the fanciful autobiography of any writer stuck at the onset of the creative process. McDonaghs solution was to let the macho side of his imagination run amok and to enlist favorite colleagues (Farrell from In Bruges Rockwell and Walken from the Broadway version of A Behanding in Spokane) to gallop along with him. Any actors with a free day or two -- Waits Harry Dean Stanton Olga Kurylenko Zeljko Ivanek Abbie Cornish Gabourey Sidibe plus Pitt and Stuhlbarg -- were welcome to join this raffish caper.

"Seven Psychopaths review A crazy film about crazy men | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSeven Psychopaths review A crazy film about crazy menThe really crazy thing about Seven Psychopaths is how much sense it makes in a weird sort of way. And how much fun it has while doing so.A menacing Woody Harrelson and a deadpan Christopher Walken in Seven Psychopaths  (Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 11 2012Seven Psychopaths (out of 4)Starring Christopher Walken Colin Farrell Woody Harrelson Sam Rockwell Tom Waits and Abbie Cornish. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh. 109 minutes. Opens Oct. 12 at major theatres. 18AThe really crazy thing about Seven Psychopaths is how much sense it makes in a weird sort of way. And how much fun it has while doing so.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) and his eager star conscripts have made a crazy and violent film to mock crazy and violent films. Its like making a Looney Tunes cartoon about Looney Tunes cartoons.Article Continued Below Related Cast interview from TIFF It begins with a bloody Quentin Tarantino homage thats really intended to show how Seven Psychopaths wont be yet another Tarantino knockoff. It ends with a kooky Coen Bros.-style finale in the desert replete with a score by Carter Burwell that goes further than the Coens ever would.In between are shout-outs to Guy Ritchie Martin Scorsese Takeshi Kitano and more amid scatter shots of bullets and profanity. It may seem McDonagh is copying every filmmaker who has ever put con to camera.The Irish playwright-turned-director is really exploring his own ambivalence about the many hard men hes brought to stage and screen. Hes also comically demonstrating how tough it is to come up with an original gangster story.This latter problem faces his surrogate character Marty (Colin Farrell) an alcoholic Irish screenwriter living in Las Angeles. His agent is bugging him for a promised script for a gangster film but all Marty has is a title that suggests the intended screen splatter Seven Psychopaths. The last thing he wants to write is ""just one more film about guys with guns in their hands.""Marty is desperate but his unemployed actor pal Billy (Sam Rockwell agreeably manic) is inventive. Billy puts an ad in L.A. Weekly asking any interested psychos to drop by to offer inspiration. Along comes a weird dude named Zachariah (Tom Waits) who carries a white rabbit and who claims to be a serial killer of serial killers.This is all very amusing and possibly apocryphal but we aint seen nothing yet. Billy earns bucks as a dognapper teaming with a mild man in a cravat named Hans (Christopher Walken delightfully deadpan). They abduct the dogs of rich Angelenos and then pocket the reward money. God-fearing Hans at least has a noble excuse hes raising money to pay for cancer treatment for his ailing wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay).Then Billy and Hans nab the cuddly Shih Tzu of homicidal gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who shoot firsts and also shoots while asking questions later. Charlie is nuts -- Harrelson plays him at his bug-eyed best -- but maybe not as loco as a real psychopath named Jack O Diamonds who wears a red ski mask and indiscriminately shoots criminals in the head. It quickly becomes apparent that Seven Psychopaths isnt so much a movie as a meta-movie. There are frequent interludes into fantasy as both Marty and Billy conjure up increasingly wild psycho scenarios.Sometimes these scenarios are better than whats happening in the ""real"" action on screen as when a vengeful Quaker played by Harry Dean Stanton stalks the murderer of his daughter. The tone of the picture wanders from simple slapstick to complex satire and from romantic drama to near horror. As an on-screen ticker counts down the psychopaths sometimes it all gets a bit much as Hans observes ""They get kinda tiresome after a while dont they?""The film also makes note of how few good roles there are for women in films like this while at the same time treating its female characters -- who also include Abbie Cornish Gabourey Sidibe and Olga Kurylenko -- as mere cameos. Clays tough Myra is the sole woman to make her presence felt.As for the men the yin-yang of idiot savant Billys violent film fantasies and righteous Hans determined pacifism best illustrate McDonaghs interior struggle over giving good pen to bad men.But he sees the humour in his misgivings. Such as when a thug turns a shotgun on Hans on a desert road and tells him to put his hands up. Hans refuses saying he doesnt feel like it.""That doesnt make sense"" the puzzled thug says.""Too bad"" Hans replies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Seven Psychopaths Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies McDonagh sets violently funny Seven Psychopaths in epic desert  Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 films you should check out opening this fall. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Brutal and often very funny ""Seven Psychopaths"" is writer-director Martin McDonaghs answer to ""Barton Fink"" a crimson yarn that like that Coen brothers film imagines what happens in a worst-case-scenario when a Hollywood scribe comes down with writers block.Unlike a worthy audience-pleaser such as ""Argo"" which can be recommended to almost anyone you know and many people you dont McDonaghs splattery jape is more of a ... specialty item lets say. But as with ""In Bruges"" the playwright and filmmakers previous feature McDonaghs story -- set in Hollywood the land of sunshine development deals and nervous envy that crawls like a vine up a trellis -- actually gives its killers interesting things to say en route to the next rendezvous with destiny. Colin Farrell plays Marty the authorial stand-in. Tense preoccupied an alcoholic and a B-minus boyfriend (Abbie Cornish plays his squeeze) Marty already has blown past his deadline to turn in a screenplay titled promisingly ""Seven Psychopaths."" His unemployed actor friend Billy played with delightful worminess by Sam Rockwell is Martys biggest fan. He wants to collaborate with him in fact. Martys not so sure.Along with his pal Hans (Christopher Walken) Billy makes a kind of living kidnapping dogs and collecting reward money upon return. Then fatefully they take the wrong dog a shih tzu belonging to a murderous gangster (Woody Harrelson who replaced Mickey Rourke early in the project). He is one of several genuine psychos who give Marty something to write about. The hard way. McDonaghs characters may be awful or simply lost but theyre all addicted to the art of the tall tale and the dark allure of the nightmarish bedtime story. Part of the enjoyment in ""Seven Psychopaths"" is seeing everyones stories real or imagined spill out onto the screen. When Tom Waits marvelously droll enters the piece as a particularly focused brand of serial killer (a serial killer of serial killers in fact) McDonagh folds illustrative flashbacks inside the main narrative. (McDonaghs play ""The Pillowman"" worked from a similar strategy turning the stage over to depictions of various fairy tales.) ""Seven Psychopaths"" opens with a couple of prime supporting players Michael Stuhlbarg (the lead in the Coens ""A Serious Man"" and a ""Pillowman"" Broadway alum) and Michael Pitt as hired killers waiting atop a reservoir to eliminate their target. Their banter kills time amusingly. Then the real killing begins and in a matter of a second ends. Its swift and horrible and by definition a sight gag of the bloodiest sort.As Marty gets sucked deeper and deeper into trouble created or simply found by well-meaning Billy the film crisscrosses LA and then ventures out into the desert east of LA into Joshua Tree National Park. McDonagh like so many other writer-directors is in love with the fable of the Old West the prospects of frontier justice. Just when most movies would tighten the screws and deliver routine thrills ""Seven Psychopaths"" unwinds a little hanging out in the desert with Marty Hans and Billy as they work on the script while prepping for an outlandish showdown.The blend of black humor and sincere pathos doesnt always coalesce. Certain bits stuck in my craw particularly the way the dog-walker played by Gabourey Sidibe is treated and Im not sure about a dubious reference to the My Lai massacre. Shot on film by cinematographer Ben Davis scored with sinister ripples of doom by composer Carter Burwell McDonaghs work is defiantly two-faced about its intentions. Marty the fictionalized McDonagh yearns to write something meaningful and humane. Yet he cant help it His impulses run the other direction. And hes saddled with that tantalizing title the promise of which he must fulfill.McDonagh has the same yearning. The result is a clever violent daydream. But McDonaghs skill behind the camera has grown considerably since ""In Bruges."" And the way he writes hes able to attract the ideal actors into his garden of psychopathology. mjphillipstribune.comSeven Psychopaths -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence bloody images pervasive language sexuality/nudity and some drug use)Running time 149Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Seven Psychopaths (movie) In Bruges (movie) Sam Rockwell Michael Pitt A Serious Man (movie) Ethan Coen Argo Five movies to see at Chicago International Film Festival Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1009-seven-psychopaths-20121011,0,6121240.column",200,sevenpsychopaths29,sevenpsychopaths,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Seven Psychopaths features psychopaths aplenty but any other expectations raised by its ready-for-the-drive-in title should probably be left behind. The second feature from Irish playwright/filmmaker Martin McDonagh stars Colin Farrell as an Irish screenwriter named Martin laboring through a haze of alcohol on a screenplay called Seven Psychopaths. Thats the start but hardly the end of the films meta touches. As the film opens Farrell has little more than the title and a life that by apparent coincidence has decided to start feeding him inspiration. Theres one obvious psychopath in the news for instance a masked killer who seems to limit his murders to those involved with organized crime. Hungry for inspiration Farrell takes the detail and runs with it on the page as far as it will go. Turns out it isnt far enough but happily at least for his screenplay his life is on the verge of several more inspiring twists and turns. It doesnt hurt when Farrells best friend (Sam Rockwell) places an ad for psychopaths in the local paper or when Rockwell and partner Christopher Walken decide to kidnap a Shih Tzu belonging to a hot-tempered mob boss (Woody Harrelson) as part of an ongoing scam to collect money from rich dog owners. More convolutions follow but for all the films narrative contortions it isnt really about the plot. Or more accurately its more about the business of storytelling and all its attendant pleasures and responsibilities than the plot itself. The film pauses to spin tales within tales including a sequence with Harry Dean Stanton as a vengeful Quaker which doubles as a satisfying short film unto itself. Then after a while Seven Psychopaths pulls back in scope and comes this close to breaking the fourth wall. The characters ponder their place in the universe in ways that suggest they might understand theyre characters in a thriller heading toward the bloodbath demanded by the title of Farrells unwritten script and the movie that contains it. Not all McDonaghs ambition pays off. Some of the postmodern gestures feel like little more than games. Theres less cohesion here than in kindred-spirit films like Adaptation or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and a running commentary on movie violence comes off as a bit vague. But while Seven Psychopaths sometimes hits the philosophical shallows its pleasures still run deep. Farrell provides a frustrated foggy anchor to the madness around him a counterbalance to Rockwells loopy enthusiasm for chaos and Walkens soulful turn as a man whos seen too much violence and knows hes destined to see more. The performance is in no way a departure from past roles but it its one of the best chances Walken has gotten to be Walken in a while and he runs with it. So does McDonagh gleefully blowing up the movie even while hes making it. He doesnt leave much behind beyond a trail of blood wit and confusion but its something to see while it lasts.

Seven Psychopaths Good Director Martin McDonagh. Cast Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken. Rating R for strong violence bloody images pervasive language sexuality/nudity and some drug use. Not everyone will agree but that is one approach to making a successful movie one that ""Seven Psychopaths"" takes to the hilt and maybe a little beyond. Martin McDonaghs film is maybe not as clever as ""In Bruges"" his last effort and fans of his stage work will probably decry all the meta movie details. Egad he may be trying to make a popular hit. But a crass sell out? Hardly. Instead ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a dark dark lark bolstered by a crazy-and-proud-of-it performance by Sam Rockwell which is balanced by a controlled one from Colin Farrell. Throw in Christopher Walken somewhere in between and youve got a delightfully nuts compulsively watchable film. Woody Harrelson and Tom Waits as a psychopathic gangster and a serial killer of serial killers are just gravy. Its all brutal good fun with laughs scattered generously throughout the bloodshed. We know what were in for from the start as two hired killers in Los Angeles wait for their target while discussing the niceties of shooting someone in the eye. (The numerous talky violent nods to Tarantino are doubtless intentional.) A rude surprise awaits them The arrival of a figure in a ski mask who shoots them in the head leaving behind his calling card the Jack of Diamonds. Segue to Marty (Farrell) an alcoholic screenwriter who has the name of his next film ""Seven Psychopaths"" and not much else. A newspaper brief about the Jack of Diamonds who evidently kills only bad guys gives him at least the hint of an idea which is more than hes had. His best friend and would-be actor Billy (Sam Rockwell) is also eager to contribute though Martys not excited about that prospect. Billy earns a living through a dognapping ring he runs with Hans (Walken). Billy nabs the dogs they wait for a reward to be offered and Hans returns them. Its a nice little scam until they steal Bonny a shih tzu belonging to Charlie Costello (Harrelson) a sadistic gangster with little regard for anything or anyone. Except Bonny. Violent misadventures follow bloody scenes stitched together by the thread of Marty and Billys developing screenplay which either reflects whats happening around them or vice versa. Billy puts an ad in L.A. Weekly looking for chatty psychopaths and Tom Waits toting a bunny he never lets go of arrives to regale them with tales of hunting down serial killers with his former wife (Amanda Warren). There is a story about a Quaker (Harry Dean Stanton) who stalks in as low-key a way as possible his daughters killer. Meanwhile Hans tends to his hospitalized wife (Linda Bright Clay). There is also a show-stopping shoot-out scene set in a cemetery concocted by Billy as a potential ending over-the-top B-movie stuff incorporating gangster movies bad horror and who knows what else. A real-life climax set in Joshua Tree National Park while pretty to look at cant help but be a letdown after that. But by then youre hooked. (McDonagh engages in some self-referential business throughout the film with his screenwriters decrying various filmmaking shortcomings even as the movie engages in them.) Rockwell and Walken in particular are infectious really fun to watch. ""Seven Psychopaths"" may not be McDonaghs best film but with all its crazy bells and whistles it sure is an entertaining one.

And way more demented.Men in movies are often just overgrown boys and Seven Psychopaths ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide) is out to prove it -- in the most twisted hilarious way possible.Its a devilishly smart film that not only sends up the hipster crime genre but also makes a powerful statement about violence -- in a brilliantly satirical way.Think Pulp Fiction with more laughs and cartoonish violence crossed with an edgier Oceans Elevenand touches of The Usual Suspects and Smokin Aces. Then add a choice cast of actors as unhinged characters who could easily be 10-year-old boys -- if those boys were also mental cases.WLOSZCZYNA  On the couch with the Psychopaths gangMORE The dog who kidnapped Walkens heartVIDEO Walken reigns at Psycho premiereMartin (Colin Farrell) is a boozy writer with the bare outlines for a screenplay called Seven Psychopaths. His best buddy Billy (Sam Rockwell) wants to help his friend. He proposes assisting with the writing but what he really does is far more effective -- if completely whacked out.Christopher Walken plays Hans an older gent who deeply loves his critically ill wife (Linda Bright Clay) and operates a shady business in which he steals dogs in order to collect the rewards. Billy is his dog-napping partner among other things. When they take Bonny the beloved Shih Tzu belonging to maniacal gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) Billy Hans and even Martin become wanted men.A few more pernicious nutcases skulk around the storys periphery. Tom Waits has a very funny turn as Zachariah half of a psycho-killing duo who only murder other psycho killers. He shows up on Martins doorstep gently cradling a cuddly white bunny.Walken has never been funnier his eccentric delivery consistently comical. Farrell is the perfect straight man. Harrelson and Rockwell go way over the top -- in a way that works ideally in this bonkers set-up.Writer-director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright/filmmaker known for his verbose dark comedies. His distinctive turns of phrases and rapid-fire dialogue add heft to a story that ultimately doesnt quite come together. But its so fun getting there that its hard to care about the denouement.Seven Psychopaths delves into the writers struggle between wanting to create something meaningful and spiritually redemptive and indulging in darker impulses. This plays out in the sagas of a vengeful Vietnamese monk (Long Nguyen) and a grief-addled Quaker (Harry Dean Stanton).McDonagh has said his cinematic influences are directors Terrence Malick and Sam Peckinpah and he seems to be exploring the fusion of those radically different sensibilities. But when not exploring that complex territory hes a whiz at bizarrely funny quotable lines When offered a drink Walken declines saying ""I take peyote.""Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Billy (Sam Rockwell) Hans (Christopher Walken) and Marty (Colin Farrell) debate the wisdom of Gandhi as it relates to their current predicament.

On one hand McDonaghs move into the American mainstream and his follow-up to the Oscar-nominated international hit ""In Bruges"" is admirably ambitious and brushes close to greatness at times. Both a movie about the movies and an L.A. crime thriller in the postmodern Tarantino tradition (forgive me for that phrase if you can) ""Seven Psychopaths"" is loaded with scabrous funny McDonagh dialogue and arguably overloaded with offbeat performances by terrific character actors Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken Woody Harrelson and a little shih tzu named Bonny.But having seen the movie and quite enjoyed it I cant shake the feeling that I wish ""Seven Psychopaths"" were something more than it is or to be more precise were a different kind of thing altogether. Already one of the most accomplished contemporary dramatists (his acclaimed plays include ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane"" and ""The Pillowman"") McDonagh has taken on the movies with a passion and here appears to be pursuing a Great White Whale Im not sure is worth harpooning. This is a comic fable about an Irishman in Hollywood written and directed by an Irishman who has evidently spent a good deal of time in Hollywood. (Although McDonagh was born and raised in England he has always identified as an Irish writer.) Its a self-regarding screenplay about screenwriting more than a little bit influenced by Charlie Kaufmans ""Adaptation"" and its an attempt to create a classic American crime film and also to subvert the cliches of that genre to other purposes. Personally Im receptive to all those things but ""Seven Psychopaths"" winds up getting snarled in its competing and overlapping agendas and falling over.Like ""In Bruges"" this film veers from grotesque violence to tender even understated emotion and conceals a level of apparently genuine spiritual or religious questioning beneath its purposefully ludicrous surface. Marty Faranan (Farrell) the nominal protagonist of ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an Irish writer in L.A. struggling with worsening alcoholism a failing relationship and an idea for a big new movie that hasnt gotten much further than the title ""Seven Psychopaths."" While Martys a more intelligent guy than the lunkhead London-Irish gangster Farrell played in ""In Bruges"" that admittedly isnt saying much and hes suffering from a similarly half-baked moral and existential crisis. Marty keeps telling his deadbeat best friend Billy (Rockwell) that he wants to write a ""Buddhist"" thriller one that would end not in violence but with the characters in the wilderness talking things out. Thats a gag of course and Billy scoffs at him - ""Why dont you call your movie Seven Lesbians?"" - but to some extent McDonagh has written that kind of movie alongside the more conventional one that ends in death and bloodshed.You may have noticed that Ive gotten almost halfway through this review without even mentioning the story of the seven so-called psychopaths which either Marty is writing or the world is writing around him or something. Thats because plot is a superficial element in this film and in McDonaghs work overall; its a tool he uses to pull the audience along to the things that really interest him which are language colorful anecdote and moral paradox more or less in that order. One of the films central gags is that Marty is the supposed sophisticate writing about crime and depravity who has no understanding of the genuine craziness around him including the fact that Billy and his dapper elderly pal Hans (Walken) are a pair of lowlife con men who kidnap dogs and then sell them back to their owners for the reward money. When they take possession of the aforementioned shih tzu who belongs to a hot-tempered mob boss named Charlie (Harrelson heavily tattooed and covered in bling) the cycle of violent retribution required of this kind of movie can swing into action. You Might Also Like But the story of Charlie and the dog and the various people who get wasted on the way to a philosophical discussion cum peyote freakout cum showdown in Joshua Tree National Monument is I think intentionally ridiculous and even self-undercutting. This movie really is something like a postmodern literary novel -- writing about writing -- masquerading as a shoot-em-up and the most memorable moments involve the imagined borrowed or stolen pieces of story that Marty folds into his screenplay (which both is and is not the movie were watching). There are not one but two serial killers in this movie (at least) One is the Jack of Diamonds a masked figure who roams L.A. bumping off Mafia henchmen (in the movies prologue we see Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg as a pair of Tarantino-esque gunmen meeting their sudden and unexpected demise). The second one is even more meta involving a craggy rabbit fancier named Zachariah (growly music legend Tom Waits) who recounts to Marty his youthful exploits as half of an interracial couple who traveled the country wiping out other serial killers. (At last we know what happened to San Franciscos famous Zodiac.)Thats without even getting into the story of a reformed murderer who is followed into the depths of hell by a vengeful Quaker dad (played by Harry Dean Stanton) or the even more outlandish tale of a former Viet Cong guerrilla turned Catholic priest (and/or Buddhist monk) who comes to America to wreak vengeance on our nation reverse-Rambo-style. Its impossible not to admire the layer-cake complexity and prodigious imagination at work in ""Seven Psychopaths"" but for me its also impossible to avoid the sense that McDonagh is fighting against himself every step of the way and that the point of the whole exercise is elusive. Hes too smart and too tormented to write a straightforward crime farce and at the same time hes desperate to bring the laughs and the action and avoid the art-house ghetto. Its too many masters to serve and I have the feeling that ""Seven Psychopaths"" wont be fully satisfying to anybody. Mind you the film has moments of real brilliance and pathos; flawed as it is ""Seven Psychopaths"" isnt like anything else youll see this year or any other. For me the strongest elements dont derive from all the lurid meta-narrative detail but Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell who infuse a pair of essentially pathetic losers with surprising dignity and humanity. If Rockwells Billy seems at first like an over-the-top dumbass Walken gives one of the most restrained mysterious and thoroughly magnificent performances of his long career as the brokenhearted cravat-wearing Hans. In this thoroughgoing indictment of the corrosive carnivorous nature of writing these guys are willing to die on behalf of a movie that might offer the transcendence they yearn for.

Garbage comes in all sizes and every one of them seems to fit into a load of violent hateful and incomprehensible trash called Seven Psychopaths. Written by talented Irish playwright Martin McDonagh who shocked Broadway audiences with dark funny gothic creepshows like The Beauty Queen of Leenane The Cripple of Inishmaan and A Behanding in Spokanethis movie is proof that moving to Hollywood is poisonous Kool-Aid to the creative process. Kneeling at the trough of Hollywood pop psychobabble that has come to symbolize the New Cinema Mr. McDonagh seems to have taken leave (temporarily I hope) of his senses. He proved in 2008 with a brooding job called In Bruges about hit men on holiday in Belgium that he cannot stretch his bristling ideas into one full-length feature. Unfortunately he also thinks hes a director--a job for which he shows no patience aptitude or proficiency. The result is a twitching convulsion of vicious drivel passing itself off as a movie which can be best appreciated by the kind of people who dig Showgirls the Saw franchise and Spike Jonze-Charlie Kaufman flicks. For starters the title means nothing. Dont even try to count the number of psychopaths who bang around from scene to scene without reason or rhyme. Colin Farrell a fellow Irishman who bonded with Mr. McDonagh on the In Bruges shoot plays Marty a drunken Hollywood screenwriter who has lost his inspiration in the middle of a numbskull morality tale (called Seven Psychopaths natch) about a serial killer who longs for love murder and world peace. His best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) an actor who cant get a job in the movies because he keeps punching out the directors is determined to help Marty finish his script at all costs including a few massacres of his own. The first thing he does is introduce his hapless pal to his partner in crime an aging Polish loser (Christopher Walken looking like 10 miles of broken asphalt painted green) with a dying wife who cooks up a scheme to steal dogs then return them to their desperate owners to collect the rewards. The blocked writer finally gets a glimmer of the Real McCoy when the dognapper makes the mistake of stealing a fluffy yappy sissy Shih Tzu named Bonny (played by a real Shih Tzu named Bonny) that belongs to a macho gangster (Woody Harrelson). The effeminate but brutal thug goes viral and tracks down the Polish thief and everyone he knows beginning with his terminally ill wife whom he exterminates in the cancer ward. Thanks to a plot that backfires and a newspaper ad that Billy places inviting closeted psychopaths to come forward and be interviewed Marty the ill-fated scribe is suddenly up to his inkjet printer cartridges in real serial killers including Tom Waits who is not much better as an actor than he is as a tone-deaf musician (except he mercifully does not sing out of tune this time) as a maniac who ties his victims to a table and chops them up with a meat cleaver while a white rabbit licks up the blood then pours gasoline on the corpses and sets them on fire. You sit there trying to figure out whats going on before you finally realize theyre making it up as they go along. As they act out their different versions of events in the unfinished screenplay the movie is making it up too. Suddenly the entire cast is busy slaughtering each other as the screen is crowded to capacity with psycho killers and more psycho-killing psycho killers including a pair of homicidal maniac lovebirds a razor-slashing Quaker and a Viet Cong killer disguised as a priest seeking revenge against America. They all end up in Joshua Tree National Park in a blazing shootout that leaves almost everyone dead except the delusional writer whose finished screenplay might be on its way to an Oscar. Ive never seen such a colossal waste of talent. The acting is so bad in this picture that even the quirky inventive Sam Rockwell cant save it. The pulpy Quentin Tarantino-style dialogue mixes Little Caesar with Grand Guignol to no effect the camerawork is garish the pacing ludicrously twisted the bloodshed gratuitous. The women in the film (Abbie Cornish Olga Kurylenko and Gabourey Sidibe from Precious) are underdeveloped to the status of walk-ons. The direction has a scattered buckshot effect which may be trendy but is not meant as a recommendation. At the recent Toronto International Film Festival where it premiered in a sidebar event called Midnight Madness one wag informed me that Seven Psychopaths is actually a comedy with a potential cult following and that I just dont get it. Whatever. This time ignorance is bliss but to me the movie is genuinely humor-resistant. Any cult it develops will be chewing gum and wearing Halloween costumes. rreedobserver.com SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS Running Time 109 minutes Written and Directed by  Martin McDonagh Starring Colin Farrell Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell 0/4 Comment Filed under Christopher Walken Colin Farrell Martin McDonagh movie Movie Review Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://observer.com/2012/10/seven-psychopaths-rex-reed-martin-mcdonagh-colin-farrell/,200,sevenpsychopaths36,sevenpsychopaths,com/2012/10/seven-psychopaths-rex-reed-martin-mcdonagh-colin-farrell/

Fortunately hes friends with Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) two nutcases who steal dogs for a living and who also have some bloodletting tendencies that may just give Marty the inspirational push he needs. Thats two psychopaths for you and there are plenty more where they came from. This violent vicious frequently hilarious second feature from In Brugess Martin McDonagh is sure to be pegged as a Tarantino knockoff for its self-aware brutality and profanely verbose characters; guest stars Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt start us off with a gut-bustingly vulgar discussion beneath the Hollywood sign that climaxes with metallic slugs to the head. At worst the film earns our dismissive scorn for its knowingly smug treatment of buxom bullet-bait played by Olga Kurylenko and Abbie Cornish. Yet theres also a uniquely affecting spiritual component to McDonaghs work something he explores here via two sublimely ridiculous stories-within-the-story about a razor-wielding Quaker and a vengeful Vietnamese monk. It likewise helps that the writer-director has assembled such a stellar cast that paves over most of the rough patches. Walken is particularly alive in a way hes rarely been since Catch Me if You Can adding untold shades to Hanss mystery-shrouded past--wait until you see whats under his cravat--while still giving his singularly eccentric line readings (""Fuck tha cops...

Maybe you believe its no longer possible to be pleasurably jolted by inventive swearing from-no-place head shots and post-everything structural flourishes. Certainly you have no reason to expect blood-splattered poetry or throat-clearing laughter from yet another movie in which Los Angeles criminals set out to the desert for showdowns and the usual exploding cars. Thats all the more reason to savor Seven Psychopaths the movie in which Martin McDonagh the scabrous playwright and Martin McDonagh the high-end junk filmmaker at last craft a doozy both can brag about to their mates.Thats mates in the sense of laddish buddies as thats who the movie is about and much of whom it is for. McDonagh contrives to have his hero an Irish screenwriter with the ""get it?"" name Marty (Colin Farrell) soundly dressed down for his inability to write women who arent just there to be murdered to spur the plot. That complaint is certainly true of Seven Psychopaths and his joking about it is an old rogues trick Admitting to rakish behavior before someone else can make a stink about it purchases leniency for future offenses.So yes this is boys stuff. A screenwriter and his somewhat-touched actor bud (Sam Rockwell in stoned-Dana Carvey mode) shake L.A. to find seven stories from seven psychopaths to fill out a screenplay Marty has named--just guess--but hasnt written. A dog-napping Christopher Walken gets in bad with raging gangster Woody Harrelson and eventually does the one last great thing you cant believe no other movie has ever thought to have Walken do drop peyote at Joshua Tree. (Tip for your offices Walken impersonator He calls the drugs ""howl-loose-sen-ah-gens."") Tom Waits shows up first as a sight gag and then as a menacing monologuist his voice box grinding like the gears of a 72 Imperial. There are flashbacks to absurd crime sprees fabulist tales of murderers who might or might not make the in-film screenplay a serial killer on the loose and more sawn-open corpses than in a good Fangoria.Film Details Seven Psychopaths RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time109 More Info Trailer And theres an air of pub-culture bad-boy-ism about it all as McDonagh for the first time setting his madmen in America refuses to heed the local niceties about race or gayness. Walkens complex bastard even half-apologizes for throwing around ""fag"" as a catchall insult for men who arent movie-style manly but like the apologia about the female characters tendency to get popped this feels less like an effort to satirize douchiness than one to suggest that we just roll along with it.But as boys stuff goes this is the best of it even in the films less-daring first half which plays as a high-stakes crime film whose central incident--the napping of Harrelsons dog--is flagrantly meaningless. Its dark splattery fun and then sometimes its suddenly just dark and splattery. At its best McDonagh--whose directing is finally approaching his writing--pushes us into the most perverse of responses. Ive never before heard an audience applaud a throat-slitting suicide.Just as that story seems to be reaching its climax though McDonagh lunges for something more. Marty who has often expressed a desire not to write violent piffle about killers sees where everything is going both with his fictional script and with the real movie hes caught up in. He vows to come up with a new ending that suits his burgeoning pacifism. From there he and two of the movies other top-shelf male leads flee L.A. and attempt to avoid the ending we all know a movie like Seven Psychopaths must have. In the desert the film opens up becoming thoughtful expansive and more funny than ever something like Pirandello or Daffy Ducks Duck Amuck but without ever smashing fully into addressing-the-author meta-fiction. Then theres the biggest surprise of all McDonagh still manages to pull off an ending that should satisfy fans of the first halfs gory comedy fans of the seconds desert bull session and fans of those toothy never-quite-reputable plays that brought McDonagh to our attention in the first place. It even satisfies the impossible screen-writing goals Farrells Marty aspires to early in the film violent pacifist and somehow life-affirming.Remember the shitty crime comedies every Hollywood brat tried to make after Pulp Fiction? It took an Irish playwright to get it right. See it with an audience.

(Photo Claire Folger/Courtesy of Warner Brothers Pictures) Ben Afflecks third thriller Argo is a marvel of cunning an irresistible blend of cool realism and Hollywood hokum. It opens with a dose of fact a female narrators sober recitation of the U.S. role in the 1953 Iranian coup that installed our best bud the shah and the coming of the Shiite revolution and the ayatollah. Noam Chomsky would nod along Its solid anti-imperialist stuff. Then comes another view a blast of what a Newsweek cover labeled Muslim Rage a mob converging on Tehrans American Embassy to rend Our People limb from limb. Affleck intercuts real footage of the 1979 takeover with expert reenactments. Were sold This is how it was. The events Argo chronicles were classified for years long enough to give the film a juicy Now It Can Be Told vibe. The title comes from an apparently risible Star Warsknockoff screenplay used as a pretext to get six Americans out of Iran. The groupfour men two womenhad slipped from the embassy and hidden in the Canadian ambassadors basement and the fear was that if discovered they wouldnt be tossed in with the hostages but die badly and publicly. Chris Terrios script makes much of CIA incompetence from the agencys confident prediction that there wouldnt be a revolution to its pitiful scenarios for the sextets escapeamong them a 300-mile bicycle trip in winter to the mountains of Turkey. Then CIA maverick Antonio Mendez (Affleck) catches a bit of a Planet of the Apes sequel on TV and hatches a scheme by which the six would leave Iran posing as a film crew on a location scoutwhat Mendezs boss (Bryan Cranston in yet another drab movie role) calls the best bad idea we have. What a mix poker-faced espionage and broad showbiz satire. John Goodman plays (real) makeup whiz John Chambers (he did the Apes pictures) who brings Mendez to (fictional) producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) a has-been with a yen to make headlines in Variety again. Goodman is a hoot and Arkin knows the right speed (fast) for Siegels Hollywood-bubble-creature patter. Arkin and Goodman have the only colorful parts though. Affleck likes to cast himself in immodestly sized leads but is careful not to be caught showboating. He and Terrio dont use the fugitives to tug on our heartstrings. Swilling red wine out of nice goblets theyre not collectively an attractive bunch although its nice to see Clea Duvall onscreen again. The credits show the actors side by side with their look-alike real-life counterparts communicating the idea that (a) the filmmakers have taken zero liberties and (b) the seventies was historys worst hair decade. But a docudrama Argo isnt. In the climax Affleck has us in the oldest of Hollywoods vises. As the Americans make their undercover way to the plane that will carry them to safety the Iranians gradually learn theyve been hoodwinked and roar off in pursuitsome of us (Im guilty) leaning forward in our chairs and chanting Go. Go. Go. Gogogogogogogogogogogo. For fucks sake go The actual escape was nothing like that but how much reality can we be expected to take? Studios can do business with a director who has such a potent combination of seriousness and shamelessness. In Seven Psychopaths and his first full-length film In Bruges Irish playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh indulges a taste for hit-men thrillers rich in genre-conscious banter and splattery violence. The debt to Tarantino is obvious but McDonaghs kicky carnage has an element of blasphemythe characters (and their creator) defying a God that will surely send them to hell. His protagonist (Colin Farrell superb) is an Irish screenwriter living in Hollywood and free-associating a psycho-killer script while around him revolve an assortment of actual psychos telling their stories the line between reality and fantasy so blurred that the blurring itself becomes the jokea brilliant one. Sam Rockwell kills as the heros loony tunes best friend deliciously abetted by Christopher Walken as an aging sad-sack dognapper. (Guest hipster psychos include Woody Harrelson Harry Dean Stanton and Tom Waits.) The trouble is that after an hour of going with the blood flow McDonagh maroons his characters in the desert and the meta turns monotonous. Seven Psychopaths doesnt jell but its enough of a crowd-pleaser to make you worried about how pleased the crowd around you is. Argo Directed by Ben Affleck. Warner Bros. R.

""Seven Psychopaths"" is a treat blending clever quips with a quirky self-aware plot device to form a delightful entertainment stew. This violent and alternately hilarious caper is part ""Adaptation"" part ""The Big Lebowski"" - and in the best possible ways. There are rare moments you feel as though a piece of cinema was made only for you so if youre a lover of quick dialogue and madcap situations youll likely feel this one came with a bow attached. Marty (Colin Farrell) is a struggling screenwriter in Los Angeles (as if theres another kind). Hes working on a project that has an absolutely killer name ""Seven Psychopaths."" Unfortunately right after the title hes become hopelessly stuck on where the plot should go. He doesnt want it to be too violent so hes planning a Buddhist psychopath and hes considering just making the third act a couple of friends talking around a campfire. His best pal Billy (Sam Rockwell) considers it his duty to get Marty writing again and hes extremely concerned with the peaceful direction the plot is headed. Did I mention that Billy and his pal Hans (Christopher Walken) have a lucrative side business involving dog-napping? Well sure why wouldnt they? These canine robbers simply grab a pooch and wait for the reward sign to be posted. This plot aside was effective enough that Ive installed 24/7 security for my Puggle. Okay so youve gotten the gist a screenwriter and a couple of grifters now enter the bad man for optimal silliness levels. Charlie (Woody Harrelson) is the type of gangster you often see in film well dressed and with an attitude. Hes got a crew and a propensity for violence in his decision-making process. As fate would have it Charlie and his thugs become intertwined with Marty Billy and Hans which leads to plenty of laughs ... as well as buckets full of blood. Charlie doesnt like being messed with but Billy and Hans unknowingly mess with just about everyone they come across. Anger meet target. Its like a meet-cute but with bullets. Where do ""Adaptation"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" figure in? Writer/director Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"") has put together a film full of self-referential moments. For instance Hans (Walken) will opine about what makes a great script or story often in direct correlation with the action concurrently transpiring on-screen. Martys neurosis around writing scripts plays out in the actual script ... as hes writing the fake script. In other words the joke is the joke inside the joke to the point where your laughter is as nervous as it is authentic. Its one of those times where youre so off-kilter in a film that youre grateful because its clear theres no good way to end the proceedings or even to keep up any semblance of momentum. Yet ""Seven Psychopaths"" does keep the pedal to the metal channeling Vonneguts ""Harrison Bergeron"" dance in rising far above its intended station leaving logic gasping far behind. Its a beautiful thing. If you liked ""In Bruges"" you should have a wonderful time here too. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a lively effort refusing to bend to any sort of narrative expectations. Which makes it just about perfect especially if your intended goal is comedy and bemusement. What Im getting at is this if youve got mirth on the mind look no further. ""Seven Psychopaths"" delivers with style.

TWITTER Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken sign up for Grand Guignol bloodshed in Martin McDonaghs comic inversion of guys-with-gun movies. TORONTO - Say what you will about Martin McDonagh the Irish playwright-turned-screenwriter-director. Its true he might have lingered too long at the vintage Quentin Tarantino party celebrating outlandish hyper-violence and obsessive pop-cultural awareness. But the guy writes killer dialogue and spiky characters throwing them together in amusingly baroque ways. He also attracts first-rate talent which means that while its way behind the Pulp Fiction curve Seven Psychopaths can be terrifically entertaining. McDonaghs second feature isnt as tightly plotted or as distinctive in its setting as his 2008 debut In Bruges nor is it as thematically expansive or propelled by sheer storytelling brio as his best plays among them The Beauty Queen of Leenane The Cripple of Inishmaan and The Pillowman. But what saves it from being merely a show-offy wheel-spinning exercise is the films possibly candid acknowledgement of the woes of writers block and the challenges of reinventing the crime genre even in this meta age. Colin Farrell plays Marty an Irish screenwriter in Hollywood and a functioning alcoholic who has the title of his next movie Seven Psychopaths but hasnt gotten beyond EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETCORNER. DAY. He gets a glimmer of inspiration from a news item on the so-called Jack of Diamonds killer. That mystery figure is glimpsed in action in the opening scene in which two hitmen (Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg) are busy defining overkill beneath the Hollywood sign when an assassin in a ski mask strolls up from behind and pops them leaving the playing card as his signature. If the name of Farrells character and the cameos of the Boardwalk Empire castmates werent an explicit enough Martin Scorsese homage McDonagh also names Martys best buddy and would-be writing collaborator Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell). At one point Billy even does a quick ""You talkin to me?""-type Taxi Driver riff. McDonagh also tips his hat to Japanese crime maestro Takeshi Kitano by showing Marty and Billy watching a scene from Violent Cop. Billy and his preternaturally Zen-like associate Hans (Christopher Walken) run a dognapping scam swiping pooches from well-heeled locals and then returning them days later to collect a reward. But they make a mistake by taking Bonny the beloved Shih Tzu of otherwise heartless L.A. gangster Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson). Charlie becomes fodder for Martys screenplay and much of the early action strings together vignettes for possible inclusion. Among them is a droll mini-noir featuring Harry Dean Stanton as a Quaker patiently stalking the killer of his daughter. Theres also a former Viet Cong soldier (Long Nguyen) plotting revenge on the American grunts who butchered his family. Responding to an LA Weekly ad placed by Billy canvassing authentic psychopath experience Tom Waits shows up with a pet bunny wistfully recalling the wife (Amanda Warren) with whom he traveled the country icing serial murderers until he lost his nerve while she was flambeing the zodiac killer. Much of this is witty pitch-black absurdism with McDonagh winking at the audience by having Marty say ""I dont want it to be one more film about guys with guns in their hands. I want it to be about love."" The writer-director also indulges in autoironic digs about the misogyny of hipster crime flicks with Hans observing that women in Martys script either do nothing or are there just to be killed off. Thats pretty much the fate of the female contingent here including Martys prickly Australian girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) who even he doesnt seem to like much; Charlies bitchslapped dogwalker (Gabourey Sidibe); Hans wife (Linda Bright Clay) undergoing breast cancer treatment; and sultry Angela (Olga Kurylenko) whos sleeping with both Charlie and Billy. To keep things equitable gays blacks and the obese cop as many slurs as women. If the overlong film slides into self-indulgence the actors keep it buoyant particularly when gonzo Billy takes the script in hand. In a bravura aria from Rockwell he cooks up an elaborate shootout finale in a B-movie graveyard. However the real faceoff unfolds among the cacti in Joshua Tree National Park where Marty Billy and Hans have taken Bonny to hide out as Charlie closes in. As creatively bankrupt Marty Farrell is in subdued mode here his performance largely defined by the endless expressivity of his eyebrows. He serves as an excellent foil for Rockwell whose line readings continually dance between knowingness and idiocy and Walken who ventures as far into deadpan as you can go while remaining conscious. And Harrelson has fun contrasting his devotion to Bonny with his contempt for humanity. Shot by Ben Davis with a color-saturated heightened-reality look that accentuates the cartoonish nature of the violence the film is a poison-pen love letter to Los Angeles and its surrounds. It benefits in the extended denouement from Carter Burwells doleful score which is supplemented by some cool vocal choices and plays nicely against the verbal comedy. If Seven Psychopaths ultimately isnt about much beyond its larkish spirit the amount of blithe bloodletting will surely please fans of souped-up self-referential crime capers.

The best way to overcome that? Be smarter funnier and looser than the smug overwritten movies that tend to populate the ""meta-genre"" genre. In writer-director Martin McDonaghs Seven Psychopaths--his follow up to the strong but sometimes too clever In Bruges--Colin Farrell plays ""Martin"" an alcoholic screenwriter who has an idea for a script called Seven Psychopaths but who cant decide who the psychopaths should be ow what should happen. All Farrell knows is that he doesnt want this to be another blood-spattered guns-and-explosions movie. Enter Farrells actor buddy Sam Rockwell who tells him stories about some psychopaths hes heard about while hes been helping his deeply spiritual buddy Christopher Walken kidnap dogs for the reward money. Rockwell motivates Farrell even further when he takes the dog of temperamental mob boss Woody Harrelson whose subsequent hunt for the heroes sends them out to desert where they continue to collaborate on ideas for the movie. To say much more about what happens in Seven Psychopaths would rob it of some of its kick. Suffice to say that McDonagh weaves between fictional realities neatly sometimes describing in advance whats about to happen and sometimes varying the pitch. Suffice to say also that Seven Psychopaths cant consistently maintain its highest highs when the dialogue is popping and the plot is twisting. But when the movie is on its super-on. (Rockwell in particular is at his most witty and charming here.) Ultimately what makes Seven Psychopaths so successful is that while McDonagh does comment to some extent on his own past work--in a self-critical way to an extent--this film isnt a thesis statement on violence in movies and it isnt smart-ass-y for its own sake. Theres a soul to these nesting and rhyming stories of ruthless killers and what motivates them to pick up their guns and knives--and in some cases gas cans.Grade A-Scotts Take After seeing three straight turgid mediocrities--Byzantium The Iceman and Jayne Mansfields Car--McDonaghs superior follow-up to In Bruges was a much-needed adrenaline shot. Like a pulp riff on Luigi Pirandellos play ""Six Characters In Search Of An Author"" the film adds layer upon layer of meta-fiction to the hilariously slight premise of a gangster chasing after the three petty dognappers who swiped his Shih Tzu. Detractors might fairly note that Seven Psychopaths is little more than a monument to its own cleverness but when youre as relentlessly clever as McDonagh a little latitude is warranted. The script is wonderfully digressive trailing off in funny monologues dramatizations and extended bits of wordplay without caring much about moving the story forward. Since Seven Psychopaths is about screenwriting and grappling with the conventions of genre filmmaking it can still go places while spinning its wheels. Though the casting is excellent overall Rockwell is the clear standout here--little things like his habit of repeating entire sentences when someone asks what he just said are a delight but he seems incapable of delivering a line without an odd mumble or piece of inflection. Only a disappointing conclusion kept my enthusiasm in check but I can tell already that I will spend my remaining years watching it to the end every time I happen to channel-flip to it.Grade B+ Source The ABCs Of DeathDirector/Country/Time Various Directors/USA/123 min.Cast Various across all 26 shorts but nobody famous.Program Midnight MadnessHeadline A Is For Anthology U is for Uneven.Scotts Take Commissioned by Drafthouse Films 26 filmmakers were each given a letter a little money and an average of about four minutes to make the horror-themed short about some manner of death or another. Like all anthologies The ABCs Of Death has winners and losers and plenty in between though the overall experience of watching so many shorts at so modest a length is palatable and fun like judging a mini-film festival. With no time to build atmosphere the film goes heavy on jokey/ironic one-joke premises leaving the few straight-up horror statements to seem like a wet blanket. The standouts here Bruno Forzani and Helene Cattet doing more experimental image-making along the lines of their gorgeous giallo homage Amer; Adam Wingard appearing on screen to puzzle out a hilarious solution to being stuck with the letter ""Q""; Xavier Gens landing a grisly statement on the tyranny of body fascism in the culture; and contest-winner Lee Hardcastle contributing a clever stop-motion bit about a little boys fears of potty training. Far more letters fail than succeed but taken in bite-sized nuggets The ABCs Of Death is easily consumed (and discarded).Grade C+ Source Arthur NewmanDirector/Country/Time Dante Ariola USA 101 min.Cast Colin Firth Emily Blunt Anne HecheProgram Special PresentationsHeadline Lost in AmericaNoels Take Theres such a strong notion at the core of director Dante Ariola and writer Becky Johnstons Arthur Newman that it becomes even more frustrating when the film follows a familiar road--something that happens within the first 10 minutes actually. Colin Firth plays a somnambulant Floridian FedEx middle-manager who buys himself a new identity fakes his own death and hits the road to become a golf pro in Terre Haute. But before he gets too far out of town Firth meets the erratic Emily Blunt who sniffs him out as a phony right away (because shes traveling under an assumed name herself) and asks if she can tag along. Soon she has him following her thrill-seeking lead breaking into houses and pretending to be the residents partly for the sexual kink of it and partly just to disappear into yet another persona for a while. Meanwhile back in Florida Firths girlfriend Anne Heche and his estranged son are wrestling with who Firth really was (or is). The strong notion here is that many people fantasize about erasing their lives and starting over as someone else in another place. But while Firth Blunt and Heche are all very good ultimately their characters are nothing more than a collection of contrived hangups and quirks explained via artificially parceled-out backstory. In other words This is a standard-issue earnest Amerindie drama where the people do as needed to serve the plot and the point even if that means they behave far more idiotically and short-sightedly than theyre meant to be.Grade C Bad 25Director/Country/Time Spike Lee USA 131 min.DocumentaryProgram Special PresentationsHeadline ShamonNoels Take At one point in Spike Lees documentary Bad 25 Quincy Jones says of Michael Jackson that what made him unique as a performer is that he controlled the technical aspects of music-making with an almost scientific precision yet he also had good instincts and could write a song within minutes or come up with something brilliant completely in the moment. Bad 25 isnt as great a documentary as it could be. It has no real structure beyond covering each song on Bad in order; and even at over two hours the movie feels rushed with some subjects (like the media backlash against Jackson in the late 80s and the mountain of never-released Bad demos) getting mentioned and the abruptly dropped. But Lee gets comments from pretty much every significant figure involved in the making of Bad--including the directors of the albums videos--and he supplements it with appreciation from modern performers who reflect on what they learned from Jackson. And given Jacksons reputation as a creepy perfectionist workhorse its good to hear people talk about how good he was at improvisation and to see examples of Jackson being soulful on stage and video sets. Theres still not enough of the Jackson that his collaborators saw and loved--hes still a little distant even in the behind-the-scenes footage--but Bad 25 does make the case for the album as more than a cultural phenomenon but a pop masterpiece as underrated as any album that sold 30 million copies could ever be.Grade B Source ByzantiumDirector/Country/Time Neil Jordan/UK-Ireland/118 min.Cast Saoirse Ronan Gemma Arterton Sam RileyProgram Special PresentationsHeadline The Vampire DiariesScotts Take Neil Jordans second crack at bloodsuckers after Interview With A Vampire suffers from the same impulse to favor mood-building over all other considerations. Given that vampires are doomed to walk the earth for an ageless eternity some sulky atmosphere is a prerequisite and Jordan gets a lot out of his setting--an English tourist town on the coast that appears to be permanently offseason. But Byzantium is content just to marinate in vampire mythos rather than give these old stories new life. Saoirse Ronan and Gemma Arterton are both strong as usual as centuries-old ""sisters"" who are accustomed to moving from city to city after the bodies pile up and suspicion begins to mount. Ronan is a passive bookish type who feasts mercifully on the old and feeble and writes stories to cast into the wind; Arterton is the practical of the two a brassy sexpot who uses her body to pay the rent. After moving to the coast they set up shop at the abandoned Byzantium Hotel which Arterton turns into a brothel but the town figures into their origin stories and that history exerts itself in threatening ways. Jordan weaves past and present with characteristic elegance but unlike some of his best movies--The Crying Game and The End Of The Affair leap to mind--Byzantium tries to survive on mood alone as if it were enough merely to evoke the condition of being a vampire. Its gorgeous to look at and even prettier to listen to--Javier Navarretes piano score is exceptionally hummable--but an absence of passion leaves the film well bloodless.Grade C+ Ghost GraduationDirector/Country/Time Javier Ruiz Caldera Spain 88 min.Cast Raul Arevalo Alexandra Jimenez Andrea DuroProgram Contemporary World CinemaHeadline A g-g-g-g-graduationNoels Take Suppose the kids in The Breakfast Club were killed in a fire and were condemned to haunt their school Ghostbusters-style until a neurotic teacher who can talk to ghosts arrived to go all Stand And Deliver helping them pass their senior year so that they could move on to the afterlife? Thats more or less the premise of Ghost Graduation a Spanish comedy that loads up on the 80s pastiche from ""getting in shape"" montages to romantic interludes scored by Bonnie Tyler. Whats missing from the movie though is a fuller use of its premise. Writer-director Javier Ruiz Caldera has some clever ideas--for example one of the kids died while drunk and remains buzzed as a ghost--but Ghost Graduation doesnt feel thought-through enough. For one thing it never feels like these teens have been hanging around for 25 years. Its up to their teacher Raul Arevalo to explain to them all the changes in technology and culture which is dumb because what exactly have these ghosts been seeing happen all around them at school for the past quarter-century? But while Ghost Graduation could be smarter it couldnt be much more fun. The movie is brisk and bright with an arc thats predictable but in a comforting way. Caldera hits his marks well delivering the requisite raunchy jokes and emotional highs at just the right moments. Its almost as though these old crowdpleasing techniques have been hanging around for decades waiting for their chance to be useful again.Grade B Source The IcemanDirector/Country/Time Ariel Vromen/USA/103 min.Cast Michael Shannon Winona Ryder Ray LiottaProgram Special PresentationsHeadline Providing For The Family By Murdering For ""The Family""Scotts Take Over his decades working for crime families in Newark and New York contract killer Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski claims to have murdered over 100 people all while maintaining a double life as a husband and father of three in suburban New York. Making a compelling movie out of his life ought to be reasonably easy To quote William Hurt in A History Of Violence ""How do you fuck that up?"" And yet director Ariel Vromen fucks it up plenty making a boilerplate gangster drama thats smothered in a tone of high seriousness. Michael Shannon does his best to salvage the movie as Kuklinsky who he plays as a remorseless killing machine in his professional life and as the type of family man who provides for his wife and children without an excess of affection or engagement. The greatness of Shannons performance lies in the subtle ways the job-related stress starts to surface at home despite his best efforts to contain it. Kuklinski needs to maintain an air of quiet reserve on both fronts--his mob family and his real family counts on him for his sturdiness in taking care of business--and the act of killing chips away at his resolve. But Vromen applies too much gravity where its not needed Kuklinski is shown hacking up bodies in one scene and taking his girls to the roller rink in the next but the cognitive dissonance isnt punched home. Kuklinskis frenetic life is played at half speed. (And in a festival of questionable grooming David Schwimmers mustache gives Argo and Cloud Atlas a run for the money.)Grade C+ Source The Impossible Director/Country/Time J.A. Bayona Spain/USA 107 min.Cast Naomi Watts Ewan McGregor Geraldine ChapmanProgram Special PresentationsHeadline Not a dry eye (or a dry anything really)Noels Take Its been five years since J.A. Bayona debuted with the terrifying-yet-tearjerking ghost story The Orphanage and now hes finally back in the directors chair with The Impossible based on the true story of a family that was visiting Thailand in 2004 with the Indian Ocean tsunami hit. While this subject matter wouldnt seem to have much in common with The Orphanage both films lean heavily on the bond between parents and children eliciting sympathy with scenes of mothers and fathers faced with the loss of their kids. And like The Orphanage The Impossible confirms that Bayona is a major talent with a skill for shooting and constructing sequences that build tension masterfully. The tsunami sequence in The Impossible is likely to get most of the attention--and rightfully so since its ten of the most harrowing minutes most moviegoers are likely to see this year--but the movie is actually filled with smaller but no less gripping scenes of these family members scrambling to find each other amid of landscape of wreckage and strangers. The script for The Impossible isnt in the same class as the direction; the dialogue tends to be either functional or corny constraining the characters to one or two levels. But overall this is a superb example of the ""man against the elements"" film anchored by the panic that sets in when one family member fears never seeing the others again. With that as his starting point Bayona deftly pushes the audiences buttons going for the big swell of emotion and getting it.Grade B+ Source Jayne Mansfields CarDirector/Country/Time Billy Bob Thornton/USA/121 min.Cast Billy Bob Thornton Robert Duvall John HurtProgram GalaHeadline Sifting Through The WreckageScotts Take Billy Bob Thornton and writing partner Tom Epperson share a longstanding interest in examining family bonds and divisions in the Deep South--One False Move and A Family Thing are both fine early examples--and they have a great ear for redneck colloquialisms. Their latest collaboration Jayne Mansfields Car tries to do many things at once Consider the contrasting views of service within a military family in 1969 Alabama reveal the estrangement of patriarch Robert Duvall from his grown children (who are also fighting amongst themselves); find the drama romance and fish-out-of-water comedy of a British family descending on their estate for a funeral. Thornton plays much of it too broadly--this is one of those movies where an old-timer accidentally ingests drugs--and the film labors to set up and follow through on the scores of relationships that develop between Duvall and his sons and members of both Duvalls family and the visitors from overseas. But for all the flaws in is overall design Jayne Mansfields Car has a handful of powerful scenes most involving Thornton as a damaged WWII veteran and Duvall and Hurt as men who loved the same woman but feel inclined to suspend their rivalry after she passes. Theres no shortage of themes here--particularly fascinating is the way service in different wars affect how the veterans perceive one another--and the Thornton/Epperson team write a lot of nice long scenes between the characters that make the most of the stacked ensemble. But the film has no sense of rhythm or pace--it lumbers forward with an awkward gait a rewrite (or perhaps a different director) away from the refinement it needs.Grade B- Source UndergroundDirector/Country/Time Robert Connolly Australia 89 min.Cast Alex Williams Anthony LaPaglia Rachel GriffithsProgram Contemporary World CinemaHeadline Theres a world going on...Noels Take Heres how square the filmmaking and storytelling is in Underground Early in writer-director Robert Connollys docudrama about Julian Assanges teen hacker years Assange (played by Alex Williams) bets his buddy a copy of Isaac Asimovs Foundation that he can break into a system first. Assange wins the bet. A couple of scenes later he meets his friend who hands Assange the book. Connolly then includes an insert shot to confirm that the friend has given Assange a copy of Foundation. Consider that ""t"" crossed. Let no one leave the theater wondering ""Wait was that book Foundation or not?""Heres another example About midway through Underground as Assange is using his access to the US militarys databases to figure out where troops are being deployed for the first Gulf War his live-in girlfriend asks whether his computer can locate Melbourne ""where your son and his mother are."" So it wasnt always easy for Assange see. Its not just governments trying to bring him down but nagging women as well. The shame of Connollys highlight everything/turn-Assange-into-a-cliched-movie-character approach is that there really is an interesting story here about the early days of the internet when young punks and radicals had the edge on the authorities who werent even sure yet what should be considered a crime. It mightve been better had Connolly made the film more about the older detective (played by Anthony LaPaglia) who hires a young nerd to guide him through this new world in all its facets. Or it mightve been better if the whole film had been fictionalized to better suit the middle-of-the-road melodrama that Connolly seemed bound and determined to make.Grade C Source Next Terrence fuckin Malick.

Like a self-aware and sun-blitzed Elmore Leonard novel Martin McDonaghs Los Angeles-set ""Seven Psychopaths"" exploits easy quirk for big laughs being the tale of an alcoholic Irish screenwriter (Colin Farrell) and his two scam-artist buddies (Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken) who kidnap rich peoples dogs and collect the reward money. But the Shih Tzu hits the fan after the pair nab a local gangsters pooch gradually inspiring the creatively blocked scribe to write the film already unfolding onscreen. Late to the Tarantino knock-off party ""Seven Psychopaths"" boasts a juicy enough cast to skip the straight-to-homevid fate typical of such pics. Compared to McDonaghs best work for stage (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"") and screen (""In Bruges"") ""Seven Psychopaths"" feels like either an older script knocking around the bottom of a drawer or a new one hastily tossed off between more ambitious projects. Ironically enough the scribes apparent lack of any attempt to make a grand artistic statement could easily make this outing his most accessible project to date. Opening with a pair of hitmen (""Boardwalk Empire"" duo Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt) squabbling ""Pulp Fiction""-style beneath the Hollywood sign the pic establishes its talky irreverent tone by turning the tables on the two hired guns who are dead before their debate is done when a weirdo in a luchador mask walks up behind and pops them each in the head. Judging by the number of times the pic kills characters via exploding chunks of scalp its fair to assume that head wounds are the funniest sort there is and in keeping with the helmers Grand Guignol sensibility the film certainly doesnt skimp on opportunities to test the theory. In no way connected to the aforementioned scene is Marty (Farrell) who only wishes he could write an opening as entertaining as that but all he has is a title ""Seven Psychopaths."" So good friend Billy (Rockwell) pitches in taking out a classified ad suggesting that any former psychos interested in having their stories told on film should drop by. Astonishingly they get only one reply (a fun cameo from Tom Waits playing a man who serially kills other serial killers) though McDonagh has no trouble concocting half a dozen other nut jobs to flesh out his title. As the mobster missing his Shih Tzu Woody Harrelson surprisingly comes across less psycho than many of his roles. Still playing the character for his dog-loving soft spot seems the right choice for the films tone which is generally kind to crazies and hard on everybody else especially women and anyone who aint white. The fact that the characters acknowledge this weakness doesnt make it right though the scripts primary tension isnt between the characters at all but rather in McDonaghs mind as he arm-wrestles the split between shlock and sincerity in screenwriting. The films overall tone is so cartoony its easy to imagine someone spinning off a macabre animated series of the same name if only more of the psychopaths survived at the end. As it is the film takes place in a version of L.A. that appears simultaneously familiar and kitsched up to an intense degree with plain white-walled apartments crammed full of shag throw pillows and odd plastic dolls. McDonaghs going for weird and his set and prop teams have certainly indulged him while Carter Burwell supplies a score -- like so much of his work for the Coen brothers -- that puts a funereal spin on the materials almost playful disregard for human life. Theres an old Hollywood cliche that goes ""write what you know"" and the film has fun twisting that advice by ratcheting up the insanity of the circumstances around Farrells otherwise feckless scribe. Opposite the unusually restrained star Rockwell and Walken are free to chew the scenery as editor Lisa Gunning repeatedly selects the thesps most eccentric takes in order to underscore the laugh. Exaggerated widescreen framing gooses the comedy further though d.p. Ben Davis seems overwhelmed by the intensity of California sun resulting in extremely high-contrast exteriors.

From ""The Pillowman"" to ""A Behanding in Spokan"" McDonaghs plays tend to begin with a ludicrous premise filled with colorful characters whose struggles eventually become real enough to allow for moving finales. With his second feature-length directorial effort following the gangster farce ""In Bruges"" you have to look closely to see beyond the absurdities and appreciate the insight but thats only because the two ingredients are fused together with such enjoyably wacky finesse. Despite its silliness ""Seven Psychopaths"" bears the mark of a personal work if for no other reason than the lead character played by Colin Farrell is named Marty and suffers from a major case of writers block. Attempting to construct a screenplay with the movies title he spends the runtime trying to figure out the identities for each of the psychopaths set to be featured in the story. Help arrives in the form of his two close pals the peppy Billy (Sam Rockwell) and introspective Hans (Christopher Walken). Both actors appeared in McDonaghs New York stage production of ""A Behanding in Spokane"" not too long ago and their ability to have fun with this freewheeling material is evident; Walken in particular delivers his best performance in years a welcome return to the over-the-top mock seriousness that defines Walkenesque. But ""Seven Psychopaths"" moves beyond the neuroses of its bitchy writer protagonist to let his creations take the stage because Billy attempts to draw from real life and finds plenty of material. While his psychopaths are modeled after real people the movie frequently cuts to Martys dramatized takes and their glorified violence takes the movie through a series of calculated gags. The tale of the Quaker Psychopath embodied by Harry Dean Stanton is a matched only by the arrival of Tom Waits as a mopey psychopath who spent his formative years killing psychopaths. Then theres the Vietnamese Rider (Ricky Titus) whose path of destruction develops out of more personal concerns. Marty also has to contend with real-life psychopaths including a gun-toting Woody Harrelson the gangster whose beloved Shih Tzu has been stolen by Billy and Hans. Harrelson amusing deadpan as usual launches a pursuit of the men that leads to a series of climaxes and revelations both confounding and entertaining for largely the same reasons. The problem is compounded by the ridiculous ingredients driving it. ""You cant let the animals die"" Billy insists when Marty complains about the gangster on their tail. ""Only the women."" Truth and fiction merge until even Marty cant quite sort it all out. A less controlled and slapdash character piece than ""In Bruge"" McDonaghs new movie benefits greatly from a plethora of one-liners that toy with crime movie cliches in the unlikely context of writerly obsessions. When Marty complains about the cliched use of guns in most crime scripts one of his pals fires back ""They arent fucking leprechauns."" And yet its the air of breezy fantasy that transforms ""Seven Psychopaths"" from an ego-driven lark to an oddly spot-on analysis of the way fiction and reality can merge for those who attempt to draw from one to create the other. The zany developments never slow down but theres still a general sense of carelessnessas it veers in and out of Martys developing screenplay. A keen anatomy of a slippery craft ""Seven Psychopaths"" may not take itself too seriously and beckons viewers to feel the same way. But each strong jab in the ribs comes equipped with a dose of creative insight. Its less a love letter to the writing process than a satire of those obsessed with it. Even if McDonagh doesnt mean to imply that writing is a psychopathic behavior the proof is in the gory pudding. Criticwire grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? CBS Films will release ""Seven Psychopaths"" on October 12. It may be too off-kilter and dark for many audiences but fans of McDonagh and the stars may help it find solid business in its opening weekend.
