By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 15 2010 Save for later Saved In this publicity image released by Summit Entertainment Helen Mirren is shown in a scene from ""Red."" Frank Masi/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If youre like me youll put up with a lot of malarkey in a movie just to see Helen Mirren wielding a semiautomatic weapon. You may argue that Helen Mirren wielding a semiautomatic weapon is also malarkey. Maybe so but malarkey doesnt get any better.Mirren is one of several overqualified actors who are featured in the graphic-novel-derived comic action escapade ""RED"" and she doesnt appear until well into the movie. Until then we have to satisfy ourselves with a motley crew of oddball luminaries including Bruce Willis over-underacting as former black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses and John Malkovich under-overacting as ex-CIA loon Marvin Boggs.Retired Frank has been living a gratifyingly boring and solitary life in the burbs when his home is inexplicably invaded by a high-tech hit squad which he methodically dispatches. Up until this point hes been periodically amusing himself flirting on the phone with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) the administrator of his pension checks. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? On the pretext of a business trip he arranges a blind date with her. In the wake of the attack fearing she may also be implicated Frank converts the date into a kidnapping. Sarah complains but not too convincingly. Frank is after all more exciting than the losers shes been hooking up with. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Besides Frank several other top CIA agents all retired are also being targeted by as is soon revealed their former employer. (The films title is an acronym for ""retired extremely dangerous."") Joe (Morgan Freeman) terminally ill but still game is living in a nursing home; Malkovichs Marvin the unwitting recipient of long-ago LSD experiments conducted by the CIA stows himself in a camouflaged bunker; Mirrens Victoria looking like a cross between Martha Stewart and Margaret Thatcher has a queenly decorum.None are happy marking time. When the attacks begin they swing into action with Frank and they love every minute of it. We are encouraged to love every minute of it too.This wasnt quite the case with me. I liked every 20 minutes of it. Director Robert Schwentke never strikes a comfortable balance between comedy and action. That first home invasion for example is shot like a routine thriller sequence but its bookended by goofiness. His mistake was in trying to strike a balance in the first place.In order for it to work at all ""RED"" should not be taken seriously on any level. Whenever it touches on the real world - whenever it brings up torture and terrorism and assassination of US leaders - it loses its bearings.It also suffers from being yet another movie in the wake of ""The A-Team"" and ""The Expendables"" about an aging cadre of codgers facing off at the OK Corral. (Among the many films it pilfers from is ""The Wild Bunch."") For years Hollywood has been trying to figure out what to do with its superannuated action stars. The answer it turns out is simple Cast aging action heroes as aging action heroes. (Now that Governor Schwarzenegger is about to step down dont be surprised if he reenters the fray big-time.)Another reason these films which also include ""Knight and Day"" with Tom Cruise are resurgent is that with their comic-book frolics they serve as antidotes to the grim ""Bourne"" movies and their ilk (like ""Salt"").By not taking themselves too seriously they provide an alternate-universe romper room that harks back to the comfy days of cold warriorism. ""RED"" in fact features a Russian operative and former cold-war spy Brian Coxs Ivan whos as warm and fuzzy as a teddy bear.""RED"" is a poisoned valentine to the CIA and that approach too is in keeping with its cold-war sentimentality. For most of the way the films chief CIA baddie played by Karl Urban is as sleek and soulless as his high-tech weaponry but this just proves that the CIA isnt what it used to be when Frank and Joe lived high on the hog. ""RED"" is a goofball lament. Its saying that in the good old days or at least in the good old movie days our killers were good-time guys. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence and brief strong language.)More Monitor movie reviewsTamara DreweConvictionVision Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

The title stands for retired extremely dangerous and this knockabout action comedy is a boisterous getting-the-band-back-together movie as Frank assembles a crew of trigger-happy oldsters (John Malkovich Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren Brian Cox) to uncover why his distinguished black-ops past is coming back to haunt him. Its a charming mess rescued by the knowing gusto of the acting. Beneath its light exterior is not only a neat if unsubtle political undercurrent but a rebellious streak about how the allure of firing an RPG outweighs the prospect of retirement.

Comments (2) click to enlarge RED Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2010 Adapted from a DC graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer this action comedy benefits from a lovely flatness to the images and from blocky compositions that permit fleet editing--sitting in the theater you may feel as if youre quickly turning some very large pages. Bruce Willis plays a retired special-ops warrior whos trying to figure out why government agents suddenly want him dead; Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Brian Cox and Helen Mirren are the retired spies who help him out. Much of the enjoyment comes from seeing these respected thespians so thoroughly embody cartoon characters; its like Sidney Lumet directing Space Jam. The film preserves many of Elliss amoral one liners (best delivered by Malkovich and by Richard Dreyfuss as one of the villains) though as in much of his writing the fun is discolored by a profound cynicism.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Two of this years best summer movies didnt play during summer. One of them ""Kick Ass"" opened in late spring and featured a foul-mouthed 12-year-old heroine named Hit Girl. And now the action-comedy ""RED"" opens today and struts an ensemble of iconic performers as CIA operatives having way too much fun and all too pleased to take audiences along for the ride. Directed with fleet assurance by Robert Schwentke ""RED"" is unabashed unabated fun in a season typically reserved for awards-night aspirants -- whodathunkit? Bruce Willis all smirk and vulnerable charm is Frank Moses a retired CIA operative. Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren and John Malkovich portray his former colleagues in spy craft. Malkovich is indelibly nutty as the paranoiac Marvin. He carries a stuffed pink pig. Brian Cox appears as former Soviet Cold-Warrior Ivan who misses the old-guard game. Frank spends his days in a suburban house executing a lonesome routine perked up by a phone flirtation with Sarah a pension-benefits caseworker. Mary-Louise Parker emerges nicely from ""Weeds"" to play the wide-eyed civilian. Based in Kansas City cubicle captive Sarah hankers for the kind of overheated romance that novels traffic in. Oh to be embroiled in an adventure. Sarah meet Frank. Targeted by his former employer he goes on the run protesting crush in tow. This summers Tom Cruise- Cameron Diaz vehicle ""Knight and Day"" was nearly the same make but a decidedly different model. ""RED"" mashes up two stories fast becoming staples of American pop culture spies wanting to be loved and mothballed clandestine operatives being hunted by their own. So much so that one might ponder its deeper significance. A few of this years candidates for that essay ""Salt"" ""The Expendables"" ""The Losers"" ""The A-Team."" Only ""RED"" is such a well- tooled smoothly oiled machine of quips twists and spies- versus-spy upsmanship that going all sociological on it is the last thing wed want to do. ""RED"" works a different demographic of the generation gap from ""Kick-Ass."" Think of Mirrens character Victoria as Hit Gal. Shes retired to the shores of Chesapeake Bay but hungers for the lethal trade. ""RED"" is fueled by conspiracy. A dead reporter a clandestine operation a vice president with highest-office ambitions (Julian McMahon) and an arms manufacturer with higher aims still (Richard Dreyfuss too good at unctuous) all figure in. The agent assigned to dispense with Frank is Langleys 21st-century reboot of Frank. Hes sleek lethal high-tech savvy. Played with dogged clarity by Karl Urban (Dr. McCoy in ""Star Trek"") Cooper is so good at what he does he carries on a fatherly phone conversation with his young son while staging a crime scene. His boss Agent Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) is as chillingly on point. Yet the veteran crew thwarts them again and again in this enthusiastically pro-AARP ride. This isnt ""Cocoon."" Though they have their moments of sweetness these characters ""do not go gentle."" Rated PG-13 the movie is based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis and illustrator Cully Hamner. Brothers Erich and Ron Hoeber expand on the notion of a conflicted agent in their clever screenplay adding the team of retirees with hard-to-relinquish habits. In a tender scene Victoria tells Frank that shes always thought him to be hard on the outside but admirably gooey to the core. ""RED"" has ka-booms rat-a-tat-tats and a wildly extended first date.

Second thumbsuckers who think they know better insist on calling you ""grandpa."" Third to quote a disconsolate Russian in a purple smoking jacket ""I havent keeled anyone in years."" That last problem is easily rectified in RED which is short for ""retired extremely dangerous."" Through the magic of cinema bored-witless retirees are rousted from their overstuffed furniture to fight off hordes of highly trained assassins. Who these assassins are and who hired them are mysteries the film addresses in time along with the significance of a plush pink pig toted around by John Malkovich. But the plot is not something that requires our full attention. As they say in the spy game on a need-to-know basis you dont need to know why Malkovich and Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis and Brian Cox are running around blasting off many large guns. What matters is that they are and theyre having an awesome time doing it. You will too if you take this breezy action comedy for what it is a noisy affirmation that life goes on after 50 that retirement doesnt mean redundancy and that nobody -- young or old -- can wear a long cream evening gown like Mirren. Especially when shes shooting people. Mirren arrives fairly late in the story as a lethal former agent for MI6. Cox is the purple Russian. Malkovich plays a crazy ex-spook holed up in a bunker with the aforementioned pig. Freemans character is an 80-year-old with Stage IV liver cancer and a roving eye while Willis another former CIA black-ops agent is now an idle retiree with a crush on a government pension worker he rings up for fun and flirting. Shes played by Mary-Louise Parker who possesses in her dry comic repertoire some of the best discombobulated reaction shots in the business. Another prominent youngster is Karl Urban as a current CIA man hot on their tails but hes just filler - the token Gen X hunk in a cast that also includes Richard Dreyfuss and the unsinkable Ernest Borgnine. All of them have their signature looks Urbans piercing eyeballs Coxs imploring brow Willis patented smirk-and-blink. Malkovich does this thing with his teeth (he does it in Secretariat too) that seems to mimic hippopotamus behavior and alarms me somewhat. By design all of this oldster eccentricity softens the films limit-pushing PG-13 violence which turns uncomfortably dark in several places and relies on the bullet-spraying overkill so common in the genre. But Robert Schwentke shaking off the sentimental blahs that plagued The Time Travelers Wife directs as though hes relieved to just get outside and play. Joining him there are screenwriting brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber whove loosened and lightened up Warren Ellis graphic novel. Old people who kill people are so much cuter than young people who kill people right?

It may be that Ive mislaid another star or two in the accounting; its hard to keep track when a motion picture is so profligate with talent. MORE ON FALL FILMS Benjamin Mercer Eastwoods Hereafter Matt Damon Shines Despite SchmaltzChristopher Orr The Social Network The Thrilling Facebook Creation MythChristopher Orr Wall Street The Crash According to Oliver Stone One would imagine that any movie boasting such a cast would inevitably offer its share of rewards. Alas director Robert Schwentke offers yet another reminder that cinema is not arithmetic. When Schwentke made his American debut in 2005 with Flightplan I described the film as an example of the Hollywood maxim that more is often less; with Red the German-born director takes that maxim and expands it exponentially.Willis plays Frank Moses a former CIA superspy who has been declared--for reasons that will gradually become clear if never quite lucid--""Retired Extremely Dangerous."" (Hence the title which the film shares with the graphic novel on which it is loosely based.) Thanks to this unwelcome status Frank quickly becomes the object of a gaudy but ineffective assassination attempt afterward as he walks out the door of his comprehensively machine-gunned house the roof collapses in a twist on the old hard-rode-jalopy-whose-doors-fall-off gag. Undeterred he hits the road and gently kidnaps Sarah (Parker) a service rep at the firm that dispenses his pension checks. For months Frank has been using said checks as an excuse to call and flirt with her; he worries that whoever is trying to kill him will realize that he ""likes"" Sarah and make her a target as well. Sarah for her part though initially miffed at her abduction by a man she has never actually met is soon pluckily committed to disentangling the murderous conspiracy.As the two shuttle about the country--New Orleans to New York to Mobile to Langley to Chicago--they gradually pick up old friends (Malkovich Freeman Mirren Cox) and new adversaries (Urban Pigeon Dreyfuss). There are the requisite reversals and betrayals of course and enough small (and-not-so-small-) arms fire to settle a mid-sized insurgency. (Red is to belts of ammo what The Departed was to the word ""fuck"" and its derivatives.) A gag in which Parker is rescued while sedated is borrowed awkwardly from genre sibling Knight and Day. And a lengthy procession of geriatric-assassin jokes--Malkovich boasting ""Old man my ass"" after a shootout; Aerosmiths ""Back in the Saddle"" blaring as Willis beats up a younger agent--offers a chilling portent of what lies in store should soon-to-be-ex-Governor Schwarzenegger ever return to the big screen. But in the end the greatest surprise--mild spoiler alert for those who dont know what ""already has a terminal disease"" augurs in this narrative context--may be that the implicit moratorium on the non-ironic killing of lovable nonwhite sidekicks has apparently expired.Though Willis has a longstanding knack for blending action and humor his smirky appeal is uncharacteristically muted. It may be that at 55 playing the toughest guy in the room leaves him with little energy left over for cracking wise. Parker is as endearing as usual but her performance amounts to little more than a collection of familiar tics the wide doe-eyes the nervous nips of lips and tongue. Worse the two stars show no meaningful sign of romantic combustion Even the opening scenes of telephonic banter intended to sell us on their long-distance chemistry are stubbornly inert.With the exceptions of Mirren (the Dame is game as always) and Urban (Star Treks McCoy doing what he can with a limited role) the rest of the extravagant cast seems at a loss as to what exactly they are doing here. Malkovich evidently unaware that the A-Team movie has already been cast shot released and consigned to the bad-memory drawer offers what appears to be a tepid audition for the role of ""Howling Mad"" Murdoch; Cox hams his way through a borscht-thick Russian accent; and Freeman looks as if he has finally wearied of the avuncular persona that will put his great-great-grandkids through college.There is some appeal I suppose in the A-list B-movie ""slumming"" aspect of the whole enterprise in watching celebrated sexagenarians get in touch with their inner Van Dammes. But the novelty soon wears thin. And at a moment when Hollywoods unintentional lack of quality is everywhere to be seen a deliberate cultivation of the same loses much of its luster. Near the midpoint of the movie Mary-Louise Parker commenting on the mess the gang has gotten itself into grumbles ""This is so bad."" By the end though she has reversed herself ""Can you believe it? It all worked out."" I fear she had it right the first time.

Twitter previousCan Tacking Right Save a Freshman Democrat in Virginia?nextAn Ugly Answer to Israels Arab Problem Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Red Red an insult to viewers intelligence BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Oct 15 2010 (...) Summit Entertainment John Malkovich (left) and Morgan Freeman star in ""Red."" Do you remember a movie called ""The Whole Nine Yards""? The makers of ""Red"" are hoping that you dont because theyve dusted off the dim-witted premise of a hit man hiding in the suburbs and theyve even enlisted the same star Bruce Willis.""Red"" is an insult to our memories and to our intelligence an unfunny farce whose veteran cast is cashing a retirement check.A check is what Frank Moses (Willis) wants when he periodically pesters clerk Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) at the Social Security call center in Kansas City. Frank lives in Ohio yet he considers Sarah his only friend. But hes got enemies from his time at the CIA -- which classifies him as ""RED"" (""Retired Extremely Dangerous"") -- and when covert commandos invade his cul-de-sac Frank goes on the lam. In a surefire nominee for the most idiotic script of the year Frank drugs and kidnaps Sarah for a cross-country mission to reunite the retired spies who can help him thwart the assassins. Its like ""Knight and Day"" with a hernia.If a killjoy critic dares to point out that Frank is risking a strangers life for no good reason and that ditzy Sarah never raises a fuss about it apologists will answer that an action comedy doesnt have to make sense if its got enough you know action and comedy. But with convalescent co-stars such as Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren and John Malkovich the action is a limp mishmash of slo-mo and CGI. And except for Malkovich who shines as a lunatic acid casualty the comedy consists of toothless bickering instead of sharp observations about age or espionage. Each of these esteemed actors has played similar roles before Freeman in ""Wanted"" Malkovich in ""Burn After Reading"" Mirren in ""Shadowboxer"" and Willis in half the movies hes ever made.

But now these red-white-and-blue vigilantes are going to use their elite skills to turn the tables on the turncoats who are . . . Wait a minute. Doesnt this sound awfully familiar? Well it should -- because that was already pretty much the plot behind this years ""The Losers"" and ""The A-Team."" (It has more than a passing resemblance to this years ""Knight and Day"" and ""Salt"" too). The only difference is that this movie (also like ""The Losers"" based on a cult comic) is called ""Red"" and stars Bruce Willis and four -- count em -- Oscar winners. And that despite all of them big shiny stupid ""Red"" has nearly nothing going for it except its own wastefulness. Its as if the studio simply assembled a huge pile of money in the middle of the back lot set it ablaze and started filming. Movie Review RED (PG-13) Summit (111 min.) Directed by Robert Schwentke. With Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren John Malkovich. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review ONE AND A HALF STARS And I wish they had because it would have been more interesting to watch than this. The movie begins with Willis a retired CIA agent living alone with his memories and his smirk. But then a team of freelance assassins burst in and try to kill him. (Guess what? They dont.) And soon Willis -- and old pals Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren -- have rejoined forces to find out why. The answer has something to do with Richard Dreyfuss. But getting there also requires the charms of Mary-Louise Parker (who seems to be in another movie and should be) Rebecca Pidgeon (more unpleasant than usual as an icy CIA chief) and the still-up-for-anything Ernest Borgnine. It might be bearable if (as in ""Knight and Day"") there were even a fleeting moment of wit. Or if (as in ""The Losers"") the picture accepted its own witlessness and even indulged it with a bit of camp or amusingly over-the-top action. But no such luck in a movie solely powered by small minds large guns and an electric-bass-and-bongos soundtrack that feels lifted from an old cop show. And as for the plot -- well even for a Bruce Willis movie it makes no sense. Why for example does Pidgeon send her top agent into a top-secret archive to get a highly classified report which she knows reveals -- absolutely nothing? Why does Willis break into someones home to hold a family hostage -- and then leave without accomplishing anything? Why am I still sitting here an hour-and-a-half later watching this? Oh thats right. I get paid to. But you dont. And while theres some fleeting enjoyment to be had seeing Helen Mirren in camouflage firing off enormous automatic weapons -- really if MGM ever gets its act together I think she should be the next James Bond -- theres nothing here worth your time or your dollars. Ratings note The film contains wall-to-wall violence.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday October 15 2010 400 AM Title Red Caper about retired spies. With Bruce Willis Helen Mirren. Director Robert Schwentke (151). PG-13 Violence language. At area theaters.""This is going to be fun"" Helen Mirren accurately predicts while training her assassins rifle in ""Red"" an action comedy as entertaining to watch as it evidently was to make.According to Jon and Erich Hoebers clever script (which was based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner) RED stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous. Its certainly true that these middle-aged spies -- not to mention the stars who play them -- are still at the top of their game.A typically amiable Bruce Willis leads the charge as ex-agent Frank Moses whose quiet suburban home is ambushed out of the blue. Turns out Frank and his former colleagues (Mirren Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich) are all on a hit list organized by a powerful arms dealer (Richard Dreyfuss) as part of a political coverup. RED stars Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis as middle-aged spies who are still at the top of their game. (Frank Masi) Like the others Frank is happy in retirement and just wants a low-key life with a low-key girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker). But once a CIA hotshot (Karl Urban) is also assigned to ""silence"" them he and his partners find themselves back at work -- and realize just how much theyve missed it.Director Robert Schwentke wisely keeps it light but there are no attempts to pander to a young audience or otherwise sell his esteemed leads -- each of whom owns at least one Oscar or Emmy -- short.They in turn cheerfully embrace the preposterous nature of this decidedly non-prestigious project. Theyre confident enough to acknowledge their age while reminding us theyve never been better. To underestimate actors of this caliber -- even in a popcorn action flick -- would be dangerous indeed. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Summit Entertainment By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 15 2010 1201 a.m. ET Only in Hollywood is someone seriously old at 55 but this is the underlying thesis of ""Red"" and it works like a well-worn charm. Watch a clip from the film ""Red"" starring Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker. Bruce Willis still buff and smirking at that august age plays Frank Moses a retiree quietly collecting Social Security until his life is suddenly threatened by a small army of intruders with enormous guns. Since Frank used to be a black-ops ace in the CIA he dispatches the would-be assassins forthwith. Then the born-again action hero rounds up the even older members of his old team to help him survive. In a stroke of creative casting the team includes Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren ""Were gettin the band back together"" Mr. Freemans Joe says with quiet pleasure. Frank also enlists the help of an active CIA functionary played by Ernest Borgnine who at the age of 93 has achieved authentic oldness although he doesnt act like it. If logic applied Mr. Borgnines Henry a documents custodian would have long ago been retired from the job that he performs with the cheerful air of a cashier in a country store. But logic doesnt apply to a single tumultuous moment of ""Red"" which was directed with huge exuberance by Robert Schwentke and freely and frivolously adapted by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber from a superserious and ultraviolent graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer. (The title is an acronym for ""retired extremely dangerous."") Mary-Louise Parkers Sarah Ross a Social Security clerk isnt interested in logic either. In the enjoyably silly plot Frank whisks Sarah out of her Kansas City office and presses her into involuntary service as the teams junior member but she soon comes to think that he isnt old at all and she takes to the wild thrills of his cross-country mission like a salmon takes to white water. Ms. Parker is a graceful comedienne and its no news that Mr. Willis is a past master of delicate--yes delicate--self-irony so their characters generate welcome fizz in the course of a fraught relationship. (""Your eyes are so beautiful"" Frank tells Sarah early on as he covers her mouth with silver duct tape to keep her from screaming.) This cheerful bauble of an entertainment starts to lose momentum only when two-thirds of the way through or thereabouts the bad guys remove Sarah from the romantic equation for much too long. Thats not the movies only flaw. In what has been a consistently funny caper Sarahs removal coincides with a turn toward political melodrama in a setting that for anyone old enough to remember has chilling overtones of RFK and the Ambassador Hotel. Given that the movie was presumably intended for audiences old enough to remember things (even though it carries oddly enough a PG-13 rating) one wonders how such a script choice could have been made. Yet ""Red"" recovers from the chill with the steadfast help of its stars. (Among the nonstar turns that enliven the show Richard Dreyfuss plays a particularly brash bad guy with a mistaken belief in the protective power of badness. Brian Cox is Ivan a Russian diplomat with a romantic past and an encyclopedic knowledge of present-day codes at CIA headquarters.) Every now and then the senior participants in the proceedings offer nuggets of wisdom. ""Heres the thing"" Frank tells a remorseless adversary ""with age comes a certain perspective."" That may even be true but whats obvious here is that age in conjunction with talent can sharpen performance. The best part of ""Red"" is the spectacle of terrific actors being terrific in novel ways. Its great fun to see Mr. Williss swings between minimalist comedy and maximalist action or Mr. Freemans combination of suavity and warmth. While Mr. Malkovich has played nut jobs in the past Marvin Boggs the martial crackpot he portrays so gleefully here has an especially firm purchase on insanity. (When a bazooka-slinging woman dares to call Marvin ""old man"" the actors rage would do King Lear proud.) Ms. Mirren by contrast is almost demure in her approach to destructiveness. She plays Victoria Winslow once the sharpest of sharpshooters though more recently given to rustic puttering in a beautiful home. For a case study of how to put an inimitable twist on an ordinary line watch Ms. Mirrens Victoria tell Sarah about her true trade. ""I kill people dear"" she says with exquisite concision then adds a fleeting smile and a barely perceptible shrug. Its the little things that count. ENLARGE Bryce Dallas Howard and Matt Damon in Clint Eastwoods Hereafter. Warner Bros. Pictures Hereafter Matt Damon is George a spiritualist in spite of himself in ""Hereafter"" and one of three people in the film who have haunting connections with the afterlife. Unfortunately Clint Eastwoods slow-paced drama has slack connections with the here and now. Watch a clip from the film ""Hereafter"" starring Matt Damon. This supernatural thriller which was written by Peter Morgan begins impressively when a tropical resort is ravaged by a tsunami. In the chaos that ensues Marie a TV personality on vacation from France--shes played by Cecile de France in subtitled French--has a near-death experience that qualifies her as another member of the haunted trio. The third member is the youngest and most improbably affecting--a sweetly bleak-faced English schoolboy Marcus (Frankie McLaren) who has recently lost his twin brother. One problem that soon surfaces is the movies certitude. No Turn-of-the-Screw-y ambiguities no mind games about whether the three might share some all-too-human delusion. Either you buy their Vaseline-lensed visions of the hereafter or you watch in stony silence as I did wondering why theres no one to care about. Mr. Damon brings calm intelligence to his role and he has an agreeable encounter with Bryce Dallas Howard in a cooking class--the students take turns wearing masks and spoon-feeding one another in blind tastings. But even that scene wears out its welcome; it isnt as intimate as it promises to be and its pace in keeping with the movie as a whole is insistently slow. The cast includes Marthe Keller as a celebrated student of death and not dying and Derek Jacobi as himself giving a reading at a London book fair. Even he seems a bit morose. Conviction Watch a clip from the film ""Conviction"" starring Hillary Swank. This affecting fiction film was based on a true story. The key fact is that its precipitating event the conviction of an innocent man on charges of murder came in the early 1980s before the use of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system. ""Conviction"" which was directed by Tony Goldwyn from a script by Pamela Gray provides a showcase for two exceptional actors. Sam Rockwell is Kenny Waters a volatile resident of a small Massachusetts town who received a life sentence on the strength of false testimony. Hilary Swank is his sister Betty Anne Waters. A high school dropout and single mother who never doubted her brothers innocence Betty Anne put herself through college and law school so she could exonerate him and finally succeeded in her efforts. (The film pays tribute to The Innocence Project which was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld and which helped Betty Anne to prevail.) The narrative is of necessity often predictable with extensive factual ground to cover. Ms. Swank in particular must work her way through familiar scenes of heroic striving although the script invites us to consider whether Betty Anne moves from heroism into zealotry at the expense of her children. But the quality of the acting is consistently high (Ari Graynor is luminous in the small role of Kennys daughter) and Mr. Rockwells crackling energy goes a long way toward compensating for the films predominantly earnest tone. His blue-collar bad boy--Kenny often got himself into minor trouble around town--has a wild streak and a short fuse but he always made people laugh. Some of the movies most stirring scenes take place during Betty Annes prison visits when the laughter has stopped and her innocent brother contemplates his shattered life. Carlos One of the high points of last months Telluride Film Festival was as I wrote at the time spending 51/2 hours in a darkened theater--with one short break around the four-hour mark--to watch Olivier Assayass shocking and edifying epic which stars the Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez in a phenomenal performance as the international terrorist of the 70s and 80s. Now that ""Carlos"" has begun a series of theatrical engagements around the country--the release schedule can be found at ifcfilms.com--I urge you to see it in a theater too. And see it all in one sitting as I did even though the theatrical version will also be shown in two installments and will be available via video on demand. Why turn a movie into a marathon? Because time may be fleeting but its mysteriously elastic as well. Once youve committed to an experience as intense as this one hours become much less than the sum total of their minutes. In my own encounter with ""Carlos"" giving up the required chunk of my life allowed me to enter the life of the film as if all other cares and clocks had ceased to exist.

Photo John Malkovich Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren offer a little uh social security for their fellow CIA retiree Bruce Willis when he suddenly comes under attack by spooks still working for the Agency. ( ) John Malkovich Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren offer a little uh social security for their fellow CIA retiree Bruce Willis when he suddenly comes under attack by spooks still working for the Agency. ( ) Once in a great while a film comes along that tenderly describes the aging process in all of its bountiful golden wisdom. But who wants to see that? ""Red"" perhaps the first CIA-AARP flick fits seniors with grenade launchers instead of slippers. I say its about time. Defying box-office wisdom (the kind promoted by studio executives too young to remember Jimmy Carter) the film is likely to be a profitable exercise for an action comedy whose age scale runs from old (Bruce Willis) to really old (Morgan Freeman) to Ernest Borgnine. Willis is a lonely Cleveland codger who has developed a crush on a clerk (a very funny Mary-Louise Parker) at the Social Security office. She sends him checks and he pretends to lose them so he can keep calling her back. She wants to go to Chile. Has he ever been there? Er yes well but he doesnt remember much about it. ""It was dark"" he says. PHOTOS HOLLYWOODS COOLEST BADASSES Hes a little quicker on his feet when his former colleagues at the CIA drop by to redecorate his house with bullets. Figuring the death squad will probably try to eliminate the girl too -- death squads can be really mean -- he finds it necessary to kidnap her first answer questions later. And with Parker waxing deadpan all the while (""not my best first date. Not my worst"") were off on a romp around the country to figure out why the CIA is trying to kill one of its own honored vets which Washington politician has secrets to hide and whether its possible to hop out of a car thats spinning like a roulette wheel. (Answer Yes if youre Bruce Willis but we already knew theres nothing the man cant do except grow hair on his head.) Casting matters and I for one have no problem believing John Malkovich as a conspiracy-minded maniac who took LSD every day for 11 years as part of a psych experiment. (""In that case"" Parker says ""he looks great."") Morgan Freeman as a lecher? Thats cool (although he doesnt get enough to do). And Helen Mirren is as deadly as ever but for once she gets a chance to slay people not with a raised eyebrow but with a machine gun. Arranging flowers and pulling triggers she shows us exactly where Martha Stewart meets John Rambo. The ferocity in her eyes suggests shes mentally mowing down whoever talked her into doing ""National Treasure Book of Secrets."" ""Red"" -- the title turns out to be a sly joke -- doesnt bother much with making its action scenes workable (whenever there are a dozen highly trained assassins in the room Willis is somehow always behind all of them). The comedy is a bit too broad in places and the laughs gradually get drowned out by the nonstop fusillade of the last act. But cute as it is much of it is smart too. A scene in which a secret dossier kept in maximum security turns out to be filled with redacted pages is such pure self-negation that it summarizes the whole depressing history of the CIA. Some of the sillier stunts are no less absurd than the ones in ""Salt"" but are presented with a twinkle in the eye that makes them much more fun. ""Red"" has more snappy joy in store than practically all of last summers busted blockbusters and its as zippy on its feet as a third-grader. I look forward to a sequel in which I hope the ""Red"" gang will school those humorless old dopes from ""The Expendables."" The losing team buys the winners dinner -- at 430. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Barbara Walters to interview Oprah Winfrey Read Next Barbara Walters to interview Oprah Winfrey Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43460 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21100 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18381 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Comics graphic novel the film stars Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren as CIAs top agents. The secrets they know turned them into the Agencys top targets. Starring Bruce Willis Mary-Louise Parker Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Helen Mirren Karl Urban Director Robert Schwentke Release Opened Oct 15 2010  Editorial Review Armed and still very dangerousBy Ann HornadayFriday October 15 2010""Red"" joins a long and mostly undistinguished line of recent movies whose upper-middle-aged stars play AARP members who refuse to go gently into genteel cinematic dotage. But unlike ""Wild Hogs"" or last summers ""The Expendables"" this adaptation of the ""Red"" graphic novel series gets into a cool sophisticated swing. The hip vibe and quirky characters seem less inspired by Sylvester Stallone than by Steven Soderbergh in his ""Out of Sight"" phase; the one-liners zing right along with the bullets in a playful pas de deux of mayhem misdirection and mordant humor. Bruce Willis plays Frank a former black ops agent now living in quiet desperation in Cleveland and enjoying a long-distance phone flirtation with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) the warm-voiced woman who mails his retirement check. When Frank is unexpectedly visited by a lethal ""wet team"" he realizes his life is in danger and he seeks to reassemble his old cohort of covert assassins Joe (Morgan Freeman) whom Frank busts out of a nursing home in New Orleans; Marvin (John Malkovich) whos living in flashback-induced paranoia somewhere in the Gulf Coast swamplands; and Victoria (Helen Mirren) who arranges roses and bakes tea cakes but longs to get back into the life of ordnance and kill shots. Nothing is remotely credible or humanly possible in ""Red"" which takes Frank and Sarah (along for the ride first as an unwilling aide-de-camp then as an eager newbie) on a mad tear through most of the United States east of the Mississippi. But director Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"") knows his way around taut action and the script by Jon and Erich Hoeber keeps even the most preposterous moments afloat with breezy unforced wit. Willis and Parker whose eyes burn like black cinders work up a fine fiery chemistry; Malkovich recalls his similarly unhinged human time bomb in ""Burn After Reading"" as a man haunted by the sins of the CIAs past; and Mirren looking sensational as always tucks into her role with winking relish. (""I kill people dear"" she confides sweetly to Sarah when they meet; later during a stakeout with a high-powered rifle they commiserate about guys as if they were getting a mani-pedi.) Unlike the overheated gimmickry of so many graphic novel adaptations (see ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" or better yet dont) ""Red"" hews to clean lines and a low-key simmer proving a welcome respite from more bombastic but far less pleasing examples of the genre. Like its stars ""Red"" possesses the sleek confidence borne of experience and chops It gets the job done with competence efficiency and points for smooth goofy style.Contains intense sequences of action violence and brief strong profanity.

Loosely adapting the DC comic-book miniseries of the same name the movie stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses a recently retired black-ops agent whos having a tough time adjusting to civilian life. He once toppled governments; now his routine involves enduring crushing boredom in suburban Cleveland waiting for his pension check to arrive. When it arrives he rips it up as pretense to call Sarah the clerk (Mary-Louise Parker) that he has an almost-budding romance with.As soon as this less-than-idyllic routine is established a group of gun-toting assassins blows it to bits. Moses and Sarah go on the run and he begins rounding up former colleagues to find out who wants his head and why.The old gang includes Joe (Morgan Freeman) a retired operative spending his golden years in a retirement home; Marvin (John Malkovich whose knack for playing weird seems to increase exponentially with each passing year) a former analyst and government test subject so paranoid hes probably convinced his paranoia is out to get him; and Victoria (Dame Helen Mirren so classy she can pull off accessorizing an evening gown with combat boots) a former assassin who spends her time baking arranging flowers and occasionally killing someone on the side to relieve the monotony.Wackiness ensues and the gags fly as fast and as furious as the bullets - and there are plenty of those. Part of the fun of action movies is that they are inherently silly; the key is hitting the right notes without going too far something that recent releases such as The Losers and The A-Team failed to do.Screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber know this. They and director Robert Schwentke strike a careful balance between quasi-cartoonish shoot-outs and oddball humor which ranges from droll to silly without ever going too far over the top. The rest of the fun comes from watching the top-notch cast (which also includes Karl Urban Brian Cox Richard Dreyfuss Julian McMahon and even Ernest Borgnine) glide nonchalantly through it all.Director Robert SchwentkeStarring Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Helen Mirren Mary-Louise Parker Karl Urban and Brian CoxRun time 111 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense sequences of action violence and brief strong language) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Helen Mirren and John Malkovich get busy. Movie review Red Clever casting but this spy spoof gets old Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 15 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Based on a comic by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner Red taps into the rogue-agent theme already encountered in The Losers Knight and Day Salt The A-Team and The Expendables. This middle-aged version is the more amiably silly of the lot with a belly-buster of a cast who give the so-so material maximum spin. Bruce Willis plays retired agent Frank Moses living in self-imposed lockdown in Cleveland and carrying on a long-distance phone flirtation with pension clerk Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). When Frank escapes an assassination attempt he knows his past is coming back to haunt him. He hits the road to abduct a not entirely unwilling Sarah before assembling his old spy team (classified as Retired Extremely Dangerous providing the acronym that gives the film its title). First he locates ailing Joe (Morgan Freeman) who is living in a New Orleans nursing home and feeling bored. Next is Marvin (John Malkovich) a paranoid acid casualty living in an underground bunker in Florida. Then theres Ivan (Brian Cox) a Russian spy who knows important secrets including how to break into CIA headquarters. Last on the list is Ivans old paramour Victoria (Helen Mirren) who enjoys baking flower-arranging and the occasional contract assassination. A CIA agent (Karl Urban) and his boss (Rebecca Pidgeon) are involved in a Haliburton-style coverup led by Richard Dreyfuss channelling Dick Cheney. But the conspiracy plot is little more than narrative chewing gum. The star turns are Reds raison detre with the winking performances filling the place of any credible dramatic tension. A cameo from Ernest Borgnine 93 as an agency record keeper provides a handy measuring stick for the casts age Theres old in years and then theres old in eras. THE STAR-BY-STAR BREAKDOWN Bruce Willis (55 years old) From his opening to his final smirk Willis recycles much of what worked in 2007s Live Free or Die Hard. The cocky but self-deprecating star makes fun of his own aging while showing some romantic dash. The gap between Willis and mid-forties Parker isnt unseemly just a little underdeveloped. And you wish he was up against a less buttoned-down villain to lend his role some useful yippee-ki-yay. Morgan Freeman (73) As big a star as Willis in his way Freeman plays a randy oldster who has nothing left to lose and is ready for a last shot at glory. Its a credit to Freemans skills that he can retain his dignity while dressed up in a ridiculous Third World dictator outfit looking not unlike Michael Jackson on one of his more conspicuous days. Though he brings some gravitas to anything just by showing up this is essentially another payday. Helen Mirren (65) Lady-like Victoria shows up late in the film as the conclusion to a running joke about the scariest agent of them all. Shes an urbane doyenne in a chic white dress who offers a convincing impression of the Queen operating a machine gun - which may be the movies biggest visual payoff. John Malkovich (56) A casualty of CIA mind-control experiments hes a wild-eyed conspiracy nut whose paranoia often proves prophetic. The loony outfits off-beat delivery and maniacal eye-rolling liven things up but in aiming for uproarious he gets a bit wearisome. The movie hes performing in feels a lot broader than the deadpan spoof in which the rest of the cast are acting.

In that it succeeds but any other success comes purely from the game cast of veterans all of whom play winking quotation-mark versions of characters theyve played -- this time armed to the teeth. Bruce Willis accessorized with a perpetual smirk is Frank Moses a retired CIA operative who finds a life devoid of forced coups and assassinations to be mind-numbingly routine. Hes soon forced to retire from retirement when his stultifying idyll is interrupted by a task force sent to kill him. Determined to find out why his former employer wants him dead Moses goes on a cross-country trip to round up the rest of the geriatric gun-toting gang Morgan Freemans wise and wizened buddy John Malkovichs lovably psychotic paranoiac and Mirrens grand dame with a Kalashnikov. Whatever scenery is left to chew once Malkovich is done Brian Cox washes down with a swig of vodka as a Cold War relic who has since warmed to his capitalist enemies. This team with an assist from Mary-Louise Parker as Moses initially unwilling love-interest give it their all so delighted in each others company that they seem to overlook the hackneyed and hole-riddled plot. Their enthusiasm helps make it easier for us to ignore these flaws but by the time the film reaches its shrug of a climax its evident just how hard the cast has been working to make something so stale seem fresh. Unfortunately while REDs stars may have gotten better with age its many cliches have not.

ABOUT THE MOVIERED  out of fourStars Bruce Willis Helen Mirren Morgan Freeman Mary-Louise Parker John Malkovich Ernest BorgnineDirector Robert SchwentkeDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Greenlighting RED must have seemed like a good idea at the time. All the elements for a lively offbeat action film are here. Its graphic-novel pedigree paired with an over-the-hill gang of former CIA operatives sounds inspired. Add an eclectic cast featuring some of the best actors in their golden years and the possibilities are golden indeed. READ Hollywoods latest senior moment But try as they might -- and the actors really do -- the uneven humor half-baked plot and generic action scenes keep RED from being much fun. If the story made more sense and the humor were more abundant this could have been a bona-fide winner. Instead it falls smack in the realm of forgettably mediocre. WATCH The RED trailer Earlier this year Oscar winner Helen Mirren and box-office heavyweight Bruce Willis were trotted out at Comic-Con bolstering the want-to-see factor. But Mirren mostly ends up trailing the guys along with Mary-Louise Parker the only member of the team who is not over 50. While there is some wry banter other elements undercut its effectiveness. The script is anemic and disjointed which is hardly surprising given that REDs screenwriters brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber were responsible for 2009s inert Whiteout. Willis plays Frank a former black-ops agent whose life is so empty that the highlight of his day is to make long-distance calls about his pension check. Instead of a recording he always gets Sarah (Parker) a pleasantly chatty clerk. Fortunately for the sake of their budding romance hes suddenly attacked by a team of assassins. Though hes eligible for AARP he easily fends them off and breaks into Sarahs apartment to kidnap/rescue her. (Apparently everyone on his call list is at risk.) Sarah yearns for adventure and happily accompanies Frank as he rounds up old CIA colleagues to help piece together why hes wanted dead. His pals include Joe (Morgan Freeman) now in a nursing home and Marvin (John Malkovich) a paranoid subject of one too many LSD experiments. Victoria (Helen Mirren) has traded in her assault rifle for flower shears but is quick to jump back into the fray. Hot on their trails are an ambitious CIA operative (Karl Urban) and his steely boss (Rebecca Pidgeon). Ernest Borgnine has a pleasantly surprising turn as an affable CIA records keeper. Wisdom and experience trump immature bravado a refreshing message from youth-obsessed Hollywood. And Mirren and Freeman lend the film more grace than it deserves. But the action scenes are neither thrilling nor original except for a shootout with a middle-aged woman who looks as if she should be piloting an SUV filled with Little Leaguers rather than firing massive weaponry. Willis recycles some Die Hard moves. Lately for every exhilarating action spectacle such as Machete there are at least half a dozen thudding disappointments. (Takers The A-Team The Expendables top the list.) To clarify the title stands for ""Retired and Extremely Dangerous."" More accurate ""Regrettable and Exceedingly Disposable.""

"Better RED than dead | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBetter RED than deadThe ensemble comedy thriller Red has few pretensions beyond showcasing talented mature actors at their deadpan best.Helen Mirren and John Malkovich star in RED.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 14 2010 RED (out of 4) Starring Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren John Malkovich and Karl Urban. Directed by Robert Schwentke. 110 minutes. At major theatres. PG ""This used to be a gentlemans game"" Morgan Freeman grouses to Bruce Willis in RED speaking as one frustrated former CIA spook to another. The point may be moot in this ensemble comedy of rat-tat-tat retirees who arent going gently into that good night. It does raise the question When exactly was that golden era of saintly spies? Certainly not in the past year where the titular scruffs of The Expendables and The Losers have busted heads and expended lead without regard to any rules of engagement. You might have to go as far back 75 years to Hitchcocks The 39 Steps where gentleman antagonists Robert Donat and Sir Godfrey Tearle discussed luncheon details at the point of a gun. RED which refers to a supposed CIA acronym meaning ""retired and extremely dangerous"" has few pretensions beyond showcasing some skilled mature actors at their deadpan best. Director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) and screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber have significantly lightened up on the graphic novel origins of RED making it more of a romantic satire of late-life adventure than a thriller of bloody intrigue. As such its likely to appeal more to fans of Freemans The Bucket List than to partisans of Willis Die Hard series. But with the likes of Helen Mirren John Malkovich and Brian Cox in the impressive cast which also finds room for a 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine just watching this gang having fun is reason enough to smile. RED begins as a 6 a.m. wake-up call for Willis Frank Moses a former CIA black-ops specialist living in Cleveland who hasnt take well to being put on the shelf. Hes trying to stick to a daily routine which includes the awkward telephone courting of bemused pension clerk Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) whom he may eventually get around to asking out. ""Eventually"" becomes ""suddenly"" when a squad of professional hitmen surround his house and Frank has to get on the good foot to do the bad thing again. Sarah becomes Franks unwilling travel partner as the duo hurtle around the eastern U.S. (with Toronto and New Orleans supplying most of the scenery) dodging bullets as they try to figure out who has it in for Frank. In standard road-trip fashion the trip includes stops to reel in Franks former colleagues Joe (Freeman) Victoria (Mirren) and Marvin (Malkovich) each with their own areas of specialties and personal tics. But all of them are quite capable of pulling the trigger when the occasion demands even if they may pull a muscle while doing so. They cross paths with Russian spy Ivan (Cox) who has a history with Victoria and face down both a CIA pursuer (Karl Urban) and a corporate baddie (Richard Dreyfuss) who provide a reasonable facsimile of a plot. How it all ends up is significantly less interesting than how they get there. Its a hoot to watch the elegant Mirren shift from high heels to combat boots as she gamely goes from arranging flowers to being locked and loaded. RED may be shy of gentlemen but it lives up to its acronym. ""Im not dead"" says Freeman as the bullets fly. ""Just retired.""

"Movie review Red - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review RedGuns are shoved into the hands of terrific actors in this tongue-in-cheek action movie. The result has charms but it pushes so hard that it becomes irritating.October 15 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Once seen never forgotten the experience of looking on as Helen Mirren lets loose with a machine gun is the equivalent of watching the queen of England lay waste to a crowd of unruly commoners. Its also the only aspect of ""Red"" that satisfies as it should. RED is an acronym for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" a group of former CIA agents who have been sent out to pasture in favor of younger presumably deadlier government operatives. But a series of circumstances gets them back in the game and guess what they havent so much as lost a step. Conceived of as an action comedy with a tongue-in-cheek Tarantino-lite sensibility ""Red"" cant stop itself from trying too hard to be hip. Its not that it doesnt have effective moments its that it doesnt have as many as it thinks it does. The films inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned its downright irritating. Directed by Robert Schwentke and graced with a big-name cast including Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich ""Red"" has a real weakness for pushing quirky right into the ground. As written by brothers Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber whose self-congratulatory cleverness extends even to their press kit biographies this is a film thats too pleased with itself for too little reason. That tendency is visible even in ""Reds"" opening section which introduces Frank Moses (Willis) a quiet man who spends his time staying in shape and engaging in a genteel phone flirtation with Sarah Ross ( Mary-Louise Parker) a government functionary in Kansas City who yearns for a more exciting life. Be careful what you wish for Sarah especially in a film like this. When a black-clad assault team tries to kill Frank and he deals with them without breaking a sweat we come to understand that this unassuming man is a formidable black-ops virtuoso whose government file is stamped ""Ultra Top Secret"" for a reason. What Frank comes to understand is that people are trying to kill him. Fearing Sarah who he has never met is in danger too he goes to Kansas City and kidnaps her tying her up and covering her mouth with generous swaths of duct tape a an encounter she describes in one of the films better lines as ""not my best first date."" The Frank/Sarah relationship which will surprise no one to learn improves considerably from these unpromising beginnings is one of ""Reds"" real weaknesses. Not only is it utterly predictable its hampered by been-there done-that performances by both the laconic Willis and the wacky Parker as well as a sense that the whole business is an unconvincing contrivance from the word go. Trying to figure out why all those men in black were trying to exterminate him Frank and an increasingly intrigued Sarah flit around the country making contact with Franks old comrades in arms all retired but not necessarily happy about it. In New Orleans they meet up with Joe Matheson (an under-utilized Freeman) who is surprisingly lively for someone described as being 80 years old with stage 4 liver cancer. Somewhere in the swamps of the South they come across Marvin Boggs (an over-eccentric Malkovich) a nutty paranoid whose mind was warped by way too many doses of government-administered LSD. Wait till the ""tea party"" hears about that. Best of the bunch as previously noted is Mirrens Victoria who runs a bed and breakfast in Virginia but admits that when bored ""I take the odd contract on the side."" While the other actors run hot and cold Mirren is most at ease in her role handling her lines with aplomb and firing automatic weapons like she means it. Other fine performers wander through the films ultra-complicated plot and numerous acts of comic-book-style mayhem including Brian Cox Rebecca Pidgeon Richard Dreyfuss and even the venerable Ernest Borgnine as the CIAs ancient records keeper. Too violent to be a comedy not funny enough to counterbalance all the violence the problem with ""Red"" is not that it lacks puckish charm its that there is too little of it to go around. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA mad scheme to kill a scientistJanuary 7 2010Sure Violence Is All-American but Terrorism?

"Red = retired extremely dull. Slate Sign In Sign Up Red = retired extremely dull. Red = retired extremely dull. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 14 2010 620 PM Retired Extremely Dull Malkovich Mirren and Willis as former black-ops specialists in Red. By Dana Stevens Sitting down to review Red (Summit Entertainment) a graphic-novel adaptation directed by Robert Schwentke ( The Time Travelers Wife) I felt a bit like the time-travelers wife myself. Hadnt we just been here before with Wanted Watchmen Kick-Ass? The punchy tongue-in-cheek hyperviolent action movie based on a cult comic is becoming its own mini-genre and almost all of them leave me cold in the exact same way. ( Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was an exception; I didnt love it without reservation but found it more inventive and less sadistic than its peers.) Red tells the story of a group of aging black-ops specialists who come together to expose a government conspiracy. But the creakiest things about this movie arent Bruce Willis and Helen Mirrens joints. Frank Morris (Willis) is a retired operative living alone in a spotless suburban house. Hes so bored his main joy in life is chatting with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) a phone rep at the government office that issues his pension. Frank has just cooked up an excuse to visit Sarah in Kansas City when his house is invaded by a team of masked assassins.  Frank escapes and flees to Kansas City where he kidnaps Sarah for her own good knowing that the killers will soon track them both down. (Between Knight amp; Day and this movie abduction is emerging as the new courtship technique.) Advertisement Frank and Sarah travel the country rounding up a team of crack spies whose top-secret files reside under the heading ""R.E.D.""--Retired Extremely Dangerous. Theres Joe (Morgan Freeman) a nursing-home resident with some fight still left in him; loopy conspiracy theorist Marvin (John Malkovich); former Soviet double agent Ivan (Brian Cox); and unflappable MI6 veteran Victoria (Helen Mirren). These onetime colleagues join forces to figure out why their old employer is suddenly bent on their destruction eventually uncovering a scandal involving the vice president (Julian McMahon) and a bottomlessly cynical defense contractor (Richard Dreyfuss). Though the actors are all in theory welcome company this ensemble never really gels. Bruce Willis seems competent but jaded He could turn in a deadpan-tough-guy performance of this type with his hands zip-tied behind his back and his mouth duct-taped shut. Mary-Louise Parker who essentially does work under those conditions has some slyly funny moments but the script (by brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber) has her character trusting in Willis too early. Theres no suspense and hence no sexual spark in the development of the Frank/Sarah love story. Malkovichs acid-damaged conspiracy nut--whose fevered imaginings almost inevitably turn out to be on the mark--impresses as less comic than the actor seems to have intended. Something about Malkovichs off-kilter line delivery and sour glare makes Marvin seem genuinely disturbed and disturbing. And while Mirren looks smashing while wielding a gun in an evening gown or tearing around in high-fashion snow camouflage her character doesnt appear until a good hour into the movie giving us very little time to know or care much about Victorias motivations. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I know terms like ""caring"" and ""motivation"" are probably quaint when discussing a movie of this type but as long as were being asked to spend nearly two hours rooting for these people to be better shots than the people shooting at them is it too much to ask for a reason we should take their side? Red simultaneously tries too hard and not hard enough It keeps up a steady frantic barrage of bullets blood and wisecracks but never manages to convince us that anyone involved--characters actors filmmakers or audience--is having any fun.Like Slate on Facebook.

ORourkes maxim ""age and guile beat youth innocence and a bad haircut."" In this case age not only beats youth but it uses Tasers improvised explosives and rocket-propelled grenades. Bruce Willis stars as an out-to-pasture secret agent who finds himself and a dozen fellow retirees on an assassination list. The tone is light and larky as he assembles a team of old spooks to turn the tables on their would-be executioners. But the film never achieves liftoff. It is most interesting as a spoofy comment on aging-boomer films like ""The Expendables"" or the arthritic Indiana Jones series. Its halfway between comedy and action and it doesnt quite work as either. Dont fault the cast. Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Helen Mirren Mary-Louise Parker as Willis allies are very assured in the way they hit their laugh lines and Willis is a master of droll nonchalance. And there are good straight-man turns by Karl Urban as a by-the-book CIA superagent Rebecca Pidgeon as his starchy chief and Richard Dreyfuss as a nefarious businessman. But the jokes consistently misfire. Parker plays Willis government pension clerk whom he has been shyly wooing by phone. She comes along for the ride sort of kidnapped as he hops around the country shooting people. Shes supposed to be exhilarated by this escape from her cubicle. OK maybe. But shes unbelievably eager to put herself in the line of fire. When they break into CIA headquarters on a sabotage mission she enthusiastically asks ""Whats the punishment for what were about to do?"" Told that its death she exults ""Awesome"" And that dud is the second best joke in the hopper. The films downfall is the facile screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber. The premise -- old pros can outwit whippersnappers -- is the films one and only punch line. It goes on too long and the script is shaped to accommodate repetitive action-movie set pieces. The film takes place in a make-believe world where hit squads can shoot thousands of rounds of ammunition on a suburban street at midnight and nobody wakes up. Theres always something happening but nothing to occupy your mind. RED  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for action violence and brief strong language.

Imagine Retirees killing people instead of sitting on park benches and hanging out at the library By such fresh ideas are the minds of red-blooded young moviegoers blown.""The Expendables trotted out the concept this summer and it was good dumb fun -- a nudge-nudge wink-wink 80s movie on steroids. ""RED is more self-consciously wacky more stridently in your face and more disappointing. Oh there are some laughs from the cast of pros Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren all playing ex-CIA killers put out to pasture (theyre Retired and Extremely Dangerous; thus the title) and all of them coasting a bit too comfortably. What might have been a guilty-pleasure romp is hobbled by poor direction sloppy pacing and a story line that cant decide whether its farce or a retread.The comic on which the movies based was a simpler less satiric animal that centered on the character of Frank Moses a grizzled assassin who wants to know why his old colleagues are suddenly dying. Willis grabs the role like a career lifeline and hes pretty good establishing Franks macho bona fides as well as the characters sizable tender streak.His phone flirtation with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) a drone at the US governments pension office is sweet and awkward but when he scoops her up as his accomplice early in the action ""RED announces that you wont be having a logical night at the movies. Parker gives a dreadful forced performance because her character makes no sense. Neither did Cameron Diazs role in the similar ""Knight and Day but that moved along more smoothly if with less risk.""RED is on firmer comic ground when Frank rounds up his vitamin-A Team Freeman as Joe the one-time chief operative reduced to ogling his nurses fanny at the old-age home Malkovich as a paranoid wingding convinced the black helicopters are due any minute and Mirren as a coolly elegant hit lady formerly of British Intelligence. Chipping in support is Ivan (Brian Cox) a one-time Cold War opponent turned ally out of enforced boredom.Who is killing the great assassins of America? Theres a plot and its a torturous one involving a shady arms dealer (Richard Dreyfuss) a politico (Julian McMahon) a jaw-clenching CIA boss (Rebecca Pidgeon) and her underling a junior op named Cooper whos played sympathetically by Karl Urban. Frank teases Cooper about his ""cute hair and Cooper calls Frank ""Grampa. The dialogue doesnt get much sharper than that.The movies being sold on the image of Dame Helen Mirren wreaking havoc with a machine gun bigger than she is a notion thats less incongruous than it seems. Yes the actress won her Oscar as Queen Elizabeth II but she also won two Emmys as Superintendent Jane Tennison -- hardly a shrinking violet -- in ""Prime Suspect and she previously played an assassin in the demented 2005 misfire ""Shadowboxer.In fact the conceptual hilarity of ""RED only applies if you really cant wrap your brain around someone of Mirrens advanced age (65) or Williss (55) playing action hero. The movie does bring on Ernest Borgnine for two scenes as a CIA crypt-keeper but if only it had the guts to let the 93-year-old Oscar winner uncork a little whupass. ""Whaddya wanna do tonight Marty?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a touch of smirking apathy to everything Bruce Willis does these days an attitude that reads as ""Ive already won the Hollywood game but I guess I can keep playing for everyone elses sake."" It can be a winningly intimate feeling that were all just hanging out with the actor himself like old buddies. It can also be tremendously frustrating In Red he barely bothers to change his facial expression or vocal inflection whether his character is talking about his tender crush on his pension caseworker Mary-Louise Parker or killing a room full of cannon-fodder assassins. Why bother to hire a star who doesnt show up? Adapting a Warren Ellis-penned comic series director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan The Time-Travelers Wife) brings the same sort of casualness to Red. When a heavily armed kill team attempts to take out laid-back retired CIA black-ops specialist Willis he kidnaps the terrified Parker to keep her from becoming a target and seeks out the elderly associates of his spy-adventures heyday including Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Helen Mirren and Brian Cox as a former Russian adversary. While they attempt to puzzle out the conspiracy that led to the kill order current CIA agent Karl Urban doing his best ice-faced Terminator impression tries to track Willis down and finish the job. Many shootouts result but between action setpieces the characters engage in the languid pause-filled conversations of retirees with no commitments or deadlines in sight. This gives the films first half-hour a charming ambling feel but becomes increasingly awkward as Red continually veers between high energy and low. Theres a restrained cool in pretending that these characters are so capable that they never feel pressure or break a sweat but if they arent challenged whats the point? Part of it is cheap thrills of course; this is a capable experienced cast with extensive acting chops and its trashy fun watching them descend to the level of the material which has Mirren in a sleek ball gown capably letting rip with a 50-caliber machine gun and Malkovich toting around a giant squeaky stuffed pig. Red is often enjoyable when its just observing its cast going through the action-movie motions but Schwentke never decides whether hes making this movie for relaxed seniors or hyper misanthropic amoral teens.

Willis plays a black-ops veteran who is retired - until someone decides to riddle his house with rounds of ammunition and artillery fire.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 15 2010Beware people Flirtatious phone patter seems harmless enough - two strangers batting innuendos late into the night - but it can be hazardous to your health.One minute youre on the phone separated from the husky-voiced gent by hundreds of miles. Next thing you know youve been drugged and abducted and folks are chasing you in cars and helicopters shooting at you with guns and rockets.Thats how things shake out for Mary-Louise Parker anyway gamely playing a lonely government pensions clerk in Red a breakneck (for a time) slapstick action pic adapted from the DC Comics book.Like Cameron Diaz caught up in Tom Cruises spy-guy mayhem in Knight and Day Parker is the innocent tagalong to Bruce Willis black-ops veteran in Red. His name is Frank Moses and hes quit and gone underground but on a Christmas Eve in Cleveland someone decides to riddle his house with rounds of ammunition and artillery fire.In the kind of screen-writing contrivance that a romp like this is allowed (call it ballistic license) it now becomes necessary for Frank to fly off break into the apartment of Parkers Sarah and drag her along as he goes tearing around the country a slick high-tech killer (Karl Urban) hot on the trail.Red it turns out is an acronym for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" - a description that fits Frank to a T. Frank is RED and so too are the members of his old CIA team a group he now reassembles (shades of The Expendables) to go after whomever it is thats trying to annihilate him. Enter John Malkovich as a paranoid loon living in the Florida swamps Morgan Freeman as a restless rest-home resident and Helen Mirren as an ace assassin. (Trivia note Dame Helen has been here before starring as a hit woman in Lee Daniels kooky Philadelphia-shot Shadowboxer.)Directed by Robert Schwentke (Flightplan The Time Travelers Wife) Red has the cool swaggering vibe of an action movie where the actors and the audience know that nothing is really on the line. And at a certain point - probably around the time a visit is paid to a cartoonishly sinister Richard Dreyfuss (an evil defense contractor) - the whole movie runs out of gas. Too long too busy too loud and too reliant on slam-bang stunt work Reds glib dialogue and sinister government scenarios begin to wear.But Willis keeps his smirk on anyway and Parker wry and flaky stays for the ride.

"RED cast has fun with yet another CIA movie - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs RED cast has fun with yet another CIA movie2 1/2 starsOctober 14 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticOh my God theyve shot Dame Helen Mirren Realizing the Oscar-winning actress is playing a part and not herself the thought nonetheless is inescapable when Mirrens ex- CIA agent takes a bullet in ""RED."" I mean How dare they? ""RED"" stands for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" though ""Reasonably Entertaining Diversion"" works too. For an hour or so this PG-13 adaptation of a far grislier graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner strikes an engagingly sadistic tone. Bruce Willis brings his uber-relaxed authority to retired good-guy assassin Frank Moses whose former employers are trying to kill him for reasons vaguely specified. He gathers the old gang together for one last showdown against those trying to off them. The string-puller is a sniveling industrialist ( Richard Dreyfuss) using the CIA as ""his own personal hit squad."""");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt; We have been here before. We were here most recently in this summers high-priced junker ""Knight and Day"" in which secret agent Tom Cruise kidnapped Cameron Diaz and eliminated hundreds of disposable assailants on the government payroll. In ""RED"" Frank kidnaps the pension employee played by Mary-Louise Parker whose character is gagged tied to a bedpost (in a strategically low-cut outfit) and dragged around like groceries. But shes a fine sport and grows to love the adventure. The actresss uniquely twisted comic timing helps this movies sense of humor overcome its lust for gunfire. Mirren adds the class as Victoria former paramour of the Russian ally played by Brian Cox whose performance proves theres no ham like well-cured Scottish ham. Morgan Freeman twinkles as an old fox dealing with cancer and the confines of a retirement home depressing stuff after the life that late he led. John Malkovich wackos around wittily as a CIA colleague who went through one too many LSD experiments. At one point Malkovich bats baseball style an airborne missile back at his attacker who is summarily disintegrated. If the movie proves successful at the box office this sight gag will be the reason why. Screenwriters Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber expand freely on the bare bones of the Ellis graphic novel inventing a new back story (something to do with Guatemalan war crimes) and lightening up the protagonist. In the original Frank is a hollow shell who its implied assassinated John F. Kennedy. Little of that sort of thing has survived the page-to-screen translation. Frank isnt a dimensional character any more than the characters in the Angelina Jolie gamers delight ""Wanted"" were characters. Graphic novels offer their cinematic adapters a pre-storyboarded look along with plenty of ideas of how bullets entering skulls can make a pretty red splat on the nearest wall plus a hint of a story to satisfy our old-fashioned need for narrative. But there are limitations serious ones. Movie adaptations of graphic novels as disparate as ""Road to Perdition"" to ""Sin City"" can seem awfully thin. Around the midpoint ""RED"" starts repeating itself and spinning its wheels and looking for an ending well before the ending arrives. The actors have considerable fun with it though I cant be the only one who would prefer not to see another movie containing the line ""Wow. You really are CIA"" until the summer of 2011. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of action violence and brief strong language) Cast Bruce Willis (Frank); Morgan Freeman (Joe); John Malkovich (Marvin); Helen Mirren (Victoria); Mary-Louise Parker (Sarah); Karl Urban (Cooper); Brian Cox (Ivan) Credits Directed by Robert Schwentke; written by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber based on the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner; produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Mark Vahradian.

Red Good Director Robert Schwentke. Cast Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman Mary-Louise Parker Helen Mirren. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence and brief strong language. Qamp;A Helen Mirren | Qamp;A Karl Urban Morgan Freeman to receive AFI honor Spotlight Bruce Willis | Helen Mirren | John Malkovich Hot older actress that still got it So its kind of nice to savor the performances in ""Red"" in which such old hands as Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren poke fun at both the spy-movie genre and the prospect of getting old. (Theyre joined in a couple of scenes by Ernest Borgnine 93 who has been old a long time.) And its not all big fun at the old folks home (literally in Freemans characters case). Mary-Louise Parker has some of the best moments in the film and although shes not quite young enough to be say Willis daughter she could have baby-sat his kids. Based on the graphic novel ""Red"" isnt a great movie but its great fun and if that sounds like damning with faint praise you take things too seriously. Willis plays Frank Moses retired from the CIA and living alone - like really alone - in the suburbs. His social life is barren enough that he discards his paychecks so he can call Sarah (Parker) an operator to get replacements. Franks sad little life is interrupted however when black-clad assassins creep into his home in the middle of the night to kill him. They dont suceed of course. Although hes retired Franks still on his game. Soon he has kidnapped Sarah (for her safety he explains) and set off to round up his old friends and colleagues. Theres Joe (Freeman) busying himself by flirting with the staff of the nursing home; LSD-casualty Marvin (Malkovich) dosed several times daily by the CIA back in the day and now a raving paranoiac; and Victoria (Mirren) a cold-hearted assassin whos making flower arrangements when the gang catches up to her. They are in Joes words getting the band back together to figure out whos trying to kill them before actually being killed. The plot such as it is involves younger agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) chasing Frank and his pals around as well as a defense contractor (Richard Dreyfuss) with murky motives; and what seems to tie things together (very loosely) a secret mission in Guatemala years before. Details details. You wont get far trying to figure it all out - plausibility isnt a prerequisite given the source material - but youll have fun watching the characters try to. Willis career now evidently consists of looking bemused and making occasional wisecracks. He does that well here. Freeman of course is stately and solid. Malkovich is even more over-the-top than usual; director Robert Schwentke wouldnt have hurt things by reining him in a bit. Mirren always is a delight. But Parker is the great surprise. In what could have been a throwaway role shes caustic and withering but because Sarah is attracted to Frank up for whatever the next insane adventure might be. In ""Red"" she doesnt have to wait long. Happily neither do we.

"Red (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Red (PG-13) Big-time action is better with Oscar-caliber actors Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald10/13/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Chief among the pleasures of Red a sleek giant-scale action picture populated by formidable actors is the sight of Helen Mirren elegantly dressed in a form-fitting white dress firing away on a gigantic machine gun that makes a noise as loud as thunder her expression a combination of concentration and conviction. Woe to him who foolishly stands within her crosshairs. Her target in that scene? The Vice President of the United States. Red which has been adapted with style and wit by director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan The Time Travelers Wife) from the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner excels at bringing on the high-power pyrotechnics. Theres a terrific tactile thrill in an early sequence in which Bruce Willis home is sprayed by bullets from assassins guns that are so powerful they knock down the entire front wall of his house. As an orchestrator of shoot-em-up mayhem Schwentke is the anti-Michael Bay - he directs large complicated setpieces in which you can always follow the action clearly and you always know where every character stands in relation to the others. Hes helped considerably by the fact that his four leads - Willis Mirren John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman as former CIA black-ops agents forced out of retirement ... are often the ones doing the shooting and trading quips between reloads. The plot of Red which was written by brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber is a twisty complicated thing in which the aging quartet - all deemed ""red or retired and extremely dangerous - reunites to uncover a conspiracy involving a series of executions a cover-up in Guatemala dating back to 1982 and a reason to give Ernest Borgnine (alive and kicking who knew?) an oppor tunity to grace movie screens again with his immensely likable presence. Red is also a sort of romantic comedy about the meet-cute relationship between Willis and a romance-novel addict lonelyheart (Mary-Louise Parker) who is swept up against her will into his outlandish adventure. Malkovich playing the king of all paranoid schizophrenics has a grand time hamming it up as a conspiracy nut who cant stand being reminded of his age (in one of the movies best scenes an enemy assassin makes the big mistake of calling him ""old man). Freeman lighter and funnier than usual obviously relishes the opportunity to cut loose and not have to emanate maturity and wisdom. Schwentke repeatedly puts his characters into cliffhanger scenarios from which there appears to be no possible escape - this could have been called Mission Impossible The Golden Years complete with a break-in at CIA headquarters in Langley - and the actors treat the material with all the gravity it deserves (none). Eventually Red eventually starts to overstay its welcome and the movies plot is resolved in a disappointingly mundane scene that is the textbook definition of anti-climactic. This is also the sort of film in which characters get shot and just brush off the injury as if it were a mosquito bite. But compared to such generic flashy duds as Knight and Day or The Expendables Red goes down like a flute of fine champagne. Heres how its done youngsters.

"Red | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red ) Red (United States 2010) October 12 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Not to be confused with the early-90s Kieslowski film of the same name. Definitely not. Sometimes casting makes a difference. Under the stewardship of the same director with the same screenplay Red might be an enjoyable-but-forgettable late year action/comedy - the kind of thing one might bypass in the theater recognizing that the multiplex is just a brief stop on the movies road to DVD. However with so many A-list actors fighting for space on the marquee its impossible to view Red so dismissively. Its a lot of fun and because of the high quality of the cast theres no need to feel guilty about praising such an inherently silly motion picture. Like The Expendables this is fast-paced high octane entertainment for the AARP crowd. It never takes itself too seriously which is a good thing because its a stretch to imagine some of these actors doing the stuff theyre called upon to do. All thats missing is a cameo from Sean Connery. Despite being in his mid-50s (when did he get that old?) Bruce Willis is in his element playing an ex-CIA operative who knows how to out-think out-shoot and out-hit virtually any enemy. Having Willis in the lead for Red (actually an acronym that stands for ""Retired - Extremely Dangerous"") is unsurprising. But the rest of the cast where theres not a usual suspect to be found may raise the occasional eyebrow. ""Eclectic"" is one way to describe the supporting roster Nancy Botwin from Weeds Nelson Mandela the guy in whose mind John Cusack mucked around the Queen of England the original Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecktor Matt Hooper Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy one of the original Dirty Dozen and Mrs. David Mamet. Wow. Viewed from a high level theres nothing special about Red which involves dirty government operatives conspiracies and more empty shell casings than one could uncover at a shooting range. Its basically 24 without Kiefer Sutherland and with a healthy sense of humor. Still its worth the price of admission to see Helen Mirren hoisting a big-ass gun. Reds conceit of experience trumping youth will play well to a portion of the demographic - those who applauded Clint Eastwoods geriatrics-in-space story Space Cowboys. This time instead of astronauts its spies. The level of suspension of disbelief isnt all that different. When Red opens Frank Morse (Willis) is phone-flirting with a woman hes never met by the name of Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). Hes in Cleveland where the boredom of retirement is getting him down and shes the claims officer in Kansas City who is handling problems hes having with his pension checks. Luckily for Frank his life is about to get a lot more interesting. One night after he has decorated the house for Christmas a hit team sneaks inside under the cover of dark and discovers that retirement hasnt diminished Franks wits or his aim. Soon hes on the run with his main pursuer being CIA super-agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) whos ruthless but unaware of Franks reputation. After traveling to Kansas City to kidnap Sarah (who is in danger because of her association with Frank) he begins rounding up members of his old team 80-year old Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) who can still fire a gun despite having stage 4 liver cancer; lunatic Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) whose extreme paranoia is not without justification; KGB higher-up Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) who appreciates the irony of cooperating with his former enemies; and former MI6 agent Victoria (Helen Mirren) whose retirement isnt as sedate as it initially appears. Their goal is simple unmask the people trying to kill them. The means by which this can be accomplished is less clear and is made considerably more difficult by the dogged pursuit of Cooper. Red is based on the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name and has the kind of tongue-in-cheek tone one often associates with comic books. The action is in earnest and theres a lot of it but theres plenty of wisecracking in between (and occasionally during). The film requires a lighter defter touch than director Robert Schwentkes previous effort The Time Travelers Wife but he achieves it. Having such a skilled cast doesnt hurt. One thing thats refreshing about these actors - consummate professionals all - is that despite the potential claim that theyre ""slumming"" none of them phones it in. They invest themselves in the roles and we have no trouble accepting the unlikely sights of John Malkovich facing down a woman with a rocket launcher in a duel or Helen Mirren doing impolite things with a variety of firearms. There are no Oscar nominations waiting in the wings but these performances are damn good. I could mention a few similarities with Tom Cruises Knight and Day especially with respect to the relationship between Frank and Sarah but considering how poorly Knight and Day was received perhaps its best not to dwell on any passing likenesses. Summit Entertainment is relying on Red to be one of their late 2010 performers and theres no reason it shouldnt meet expectations. Its fast moving energetic doesnt cheat adrenaline junkies by being too jokey and offers a generally fun two hours. The strength of the cast and the ability of Schwentke to choreograph coherent action sequences are bonuses. Its hard to imagine Red not bringing some life to what has thus far been a listless autumn box office. If I wasnt a film critic this is a movie Id still want to see.

Comic. Book. Movie. Ever.Not the best. Not the worst. Just the classiest--Helen Mirren (and Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich and Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss) can spruce up any pulp. As far as comic-book adaptations go though Red is a little closer to the bright side of so-so--somewhere between lets say Iron Man 2 and Ghost World on the patented Fanboy-oh-boyometer.Based on a Warren Ellis three-issue toss-off Red barely acknowledges its roots. The original--a straight-ahead tale about a retired Company hit man named Frank Moses next on the CIAs to-do list because hes an embarrassing relic--was bloody and humorless with Frank eventually storming Langley and gutting all comers. Its big-screen counterpart written by the brothers who made a mockery of the graphic novel Whiteout (Jon and Erich Hoeber) and directed by the man who made The Time Travelers Wife (Robert Schwentke) is all grins and giggles--a kid-friendly Kick-Ass . . . or lets be honest an AARP-friendly Kick-Ass. (Holy shit theres Ernest Borgnine as a character called The Records Keeper) Its messy but hardly gory. Goofy? Thats more like it.And its absolutely thoroughly enjoyable. Red rocks like some giddy mash-up of Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World The Manchurian Candidate Three Days of the Condor and every movie ever made in which a hired gun yanks at his holster for One Last Stand to kill the one who brung him in the first place. Which is fine--nothing wrong with an affable movie about trained killers played by Oscar winners on paid vacation. Its only afterward when you realize nothing actually happened in between road trips and explosions. Plots hardly the point here--Reds a travelogue its map to the finish line pockmarked with the occasional explosion and a few drops of blood as Frank tries to figure out why he a retired agent has rocketed to the top of the agencys to-hit list.Bruce Willis plays Frank ex-CIA now living in Cleveland where he whittles away the days in a snowbound modest suburban home. Willis doesnt have the deep-felt sadness of the comics grizzled deeply wrinkled eccentric who just wishes to be left alone; his Frank is more John McClane in early retirement a dude secretly itching to get back in the killin bidness. When the bloodthirsty barrels-blazing Men in Black come calling at 330 in the morning Franks wide awake and ready for them--the alarm clocks gone off time to get back to work.And so Frank begins his trudge across America to get the band back together again and find out what the what is going on. First stop is Kansas City home of the government retirement-check-sending drone Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) with whom Franks had a longtime phone relationship. She loves her trashy spy novels then lo and behold shes living one When Frank shows up he brings with him tagalong assassins who think the two are in cahoots--and their long-scheduled date becomes a hostage crisis. Parker is Reds version of Justin Long--the sidekick intended to young up a movie that pit-stops in a New Orleans retirement home where Morgan Freemans Joe spends his time ogling nurses asses as they adjust the TV antenna.Next stop Florida where Willis and Parker find Malkovich--an acid-damaged mind-controlled paranoid short fuse--living in an underground bunker accessible through a dead cars trunk. In D.C. they find Coxs retired Russian spy Ivan (of course) shooting vodka (of course) while reminiscing about the Cold War ""I miss the old days"" he tells Frank. ""I havent killed anyone in years."" To which Frank replies with tear-stained sincerity ""Thats sad.""From there its off to Virginia and CIA HQ. Frank figures the only way to find out why the Companys trying to kill him is to break in and well ask. The answer? Something to do with Guatemala in 1981 hard to say. Even the man sent to finish him off cant make heads or tails of his mission. It all ends with a Big Finish in Chicago involving the vice-president a hotel speaking engagement and what may or may not be an assassination attempt featuring Mirren a .50-caliber machine gun and Malkovich sprinting down an alley at top speed with a Flavor Flav clock and some dynamite strapped to his chest.This isnt an old-fogies Oceans Eleven; it takes a good long while for the old gang to get back together. Mirren as the regal assassin who still takes jobs on the side when not flower-arranging doesnt show up till late in the movie at which point shes asked to do little more than point and shoot (and does a fine job of it). Freeman too disappears for a long stretch till he shows up again dressed up as a ""General Baptiste"" who looks more like a member of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club band gone AWOL. Its a comic-book movie all right. Heavy emphasis on ""comic.""

The jokes occasionally fall flat and the action scenes rarely sizzle but only a curmudgeon could entirely resist the laid-back charms of ""Red"" an amusing light-footed caper about a team of aging CIA veterans rudely forced out of retirement. Putting a comic spin on Warren Ellis and Cully Hamners more downbeat graphic novel this goofy diversion gets by with a cast of pros who can steal a scene and wield semiautomatic weapons with seasoned aplomb. While a toplining Bruce Willis ensures some young viewer turnout Summit release will fare best with older audiences in likely quick playoff and solid ancillary. With a principal cast whose average age is about 63 (thats not including 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine who has a brief role as a basement-level CIA employee) ""Red"" reps an older wiser variation on one of this years most popular action-movie subgenres; think of it as an AARP-friendly version of ""The Losers"" ""The A-Team"" or ""The Expendables"" which similarly pitted an elite team of professional assassins against a far more pernicious enemy. But while the film boasts its fair share of explosions and smashed-up automobiles its hardly another 80s-style shoot-em-up. A story about killers who are continually made aware of their own mortality even as they seek to recapture the adrenaline-pumping excitement of their youth ""Red"" manages to get at some of the basic frustrations of old age in an entirely sincere and good-humored manner giving it a tone that if not exactly elegiac is more bittersweet than one usually expects from this sort of fare. The first scene makes explicit the films concerns as Frank Moses (Willis) places a phone call to report a missing retirement check; this turns out to be a mere excuse to speak with pension administrator Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) with whom hes become smitten from afar. But when Frank expertly fends off a squad of hitmen who raid his house one evening its clear hes no ordinary lonely bachelor. Formerly a black-ops agent for the CIA now deemed ""retired and extremely dangerous"" (the classification that gives the film its title) Frank must go back into action and find out who wants him dead. With Sarah clearly in danger Frank kidnaps her (something she submits to with minimal fuss given the circumstances) and takes her on a whirlwind tour of the U.S. from New York to Mobile Ala. to agency headquarters in Langley Va. Significantly changed from the source material Jon and Erich Hoebers screenplay lays out an internal CIA conspiracy whose particulars are neither surprising nor all that interesting; even as the plot thickens to include a Halliburton-style defense contractor (led by a Dick Cheney-channeling Richard Dreyfuss) and a long-ago secret mission in Guatemala it never rises above the level of boilerplate. Fortunately as directed with low-key assurance by Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"" ""The Time Travelers Wife"") ""Red"" works primarily as an actors showcase and it experiences an immediate spike in energy humor and warmth once Franks former colleagues come out of the woodwork. These include old rascal Joe (Morgan Freeman) now holed up in a retirement home; paranoid crackpot Marvin (John Malkovich) whose craziest suspicions are invariably confirmed; elegant sophisticated Victoria (Helen Mirren) an expert at concealing weapons under her floral arrangements; and Russian spy Ivan (Brian Cox) whose taste for vodka is matched only by his affection for Victoria. It scarcely matters that these actors are never particularly believable as cold-blooded killers; part of the incongruous fun of Mirrens performance for example stems from watching the actress ever so regally fire a machine gun and Malkovichs shenanigans are so amusingly over-the-top that the question of realism never enters the equation. Yet even as Schwentke drolly extracts laughs from his characters various quirks and murderous impulses he takes quite seriously their mixed feelings about where their career sacrifices have left them at this late stage. Once again making the issue of his own age central to the narrative (as he did so gamely in 2007s ""Live Free or Die Hard"") Willis heartily battles his way through numerous opponents -- most impressively the young CIA hotshot on his tail (effectively played with a permanent scowl by Karl Urban) -- while also conveying his inner romantic. As Franks civilian love interest the appealing Parker manages to be memorable in an underwritten role by seeming no less loopy than the company she keeps. Toronto and New Orleans stand in capably for the productions many locations (signaled by picture-postcard graphics at each new destination). The decision to have the characters wear parkas in cold-weather cities is merely one of costume designer Susan Lyalls inspired touches; Christophe Becks low-key score amusingly suggests that of a Bond movie on Prozac.

Daily Edition Login to download RED Film Review 719 PM PDT 10/12/2010 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Retired-spy action comedy keeps the goofiness in check. TWITTER Smirks meet semi-automatics in ""Red"" a comics-derived action flick that offers self-conscious casting and a wink here and there without feeling as jokey as say ""Knight and Day."" Although tailor-made for genre fans it benefits from flavors of humor and romance that keep its appeal from being fanboy-only. The pic makes the most of its premise in which valuable CIA operatives must return to action after having settled or not into various stages of retirement. Some take to it comically (Morgan Freemans Joe subversive in an old-age home) and some pragmatically while Bruce Willis Frank sits alone in intrigue-free suburbia making up reasons to call a help-desk operator (Mary-Louise Parker) whose sassy-sweet voice has become the entirety of his social life. Willis isnt bored for long of course Assassins with unknown motives force him to go on the run kidnap Parker for her own safety and round up old colleagues to figure out whos trying to wipe them out. But those wry almost poignant opening scenes make up for the occasional generic moments to come. Screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber try to put a spin on this not-unfamiliar spy-vs.-spy stuff -- beyond the novelty that came straight from the comic -- and director Robert Schwentke delivers the requisite action without trying to reinvent the wheel. But what keeps the movie going is the gameness of the cast some of whom strike a perfect balance between self-consciousness and credulity. Willis might benefit the most in a part other films have tried and often failed to craft for him and Parker gives the movie more than she gets When she finally accepts having been dragged into this mess her character embraces the danger with a flirtatious relish that reminds us that this is all supposed to be fun. Even the more cartoonish performances like John Malkovichs acid-damaged paranoiac fit the movies vision of the vanished wild-and-woolly heyday of spycraft. The actual mechanics of the plot might eventually get so convoluted they have to be accepted on faith but the spirit of ""Red"" rarely falters.
