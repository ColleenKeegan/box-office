Initial come-on is promising but the script copes with a lack of momentum by ramping up soap-opera hysteria. Pic was released locally last year to mixed reviews but solid B.O. Youth-oriented fests may take a look. Using American pics like ""Coyote Ugly"" as inspiration Indonesian mainstream meller ""Virgin"" is a try-too-hard taboo-breaker that becomes merely trying. Initial come-on is promising but the script copes with a lack of momentum by ramping up soap-opera hysteria. Pic was released locally last year to mixed reviews but solid B.O. Youth-oriented fests may take a look as younger teens everywhere will relate. Three Jakarta high school girls with sex on their mind encounter dilemmas from pregnancy to prostitution. Central protag the sensible Biyani (Laudya Cynthia Bella) runs away from her dysfunctional home to find refuge with a non-interfering Islamic uncle. In this safe space a frequently tear-stricken Biyani writes about the predicaments of her friends. Credible first hour gives way to a frantic tone that feels like the imaginative and fiercely virginal Biyani was writing the script as the movie goes along. Helming is uneven but enthusiastic thesping partly compensates for the script deficiencies. Editing is energetic other tech credits low-budget rough and theres a catchy pop song about the value of virgo. VirginIndonesia ProductionA PT Kharisma Starvision Plus production.

Steve Carell best known as the non-sequitur-spouting moron in Anchorman... plays the titular Andy who has spent the four decades during which hes not been having sex amassing an awesome collection of superhero figurines (many in their original packaging) and making egg salad sandwiches. His colleagues think hes a serial killer but after witnessing his terrible attempt at sex-talk during a game of poker realise the problems much worse hes a virgin. Something must be done.  It sounds like the plot of a terrible sex comedy but first-time director Judd Apatow is an experienced writer and producer with the fine titles of Anchorman... Larry Sanders and Freaks and Geeks to his name. Here he steers the plot away from the crude and the cliched (one round of gay jokes excepted) and although it seems he couldnt bring himself to leave any gags on the cutting-room floor the film wears its two hours well. At its best it resembles one of those classic early-80s comedies starring Steve Martin - the thinking mans Woody Allen - boasting an acute mix of desperation dignity lunacy and indecorous wit. Carell gives his sweet-faced dweeb character unexpected depth while Catherine Keener makes much of the only female role written with anything approaching interest.

Or at least falling out of your seat laughing. Steve Carell (left) gets a little help with the ladies from one of his buddies Paul Rudd in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Universal Studios Before this starring role Steve Carell has been mostly a movie scene-stealer. As a stuffed-shirt newscaster hilariously spouting gibberish Carell upstaged Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty. And he stole Anchorman from Will Ferrell with his turn as a dimwitted weatherman. Some of Carells meatiest roles have been on TV as the obnoxious boss in The Office and as a correspondent for The Daily Show. Carell is now a major comedic force. With this awkward middle-aged character which he expanded from a Second City comedy troupe sketch he has landed on the ideal role to showcase his talents. Billboards showing Carell with wide eyes eager grin smoothed hair and crisply ironed shirt capture his boyishly geeky but endearing character. In contrast to that innocent sunny photo the movie has a host of raunchy moments. But it is not an indictment of virginity. Carells randy buddies (Paul Rudd Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) eventually come around to understanding his decision. Carell plays Andy Stitzer a dedicated collector of fantasy action figures who rides his bike to work at an electronics store and after hours watches TVs Survivor with elderly neighbors. He has had a few girlfriends but things never quite took off romantically. Over the years his bad luck with women has morphed into resignation. He tells his pals ""I respect women. I respect them so much that I completely stay away from them."" About the movie The 40-Year-old Virgin    (out of four) Stars Steve Carell Catherine Keener Paul Rudd Seth Rogen Romany Malco Jane Lynch Director Judd Apatow Distributor Universal Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Rated R for pervasive sexual content language and some drug use Opens Friday nationwide His friends are hellbent on ending his unlucky streak. He meets a woman he likes (Catherine Keener) but his pals urge him to gain some experience first with a few free-spirited gals. Those disastrous efforts provide some of the movies most amusing moments along with the scene of his chest-hair waxing thats been featured in trailers and promos. Andy lives in an ordered risk-free world though hes not an all-out loser. But he is immature and set in his ways which makes for plenty of laughs. His collaboration with the trio of macho co-workers -- several of the scenes seem to be improvised -- is inspired. The movies only major flaw is stealing its treacly ending from a popular DVD. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is consistently funnier than the summers next-best comedy Wedding Crashers. Its closer in spirit to zany good-natured films such as Theres Something About Mary and The Jerk. Carell accomplishes the task of being sweet-natured without becoming cloying. Its worth making a date with The 40-Year-Old Virgin. You wont go home disappointed.

Whether this new experience made me a better person is debatable; whether actor/co-writer Steve Carell (who has said in interviews that the waxing scene complete with shrieks and droplets of blood was not faked) was similarly enriched is even more so. Nonetheless this scene -- which is drawn out for so long you can practically see his chest hairs grow back again -- is the comic centerpiece of ""Virgin"" which could have been a very funny 80-minute movie except that its trapped in a not-quite-so-funny two-hour movie. There are laughs to be sure and lots of little character bits that work very well; but in between theres padding and empty dialogue and an ending that takes an eternity. Between this movie and ""Wedding Crashers"" you cant help but wonder -- are directors of Hollywood comedies being paid by the minute these days? Anyway you dont need to be a rocket scientist or a waxer to know what this movies about Carell his hair neatly combed and his polo shirts precisely buttoned plays -- you guessed it -- a 40-year-old virgin named Andy Stitzer. Hes a rather sweet fellow who enjoys playing the tuba collecting action figures (in the original packaging so as to maximize their value) and chatting with his colleagues at Smart Tech the electronics superstore where he works. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" with Steve Carell Catherine Keener Paul Rudd Romany Malco Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks Leslie Mann Jane Lynch Kat Dennings. Directed by Judd Apatow from a screenplay by Apatow and Carell. 120 minutes. Rated R for pervasive sexual content language and some drug use. Several theaters. But theres something odd in the way he awkwardly joins the after-work guy banter. ""Oh yeah"" he says in a tone just this side of Austin Powers telling his co-workers how he likes to ""get down with sex all the time."" Carells delivery is very funny here; his voice elaborately casual his wording carefully chosen but entirely terribly wrong. Quickly the guys figure it out Theres a virgin in their midst and they immediately plot to remedy the situation. And off we go through the raunchy-romantic-comedy cliche machine the vomit scene the speed-dating the condom problems the drunk driving the foul-mouthed buddies. Apatow has assembled a fine comedic cast and they bring freshness to some of this Paul Rudd has a goofball energy as lovelorn David; Seth Rogen is droopily deadpan as slacker Cal. And the wonderfully dry Catherine Keener as Andys love interest Trish single-handedly raises the movies believability quotient. The screenwriters never get around to telling us why this smart lovely woman would have any interest in dweeby Andy but Keener performs with such naturalness and conviction you almost buy it. Thats where ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" disarms us -- it is at its heart a sweet-natured romantic comedy. Unfortunately you have to clear away a fair bit of debris to find that heart. If you stick it out to the end though youll be rewarded with perhaps the most random musical number ever to hit celluloid. Its sung and danced with great flair (if not great technique) by the cast and its so much fun I was almost tempted to forgive ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" its flaws. Almost but not quite.

All Rights Reserved. less VIRGIN19 STEVE CARELL stars as Andy the title character in the comedy The 40 Year-Old Virgin who stands a chance of breaking his losing streak when he begins romancing single mom Trish (CATHERINE KEENER). ... more Hilarious farce explores virgin territory -- comedy for young single guys 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The 40-Year-Old Virgin Comedy. Starring Steve Carell Catherine Keener Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen. Directed by Judd Apatow. (Rated R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hollywood occasionally tries to craft a male version of the chick flick and for the most part fails miserably. For every successful attempt at a romantic comedy aimed at men -- ""Swingers"" and ""Chasing Amy"" come to mind -- there are 10 films such as ""Hitch"" which is really an estrogen-saturated date movie fiendishly disguised as something guys might enjoy. Veteran screenwriter Judd Apatow beats the odds with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" a love story that gets the single male culture down so honestly and unapologetically that it cant help but push the boundaries of political correctness. Despite a very lowbrow premise the profanity-packed script is hilarious and it also has a good heart. Apatow has always been kind of a tease. Hes become known recently as a television martyr who creates outstanding series (including ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"") that are promptly canceled just as viewers are getting hooked. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is Apatows debut as a feature film director. Co-written by former ""Daily Show"" correspondent Steve Carell who plays the virgin the movie features a large roster of talented comedy actors and great dialogue for everyone to work with. Carell is Andy Stitzer an electronics superstore worker who lives a simple life collecting action figures watching ""Survivor"" with his elderly neighbors and riding a bike to work. (One example of this films meticulous detail when it comes to dorkiness Carell uses hand signals before making turns.) All of Andys co-workers assume his strangeness means hes a serial killer but when they find out hes never had sex they champion his cause. Most of the movie chronicles his liaisons with a series of women including a free spirit played by Catherine Keener. While men in the movies rarely converse the way they do in real life ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is the exception. Early in the film when Andys co- workers find out hes a virgin they dont ostracize him. They make him a mixed tape of porn and pledge to get him laid -- just as your co-workers would in the same situation. Although the scene everyone will be talking about is Andys botched chest wax (which Carell endured in real life and which features a symphony of foul language that would fit nicely in ""The Aristocrats"") some of the best moments are throwaway lines. Theres no ""you complete me"" and ""you make me want to be a better man"" in this film but there is a convincing rant where Andys salesman friend David (Paul Rudd) laments the constant stream of Michael McDonald videos playing on all the stores televisions. And after all these years its nice that someone finally wrote a punch line at the expense of the 1980s progressive rock group Asia. Instead of creating an unbelievable villain (see ""Wedding Crashers"") or a contrived plot involving an inheritance or a bankrupt community center (see almost every other comedy of the past 10 years) ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" just kind of grooves along giving Andy and his friends plenty of entertaining situations to riff off including a speed-dating session that should put an end to that fad once and for all. Most of the best scenes in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" feature a lot of blunt talk which may upset girlfriends and wives who like to believe men spend idle time between poker hands talking about their feelings. And without any bad guys theres no way to end the movie except to let it fizzle out or invent a ""Threes Company""-style misunderstanding. The makers of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" choose the latter and the final few scenes are the worst in the film which is already too long for a light comedy. But these are small complaints easy to overlook when you cant stop laughing. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is the funniest film of the summer and if youre a guy it just might take the sting off that time she made you sit through ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" -- Advisory This film contains graphic language sex and nudity. Former Doobie Brother Michael McDonald and members of the super group Asia (specifically the Steve Howe Carl Palmer John Wetton and Geoff Downs lineup) should also avoid this movie.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post That is the gist of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" directed by Judd Apatow and co-written with star Steve Carell (formerly of ""The Daily Show""). Its a running joke that has some charm but gets exercised to the point of near exhaustion. Andy lives in an apartment packed with collectible toys. A comfy leather gaming chair sits near a widescreen television. The one thing that suggests he may make some woman a fine little hubby one day is the restaurant-style breakfasts Andy makes before heading off to his job as a stock clerk at the Smart Tech electronics store. Perpetual boy serial killer or gay guy wonder some of his co-workers. When Andy accidentally outs himself to three co-workers his newfound pals want to help him end his drought. Paul Rudd Romany Malco and Seth Rogen play Andys tutors David Ray and Cal. Each has his own theories about women. None of them are much good. Most of them cannot be repeated in a family newspaper. Chances are Andy will fare better with Trisha (Catherine Keener) if he avoids their advice like the plague of loser guidance it is. David talks lovey-dovey sentiments that he punctuates with diatribe. He has yet to get over a breakup that happened two years ago. Tattooed bearded Cal also flying solo through the movie offers an approach that works some with Beth (Elizabeth Banks). Answer all of her questions with a question he advises. The result is a ""whos on first"" routine. That it works even a tiny bit should have been a warning. Ray who is African-American offers the most aggressive strategies. This ham- handed character is also responsible for much of the movies bluest language and dodgiest strategies for scoring. Two actors playing Pakistani co-workers are equally klutzy. ""The Daily Show"" which made such fine use of Carell has been criticized for having no folk of color. Now that weve seen what could become of them we should be thankful for their absence. Race feels like virgin territory for the writers of this comedy. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is another in the collection of flicks that have been tagged ""smart dumb"" comedies. The Farrelly Brothers might have been the instigators of the form but director Apatow (who has produced a number of Will Ferrells comedies) is a member of a comedy club that includes Owen Wilson Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. Many of these films arent nearly as smart as their makers imagine them to be. This doesnt mean they arent fun. Some are. But all of them are revealing about where their makers are in relationship to masculinity. Like ""Wedding Crashers"" this film puts us through two fairly mean-spirited acts before reveling in its more sensitive side. One gag here has David and Cal challenge each other by saying ""You know how I know youre gay?"" Is it possible that the movies excessive mean-guy shenanigans are meant to signal that although the filmmakers are comfortable with gay guys (sort of) theyre not - repeat not - gay. Still ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" offers some sparkling insights about the cumulative effects of performance anxiety about how guys struggle with the transit from boys to men with little help from their pals.

RELATED EW.com  Most embarrassing sex scenes  Life for the 40-Year-Old Virgin YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Comedy Steve Carell or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Steve Carell. Remember that name. If you havent heard of him before you certainly will now.A former member of Chicagos Second City Carell has been featured on Comedy Centrals ""The Daily Show"" and starred in the American version of the British TV comedy ""The Office."" He also gave a show-stopping performance in ""Bruce Almighty."" Now he brings down the house in his first feature-film leading role that of the main character Andy Stitzer in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin.""Stitzer is a shy mild-mannered man who works in a large electronics store. Carells face shines with sublime innocence as he goes about being an inventory clerk by day and a reclusive collector of superhero and film memorabilia at night.When three co-workers -- David (Paul Rudd) Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) -- need a fourth player for a poker game they reluctantly rope him in. While trading raunchy stories about sexual exploits it becomes abundantly clear that Andy -- at the age of 40 -- is still a virgin.Finding this situation an insult to males everywhere they decide to make it their mission to get Andy some action. Any living breathing female will do the trick.For Andy this leads to some terrifying encounters.He meets with Beth (Elizabeth Banks) an over-sexed vixen who scares him to death. He takes part in a frightening night of speed-dating. And then he goes out with a drunken woman Nicky (Leslie Mann) who nearly kills him while driving him home and then throws up in his face.Is it any wonder he starts losing hope?Then a chance encounter with Trish (Catherine Keener) who sells memorabilia through eBay changes his life. Shes a single mother who is charmed by Andys sweet nature and -- to Andys pleasure -- wants to take things slow in the bedroom department. Of course eventually push comes to shove and naturally Andy panics.Good nature""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" is hands down the best comedy of the summer.Yes the humor is R-rated and adolescent -- there are jokes involving erections getting chest hair waxed off and a hilarious scene in which Andy tries unsuccessfully to solve the mystery of putting on a condom. But the good-natured tone of the film and the wonderful comedic talents of the entire cast -- especially Carell -- make the gross-out moments charmingly relatable.""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" marks the directorial debut of Judd Apatow who also co-wrote the script with Carell. Apatow has a sterling TV resume having worked as a producer on ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and a writer on ""Freaks and Geeks"" and his comedic credentials shine through in every scene. He knows how to keep the comedy real and doesnt just play it for cheap laughs. Carels character is goaded into a series of adventures by his co-workers played by Seth Rogen Paul Rudd and Romany Malco. Andys three buddies are all well cast especially the innocent-seeming Paul Rudd. The three guys could have easily been dismissed as misogynistic jerks but the excellent script exposes them as being just as terrified of intimacy as Andy is. They do a little growing up as well.Keener adds class to any film in which she appears; shes a treat. And its so refreshing to see two romantic leads who are old enough to remember the days before cell phones and ATMs.Theres no sense saving yourself for another movie.

"Virgin A Man On a Mission washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Virgin A Man On a Mission Andy (Steve Carell) submits to an actual chest-waxing in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" as his pals David (Paul Rudd) left and Cal (Seth Rogen) recoil in horror. (Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 19 2005 FILTHY FUNNY and sweet in equal measure ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" has a lot more going for it than its thin premise -- embodied in the says-it-all title -- would suggest. In other words theres something deeper or at least slightly different than you might expect at play than the efforts of its hero late-bloomer Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) to be deflowered. In fact the movie is less about Andys quest for the Holy Grail of intercourse than it is about his half-hearted perhaps even perverse mission to stay celibate. This despite the energetic machinations of his well-meaning work pals (Paul Rudd Romany Malco and Seth Rogen) who take it upon themselves to school Andy in the ways of love and the unexpected appearance of a compliant and attractive partner (Catherine Keener). In short it isnt the story of a man who desperately wants to get some but of a man who kind of sort of doesnt. What on Earth is wrong with him? Not much it turns out. Not as played by Carell in whose action-figure-obsessed electronics-store clerk we keep looking for signs of emotional or psychological damage ""I thought you were a serial killer"" Andys co-worker Cal (Rogen) confesses after he discovers exactly whats ""different"" about Andy. In the end all we ever find in Carells brilliantly loopy yet solidly grounded character is a regular if slightly rusty Romeo. Thats right. All kidding aside (and the movie is a raunchy joke-fest) ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is at heart a love story albeit one whose hilarious consummation featuring a musical dance number choreographed to ""Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In"" has as much to do with Andys long-delayed physical release as with his finding a soul mate. Its a chick flick with a lot of really really dirty jokes -- not to mention a scene that has permanently altered the mental image that will henceforth come to mind whenever I hear Lionel Ritchies ""Hello"" and not in a good way. There is as you might expect much that I cant even begin to describe in a family newspaper starting with the opening shot of Andy in obvious sexual arousal. Based on a character the actor developed years ago for the improvisational comedy troupe Second City the feature directorial debut of comedian-turned-writer/producer Judd ""Freaks and Geeks"" Apatow (who co-wrote the script with Carell ) is a symphony with blue humor. Comic riffs involving condoms breasts oral sex masturbation sexual climax and the sheer mechanics of doin it -- or as in Andys case not doin it -- abound. What I can describe although you may not want me to is one very funny though painful scene involving Andys decision to have his chest waxed. (The actor actually submitted to the procedure.) As real blood pools on Carells chest after the third or fourth swipe you may find yourself as Rudd Malco and Rogen do alternating between laughing and wincing. Another classic moment involves Andys very drunk (and very er available) date throwing up a seafood sandwich on our heros face even as shes propositioning him. Like ""American Pie"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"" the movie can stoop pretty low at times. What keeps ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" out of Rob Schneider territory however is 1) the fact that its pretty darn funny and in a way that feels consistently real and 2) the fact that its actually an excellent date movie. It would be all too easy to portray Andy as a freak or Keeners kooky but good-hearted love interest as the kind of implausible dream girl that losers manage to hook up with only in Hollywood fantasies. Both actors nevertheless succeed in making their characters attraction seem not just cinematically sound but sane. Paradoxically the movies real accomplishment particularly in this indulgence-saturated society is in its depiction of celibacy -- or at least saving it for the right one -- which here seems almost less silly than sex.

The stockroom manager at a San Fernando Valley consumer electronics store hes never learned to drive never had a steady girlfriend and at the ripe old age of 40 hes never been laid. His sexual history is a chronology of embarrassing near misses (including a lesson in the dangerous combo of oral sex and orthodontics). But hes not gay or impotent; his morning wood is as tall and mighty as a centuries-old oak. Hes just a victim of circumstance with his fatally unhip comb-over a wardrobe pitched somewhere between science-geek chic and senior PGA tour and his belief that whipping up a homemade egg-salad sandwich qualifies as an exciting leisure activity. So you think you know where this is going that The 40-Year-Old Virgin is on its way to being an American Pie for the post-post-pubescent set and to some extent it is -- its about what happens when Andys clean little secret gets out of the bag and his party-boy co-workers (Paul Rudd Romany Malco and Seth Rogen) take him under their collective wing as a kind of charity case. But the unexpected thing about The 40-Year-Old Virgin is how much deeper it goes. Its an unconscionably funny sex farce that by its end turns into a tender and honest romance an acute portrait of loneliness and believe it or not a musical. This is a movie Blake Edwards might have made. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - To read Robert Abeles interview with Steve Carell click here.As embodied by Carell (who also co-wrote the film with its director Judd Apatow) Andy Stitzer is a brilliant comic creation -- not because hes a mamas boy scared of his own dicks shadow but because he springs forth from the darkest reaches of male sexual paranoia. Hes what every pimply-faced teenager feared he might become and the fact that Andy has gotten so used to his predicament -- he doesnt even masturbate -- only makes him that much more nightmarish. Carell and Apatow (whose canceled TV series Freaks and Geeks was itself a storehouse of pimply-faced teenage anxiety) have thought out every last detail of Andys hermetic existence from the care with which he toasts his breakfast waffles to the precise way he tucks his pant legs into his socks before bicycling to work and how when he finally sits down to watch a porno he does the exact opposite of what youre supposed to do -- he fast-forwards through the sex scenes in order to get back to the story. In a summer when much has been made about the return of R-rated raunch at the movies (as represented by the likes of Wedding Crashers and Deuce Bigalow) The 40-Year-Old Virgin is the only one of the bunch that feels like it could become a new classic. Watching it you can imagine certain scenes becoming comic touchstones for a whole generation of moviegoers the speed-dating encounter with a biker chick named Gina (as in va-gina); the montage sequence set to the theme song from The Greatest American Hero; and that priceless moment when Andys breathy-voiced boss (Best in Show alum Jane Lynch) asks him to be her ""fuck buddy."" (""Im very discreet"" she purrs ""but I will haunt your dreams."") And if Apatow isnt much of a visual director it hardly matters because hes a whiz at casting and at encouraging those actors to riff off of one anothers improvisational energy. When The 40-Year-Old Virgin is at its best which is often it seems to be flying by the seat of its pants and its exhilarating.Then something truly miraculous happens Andy Stitzer falls in love. With a middle-aged divorcee. Who has three kids. And a grandchild. Called Trish and played wonderfully by Catherine Keener shes nearly Andys opposite someone whos been around the relationship block enough times for the both of them. Even her job -- running one of those we-sell-it-for-you-on-eBay stores -- is symbolic She spends her days trafficking in other peoples unwanted goods. So shes attracted by Andys innocence -- turned on by it -- even before she knows why hes so innocent while hes inspired by her to finally put away childish things (or at least auction them on the Internet). Yet theirs is no easy courtship; as in life there are arguments to be had temperamental adolescents to be contended with and unavoidable truths to be revealed and The 40-Year-Old Virgin is mercilessly honest about all that even as it is being ruthlessly funny. Sydney Pollack has often said of his Tootsie that it is the story of a man who becomes a better man for having been a woman. In much the same way The 40-Year-Old Virgin is the story of a man who becomes a better lover for having been abstinent though theres nothing puritanical about the movies tone. Its simply a reminder that sometimes all good things really do come -- so to speak -- to those who wait.

"40-Year-Old Virgin The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 40-year-old-virgin-the ) 40-Year-Old Virgin The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The 40 Year Old Virgin is proof that motion picture comedies can still be funny. Sadly the kind of consistent humor delivered by this film happens too rarely. This is the movie Wedding Crashers should have been rude raunchy uproarious yet with elements that are surprisingly sweet. Unlike Wedding Crashers which loses its edge (and a lot of its humor) early The 40 Year Old Virgin keeps it up for nearly two hours. Yes its a little long but there are still plenty of laughs remaining in the final 30 minutes and the movie reserves one of its best jokes for last. If youre looking for a successor to Theres Something About Mary and American Pie look no further. It has arrived. And if I may be so bold this is more enjoyable than either of them. Steve Carell is one of those familiar faces - you sort-of know him but cant quite place the name. He does a lot of supporting work but has gained a little familiarity as a result of appearing in NBC-TVs version of The Office (hes the boss) and Will Farrells Anchorman (hes the clueless weatherman). Here 41-year old Carell plays up the dorkiness and turns on the geeky charm as Andy Stitzer an inventory stocker at a Best Buy clone. Shy doesnt even begin to describe Andy - he ""respects"" women so much that he stays away from them. At age 40 hes a virgin but his salesman buddies - David (Paul Rudd) Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) - are determined to change that. Enter Trish (Catherine Keener) and Beth (Elizabeth Banks) two likely candidates. Andy likes Trish a lot but when it comes to doing anything horizontal with her his nerves take over. Beth on the other hand is young hot and freaky and might be exactly what Andy needs. Under the expert direction of Judd Apatow (who with Carell co-wrote the screenplay) the humor keeps coming and there are surprisingly few misfires. On those occasions when a gag fails it is quickly forgotten. Each member of the cast has strong comedic timing and none of the jokes are drawn out for so long that they lose their punch. (With maybe one exception - the ""I know youre gay because?"" schtick.) Most of the material is about sex with some of the funniest bits involving Andys first encounter with a condom his drive home with a drunk girl his waxing treatment and his ""date"" with himself. The movie is unequivocally unabashedly R-rated which is one reason its so refreshing. Theres no neutering to tame things down for the PG-13 crowd. The 40 Year Old Virgin doesnt just milk laughter out of the big comedic sequences; it also derives humor from the little things. Men will immediately sympathize with Andys ""morning problem"" and (some) women will smile at Beths alternative use of a detachable shower head (gives new meaning to the term ""multi-tasker""). Theres a priceless speed-dating encounter (ever experienced a moment when you cant look away?) and some unconventional dating advice (""Be like David Caruso in Jade""). As with Theres Something About Mary and American Pie The 40 Year Old Virgin wants us to like the main character even as we chuckle at his ineptitude. Andy is a decent affable guy and it doesnt take long before were rooting for him to be lucky in love. The delightful Catherine Keener is perfect as Andys GILF (Grandmothers Id Like to Fuck) love interest. The 40 Year Old Virgin has one foot in romantic comedy territory and because Carell and Keener click that aspect works as well as the raunchy stuff. And its also great to see a romance between two characters who are over the age of 30. Keener doesnt look 45 but its rare for a woman of her maturity to get this kind of role. Kudos to Apatow and Carell for not pairing Andy with someone half his age. I suppose its only fair to warn potential viewers that The 40 Year Old Virgin isnt going to be for everyone. You have to like this kind of humor - stuff that starts with Animal House and gets going from there. The gags here arent about burps and farts; theyre about vomit urine and other bodily fluids. Theres no safety net - even the most tame jokes (such as comments about Andys action figure collection) may strike the nerves of some viewers even as theyre rapping on the funny bones of others. Apatow and Carell know geekdom and they have a lot of fun at its expense (although I was surprised that there were no Star Trek jokes). And when you think youve seen everything the filmmakers give us an ending of amazing audacity. This is one of 2005s funniest and most endearing motion pictures. 40-Year-Old Virgin The (United States 2005) Director Judd Apatow Cast Steve Carell Catherine Keener Paul Rudd Romany Malco Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks Leslie Mann Jane Lynch Screenplay Judd Apatow amp; Steve Carell Cinematography Jack Green Music Lyle Workman U.S. Distributor Universal Pictures Ranked 10 in Berardinellis Top 10 of 2005 Run Time 155 U.S. Release Date 2005-08-19 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Sexual Situations Nudity Drugs) Genre COMEDY Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 1.851 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Princess Bride The (1987) City Lights (1931) This Is Spinal Tap (1984) worse movies of this genre Feast (2006) Dumb and Dumberer (2003) Freddy Got Fingered (2001) Three...better movies of Steve Carell Way Way Back The (2013) Big Short The (2015) Anchorman (2004) worse movies of Steve Carell Evan Almighty (2007) Incredible Burt Wonderstone The (2013) Date Night (2010) Three...better movies of Catherine Keener Out of Sight (1998) Into the Wild (2007) Being John Malkovich (1999) worse movies of Catherine Keener Synecdoche New York (2008) Late Quartet A (2012) Hamlet 2 (2008) Three...better movies of Paul Rudd Cider House Rules The (1999) Knocked Up (2007) Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) worse movies of Paul Rudd Ten The (2007) Over Her Dead Body (2008) Role Models (2008) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=54,200,the40-year-oldvirgin23,the40-year-oldvirgin,reelviews

Crude sophomorically homophobic but frequently funny pic also overstays its welcome a bit and indulges in some juvenile excesses. All told though The 40 Year Old Virgin delivers enough belly laughs that it should score pretty consistently. This review was corrected on August 15 2005. Continuing this summers revenge of the ""R""-rated comedy Steve Carells first star turn after a number of second-banana roles has plenty in common with ""Wedding Crashers"" for (mostly) good and ill. Crude sophomorically homophobic but frequently funny pic also overstays its welcome a bit and indulges in some juvenile excesses. All told though ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" delivers enough belly laughs that it should score pretty consistently particularly with the frat-boy contingent of the ""Crashers"" crowd. Carell plays Andy an unassuming clerk in an electronic equipment store who gets drawn into a poker game with a trio of his co-workers. As the guys swap sex stories it becomes painfully evident that Andy doesnt have any of his own having given up on women after a couple of painful (and painfully funny) early miscues. Thats right as hard as it is to believe a fellow who collects superhero action figures that fill his apartment and still rides a bike to work has managed to reach 40 without getting laid. So after subjecting Andy to some schoolyard humiliation his newfound pals -- salesmen David (Paul Rudd) and Jay (Romany Malco) and stock worker Cal (Seth Rogen) -- make it their business to remove the scarlet ""V"" from Andys resume. They begin with the easy stuff coaching Andy on how to pick up ""drunk bitches"" in bars or prodding him to chat up customers which leads to Andys relationship with Trish (Catherine Keener) who runs a ""store"" that sells peoples stuff via eBay. (Its one of several prominent product placements in the movie.) Trish wants to take things slowly which is just fine by Andy whose lack of experience has him dreading the moment perhaps more than anticipating it. Written by Carell and producer Judd Apatow ""Virgin"" derives much of its humor from the non-virgins trying to lead Andy to the promised land -- three stooges who each in his own way are far more dysfunctional than he is. David for example hasnt gotten over a girlfriend hes borderline stalking Jay chronically cheats on his soul-mate and Cal is a roly-poly goofball full of moronic dating advice. ""Be David Caruso in Jade"" he says in one of the better obscure non-sequiturs in recent memory. Following his starring role in NBCs adaptation of ""The Office"" as well as first-class stints in ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (which Apatow produced) and ""Bruce Almighty"" Carell is established as a possible addition to the ranks of comedy headliners while pic wisely lightens his burden with an able supporting cast. Beyond the guys that includes Jane Lynch -- a veteran of Christopher Guest and Eugene Levys ""Best in Show"" troupe -- as Andys boss and Elizabeth Banks as another potential conquest who he chats up with surprising success using Cals seduction tips. Although there are a few big sight gags -- highlighted by the hirsute Andys extremely painful body wax -- most of the comedy comes from the quirky characters and their decidedly unenlightened views regarding sexual conquests. Rudd the scene-stealing Malco (currently seen in Showtimes ""Weeds"") and Rogen (a veteran of Apatows TV shows ""Undeclared"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"") are all dead-on making the most of high school put-downs of the ""You know why youre gay?"" variety. As with ""Wedding Crashers"" ""Virgin"" is occasionally guilty of trying too hard and there are a few dry spells that probably could have been cured by judicious editing. For all the cleverness displayed here theres not quite enough gas in the tank to sustain whats nearly a two-hour running time. Still theres an ample supply of inspired irreverence to amuse a younger audience and pic closes with a catchy sequence that should stir even a slightly older demo into humming an especially appropriate song from the 80s -- ""Just Got Lucky"" -- as they head up the aisles.
