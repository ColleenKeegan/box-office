Comments click to enlarge Skyline Rated PG-13  94 minutes  2010 Cloverfield (2008) revitalized the giant-monster genre with its mock-camcorder account of space aliens tearing up Manhattan but the folks who produced this knockoff for Columbia Pictures have completely missed the point theyve recycled the earlier movies cardboard plot but discarded its jerky stylistics in favor of the usual elephantine FX sequences. The premise is nearly identical hip young people party in a high-rise penthouse overlooking downtown LA and the next morning they awaken to discover alien spacecraft hovering above the city. As in District 9 the ships resemble floating garbage dumps and the cool blue light they emit not only hypnotizes people but causes them to break out in clusters of varicose veins. Visual-effects wizards Greg and Colin Strause directed showing more affinity for the citys steel and glass than for any of the characters. By J.R.

"Skyline | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; skyline ) Skyline (United States 2010) November 13 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli After the release of their first high-profile directorial effort Aliens vs. Predator Requiem co-directors Greg and Colin Strause publicly lambasted Fox for ruining their movie. Now three years later with Skyline they have an opportunity to show what they can do without studio interference. The result does not argue in the Strauses favor. Ultimately there was no saving Aliens vs. Predator Requiem and theres no saving Skyline. Some will Im sure opine that this movie entertains because its ""so bad its good."" Thats not my impression. For me its just plain bad. Boring. Unwatchable. How this managed not to go direct-to-DVD (and actually get a wide distribution rather than just a handful-of-theaters dump) is one of 2010s great cinematic mysteries. If I was nine years old and a filmmaker this is the kind of movie I might make. Lots of special effects shots of spaceships. A few dogfights. Things blowing up. Cool blue lights. Monsters rumbling through L.A. tearing up buildings and eating peoples brains. A nuclear bomb going off. Characters? We dont need no stinkin characters. A coherent plot? Dont really need that either. Acting? If I didnt know better Id think these were porn actors moonlighting with their clothes on. They certainly deliver dialogue that way. At age nine I would have lapped it all up - except the occasional patches of ""character building"" during which nothing happens. Those are spaced out to allow for frequent bathroom breaks or trips to the concession stand. Skyline begins on a high note alien attack Brilliant blue streaks pepper Los Angeles. The protagonists Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) are awakened at 4 a.m. by a bright light outside their window. When Jarrod goes to investigate he undergoes a gnarly transformation. Then the screenplay missteps by rewinding the action by 15 hours and introducing us to the characters who will plague the movie for the rest of its misbegotten running length. In addition to Jarrod and Elaine who are vacationing on the West Coast we meet Terry (Donald Faison) an old buddy of Jarrods who has hit the big time in Hollywood; Candice (Brittany Daniel) Terrys blonde bimbo wife; Denise (Crystal Reed) Terrys brunette bimbo mistress; and Oliver (David Zayas) the badass guy who sits behind the desk in the apartment lobby. Once we endure the 15-minute ""getting to know them"" flashback sequence which proves beyond a doubt that the directors cant direct the writers cant write and the actors cant act its back to the present and the alien invasion which turns out to be a snooze. Skyline has one primary action sequence which occurs when a bunch of people flee the apartment building for a marina and several end up dead. Other than that its mostly the survivors holed up on a penthouse watching things transpire through a telescope. When a nuclear bomb explodes the building barely shakes. Skyline isnt interested in putting the ""science"" back in ""science fiction."" Skyline is a pastiche of the worst moments from every alien invasion movie imaginable. Big unwieldy mother ships hovering in the skies. Cities in ruins. Dumb people doing inexplicable things. Characters we dont care about dropping like flies. Nearly every scene thats done with a degree of competence (not many admittedly) provokes this reaction ""Ive seen that before and it was better in the other movie."" Even if ""the other movie"" is something cheesy like Independence Day. Yes Skyline does the seemingly impossible and makes Independence Day look good. For that matter it makes the Roland Emmerich/Dean Devlin Independence Day follow-up Godzilla look good. And that is an achievement. The Brothers Strauses background is in visual effects which may explain why they treat the human actors with all the care and dignity accorded to any other wooden prop. Unfortunately the special effects arent anything to get excited about. The CGI is pretty but is it much better than what can be achieved by a truly talented kid with a computer and an advanced graphics program? Theres no invention in any of the shots - nothing to surprise or delight nothing that would encourage us to buy a copy for home viewing so we can experience it over and over again. The creatures look silly with their blue flashing LEDs and rock-like appearance. Theres a scene in which Jarrod is beating to death one of the smaller monsters with a cinder block and it looks like hes pounding on a bean bag chair. Suddenly I appreciate the technical aptitude of Transformers. That too is an achievement. Most alien invasion movies focus on important people - Presidents high-ranking military officials the everyday guy who leads the final fight for freedom. Skyline trains its cameras on inconsequential individuals who serve no important function. They are witnesses. Its an interesting conceit and it has been used to good effect in films like Cloverfield and Monsters. What about the ""little people"" the men and women who are dispatched with little compunction in a throw-away scene? Skyline wants to be about them but it botches the job by failing to make us care about its characters. Jarrod and Elaine are so hollow that whether they live or die is a matter of complete indifference. Some have decried the ending of Skyline as being horrifically bad. On one level I suppose I agree. But by the time the 90 minute endurance contest is at an end I cared so little that the last ""twist"" didnt raise my ire. What right does one have to expect something different after 85 minutes of largely incompetent filmmaking? Is Skyline the worst film of 2010? Possibly but theres still another month-and-a-half to go. Plenty of time for something worse to come along. Still if it happens that will be an achievement to dwarf all others.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Theres a particularly insulting kind of awful movie that doesnt leave you mad at the director (but you could be) or the cast (even though theyre mostly awful too). Youre just left annoyed with a culture in which all a studio has to do for a gigantic opening weekend is buy ad time during football games wrestling matches and whatever trends in drama continue to erode NBCs programming sense. To see ""Skyline a science fiction action movie that opens this weekend is to wonder why youre watching it.The trailers tell you nothing about why whats happening is happening. An alien ship vacuums Los Angeles free of people (the hovering craft could have been made by Dyson). Of course if youve ever seen any work of alien invasion or alien confrontation a proper explanation might not be necessary. ""Skyline is basically every such movie with a finale that the makers of ""Aliens and ""The Matrix wouldnt be wrong to find actionable.Beholding the movies hulking metallic-reptile-invaders look is like spending the evening at Rick Bakers alien waxworks. The plot as it were is even less original. At some point the wealthiest of the five humans were trapped with intuits that the right thing to do is head to his powerboat. From where but the video store does this instinct arise? (Water kills most movie aliens.)The movie is the second by Colin and Greg Strause American visual-effects guys who as directors of commercials. music videos and movies go by the risibly pretentious ""Brothers Strause. Their previous outing was ""AVPR Alien Vs. Predator Requiem hence the creatures in this new venture. The titling this time is more digestible. The moviemaking is something else. With apologies to the screenwriters Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell ""Skyline doesnt have a story so much as it has an object Flee the high-rise or perish. George Romero and John Carpenter built fine careers on that premise although they never used this much slow motion. The Strauses dont care about how to keep an audience. Their movie has no sense of suspense or dread -- ""Skyline is an apocalypse movie that plods like one of Romeros zombies.These arent moviemakers who live even in other movies let alone the world. They live in hard drives. And so as you might expect the effects arent bad. The actors -- Eric Balfour Scottie Thompson Donald Faison David Zayas the peerlessly whatever Brittany Daniel -- and the audience are props. As the cast members run for their lives you almost hope they dont make it just to see what the computer-generated aliens can do. In that sense the movie feels like a trade-show demo for what nifty visual tricks the Strauses can supply for your blockbuster -- and cheaply. TheWrap.com reported the budget to be 20 million which is what ""Avatar spent on digital body paint. Selling ""Skyline probably cost the same. The Strauses might take that as a compliment.

The dialogue is abysmal (Vaya con dios you son of a bitch) the acting is even worse the bulk of the story takes place in one LA penthouse and the plot makes absolutely no sense. For a good 45 minutes very little happens our heroes Jarrod (TV veteran Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scotty Thompson) arrive in LA for the birthday bash of their successful effects-designer pal Terry (Donald Faison) but just as theyre beginning to settle into the Hollywood lifestyle wouldnt you know it aliens invade. Cue lots of flashing lights yelling (We gotta get out of here) and fairly mediocre but intermittently impressive CGI effects.But when the final act rolls around its as if the filmmakers themselves just got bored of their own movie and decided to go a little nuts. One of our heroes gets flattened by a giant marauding bug-beast a supporting character gets his brain sucked out the US air cavalry pitch in to the join the fight and things start to look up. By the time one of the leading actors takes it upon himself to batter a flying squid-creature to death with a brick its becoming clear that resistance is indeed futile and its just easier to submit to the movies increasingly berserk parade of b-movie thrills. An extended coda tests the patience but for a good twenty minutes Skyline fulfils its low-rent remit. Imagine its 1953 and youre watching a movie called Brain Suckers from Planet X and you might even have a good time.

The ending is a disappointment and a complete total let down to your intelligence. The official review above pretty much has it spot on. About 1/3 of the way through the film if you have any brains youll start to realise the whole film will take place in the hotel. Surprisingly they do keep up the suspense and the special effects are amazing. But its kind of like they had a good idea for a film without a any clue about how to do a good ending. The film starts off so promisingly but its just not as good as the adverts youll have seen at the cinema or on telly wouldve led you to believe. To give it less than 7 out of 10 would be unfair (though my wife gave it a 5) but I only give it an 7 because of its potential promise of what it could have been and because of how good the special effects are. But its not worth going to see folks just wait until it comes out on DVD.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 12 2010TimFeaturedHave just seen it would give it 8/10. Unlike some other disappointing films (I have The Forgotten in mind) there are plenty more good CGI action sequences in the film than in the trailer. Reviewers have complained of a lack of plot but in that sense this film is no different from Cloverfield. We dont know the aliens intentions (unlike in Independence Day where theres a dubious scene where its blatently spelled out for the audience). Its actually feels realistic. Theres no WIll Smith hero flying jets and helicopters and single-handedly saving the Earth. Theres no pew pew of space lasers in fact the alien science is entirely ""off worldly"". You realise early in this film that America might not be saved in this film - but thats quite a refreshing change.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89417/skyline.html,200,skyline3,skyline,timeout
Skyline The aliens are here and they suck hard | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSkyline The aliens are here and they suck hardMovie derivative fo Cloverfield The Host and others also has oddly generic cast.Skyline.By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Nov. 12 2010 Skyline (out of 4) Starring Eric Balfour Scottie Thompson and Donald Faison. Directed by Colin and Greg Strause. 92 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Theres a kind of magic that happens when a movie inspires complete strangers to ridicule it to each other on the way out of the theatre. That special joy is likely to be the only thing that viewers take away from the experience of seeing Skyline. An often laughable jumble of alien-invasion and monster-movie cliches it most definitely does not do for Los Angeles what Cloverfield did for New York. Skyline owes more than a little to producer J.J. Abrams 2008 hit including the set-up. Again a group of young not terribly bright hotties serve as our stand-ins during an alien siege of an American metropolis. The morning after a party in the penthouse suite belonging to his friend Terry (Donald Faison) photographer Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) are woken up along with the rest of the city by the blinding blue lights pouring through their windows. We soon learn that anyone who looks at the light is hypnotized so they can be drawn out into the open and then sucked up into the sky by the extra-terrestrial equivalent of a Dyson vacuum cleaner. But if weve learned anything from alien-invasion movies its that our adversaries always have a vulnerability we can exploit. In War of the Worlds it was the aliens susceptibility to our germs. In Signs it was their aversion to water. As for Skylines space meanies all it takes to foil their plans is Venetian blinds. Clearly frustrated with the persistence of our survivors and their shade-creating devices the creatures soon resort to the more traditional tactics of building-smashing and shoving humans into their gooey orifices. Though they come in various sizes the aliens themselves are a generic bunch resembling a cross between the giant amphibians of Cloverfield and The Host the multi-tentacled thingies in War of the Worlds and the many-eyed sentinels in The Matrix. The human characters have even less personality. Played largely by familiar but unremarkable TV actors (e.g. Balfour of 24 Faison of Scrubs David Zayas of Dexter) they are too indistinct to elicit much sympathy before they are variously crushed swallowed or whisked up into the air. The very modest scale of the destruction at hand is another reason Skyline cant compete. As a result of the obvious budget restrictions the aliens seem unduly preoccupied with the single high-rise building where nearly all of the action takes place -- wouldnt they rather be smashing up Venice Beach? Or better yet Rodeo Drive? There must be a Pretty Woman fan somewhere in their ranks. Its even sadder to see what happens when our brave Jarrod goes toe to toe with a creature -- the scene that ensues is the CGI equivalent of the fight with the giant rubber octopus in Ed Woods Bride of the Monster.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 12 2010 717PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The only fascinating thing about Skyline is that that such a mad muddle of a movie can even exists in an era of corporate homogeneity and purported quality control. Made on a 10-million budget the film is the handiwork Colin and Greg Strauss who helped provide special effects for movies including Avatar and Ironman 2 and also directed another alien smackdown Alien vs. Predator - Requiem. So intent are the Strausses on showing off their visual chops they leave the films story dialogue and acting in shambles. The opening scenes mimic Cloverfield another movie in which a wild party by a group of twenty-somethings culminates in an extra-terrestrial invasion. Jarrod ( Six Feet Unders Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) have come to L.A. to celebrate the birthday of his rich rapper pal Terry (Donald Faison). When the aliens attack they do the sensible thing and pull down the blinds. When that proves ineffective the group bickers some arguing for running to the marina on the chance that the aliens dont like water and the others opting to stay put on the chance the aliens might ignore them. The actors desperation is palpable and yours would be too if youd signed on to this. Through their big-screen window the characters watch as Los Angeles is attacked in what looks like an Independence Day/Transformer double-pronged invasion. The aliens are a diverse group resembling giant spiders octopuses bats angler fish bagpipes and the poop monster from Kevin Smiths Dogma. Typically the creatures hypnotize people with the pretty blue Christmas lights they have hanging on their bodies and then hoover them into their gnarly clam-shell of a space ship. Their other techniques owe a lot to movies from Godzilla to Aliens to Jurassic Park. Occasionally theyll even go zombie - sneaking up from behind their victims and sucking out their brains though from what we see of the humans in the film it would be a poor source of nourishment. If for some reason you end up going to Skyline promise yourself to stay to the last 15 minutes. Thats when the movie outdoes itself as the narrative becomes incomprehensible and the palette turns into a bad peyote trip of candy-floss pink and bile greens. Some movies aspire to be like roller coaster rides; Skyline just resembles the results of an unpleasant digestive spill.

Credit Universal Pictures Its pretty clear that most of the thought time and money spent on ""Skyline"" went into the fabrication of the alien creatures who descend on Los Angeles and start feeding on humans at a pace reminiscent of the afternoon rush at In-N-Out Burger. These extraterrestrial locavores -- they consume their food right where its harvested -- are a cross between the Alien and Audrey the man-eating plant in ""Little Shop of Horrors"" except that they come in sizes ranging from large car to small building.This emphasis on latex and computer graphics makes sense given the involvement of the Brothers Strause Colin and Greg who have done special effects on 60-some movies but directed just two ""Skyline"" and the 2007 ""Aliens vs. Predator Requiem."" Elsewhere theyve scrimped the actors are from television (Eric Balfour of ""Haven"" Scottie Thompson of ""Trauma"" Donald Faison of ""Scrubs"" David Zayas of ""Dexter"") and Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnells screenplay is strictly from hunger. Photo A scene from ""Skyline."" Credit Universal Pictures Trapped inside what looks like a Marina del Rey condo complex the principals raise and lower the blinds run up and down the stairs and occasionally venture outside while the audience if it has the energy yells ""No Dont do that Thats stupid"" Eventually it turns out that all the running and hiding and chopping (theres an ax) was beside the point which is the sort of thing that can make you angry if you care about the characters but in this case is kind of a relief.Some obvious comparables for ""Skyline"" are ""Independence Day"" and Steven Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" but there is nothing here that even approaches the comic-book verve of the first or the churning dread of the second. There is one natural audience for the film though people who really really hate Los Angeles.SkylineOpened on Friday nationwide. Directed by the Brothers Strause; written by Liam ODonnell and Joshua Cordes; director of photography Michael Watson; edited by Nicholas Wayman Harris; music by Matthew Margeson; production design by Drew Dalton; costumes by Bobbie Mannix; creature design by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.; produced by the Brothers Strause Mr.ODonnell and Kristian James Andresen; released by Universal Pictures. Running time 2 hours 9 minutes. WITH Eric Balfour (Jarrod) Scottie Thompson (Elaine) Brittany Daniel (Candice) David Zayas (Oliver) and Donald Faison (Terry).""Skyline"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Call it Cloverville. Or maybe Bloverfield. Whatever the case the science-fiction thriller Skyline falls squarely--and a little endearingly--into the Roger Corman tradition of cheap cash-ins on popular hits. Its Cloverfield without the multiple-camcorder hook stocked with good-looking D-list actors who are generally sixth- or seventh-billed in TV shows. Normally such things go straight to DVD or the outreaches of cable but brothers Greg and Colin Strause are FX wizards by trade and they stretch every dollar of their exceedingly modest budget into 5 of effects. Sadly theyre significantly less skilled at working without pixels The Strauses ran the Alien and Predator franchises further into the ground with their debut feature Aliens Vs. Predator Requiem and Skyline reveals a similar inattentiveness to developing characters or gleaning something anything fresh from stock situations. That guy from Six Feet Under (Eric Balfour)--you know the tall skinny one with the drug problems--stars as one of a group of hotbodies convening in a Los Angeles penthouse for a birthday party. In the middle of the night a series of beams of blue light shoot down from the sky prompting many to fall into a hypnotic state and get beamed aboard a mothership hovering above the city like the one in District 9. The situation worsens when alien beings of various shapes and sizes fan out across the city and vacuum up the few remaining stragglers. Trapped in the penthouse Six Feet Under guy his pregnant girlfriend (Scottie Thompson) three other random good-looking people and that guy from Dexter (David Zayas)--you know the earnest one with the slight speech impediment--try to figure out how to escape their impending doom. For those who turned green over Cloverfields shaky-cam aesthetic Skyline is there with the Dramamine The Strauses working from a script by Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell borrow the idea of witnessing an alien invasion from a fixed perspective but treat it with slick conventionality. It isnt clever. It isnt original. It isnt scary. At best Skyline is a proficient forgettable programmer that only occasionally lapses into irredeemably silliness like when it makes a plea for the transcendent power of love. Mostly its just a break in the natural order of things a rare opportunity to forget a B-movie knockoff in theaters before forgetting it on DVD.

Imagine a Kmart mash-up of ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"" and youre appropriately primed for ""Skyline"" an underwhelming and derivative sci-fi thriller thats only marginally more impressive than a run-of-the-mill SyFy Channel telepic. Co-directed by vet visual effects wizards and Hydraulx f/x company founders Greg and Colin Strause billing themselves as the Brothers Strause pic intersperses drearily extended scenes of cringe-worthy dialogue and over-amped acting with sequences showcasing only sporadically spectacular CGI-laden destruction. Hard-sell ad campaign may generate fair-to-good opening weekend numbers but word of mouth likely will dampen long-range theatrical and homevid prospects. Positing a worst-case morning-after scenario scripters Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell get things started by having hearty-partying acquaintances awaken to find the skies of Los Angeles filled with the warships of extraterrestrial invaders. After the initial assault pic flashes back to introduce and delineate the central characters who are in the wrong place -- a Marina del Rey luxury penthouse apartment with humongous windows -- at the wrong time. Unfortunately even after the action picks up again and the characters continue to interact theyre never more than stereotypes despite the determined efforts by some cast members to flesh out their parts with capital-A acting. Its not entirely the fault of the thesps who are burdened with dialogue like ""Theyre not dead Theyre just really really pissed off"" while trudging through a storyline littered with fuzzy logic and hoary cliches. Cast as an apartment complex factotum who more or less takes charge at the 40-minute point (though not alas for very long) David Zayas asserts himself as most valuable player mainly because hes naturally authoritative enough to sell even the silliest lines. The extraterrestrial meanies start out by shooting blasts of light that hypnotize humans making it all the easier to harvest hundreds of thousands of them in a manner one character aptly likens to the ""rapture"" of biblical prophecy. At first it seems that all the penthouse inhabitants have to do is keep the blinds closed. But no The invaders proceed with a mop-up operation that involves assaults by protoplasm-like drones airborne multi-tentacled predators and a few giant marauders that resemble humanoid-shaped industrial sludge decked out with Christmas lights. CGI effects the pics raison detre range from dazzling to chintzy. Its hard to shake the suspicion that the Brothers Strause (who actually fared much better with their 2007 debut feature ""Aliens vs. Predator Requiem"") intended this sophomore effort as a kinda-sorta product reel to demonstrate their ability to make an f/x-heavy sci-fier on a relatively low budget. But in concentrating on their digital craftsmanship the helmers have paid little attention to such niceties as credibility and coherence (its never entirely clear why some folks in the penthouse think its a smart move to risk retreating to a yacht docked nearby). Sporadic attempts to intensify the minimal suspense with slo-mo and sped-up sequences are inadvertently comical. And judging from the response by paying customers at a latenight showing even those in the pics presumed target demographic may laugh out loud or shout rude things in response to the absurdly anticlimactic ending.

(Rogue) Joe Neumaier Friday November 12 2010 311 PM Title Skyline A group of people fight aliens after Los Angeles is attacked. With Eric Balfour Donald Faison. Directors Colin Strause Greg Strause. (140). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.Its finally here The most boring alien-invasion movie ever. Despite borrowing liberally from previous hits like ""Independence Day"" ""War of the Worlds"" and ""District 9"" the not-screened for-critics ""Skyline"" takes the crown from 2003s ""Dreamcatcher"" in a stunning display of laziness dull special effects and deadly pacing. It even makes sure each and every character is unsympathetic and dull for good measure.Just as Jared (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Brittany Daniel) arrive in L.A. for the birthday party of their newly-minted entertainment mogul pal Terry (Donald Faison) strange beams of light come down from the sky. Well actually not just as they get to town; first we have unbearably boring party scenes some ""Bro did done good"" dialogue catty chat between Terrys wife and his sexy assistant and an early revelation that Elaine is -- shock Foreshadowing? Cliche -- pregnant.Then the aliens arrive and everything that seemed dull beforehand now seems exciting by comparison. trapped in Terrys high-rise penthouse the gang keeps staring at the huge spaceships and avoiding looking into the light -- because if they do their skin starts to bulge and turn blue and their eyes get foggy as the aliens attempt to suck out their brains. (Yep these are the brain-sucking kind of aliens.) But if they look away from the light or get pushed out of the way whew theyre ok and their skin turns normal again.Someone gets the idiotic idea that the aliens dont like water (they must have seen ""Signs"") and a plan is hatched to get to the nearby marina. But then the monsters chase them down the street or stick their tendrils into the penthouse and generally hover around. The good news Everyday objects like axes knives and concrete blocks can deter these brain-eating fiends from beyond the stars. The bad news Despite the electricity still being on no one turns on a TV or computer to see how the world is reacting. Director siblings Colin and Greg Strause have previously done visual effects for TV and movies but stage one of the most potentially exciting events in the world -- an alien invasion in case you forgot -- as if we were watching fish in an aquarium. Even the obligatory feisty who shows up in the second act cant shake the film from its stupor.The innocent cast is trapped in ridiculous action scenes though in truth many of them may not have been able to hear the tin notes in the script written by Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell. The whole movie seems to be in an eye-fogging trance. But until a better eye-fogging trance-inducing lethargic alien invasion movie shows up this one wins.

"Skyline review -- Brain food but not in the good way - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Skyline review -- Brain food but not in the good waySkyline a 1 1/2 starsNovember 12 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticIn ""Skyline"" which offers a few stray sights of enticing PG-13 grossness but not much of a movie space aliens drop in on Los Angeles luring the residents with mesmerizing shafts of unholy blue light. Its like a trip to a Kmart staffed by the ugliest beings imaginable. Seeing ""Skyline"" with a late-night audience was instructive derision-wise. I didnt sense the right kind of laughter happening; I sensed more of a ""ahhhh kill em all These people are idiots"" kind of laughter. The poseurs littering the story several of whom work in the special effects industry but act like millionaire gangstas deliver each new straight line on cue. ""Morning already?"" wonders the visiting pregnant Brooklynite played by Scottie Thompson (best thing in the film) upon first sighting of the blue light. Once too often somebody screams ""Ruuuuunnnn"" or ""Noooooooo"" simply because theyve seen other characters in other movies do the same. The blue light according to directors and producers Greg and Colin Strause and screenwriters Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell is meant to be the visual equivalent of the siren songs of old the trickery by which humans meet their doom. Each time one of the vacuous youngfolk stuck in a Marina Del Ray high-rise starts zombie-walking toward the light you think Isnt that James Camerons preferred icy blue hue? Are the aliens actually working for Cameron? The Brothers Strause as theyre billed certainly did; they contributed to the effects work on ""Avatar"" among many other high-profile projects. ""Skyline"" exists to show off a portfolio of creatures derived from ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Minority Report"" and many others. There are the motherships into which masses of hypnotized Angelenos are sucked. (Theyre brain food literally for the demanding tourists. Insert L.A. joke here.) There are so-called hydras and drones smaller tentacled beasts that give Donald ""Scrubs"" Faison -- who plays a callow special-effects wizard living large until he dies larger (whoopsie ""spoiler"") -- a time of it in the high-rise. Most of the film takes place in and around and atop the high-rise. Too much of it. Instead of effective claustrophobia ""Skyline"" feels static even with the digital megillahs giving Earth a dehumanizing makeover. The movie takes an absurd leap into cross-species heroism at the end once we see what actually goes on inside the brain-slurping motherships. ""I never saw myself out here"" mutters our East Coast hero played dully by Eric Balfour earlier on. Theres a sly joke buried in ""Skyline"" relating to the gullibility of Angelenos when it comes to the latest shiny distraction whether its an Angelyne billboard or a blue-light-not-so-special. The Strauses couldve shouldve exploited that joke more ruthlessly. Their effects are pretty good on a fairly limited budget. And thats about all you can say for ""Skyline."" mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence some language and brief sexual content) Cast Eric Balfour (Jarrod); Scottie Thompson (Elaine); Brittany Daniel (Candice); David Zayas (Oliver); Donald Faison (Terry) Credits Directed by the Brothers Strause; written by Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell; produced by Kristian James Andresen and Liam ODonnell and the Brothers Strause.

Scottie Thompson and Eric Balfour try to stay covered in Skyline (Rogue) Skyline Genre Action/Adventure Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Eric Balfour Donald Faison; Director Colin Strause Greg Strause; Release Date Wide 11/12/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Universal Pictures Posted November 12 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Basically a nifty VFX reel in search of a plot Skyline follows a group of hard-bodied thirtysomethings (including Eric Balfour and Donald Faison both of whom deserve better) trying to survive an alien invasion in L.A. They scream and bicker vacantly but nobodys buying a ticket to this movie to stare at a bunch of humans. The real stars are the descending swarm of tentacled brain-eaters that look like they were spawned at a cyborg seafood farm alongside the Cloverfield monster and District 9s prawns. Independently produced and helmed by the FX-wizard brothers Colin and Greg Strause Skyline confirms what D9 first proposed Sci-fi spectacles are no longer the sole domain of the megabudget director. With just a modicum of money (reportedly around 10 million) the Strauses used their tech savvy to make a marvel of logistics that looks every bit as slick as a studio tentpole. Its just a shame they havent figured out a way to CG a decent story. Yet.

Daily Edition Login to download Skyline Film Review 1130 AM PST 11/11/2010 by Megan Lehmann FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A laughably bad sci-fi mash-up with some above-average special effects. TWITTER SYDNEY a Belligerent aliens lay waste to downtown Los Angeles in visually spectacular fashion but thereas no sign of intelligent life in this high-concept low-budget sci-fi calamity. Beyond the dazzling ""first contact"" sequences seen in the trailers Skyline is a spasmodic and incoherent shambles hampered by an astoundingly stupid screenplay. Burdened also by unspeakably bad Syfy channel dialogue and dreadful acting it culminates in a risible finish that incredibly seems to be setting up a sequel. Sci-fi fans transfixed by the brilliant blue light from the invading spaceships in those tantalizing trailers should swarm multiplexes on opening but business will drop off steeply once it becomes clear that Skyline is neither a clever District 9 twin nor even a cut-rate War of the Worlds/Independence Day mash-up. Its a wannabe epic but make no mistake this is strictly B-movie fare punched up by some occasionally inspired imagery. The brothers Strause Colin and Greg special effects artists who worked on Avatar Iron Man 2 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and 300 as well as helming Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem financed their film independently. They clearly exhausted most of their modest budget and all of their creativity on a handful of cool set pieces created by their own SFX house Hydraulx. Outside the blockbuster-scale spectacle of hulking tentacled alien ships shooting out pulses of light to mesmerize their human prey before hoovering them up in squirming clouds this is a joyless slog through indecipherable action and even murkier cinematography. The film maintains a consistency of abysmal acting and direction from the moment we meet Jarrod (Six Feet Unders Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) traveling to L.A. to celebrate the birthday of Jarrods Porsche-driving margarita-swilling pal Terry (Donald Faison of Scrubs). Terrys penthouse party pad proves an excellent perch from which to watch an alien invasion. Just before dawn leftover partygoers are woken by an eerie blue glow streaming in through the blinds. One of them makes the mistake of looking into the light and is sucked up into the belly of a giant hovering spacecraft. So begins the end of the world - and an awful lot of yelling and running around in increasingly illogical circles by a small band of underwritten uniformly disagreeable characters. Those pesky budget restrictions mean the action is limited to a single high rise. So as the invaders scour the city outside looking for stragglers not beamed up in the initial abduction a handful of survivors runs up down even sideways a couple of times looking for escape. But they have nowhere to go - and neither does the movie. For all its pointless frenzy the film remains strangely inert as cynically dismissive of plot propulsion and character development as a porn film. The ""money shots"" starring the various alien creatures designed by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. are too few and far between. In a cockeyed nod to the maternal desire that fueled Ellen Ripley in Aliens screenwriters Joshua Cordes and Liam ODonnell toss in some nonsense about an unwanted pregnancy which only serves to make a bargain-basement storyline even more baffling. Heres a tip Dont waste your time trying to work out whats going on. Its clear by the end that the filmmakers had no idea either.
