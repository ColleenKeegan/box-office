Nearly two billion dollars in box-office doubloons flowed into the coffers and eight Academy Award wins plus untold riches on VHS and DVD made Walt Disney and the resurgence of traditional 2-D animation the storyline of the moment. Ursula Elton John at the piano an epic pan out to a grand ballroom Belle and Beast dancing arm in arm these are the images that stick with you images that captured a generation of fans. But Id say they were always fans of the stories not the medium and an evolution of both was barreling toward starship Disney. Pixar released the first feature film to use computer-generated imagery Toy Story in 1995 and that was pretty much that. The hand-drawn animation king was dead long live the king. Sure there would be occasional non-Pixar winners that slipped through (I quite enjoyed the breezy silliness of Lilo amp; Stitch) but the game had been permanently and irrevocably changed. Pixar wasnt just an evolution of medium it was an evolution of story structure. Princesses and their foils had been replaced by quirky though internally realistic environments and motivations. Imagination and methods leapt forward. And thus its with no small amount of oddness that the director of 2-D killer Toy Story John Lasseter is one of the champions of the last gasps of 2-D animation The Princess and the Frog. But what of this Princess and the Frog? Its a very cute film a very accessible work for children and families. Tiana is a girl growing up in New Orleans; her fathers dream of opening a restaurant has been passed along to her. Shes a hard worker a Disney heroine for this time and place a slinger of pancakes and a baker of beignets. Prince Naveen whos slightly estranged from his family (much like Eddie Murphys Prince Akeem in Coming to America) visits the city in hopes of finding a wife. Dr. Facilier is the sorcerer baddie willing to make your dreams come true ... for a price. Its a pretty typical setup villain-wise but the plot itself is a notable departure from the majority of Disneys animations. You see The Princess and the Frog is a very specific work. New Orleans creole Cajun gumbo voodoo jazz. Im not sure how well these concepts will translate to international audiences -- or heck even domestic audiences west of the mighty Mississip. I suppose thats not our concern here though as were tasked with reporting the highs and lows of The Princess and the Frog. The film starts slow laying the groundwork for Tianas personality. Shes a hard chargin dreamcatcher not so much of a ""when you wish upon a star"" style of girl as a ""work three jobs and your dreams will come true"" one. It would seem that even Disney has entered the new economy. Prince Naveen and Lawrence the man-servant come to New Orleans by boat making a grand entrance. Voodoo practitioner Dr. Facilier schemes his way into everyones plans using the Princes blood for nefarious shape-shifting purposes. There are numerous musical interludes including some great moments from soulful Ray (the lightning bug) and Mama Odie the good witch of the bayou. The movie does pick up steam once various spells have been cast; once were out of the real world and firmly into a transformative and illusory one. Sorry no spoilers here -- thats as much as I can give you plot-wise. My main criticism of The Princess and the Frog would probably be the multiple story arcs all filled with jagged edges. This is a Disney film we know nothing too terrible is going to transpire yet the film cant help wobbling toward the dramatic edge four or five times. Thirty minutes in the whole endeavor seems to be in trouble Tiana and the prince on the brink of disaster only our intellect tells us its going to work out. This makes for a very schizophrenic viewing experience. I dont remember these huge swings of emotion in previous Disney efforts; I recall a slower build to a satisfying culmination but perhaps my mind is playing tricks on me. Regardless I would have preferred a more balanced shared struggle here with less ""Were completely doomed"" moments. When you ask for your audience to care it should feel like a symphony not a stickup. This is probably not the film you wanted to push all your chips into the middle on as its firmly good but rarely great. But here we are The Princess and the Frog referred to as ""2-D Animations Last Hope"" Disneys head perched on fist anxiously awaiting our collective monetary judgment. Which I suppose makes me Johnny Utah to Princess and the Frogs Bodhi as it wades out into the ocean during a hurricane. ""Hes not coming back.""

But whats surprising about The Princess and the Frog is just how far back theyve gone this isnt The Lion King or even The Jungle Book with its sensuous hand-drawn animation soft pastel palette and jazz-age setting this is an exercise in retro recreation as rigorous and rewarding as Far from Heaven. The plot is thin but fun following the adventures of a poor New Orleans waitress with big dreams and a haughty prince of indeterminate foreign stock after theyre transformed into amphibians and marooned in the Louisiana bayou. Randy Newmans songs are a little too blandly Randy Newman-ish and the story is uneven but there are some great characters some even better jokes a general sense of good humour and that entrancing eye-ravishing old-school animation.

Crass and thoughtless. If the writers needed to establish how evil the villain can be they needed to do so earlier in the film. As it us hes plenty bad and adding this terrible scene near the end of the film (after the children have been manipulated to care about the firefly) is unnecessary and unethical. Disney movies have a long history of dead parents and evil step-parents but this instance is so irrelevant to the main plot as to make you think the company truly hates little kids.

The lightening bug is murdered ON CAMERA (with accompanying ""crunch"" sound effects) and an extended death scene in which his light slowly fades had children in the theater wailing.

Princess Tiana voiced by Anika Noni Rose plans to open a classy restaurant in New Orleans. Photo DISNEY The Princess and the Frog 1 / 2 Back to Gallery And we thought the era of cartoon Disney princesses was over. Old-school animation and all of its trappings -- the tiaras the enchantment the wishing on stars -- make a gently bewitching comeback in The Princess and the Frog a starry-eyed two-dimensional G-rated anachronism that pairs its retro aesthetic with a few small adjustments for the modern world. For starters the Mouse has officially crowned its first African-American princess. Her name is Tiana and shes not sitting around waiting for some pretty fella in tights to whisk her away on horseback. Voiced by Tony Award-winner Anika Noni Rose Tiana is a jazz-era waitress in New Orleans and baby shes got dreams; once she scrapes together the down payment she plans to open her own classy restaurant. Her mother (Oprah Winfrey) objects thinking she ought to get out there and ""meet (her) Prince Charming"" but Tiana has zero interest in men. Naturally one arrives Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos) a rakish party-boy whos in town shopping for a wealthy bride. As sometimes happens in these cases he gets sidetracked when an evil witch doctor (Keith David) turns Naveen into a frog -- and Naveen mistaking Tiana for a princess gives her a smooch and turns her into a frog. Our leads then spend the bulk of the film in amphibious form searching for blind voodoo queen Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) in the hopes they might switch back. Meanwhile a double swans around as the prince romancing a rich ditz named Lottie (Jennifer Cody). This being set in Louisiana there are sidekicks in the Bayou -- a trumpet-playing gator named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a beat-up Cajun firefly named Ray (Jim Cummings) who sings to the evening star and stole my heart. Helmed by Aladdins Ron Clements and Jon Musker The Princess and the Frog is packed with infections tunes all of them courtesy of Pixar veteran Randy Newman. Among them are a gospel hymn (Dig a Little Deeper sung by Mama Odie) a waltzing lullaby (Ma Belle Evangeline sung by Ray) a zydeco stomper (Gonna Take You There with a pupa substituting for accordion) and lots of brassy Nawlins jazz. To my ears this is some of the catchiest smartest Disney music since Beauty and the Beast. The animation sparkling and graceful also ranks as the studios best traditional work in ages (and its first since 2004s Home on the Range). Still not every kid will pirouette on tippy-toe in excitement. While my eighth-grade daughter adored the film my fourth-grader and his buddy found it a tad schmaltzy -- ""too much kissing"" -- and nontestosteronal to their taste. They much preferred my description of the original Grimm fairy tale in which the princess transmogrifies the title froggy by trash-talking the thing (""you nasty frog"") and splatting him against a wall. Sliding down he turns into a prince. Cool huh? But it sounds more like DreamWorks to me. As for Disney its nice to know that the studio behind Cinderella can still cast a spell in two dimensions. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 10 2009 159PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Princess and the Frog Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements Written by Ron Clements John Musker and Rob Edwards Starring Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos and John Goodman Classification G A by-the-numbers approach keeps The Princess and the Frog out of the first ranks of Disneys animated films but this lively fractured fairy tale should find an extended life in childrens DVD collections and on Broadway. The new movie is being doubly promoted as Disneys first featuring an African-American princess and a return to hand-drawn animation. Set in the New Orleans of the 1920s the story pays tribute to jazz culture and like last years The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  gains resonance from the Hurricane Katrina-devastated city itself. The casting decision seems less of an innovation than a long-overdue correction Disney has already featured native-American Chinese and Hawaiian heroines (and in Tim Burtons The Corpse Bride  even a dead one). Besides for the one African-American princess breaking new ground The Princess and the Frog offers plenty of familiar stereotypes air-headed blondes malaprop-mouthing Cajuns toothless hillbillies and a wise old voodoo queen in the bayou. Much bolder is the decision to return to pencil over pixel to animate the new musical a call made by John Lasseter the former Pixar head and computer-animation pioneer whos now the chief creative officer at Disney. The films directors and co-writers (with Rob Edwards) are Ron Clements and John Musker ( The Little Mermaid Aladdin ). Two of a team responsible for Disneys nineties renaissance they recreate the flowing Disney animation style paying homage to classic examples from Pinocchio to Lady and the Tramp with scenes that range from spooky gothic to phantasmagoric to art-deco grandeur. Pixars favourite songwriter Randy Newman provides the score which if short of memorable tunes is rich in authenticity with a mixture of local flavoured ragtime zydeco and jazz. A prelude set in 1912 sees a young Tiana (voiced by Elizabeth M. Dampier) as the child of a labourer James (Terrence Howard) who dreams of being a chef. Tianas mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is a seamstress and nanny to Tianas best friend the spoiled little white girl Charlotte (Breanna Brooks as a child and Jennifer Cody as an adult). Charlottes the daughter of a wealthy indulgent widower Big Daddy La Bouff (John Goodman) who is also the perennial Mardi Gras king. When Eudora reads the Grimms fairy tale of the princess and the frog to the children Charlotte says she would kiss any number of frogs to win a prince; Tiana says frog-kissing is where she would draw the line. Jump ahead a dozen years and the grown-up Tiana (voiced and modelled on Dreamgirls  vivacious star Anika Noni Rose) is on her own working two waitressing jobs and saving tips to top her late fathers dream by running a fancy restaurant. Tianas a somewhat dully industrious if unsappy heroine whos more interested in entrepreneurship than romance. Although the periods pervasive racial segregation isnt mentioned one cant help think that if Big Daddy had simply proffered a small-business loan there would be no need for Tiana to seek a princely saviour. Instead Charlottes father plays host to a costume ball for a visiting dignitary Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) a jazz-loving playboy from the fictional country of Maldovia. With his caramel-coloured skin Latin accent and Indian name Prince Naveen (Bruno Carlos) is a handsome shallow dude with wavy hair and mysterious ethnicity (the subject has been a source of controversy in the blogosphere). In any case he wears a crown which is enough for Tianas friend Charlotte who is set on bagging a royal husband. Unbeknownst to his guests Naveens also flat broke having been cut off by his rich parents for unspecified transgressions. He makes a bad bargain with the movies most memorable character a skeletal Creole witch doctor Dr. Facilier (Keith David) whose manner echoes such previous dandyish villains as Scar in The Lion King and Jafar in Aladdin . Facilier has as he explains in song ""friends on the other side"" which provides an opportunity for a ghostly seance sequence. Working in cahoots with Naveens treacherous valet Lawrence (Peter Bartlett) Facilier transforms the prince into a frog. Tiana out on Charlottes balcony wishing on a star for a financial stimulus package gets approached by the frog prince who mistakes her for a princess and asks for a kiss. Charity overcoming generosity she plants one on him and unexpectedly finds herself turned into a small green amphibian. That sets the stage for the two frogs to set out through the bayou to visit a 197-year-old blind voodoo queen Mama Odie (Jennifer Lewis). Theyre accompanied by a cornet-tooting alligator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a firefly named Ray (Jim Cummings) with an accent as thick as a mouthful of gumbo who has fallen in love with a star. The sidekicks it must be acknowledged feel grafted on though the frog love story has charm. Because Tiana and Naveen fall in love while at their most green and slimy (""Its not slime its mucous secretions"") we know their love must be real and will lead them back to their natural human gorgeousness. Lets just hope that The Princess and the Frog doesnt do for amphibian terrariums what 101 Dalmatians did for spotted dogs or Finding Nemo did for pet-fish sales.

"The Princess and the Frog reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Princess and the Frog reviewed. The Princess and the Frog reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 11 2009 116 PM The Princess and the Frog A princess movie that ever so gently undermines the whole princess thing. By Dan Kois ""I was starting to think wishing on stars was just for babies and crazy people"" sighs Lottie the antiheroine of Disneys new animated feature The Princess and the Frog a movie that takes a dim view of wishing on stars and hoping your dreams will come true. The Princess and the Frog represents a course-correction for Disneys multibillion-dollar princess franchise It attempts to celebrate the virtues of hard work and pluck even if the movie itself can feel at times like a lesson rather than an enchantment. For parents exasperated with their daughters princess obsession--fueled by such earlier Disney features as Cinderella Snow White and Sleeping Beauty or more accurately by Disneys (genius) decision to brand those characters under the ""princess"" line in 2000--The Princess and the Frog will feel heaven-sent. As earthy as the previous movies were dreamy and featuring the companys first African-American animated heroine The Princess and the Frog is set in 1920s New Orleans a locale it treats with due respect--from the jazz- and zydeco-inflected soundtrack to the prominent role of beignets and gumbo in the movies plot. (At the very least New Orleanians should find nothing as objectionable in the movies portrayal of their city as Arab-Americans found  in Aladdins regrettable lyric ""Its barbaric but hey its home"") Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. We first meet the new Disney princess Tiana as a young girl listening to the story of the Frog Prince alongside her friend Charlotte. Charlotte is rich and white the pampered daughter of Big Daddy La Bouff (voice of John Goodman) a NAwlins mover and shaker who spoils his little girl rotten. Tianas mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is a seamstress kept in business by Charlottes insatiable demands for new princess dresses. (Her room will be familiar to contemporary parents packed as it is with frilly pink numbers and shelves that are stocked with suspiciously Disney-esque dolls.) When the girls grow up needless to say their paths diverge. Lotties a hottie with a motor mouth a face-splitting grin and a hunger for happily ever after; she dreams of the day a real prince will come to New Orleans and sweep her off her feet. Tiana for her part takes her fathers long-ago advice Wishing on a star he told her ""can only take you part of the way. You have to help it along with some hard work of your own."" So Tiana toils at two waitress jobs saving up pennies to open her own restaurant. When a real prince does arrive in New Orleans hes not all hes cracked up to be. Prince Naveen of Maldovia (Bruno Campos) is a feckless Lothario with a love of jazz and empty pockets. (His parents have cut him off.) Evil witch doctor Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog; when frog-Naveen convinces a dubious Tiana to kiss him she too finds herself slimy and green. Advertisement Tiana of course must learn to loosen up and have a little fun. Naveen must learn to appreciate the value of hard work. The journey to those unsurprising revelations will be for most parents a smooth one thanks to terrific voice acting and some exceptionally beautiful hand-drawn animation. (After a brief abandonment of cel animation in favor of computer-generated movies its nice to see Disney back doing what it does best.) If the songs by Randy Newman are blandly aphoristic with titles like ""Dig a Little Deeper"" and ""Almost There"" theyre at least catchy enough. And if Tiana isnt the most exciting heroine--shes as straight-arrow as they come and even her eventual cutting loose comes in the form of some chaste dancing--shes one that little girls will love and to whom no parent can object. (Dreamgirls Anika Noni Rose who knows her way around a ballad provides Tianas voice.)And who was the last Disney princess who wasnt a good-hearted snooze? At least Tianas boring for good reasons and doesnt fritter away her time dreaming of a prince. Thats Lotties job. Lottie one of the funnier animated creations in recent memory prances like a show pony and somehow delivers her lines with both a Southern drawl and a machine-gun cadence. (The exceptional voice work is from Broadway actress Jennifer Cody.) Though she stands in the way of Tianas dreams shes a lovable addle-pated character a not-so-wicked stepsister chirpy and flighty but with a good heart. The wickedness comes from Facilier who has Keith Davids entrancing baritone and a long lean slippery physique recalling Plastic-Man mixed with Michael Jackson. His big number ""Friends on the Other Side"" is the best-written in the movie and a great showcase of spooky voodoo-inflected animation; his comeuppance is appropriately spectacular.As always a team of Disney writers has packed the margins with lively supporting characters Ray a snaggletoothed Cajun firefly; Louis a lovable trumpet-playing gator (with sharp horn provided by Terence Blanchard); Faciliers henchmen a pack of creepy shadow-creatures who wouldnt be out of place in a Miyazaki movie. The directors Ron Clements and Jon Musker--Disney vets with Aladdin and The Little Mermaid on their resumes--keep the story moving.But efficient well-practiced storytelling is what we expect from a Disney animated feature. The real story here for parents is the clever and careful recalibration of the princess archetype. Even as previous Disney movies tweaked the concept they still maintained a vision of princesshood based on wealth beauty and happily ever after. The Princess and the Frog does away with those notions. Tianas palace is a restaurant. The princess spends most of the movie secreting mucus and hungering after bugs. And happily ever after may come but only after the movies heroes roll up their sleeves and get to work. Sound square? It is. But as the dad of two daughters Ill take it.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In a Louisiana bayou ""The Princess and the Frog"" goes so completely from worrisome to wondrous that deference to this beautifully hand-drawn animated feature must be paid. Disney has had some trouble deciding whether to herald or repress the fact that this is its first film with an African-American princess. And this reimagining -- and then some -- of E.D. Bakers ""The Frog Princess"" starts as a period piece with freighted images of jiving kids dancing jazzing black musicians tooting their horns and a dastardly and less charming than he believes voodoo man. Prince Naveen of Maldonia and hard-dreaming harder-working waitress Tiana have yet to be turned into lime green frogs. When they are the movie leaps to joyous unfettered life. Small wonder Aesop entrusted animals to convey all-too-human complexities. In the swamp theyll meet two unforgettable characters. Gifted gator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) wants to be human and blow his horn baby. Ray (Jim Cummings) the Cajun firefly with a fanny of light is brilliantly content and kind as is though he does pine for the mysterious Evangeline. Also in the mist and cypress is a priestess Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) who is sure to break the spell. Setting the story in New Orleans is a way of course to tease and dodge race. After all the Crescent City is a gumbo a mix of cultures African European Cajun Creole. When we first meet Tiana (Tony winner Anika Noni Rose) she is a little girl with a growing talent for cooking. (Amid the inevitable movie tie-ins is a cookbook with recipes for muffuletta and the like.) Her father James (Terrence Howard) has plans for a restaurant. Her mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is a sought out seamstress. One of the well-heeled clients who keeps Eudora traveling from her shotgun-style house to the more stately houses of the Garden District is Mr. La Bouff (John Goodman). His daughter Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) has made her bedroom a shrine to pink satin and fairy tales. Blond and giggly shes gleefully bowled over by Eudoras recounting of the fable in which a kiss returns a frog to his royal status. Tiana doesnt have time for swooning over make-believe princes. She has ambitions. And the films first perfect moment -- and there are plenty -- comes when in the slam of a bedroom door Tiana goes from sweet kid to a young woman holding two jobs and saving for a restaurant. Her opposite in work ethic is Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) who arrives in New Orleans before Mardi Gras to great fanfare. The princes ethnicity rankled some critics who hoped Disney had the chuztpah to make a love story featuring two African-American protagonists. Regardless the Brazilian-born actor is amusing especially once his light-skinned suave self is made amphibian in a shady bargain. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements ""The Princess and the Frog"" rummages in the attic of Hollywood of yore. When Charlotte natters on about ""Big Daddy this Big Daddy that"" shes straight out of Tennessee Williams. Something in voodoo practitioner Dr. Faciliers (Keith David) lithe slide to the right smooth slide to the left choreography brings to mind the ""hi-de-ho"" moves of Cotton Club bandleader Cab Calloway. Randy Newmans original songs are solidly in the key of jazz zydeco and other styles that speak but dont fully express New Orleans overwhelming musical heritage. No matter. The visual artistry of the song-and-dance numbers captivates. The loveliness starts with Tianas fantasy sequence -- all browns and oranges and golds -- about the transformation of a dilapidated sugar mill into a go-to restaurant. This wouldnt be New Orleans without Mardi Gras parades and a celebratory procession to usher a soul to its final resting place. And what a place. ""THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG."" G. 1 hour 35 minutes.

"This Princess takes her place among Disneys animated classics - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections This Princess takes her place among Disneys animated classicsOrlando Review  (out of four)December 11 2009|By Roger Moore Orlando Sentinel Movie CriticDisneys The Princess and the Frog is an instant classic and one of the years best films. An enchanting story told with a healthy helping of heart it marks a return to the style of animation that made Walt Disneys studio famous. And its a return to form for a studio that milked 2D animated fairy tales to death in the 90s.Disneys first African American ""princess"" tale is set in Roaring 20s New Orleans with the classic frog prince story translated to hard-working waitress Tiana (voiced by Dreamgirl Anika Noni Rose) who tries to help a suave frog (Bruno Campos very Antonio Banderas) become a prince again with a kiss. But shes not a real princess and the neer-do-well prince Naveen who is visiting ""Nawlins"" to soak up the jazz and marry a rich girl needs to learn the value of hard work and true love. So Tiana is transformed into a frog too and each of them learns a better way to live and love as theyre dodging gators and the minions of The Shadow Man (Keith David perfect) who has set up a fake prince with designs on finally having the money to rule the city.Disney summoned its Little Mermaid team to direct this and John Musker and Ron Clements zero in on the emotional center of the story even as they and their co-writers find jokes and jokey characters to juice this thing up. So we see Tiana grasp that achieving her dream -- her own restaurant -- without love would be empty and Naveen learn to think of someone other than himself.There are story elements borrowed from many a Disney toon even The Jungle Book as and a trumpet-playing gator wants to be human so he can blow that jazz. Musker and Clements even name a blue tick hound ""Stella"" just so Big Daddy La Bouff can summon his dog Tennessee Williams style.""STEL-laaaaa""Big Daddy spoils his daughter Lottie (Jennifer Cody an adorably daft voice to match her character) but never thinks of lending his daughters lifelong pal Tiana the money to open her own restaurant. Thats just as well as this movies ""hard work"" ethos suggests that she wouldnt take anyway.Randy Newman a songwriter with deep New Orleans roots conjures up a dazzling collection of tunes with a couple of gospel-inspired call-and-response show-stoppers -- ""Im Almost There"" and ""Dig a Little Deeper"" (a bayou chorus of roseate spoonbills). And if this lyric doesnt give the city a new theme song -- ""Rich people poor people all got dreams. And dreams do come true in New Orleans"" -- somebodys missing the riverboat.Musker and Clements invent a great new Disney villain in The Shadow Man and like Walt and the Brothers Grimm dont shy away from letting death show its face lending urgency and poignancy to the tale.Its been 20 years since The Little Mermaid but with this classic story classically told The Princess and the Frog can proudly take its place among Disneys great princess pictures. Yes ""EVERY little girl is a princess"" is true. And if the spirited Tiana inspires more African American princesses to don tiaras their daddies will just have to live with it.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In the year of Americas first black president it makes sense that Disney would introduce its first black princess. On the surface this feels revolutionary. Her name isnt Ariel or Belle. Its Tiana. And she and all the black characters in ""The Princess and the Frog have been drawn by hand with an appreciable degree of love and care - wide noses and full lips realistically scaled for each bright brown face. Even the somewhat stereotypical voodoo man a light-skinned toothpick with purple pupils and a gap in his teeth you could sail a boat through looks like one of my uncles.For an additional measure of inspiration the movie is set in old-time French Quarter New Orleans and hits every box in the citys checkered checklist gumbo; riverboats; a toothless turbaned conjure woman (with Jenifer Lewiss voice); chase sequences all over the bayou. Powdered sugar sits like a cloud on the beignets. And Randy Newmans songs swing from big band and gospel to zydeco and well Randy Newman.But the renovations are merely cosmetic. Alas ""The Princess and the Frog still forces Tiana into the same conundrum that every Disney heroine faces the marriage fantasy. She puts up a fuss but its no use.Voiced warmly by Anika Noni Rose Tiana was raised by her seamstress mother (Oprah Winfrey) and dreams of being a chef and running a nightclub restaurant in honor of her late father (Terrence Howard). Tiana refuses to believe in fairy tales and princes. She waits tables saves her tips and sings about how hard shes working. No fun please shes a serious black woman. When Naveen (Bruno Campos) a randy racially ambiguous jazzbo prince from someplace called Maldonia makes a sour deal with the voodoo man (Keith David) that turns him into a frog he needs a princesss kiss to break the spell and chooses Tiana who happens to be wearing a tiara and sky-blue gown. Its a costume. So instead of turning him back into a man her kiss shrinks this upwardly mobile woman into a proud frog and a kind of screwball comedy ensues. The movie isnt short on pleasure. Naveen is a more commanding frog than he is a prince (that neck; those giant delicious-looking legs). Tianas restaurant looks like something from the Harlem Renaissance - all the expressionist angles and silhouettes; the ochres mustards and chocolates; the bubbling champagne flutes that rise like girls in a Busby Berkeley musical. These sequences are an Aaron Douglas painting come to life. The whole movie should have been drawn in such an inspired scheme. The voice actors are also excellent especially Michael-Leon Wooley as a bouncy trumpet-playing alligator and Jim Cummings as a lovelorn Cajun firefly. When those two arrive the Claudette Colbert-Clark Gable movie Tiana and Naveen have going on expands into a sort of swamp-faring ""Wizard of Oz caper in which they look for a way to become human again.But theres a rub. Even as Tiana and Naveen hop together through the bayou she continues to assert her self-reliance. So while she knows shes headed for love I just never felt her heart was in it. Its not a man she wants. Its professional success. The way she resists the fantasy formula is admirable but ultimately (and disappointingly) futile. Early on it looked like the directors Ron Clement and John Musker who also did ""The Little Mermaid and ""Aladdin together were close to turning things completely upside down. Tianas rich white man-hungry counterpart a creature of comical breathlessness named Lotte (Jennifer Cody) is a lurid joke on old Disney princesses. With her big eyes and tornado gumption shes like Dorothy Malone the Bratz doll. I do like how the movie doesnt turn her into Tianas rival. In her selfish way Lotte is a friend. But her lustiness makes Tianas falling in love seem more reasonable. Its not. As charismatic as Naveen is (Campos pumps the character full of enjoyably obnoxious oomph) its inconceivable that his flirting would make a romantic impression on Tiana. The fairy tale here is ultimately a business transaction. She doesnt love his money but it is nice to have no? In that sense ""The Princess and the Frog does transcend race. The color that truly matters is green.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Movie Information The Princess and the FrogRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Ron Clements and John MuskerActorsVoices of Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos Keith David Jim Cummings Michael-Leon Wooley Terrence Howard and Oprah WinfreyRun time 97 minutesMPAA rating G (some scary images)SynopsisDisney introduces another contender to the throne in this much-anticipated animated tale.More movies from GuideLive.comBut that was the old regime. Now John Lasseter is running the show and if the lithe exuberant Princess and the Frog is any indication hes brought some of the Pixar pixie dust with him. The characters human and animal are blessed with expressive features and deft comic timing. The colors and sleek design leap from the screen. And if youre into pull-out-the-stops Broadway-style musical numbers they have those too.Most important this modern take on the classic royalty-amphibian mash-up has that old Disney something heart class wit - whatever you want to call it. Old-fashioned charm meshes with a suave knowing urbaneness; song and dance (and swim) have a high time in Louisiana bayou country and before-the-flood New Orleans. You know theyll all live happily ever after (at least the ones that deserve to) but its still a constant treat watching them get there.Princess Tiana (Broadway star Anika Noni Rose) as you may have heard is Disneys first African-American princess. But shes not too worried about that; she just wants to open her own restaurant in the French Quarter and follow in the culinary footsteps of her late father (Terrence Howard). Yeah theres a prince (Bruno Campos) in town but she doesnt have much time for him either - until that is they both turn into slimy green critters. Venturing into the swamplands for safety they find themselves slowly bonding then falling head over webbed feet.This New Orleans has its share of snakes as well. The most invigorating is a Voodoo conjurer named Dr. Facilier blessed with the golden baritone of Keith David. The good doctor gets the best production number ""Friends on the Other Side"" a rollicking slice of New Orleans jazz with swirling psychedelic colors nimble shadows and an art deco texture. Davids voice-over work has brought gravitas to everything from video games to Ken Burns documentaries; here he gets to cut loose and be as bad he wants to be.Its still a Disney film so our little green friends get some animal buddies as well. These include Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) an alligator who wants to play jazz trumpet like that other New Orleans Louis as in Armstrong; and Ray (Jim Cummings) a Cajun firefly with dental issues.Disneys aggressive marketing and ""from the vault"" hucksterism make it an easy target for critics. But The Princess and the Frog makes for a very encouraging sign. Light on its feet confident and modern its the work of a company hungry for respect and eager to remind moviegoers of its enchanting roots. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Disney Enterprises) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 11 2009 Few movies have been greeted with as much anticipation -- and outright apprehension -- than ""The Princess and the Frog"" Disneys first animated movie to feature an African American princess. You can exhale now ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a triumph on every one of the myriad levels it has been asked to succeed on. This StoryThe Princess and the Frog Shes the belle of the ballWatch the trailer Anika Noni Rose (""Dreamgirls"" ""The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"") gives mellifluous spoken and musical voice to Tiana who works as a waitress in 1920s New Orleans and dreams of opening her own restaurant. When the handsome Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) arrives in town at first it looks like hell be married off to Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) a spoiled Southern belle whose family employed Tianas seamstress mother. But when villainous voodoo doctor Facilier (Keith David) intervenes everyones plans go awry with both Tiana and Prince Naveen winding up as frogs lost in the Louisiana bayou. With a lilting catchy score written by the venerable Randy Newman and hand-drawn animation that evokes the most cherished Disney classics ""The Princess and the Frog"" effortlessly takes its place in one of cinemas most-revered canons managing to be groundbreaking and utterly familiar at the same time. The films setting in New Orleans with its African European Caribbean and Native American influences allows for a gratifyingly diverse mix of ethnicities and hues among its characters which also include a Cajun firefly named Ray and a trumpet-playing alligator named Louis. Most important Tiana turns out to be not just pretty but competent and self-sufficient embodying the principle that wishing upon a star might help you express your dreams but hard work character and perseverance make them come true. ""The Princess and the Frog"" has been a long time coming but its well worth the wait.  G. At area theaters.

"Princess and the Frog The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; princess-and-the-frog-the ) Princess and the Frog The (United States 2009) December 10 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli When Disney mothballed traditional animation in 2004 following a series of disappointing box office underperformers the blame was placed upon changing tastes - that viewers preferred the more eye-popping style of computer-generated images to the ""old fashioned"" approach that had dominated for nearly 70 years. Little or no consideration was given to the decline in quality of the animated productions especially where the story was concerned. Disney had strayed from the tried-and-true formulas that marked its greatest animated successes and the company was harvesting crops from neglected fields. So hand-drawn animation was dumped but what at the time seemed to be a permanent measure became temporary once the Disney/Pixar merger was finalized. With Pixar in charge of all animated projects the decision was made to revive traditional animation but in doing so to return to its ""roots."" The result is The Princess and the Frog and if you didnt know better youd swear this had been made in the late 1980s or early 1990s alongside The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. The elements are all in place. The movie has a loose connection to a fairy tale (The Frog Prince) seven Broadway-style animated numbers (penned by longtime Disney collaborator Randy Newman) a plucky heroine likeable animal sidekicks (a jazz-loving crocodile and a firefly besotted with a star) a fairy godmother type a villain who uses black magic and a stew of romance and comedy. The Princess and the Frog is so in synch with the early entries into Disneys so-called ""second golden age"" that one wonders how the company could have gotten away from these movies in the first place. Much has been made about Tiana (voice of Anika Noni Rose) being Disneys first African American ""princess"" but Disney has never been afraid of branching out. Lead females have included an Arab (Jasmine Aladdin) a lioness (Nala The Lion King) a Native American (Pocahontas) and a Chinese girl (Mulan). Tiana has just as much spirit as any other Disney standout (and she spends most of the film as a frog anyway). Its certainly time (or past time) for the Magic Kingdom to embrace a black character but I suspect this has more meaning to those who write about such things that it will to the movies target audience - children of all ages genders and races. Tiana is a hard-working waitress who holds down two jobs at the eateries of New Orleans. She dreams of amassing enough money to one day open her own restaurant - a dream engendered in her at an early age and encouraged by her father (voice of Terrence Howard) and mother (Oprah Winfrey). Her best friend Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) has an equally ambitious goal to marry a prince. This looks feasible when Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) a foreign dignitary visits New Orleans. Unfortunately he falls afoul of the voodoo of Dr. Facilier (Keith David) who turns him into a frog. The first woman he meets is Tiana at a costume ball where shes dressed in a princess costume. He convinces her to kiss him but the results arent what either expects. Instead of Naveen regaining human form Tiana is turned into a frog. Now with the help of a jovial crocodile named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and the firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) the two must avoid the shadow-creatures of Dr. Facilier while attempting to locate the voodoo priestess Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) who may know how they can become human again. From a visual standpoint theres little to differentiate The Princess and the Frog from the likes of The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin all of which shared a similar style. The strongest link lies with co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker who also helmed two of those three The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Backed by an army of animators Clements and Musker imbue the streets of New Orleans and the bayous of Louisiana with the same subtle magic that gave life to an undersea kingdom and ancient Baghdad. The films comedy finds the right mix of jokes that will appeal to children and adults. The sidekicks are cute but not too cute. And the romance is of the sort that humanizes the characters. The best animated Disney films have often been romantic comedies and this is no exception. For the most part the characters are voiced by low-profile actors all of whom are well-chosen. There are some big names in the cast - Oprah Winfrey Terrence Howard John Goodman - but all have supporting parts. If one elects to trace the beginning of the decline of 90s animated films to Pocahontas its worth noting that this was the first time (but not the last) that Disney employed an A-list actor (Mel Gibson) for voice work. If theres something to be said for relative anonymity the statement was made by The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King. Randy Newmans songs are catchy and are effective within the movies context but I cant see any of them having ""legs"" beyond the screen the way tunes from the earlier animated musicals did. Newman who has frequently worked with Pixar on computer animated films was a safe choice as the composer and his score combines elements of jazz and gospel that amplify the locale and themes. One could liken Newmans work on The Princess and the Frog with that of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens on Anastasia songs that are enjoyable and advance the story but are generally not remembered afterward (at least until the fourth or fifth viewing). If theres little thats new or challenging in The Princess and the Frog therein lies the core of its charm. The movie is delightfully ""old school"" if that term can be applied to how the genre looked a mere 20 years ago when The Little Mermaid reinvigorated it. The structure and composition is the result of careful planning but it comes across as inspired. Tiana is the next great Disney princess and The Princess and the Frog is a worthy entry into a genre whose resurrection is welcome.

(SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Dec. 11 2009 Animated. Starring the voices of Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos Keith David Michael-Leon Wooley Jennifer Cody and Jim Cummings. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. 97 minutes. At major theatres. G Disney provides a fairy-tale ending for animation lovers returning to its roots with the artful The Princess and the Frog a lovely toon destined to join the Mouse Houses best-loved classics.With a message that hard work gets you what you want in life not wishing on stars or counting on princes one of the most-worshipped little-girl idols - the Disney princess - finally joins the modern world.Article Continued BelowDirected by John Musker and Ron Clements (The Little Mermaid Aladdin) The Princess and the Frog will soothe the eyeballs of the CGI-weary. Soft-edged and colour-saturated in hand-drawn good old 2-D it offers an uplifting yet simple story that trips along with the help of jazzy toe-tappers spirited Zydeco and inspiring gospel styles infusing a score of forgettable songs by Oscar-winner Randy Newman. The mansions and lush gardens of 1920s New Orleans streetcars trundling down gas-lit streets a shadowy voodoo world and the Spanish moss-draped bayou provide the glorious backdrops. This Princess is more than just a looker. Thanks to the movies star shes also got smarts charm drive and a sense of humour. The latter initially eludes spirited African-American wannabe restaurateur Tiana (voiced by Dreamgirls Anika Noni Rose). But then theres not much to amuse when turned into a frog.Tiana is unlike frothy Disney princesses past from her generous curves - shes a chef and looks like she eats - to her focus on hard work over daydreams. Labouring at two waitressing jobs leaves no time for wishing on stars for love like her boy-crazy pal Charlotte (delightfully zany Jennifer Cody).Neither is Tiana interested in trying to catch the eye of visiting royal hunk the aimless Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos) who has come to New Orleans to listen to jazz. Now if she could land the contract for making her late daddys legendary gumbo for the palace that would be another story.Evil slithers in wearing a skull-and-crossbones-festooned top hat. Sly Dr. Facilier (Keith David) a snake-hipped Creole voodoo villain with a pencil-thin moustache has a direct line to the spirit world and can conjure up all manner of ghoul and spectre to do his bidding.Hes to blame for turning Prince Naveen into a frog and when the web-footed victim begs for his liberating kiss from Tiana the spell backfires and she finds herself turning into the cutest amphibian this side of the Mississippi.From there its just a hop and a jump to the bayou to seek a cure. They meet up with Louis a neurotic alligator who yearns to join a jazz band and laid-back love bug Ray (Jim Cummings wonderful) a sweet-talking Cajun firefly suffering the pangs of unrequited love.Tiana has no time for her lazy frog prince and his let-them-eat-flies attitude. But hes not as shallow as he seems and she realizes that love can be more than skin deep - even green slimy skin. ""Its not slime its mucous"" the prince huffily informs her.The tale although lightweight is told with good humour and enough goofiness to keep smaller audience members laughing at the antics of the crazy swamp critters. Parents will appreciate the messages about the value of hard work and the rewards it can bring - although they are so oft repeated you may be tempted to sigh ""enough I got it.""But it is a good antidote for all those years of singing ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" while mooning at a twinkling first star. The prince is still very welcome but no rescue required.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Old-school in that its the product of hand-drawn animation rather than the digital sort. New-school in that its scrappy heroine is both self-made and prince-completed.And in truth the film billed as the first Disney animation to boast an African American ""princess"" is really about a resourceful bootstrapper in New Orleans a young woman allergic to the fairy-tale pap spoon-fed to young girls.Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) daughter of a World War I soldier James (Terrence Howard) and a seamstress mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is a Crescent City waitress.She is also a would-be chef who balances two jobs - and many many serving trays - hoping to save enough and realize her dream of opening Tianas Place a stylish supper club.When Naveen (Bruno Campos) a playboy prince from the Mediterranean kingdom of Maldonia (somewhere between Mali and Macedonia?) arrives in town hard-working Tiana hardly notices.She is amused though at the intensity with which her childhood playmate Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) daughter of the prosperous family for whom Eudora sews sets her cap for the prince hoping to trade in her cloche for Naveens crown.Then Naveen steps into some deep voodoo courtesy of Dr. Facilier (Keith David) a trickster who turns him into Kermit. When Tiana kisses frog Naveen he doesnt become a prince. Instead she becomes an amphibian with a sticky ribbon tongue and taste for flies.For much of this musical gumbo seasoned with Randy Newman songs the frogs travel bayou and swamp to find the voodoo priestess Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) who might reverse the curse.Escorting them are a horn-playing gator named Louis and a sparkly firefly named Ray the bioluminescent counterpart of Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket. In one of the films nicer subplots Ray doesnt wish upon a star; he sings to one.With eye-popping saturated color and streamlined figures codirectors Ron Clements and John Musker (the duo behind the vibrant Aladdin) lovingly invoke Harlem Renaissance artistry.While the songs in The Princess and the Frog generally are not up to the high standard of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid Dr. Faciliers showstopping ""Friends on the Other Side"" is almost as colorful and bouncy as Aladdins ""A Friend Like Me.""(With its spectral creatures and unleashed evil this sequence might be a little scary for viewers under 7.)Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

(Courtesy of Disney)How can a good-looking animated feature with a Randy Newman song as kicky as ""When Were Human"" end up being just sort of ... all right?Such is ""The Princess and the Frog"" the Disney companys first hand-drawn (non-digital) effort since ""Home on the Range"" five years ago. Itll look especially pleasing to older audiences whove missed this warmer visual aesthetic of 2-D animation---and their kids wont have their souls crushed by it or anything. But the movie slam-jams its overpacked story in a frenetic needlessly complicated manner. It lacks for nothing in setting and atmosphere (New Orleans mostly in the 1920s with side trips to bayou country) but comes up short where it counts the characters. Human insect or amphibian their appeal is hard-sell and engineered. I realize times change but its too bad these screenwriters and directors couldnt revisit ""The Jungle Book"" (1967) for reference. That film with its hep-cats-meet-Kipling insouciance took its time and has become a classic. ""The Princess and the Frog"" never catches its breath.It features the first African-American princess from Disney Enterprises Inc. to whom the buine of marketing female royalty is ignificant. The central character is oddly sidelined by her own story. Brought up by loving hard-working parents (Terrence Howard and Oprah Winfrey voice the roles) Tiana chases one goal above all opening her own restaurant. The longtime waitress scrimps and saves and if the bumbling condescending white businessmen allow it shell own the waterfront former sugar mill of her dreams outright. The script quickly introduces a visiting prince a smoothie with the doe-eyed Big Easy femmes. The prince runs afoul of the spell-casting ""shadow man"" Dr. Facilier (Keith David he of the basso hoodoo voice). To escape his newly amphibian state Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) must lock lips with a princess; Tiana he mistakenly believes will do the trick. She doesnt; she turns into a frog herself. Then the bickering begins in earnest and keeps up for most of the film which has a way of creating noisy diversions away from Tianas situation rather than setting up tributaries that feed the main river.The first half-hour of ""The Princess and the Frog"" is virtually laughless. Then in the nick of time were treated to songwriter Newmans best number in an eight-song score. In the spirit of ""Hakuna Matata"" ""When Were Human"" is tailored for a trumpet-playing alligator named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and the would-be froggy lovers. (The songs story purpose is similar to ""Human Again"" cut from Disneys ""Beauty and the Beast"" but interpolated into the stage version.) Alas Tiana whose hallmarks are doggedness and clean living isnt a very interesting character though Broadway ace Anika Noni Rose provides her with a wonderfully soulful voice. Campos Naveen may look like Michigan J. Frog but he sounds like Maurice Chevaliers cousin amusingly. Less amusing is a Cajun firefly (voice by Jim Cummings) resembling a dentally challenged Jiminy Cricket who aids Tiana and the gang on their journey as does ancient Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis). She gets a gospel stomper to sing (""Dig a Little Deeper"") though the song stops the show in theory not in practice.I loved one bit and one bit only a brief riotous flashback showing Louis the alligators first foray into inter-species jazz musicianship. This you think is the old stuff funny quick on its feet and---tellingly---the one big laugh in the all-ages screening I attended. Disney can be proud of adding finally a black princess to its roster of princessy archetypes. On the other hand With his rolling eyes and cliched overexploited menace Dr. Facilier may have some parents in the audience thinking back to Geoffrey Holder in ""Live and Let Die"" which is a mixed blessing indeed.mjphillipstribune.comRelatedWinters 10 most-intriguing moviesMPAA rating G (all ages admitted).Voice cast Anika Noni Rose (Tiana); Bruno Campos (Prince Naveen); Keith David (Dr. Facilier); Michael-Leon Wooley (Louis); Jim Cummings (Ray); Jenifer Lewis (Mama Odie); John Goodman (Big Daddy) Credits Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements; written by Clements  Musker and Rob Edwards; songs by Randy Newman; produced by Peter Del Vecho. A Walt Disney Pictures release. Running time 134. Posted at 103713 AM in Reviews Comments Im really pretty astonished by so many of these posts. When will everything and I mean EVERYTHING stop being about race? How are we supposed to become a country where race doesnt matter when it so obviously DOES matter? Nobody has ever complained at such length about any other Disney movie-- and really I thought they outdid themselves with such a diverse cast of characters. But that thought only occurred AFTER the movie because when I was in the midst of it excuse me if I was too enraptured to take a black/white head count For Disney who hasnt made a 2D movie in quite some time I think this is a triumphant return. If I had been met with all the pressures they were coming into this Im not sure I would have bothered at all Really its disappointing to see the complaints. Ill never understand I suppose. At any rate Ive seen this movie as many times as I could without going bankrupt. I grew up on a steady staple of Disney movies and watched The Little Mermaid so many times that I could recite it by heart. (By the way Mr. Phillips The Jungle Book was probably one of the WORST Disney movies ever-- Mowgli was a spoiled brat of a character.) When I thought they had forever switched to 3D animation it simply broke my heart-- especially when I aspire to be an artist some day. (Im currently in college.) Then I heard the news-- Disney was coming back not only with their first African-American Princess (which surprised me because it wasnt like all the Disney women were white) but the first story (except for Pocahontas of course) set in America and an America that I could really relate to. (Old-World USA is a little far back for me to really slip myself in you know?) And the Roaring 20s No doubt one of the most exciting and table-turning points in our history. Indeed all of the themes and flavors and music they got from this era and the setting of New Orleans made the entire movie a colorful flurry of sounds and lights. (But not that I couldnt keep up which apparently you didnt manage to do dear Mr. Phillips. Odd since the movie is aimed at 5-year-olds.) The characters now I think Ill discuss them. First of all anyone who saw the title The Princess and the Frog and didnt realize that characters were going to be frogs are just... short-sighted. How would their relationship develop if they were each stuck as a different species? What ELSE would the climax be in the movie if not the point when the characters change back? (Maybe I get this because Im a writer I dont know but it didnt seem like a rocket-science leap to me.) Oi. Tiana was quite a change in itself a very hard-working almost tunnel-vision young woman who bluntly told her mother that she was too busy for fairy-tale dreams. She worked incredibly hard and thats a commendable trait from a line of true Princesss. (Of course theres Cinderella but well... I dont think thats quite the same do you?) She managed to be sweet and caring as well and obviously loved her mother. (It was also nice for a Disney girl to have her mother for once.) I dont get all the comments that white people were portrayed in a bad light either. I thought everyone got along really well with one another You never see anything to the contrary anywhere in the movie. The La Bouff family was nothing but familiarly friendly with Tiana and her mother since Tiana had practically grown up with Charlotte and Charlotte for all her somewhat-bubbly and spacey nature was a LOVELY character. She had heart and gave up her beloved happy ending for her friend. (Not to mention who cleaned Tiana up when she fell over the refreshment table?) Sure she was a funny character but why would anyone be upset about that? Which brings us to Ray. Sure he was portrayed as something of a Cajun hillbilly but really his character was so kind and endearing that its obvious they werent attacking him. Ray was undoubtedly a lot smarter about many things than the rest of the characters and he was sort of the papa bear so to speak-- the wise character that helped lead Naveen Tiana and Louis along. His death was a tear-jerking part of the movie and his devotion to people hed only just met enviable. Naveen. Ahh poor Naveen. Not white enough or black enough for anyones standards. Still as Princes go I was completely enamored of his obvious character flaws instead of being portrayed as perfect-- or not portrayed at all Facilier was creepy his nasty minions were creepy he was a perfectly evil villain-- end of story. Im getting tired of typing so I hope you get the picture. That aside I sincerely hope that some of the people who posted that they would certainly NOT be seeing the movie change their minds because otherwise theyre short-sighted and incredibly stupid. Despite what Ive said if you want to know how you feel about a movie go see it yourself Or at least rent it if you dont want to spend the money on a theater ticket I give it 5/5 for sheer brilliance verve love and success in the face of so much negativity. You can believe ILL be buying it when it comes out and I hope that Disney continues. This time I think they should make what they want however and not cater to the public since these comments are proof that you just cant please some people. Ill watch Disney no matter WHAT they put on screen. (I even liked The Black Cauldron) Not to say that the above comments arent perfectly valid of course. Just watch it and take off your PC hats for a few minutes. Let your feet tap to the catchy music. Stop CRITICIZING. Just watch. Posted by Kiah | March 16 2010 at 0712 PM I was offended by the portrayal of Cajuns as dirty and stupid. Posted by cajun | January 13 2010 at 0209 PM this was infact an amazing movie.You are wrong on many levals. This movie was for the yong children of america and all of the ratings i have seen are positive.(other that yours) My family loved the movie and so do most of the oth people i have talked to. Posted by tiara | December 29 2009 at 1126 AM Why does no one comment on the stereotypical portrayals of Cajuns as ignorant swamp folk with bad teeth? That aside I thought the movie stunk. Dull listless songs (incredible to believe with all that jazz and zydeco inspiration) boring characters and plodding plot line. Disney needed to be PC with a black princess and this is the result. Posted by Susana | December 25 2009 at 0731 PM Fed Id also like to say that I agree with you as well. My family is predominantly African-American but my children are of Hispanic(Mestizo) and African-American origins. They havent see the movie but we have purchased some of the books for them and we liked the fact that there was a racially ambiguous prince. It worked for ours and many other multiracial families. I have heard some AAs claim that the movie wasnt black enough and some whites claim that it depicted whites in too negative a light. The ""problem"" with having only one Disney movie featuring blacks is that as a result all dreams rest on the shoulders of this one movie. On the other hand young white girls who dont like Snow White can pick from many other princesses and princes. People were expecting Princess Tiana and The Princess and The Frog to make up for decade upon decade of limited to no black characters in Disney films. Impossible. This movie will surely be the first animated film of more to come featuring a black lead. It will take many years to see the diversity of character and quality that were so used to with the other Disney princesses. This is just the beginning. Posted by Marisa | December 25 2009 at 0206 PM Wonderful article Stacey. My husband and I went to see this movie sans kiddos. We loved the movie but absolutely recognized the points you made. I havent invested myself as emotionally; perhaps because I knew ahead of time what to expect. In any case I do believe that Disney has made progress and I also believe that as parents of another time our children may view this video much differently than we do. After all our children live in the age of a black first family. Surely their perspectives and understandings of race will be somewhat different than our own and there is at least the potential that they will view this movie through a much different lens. We can only hope. Posted by Marisa | December 25 2009 at 0154 PM I have to say that after reading many of the posts I am seriously appalled. so one of the biggest values we teach children to be ""what is inside you is what counts"" ""who cares how you look as long as you are truly a good person?"" and by the looks of it there are a bunch of hypocrits out there who repeat those things and then get offended because in a kids movie the princess turns into a frog and ""oh oh shes not black anymore"" and so the bashing begins. I will be honest and say that Disney has done a great job in the last few decades bringing complex characters to embody role models for young girls; we have a red-head who is willing to defy gravity for her dreams; an arabian princess wanting to escape from an arranged marriage; a native american fighting to unite two worlds; and a chinese who saved an empire--- i gotta say these girls are characters to emulate and they are all quite diverse as opposed to the first few years when the princess basically waited for things to happen; or for a prince to rescue her (I.e. snow shite; sleeping beauty; cinderella...) I much rather have a princess of my race be turned into a frog but have the courage and dare that Tiana has throughout the movie (in which SHE saves the prince  for a change) than a princess who waits to be rescued. I loved how hard-working and focus she is and I only wish I can be that focus once I find my dream; I particularly love how she doesnt believe wishing for a star will make all your dreams come true but that you must work for it. I personally was so glad to see that there would be an African American Princess added to the repertoir and even thought ""its about time"" when I heard. perhaps Tiana was not shown as much as we all would like for her to have been shown but I am sure it was not because ""it would have been too black"" -- so pohahontas was what? too brown? or mulan was too asian?-- it was done because that was the plot and i thought that turning the princess into a frog was a brilliant and unexpected twist. (besides; tiana and naveen were not the only black characters in the movie anyway) when it comes to other characters I read some people criticizing that it was too diverse and so there was not enough black pride because the writer could fathom an entire black cast in a disney movie; but crazy enough I heard other people say that if the cast was of all blacks that would mark racial difference even more and create more dislike between races--- so who wins? its a lose lose situation unless people are willing to open their minds and leave prejudices aside I could write a book arguing about this movie and how as opposed to some views who believe the white characters in the movie are ditzy and ridiculous they were kind and friendly and oblibvious to the racial difference--- so they were rich; newsflash there had to be some kind of historical background here and at that point in time whites were at the higher end of the stick ( and to those who argue that there shouldnt have been any historical accuracy at all I say that some of the best disney movies I.e. mulan and pocahontas have a historical context and that in pocahontas native americans were referred to as ""savages"" many a time. not that it matters but I will say I am south american and have a family that ranges from blue eyed beauty to chocolate skin hunk so dont try to tell me im prejudiced because Im far from it. ....just the opinion of a humble college student Fed. Posted by Marifez8 | December 22 2009 at 0632 PM hey i took my lil sis and my church girls to go see it and had a ball. i love the plot message and everything about this film but remember these are kids wathcing a cartoon not watching ""bowling in columbine""...but a CARTOON. this is something in the norm for them so please dont desecrate their enjoyment of the film. i actually loved the frog theme because throughout the movie it teaches your kids to respect appritiate and love people for who they are not the money they have or their physical appearences. mind you ariel was human like 80% of her movie....maybe (if disney is bold enough) to make a sequel. hey if ariel can have a daughter so can tiana. then you can see tiana in human form for th rest of that film because you do have to admit...shes beautiful XD Posted by MaCherris | December 21 2009 at 1213 AM Whoever says they wont see this wonderful movie because Princess Tiana is turned into a frog has NO idea what they are missing out from and this comes from a young African-American woman who grew up during the Disney Renaissance. Disney absolutely DID show Princess Tiana in a positive light. In fact she ranks up there with Pocahontas and Mulan as Disney Princesses who stand out from their counterparts for doing a lot more than just hoping and wishing theyll marry a prince someday. Coming from someone who was initially disappointed that Tiana was turned into a frog I have to say that having prejudice towards seeing this classic Disney Princess film because Tiana was turned into a frog for most of the movie is just as prejudice as Disney showing prejudice toward African-Americans. Throughout the film it is made quite clear that Disney was doing everything they could to NOT be racially insensitive so I dont understand why people are going out of their way to find things which could make this film racist when it clearly is not at all. By doing the aforementioned ignorance will keep you missing out on an excellent film that gets a 9/10 in my book. I find it so sad and disappointing that people are going out of there way to not see this film for such petty and insignifcant reasons. IT TRULY IS A SHAME Posted by Alexandria J | December 19 2009 at 0134 PM I saw the movie with my 3 year old who seemed to enjoy it. Im sure its more a girls movie but animation is animation and boys will enjoy a lot of the action and silliness. Its sad that black people (unless you moved here from there youre not african american youre black american since you feel the need to distinguish your color. Nobody runs around calling themself european american or white american) still need to martyr themselves and at the expense of their kids. I could say the movie portrayed whites as pompous spoiled unfairly wealthy condescending and stupid. I work with blacks mexicans native american indians hispanics filipinos hawaiians and other people of color to the extent the we joke about me being the token white guy hired to fill the quota. I get called whitey on a daily basis and picked on as being a lesser person in their midst. Its all done in good fun and we all consider ourselves color blind when it comes to race. We judge people on their merits not their appearance. And THAT folks is what I took away from this movie. It was about pointing out the value of character and virtue not hiding a black princess in the guise of a frog. And the amusing irony is- had the princess been white would there be a stampede of caucasians blasting disney for doing the same thing? Highly unlikely. Sometimes the biggest threat to progress in diversity seems to be the very people intended to benefit from it. Posted by David B. | December 19 2009 at 0201 AM Just to balance this out a bit Im an African American woman who grew up on Disney films and is still a big fan of animation--and I loved the movie--it was adorable The African American characters as well as all others were beautifully drawn. The Shadow Man villain was excellent Raymond the fire fly the alligator etc. all terrif. I also have strong Louisiana roots so I especially loved the southern and cajun accents and French phrases Especially the use of ""cher"" as a term of endearment--thats what my grandma and mother called me as a little girl. Like I said I thought the whole thing was adorable. In particular I did not object to Tiana being a frog for most of the pic for the very reason that it de-emphasized encouraging little girls to want to be princesses in the first place Thats what I liked so much about Mulan. Little girls want fantasy play and dress up they really dont give a hoot about whether its as a princess queen empress--or just a grown up with cool clothes and magical powers. RELAX--at the end of the day its a cartoon. Just go see it Posted by I liked it | December 17 2009 at 0303 PM I am a free thinking liberal and father of a little girl. In my daily life and in my job I work passionately against racism and bigotry and will always be a proud supporter of diversity. I say all that ...and now say this.Go see the movie for yourself before you listen to some knee jerk reaction from a yahoo. Just go see it. Youll love it. The movie was great There is nothing wrong with this movie...at ALL It was beautifully made well written the music and characters were charming and the message was very powerful for people of all ages. The message is in essence three fold 1. ""We should all focus on chasing our dreams. 2. We should learn to distinguish between what we NEED and what we WANT. And 3. Love is more important than other thing we could wish to attain. THATS IT Thats the whole message. And it was beautifully told. There was no subtle racism or hidden agenda. Anyone who thinks that it was ""bad"" that she was a frog for most of the movie is really quite shallow in my opinion. The story is what it is. Ideas of race and social inequality were treated sensitively and appropriately and YOUR KIDS will love it. I was so proud of my daughter today. She is not quite 3 years old. We have ""attempted"" other movies but we have only ever gotten about 45 minutes into it. Disneys ""Earth"" Ice Age Mr. Fox etc. She has always gotten bored tired hungry or maybe scared by all the noise and intensity of a big movie in a dark room. Today I was very emotional as I left the theater because she was glued to the screen from the first moment to the last and loved it. Outside of the theater there was an african american girl in a princess outfit. My dauhter looked at her with a big smile and said..ooooooo a princess. ) Cased closed) Posted by John | December 13 2009 at 0647 PM The movie was terrible - a BIG BIG disappointment. We were really looking forward to the movie. Disney Oprah and all else associated should be ashamed. Did Disney do any market research? SICKENING. Same reasons as other posts...Tiana was a frog for 90% of the movie. Ugly secondary characters -- the firefly and alligator? yuck. Where a cute little Jiminy Cricket or Tinker Bell? Also the depiction of the white people was offensive to me. Besideswhat child today knows about/relates to the 1920s? It could have been set today with some rap music and spoiled rich black friends. The animation was subpar -- the musical numbers and animation were nothing like Beauty amp; The Beast or The Lion King. Posted by Sheila | December 12 2009 at 1053 PM ""It features the first African-American princess from Disney Enterprises Inc. to whom the buine of marketing female royalty is ignificant."" I am surprised that someone will actually write this unprofessionally. This kind of journalism doesnt even belong in a college newspaper. I expect better from someone working for the Tribune. Posted by John Burns | December 12 2009 at 1201 PM I agree with the review the movie was a little rushed especially in the beginning and the quality of the film doesnt quite stand up to classics such as Beauty and the Beast Jungle Book etc but it does have a charm of its own. I would say that this movie was a promising reentry into 2D for Disney. As far as the movie being rushed you could probably look to budgeting because of it being a 2D movie rather than racial issues. I noticed the actual drawn quality of the film also wasnt as crisp and clean as I hoped the plot would be a definite sign that this film probably just did not have the necessary funds or was not Disneys main focus (again because of it being a 2D film something untrustworthy in todays theaters). I think it is important to note that the ideas for these films rarely (infact I would say never) stem from something politically racially or philosophically charged. It starts with a bunch of people cartoon nerds (myself included) talking about a funny joke and then building a movie around it. While yes it would have given children some emotional and mental growth for Tiana to have been human longer the gag was based on the Frog and the Princess tale. Besides when you view Tiana as a character and I guess more pertinently compare her as a black character to all the white characters she was ideal. She was responsible hard working independent a strong female lead while her best friend was for the most part shallow lazy and spoiled. And also its a childrens movie. How often does Disney make a human character the complete central focus of their movies? Rarely. Because kids like seeing a lion grow up or a young boy dancing with bears and orangutans or a mermaid singing with a lobster and fish. I cant believe that children try to acknowledge the same levels of thought as adults. It is important to look out for your children and push for change in areas that you think are important but it is also good to step away from something you believe to be so loaded as is the case with this movie and just let your children enjoy it without pressuring them into trying to understand that Disney finally has a black princess. Posted by Mr. Kensington | December 12 2009 at 1130 AM The ""old stuff""? Please. That flashback is straight out of Family Guy. Posted by David | December 11 2009 at 1135 PM Stacey Lewis I appreciate your post. As a fellow black woman I find it very informative. Some people (e.g. JK) are unable to relate to your sentiment through no fault of their own. I too was thrilled when I found out Disney had finally produced a movie with a black princess. One would have to understand the long treacherous relationship between Disney and black Americans in order to fully appreciate this right? Thus I am so disappointed to read reviews that suggest that Disney did a mediocre job with this film when the studio has a reputation for producing much better work. I too cant help but wonder if they hastened to check ""black princess"" off of their list of things to do to calm the masses... And believe me I like you dont usually have race at the forefront of my mind when it comes to navigating conflicts. I suppose Ill wait for the film to come out on video and check it out for myself. Hopefully Disney will do a better job with this in the future. Finally dont feel bad (and I know you dont) about removing your girls from the post-film festivities right away. If I had daughter(s) I would do the same. Black girls like their counterparts deserve to see themselves portrayed in a positive light in the media. They are not something that should be hidden (read turned into frogs for 90% of the film.) I know my mother would have (and did) done the same for me in this situation. Posted by AH | December 11 2009 at 1021 PM I absolutely agree with Stacey I have not seen the movie but my mother did today and was heated/let down by what she saw. When she told me that ""Princess Tiana"" was turned into a frog and remained a frog for most of the movie I was upset. I dont even think Im going to see the movie now. As a Black American just when you think progress is being made we get slapped in the face. None of the other Disney princess were turned into animals and stayed animals through most of their movies. I understand that Disney tried but thats just it THEY TRIED and SCREWED it up. Posted by Christina | December 11 2009 at 0951 PM I guess comments only stay on here if they are bashing the movie and talking about the plight of the black in America. Typical... Posted by FU | December 11 2009 at 0411 PM Stacey thank you for your informative post. I will NOT be seeing this film. Im tired of Hollywoods lack of diversity and mistreatment of people of color. They had an opportunity to make a beautiful film that would have made a huge impact towards showing an animated African-American female in a positive light but they messed it up. Great job Disney Your racist history lives on Posted by GrChi | December 11 2009 at 0318 PM Interesting take on the film. I loved it and I hope that people will go and judge it for themselves. My take http//mominthecity.com/wp/2009/11/24/the-princess-and-the-frog-a-new-twist-on-an-old-story/ Posted by Kimberly/Mom in the City | December 11 2009 at 1143 AM I havent seen the movie and Im not sure that I will. Based on the preview I felt as Stacey felt that Disney turned her into a frog to appeal to the masses and to prevent the movie from being ""too black."" I was also offended by some of the cast whose descriptions I read online. They feed into racial stereotypes. There were a lot of white cast members and I never recall any other disney movies being so racially diverse. I also thumbed through one of the books at the bookstore and thought some of the characters looked like they had been plucked from some old stories about slavery. They make stories about white characters without reference to their history as slave owners mass murderers or land grabbers so they should be able to make a story about black characters that just tell a nice happy story. Disney needs to end their history of not hiring blacks especially when theyre doing stories about blacks. Posted by Chi-Girl | December 11 2009 at 1132 AM Its a very beautiful story and a beautifully animated movie. Watch the trailer on http//trailers-watch.com/ . Also available in HD. Posted by Loron | December 11 2009 at 1113 AM Way to go Stacey Lewis. Im glad you remembered to even take your children with you to the premiere because it really sounds like it was more about fulfilling your childhood dreams of having a Disney princess that ""looks like you."" The really pathetic thing is how you and your friend were just SO APPALLED that you had to rush out of the theater after the movie in the midst of your children having a fantastic time with the movie and taking pictures with the princesses. Grow up. I hope one day that people like you can stop making decisions based on the color of skin rather than on the merits of the person in question. Posted by JK | December 11 2009 at 1040 AM I have been anticipating the release of The Princess and the Frog for the last year When I first heard that Disney was finally debuting an African American princess I could hardly maintain my composure. Like most Americans I have been enamored with Disney since my first visit to the Magic Kingdom in 1969 as a bright eyed and curious three year old. Through the years Disney has been a staple in my life. My son celebrated his 5th birthday at the Magic Kingdom. We own every Disney movie known to man. So the introduction of a princess that not just resembled but actually looked like that bright eyed three old now turn 43 year old mother of two amazing daughters would be the icing on the cake. To show how excited I was about this film I purchased tickets to attend the exclusive premiere engagement of the film at the Walt Disney Studio in Burbank. Not one to do things in a small fashion I purchased the Royal Package which included reserved seating commemorative beads and a limited edition lithograph picture. My daughters and I could hardly maintain ourselves as our premiere day rapidly approached. With all the TV commercials advertisements and banners announcing The Princess and the Frog we knew we were in for an event of a lifetime. Finally it arrived We had reservations for five (my two daughters their friend her mother and myself) for the 700 p.m. show of The Princess and the Frog We showed up an hour early just to make sure we didnt miss anything We parked and in the impeccable fashion of Disney followed the ""frog feet"" that lead to the entrance. We showed our tickets pontificated about the fact that the popcorn was not included in the 50 Royal Package and followed ""our yellow brick road"" to the grand theater. Due to the fact that the movie has not been released nationally we had to turn in our cellphones and go through a metal detector. A mere inconvenience for what was about to take place. We found our ""royal"" seats in the back of the theater and settled in for one of the ""best films we had ever seen"". I was shocked to see that the majority of the patrons in the theater did not look anything like me. However lets face it....everyone loves Disney As the live entertainment played his last note and the lights dimmed my heart started racing as I look over to the three young girls sitting next to me with smiles that appeared to be as wide as the building. The music came on and my long awaited film began. I sat there a watched every single moment. I was in awe Then my princess a.k.a Tiana turned into a frog Now I was okay with that because I knew that was part of the story. Here where things went south for me........................ I didnt realize that my princess was going to remain a frog for the greater part of the movie. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for her to again look like me and my daughters. As a matter of fact at one point I thought Disney was going to send me into cardiac arrest and have her remain a frog. The next time I saw my princess face was when she kissed frog Naveen and the two of them became human again. She stayed on the screen for another 5-7 minutes and wala it was over and she was gone There was brief silence a small around of applause and everyone started exiting the theater. I sat in my chair horrified and extremely disappointed I could hardly speak. I looked over at my friend. The look on her face spoke the sentiments of my heart Our three young girls were happy yet surprisingly reserved. Walking out the theater I said to my friend ""So what did you think?"" She replied ""Not right now. I need to gather my thoughts and regroup."" The two of us walked silently to the ""interactive"" show where all of the Disney Princesses were waiting to greet the guest. Our daughters ran around the room taking photos with all of the princesses. I decided to go and retrieve my ""limited edition lithograph"". What awaited me was indescribable. I opened up the envelope and inside is a picture of my princess and Naveen as FROGS Not as the beautiful princess she turned into. Not the handsome prince Naveen from Macedonia - but FROGS I was done My friend was so done that she asked if we could leave and she left her lithograph at the lot. Speechless and stunned the two of us just walked to our car in pure amazement. How could something so special be reduced to something so........demeaning? Of all the wonderful ads Disney has used to promote this movie the only picture they could find for a ""limited lithograph"" was Tiana and Naveen as frogs Wow Now I am definitely not one to immediately jump onto the ""race"" bandwagon. I am astute enough to know that everything is not racial however I realize that some things are racial. I began to think of all the Disney princess movies (Snow White Ariel Mulan Belle) and I cannot recall any of them not showing the face of the primary character throughout the film. So that begs the question ""why did Disney decide to go a different route with Princess Tiana?"" ""Why does she have to be a frog for the majority of the movie?"" What is the subconscious message? I know I know - folks are going to say that I should be glad that Disney finally created an African American princess. For the record I do applaud Disney for their effort however that does not change the end result for me. I also realize that Disney has to appeal to the ""masses"" so this may have been their way of doing just that - having an African American princess and mass appeal After all would the masses sit in a movie theater and watch an animated African American girl for over an hour with or without Disneys ""rubber stamp?"" Well that remains to be seen. Okay realizing that I might have been reading a little too much into this whole frog thing I did my own mini survey. A number of my friends attended the exclusive engagement. Not baiting them or even letting them know my disappointment I personally asked all of the same question ""So how did you like the movie."" Every single one of them made the same or similar statement "" I was really disappointed about her being a frog for so long in the movie. That really bothered me."" When I asked about the lithograph the majority of them said they threw it in the trash because they were appalled . Ah ha so it wasnt just me. My feelings were real Hundred of people are going to flock the theater this weekend to see the debut of Princess Tiana. Ill let you be the judge. Whats great about America is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and we can always agree to disagree. To that end again I have to say I appreciate Disney for their effort. Nonetheless I would be remissed if I didnt express my sadness at the finish product. Many folks would argue that we are currently living in a post racial nation; yet I would contend that true progress continues to be slow. It continues to be slow.

Today though The Princess and the Frog carries much more weighty expectations as the first pen-and-ink Disney cartoon in five years. The previous two films Treasure Planet and Home on the Range cost so much to make and grossed so little that the studio went into computer animation full time. And those expectations are much too great for this amiable but slight reworking of the familiar fable. Directed by The Little Mermaids John Musker and Ron Clements and peppered with not-quite-memorable songs by Randy Newman the picture already feels somewhat dated -- a throwback to a formula that went out of style after Pixar rewrote the animation rule book. Most notable about The Princess and the Frog is that it features the first African-American heroine in Disney history Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) a hard worker who longs to fulfill her late fathers dreams of someday owning a five-star restaurant in jazz-era New Orleans. The movies main twist on its classic source material is that when Tiana kisses a prince (Bruno Campos) who has been turned into a frog by a voodoo shaman (Keith David) she too becomes a green-skinned fly-eater and the pair hops into the swamp in search of a priestess to lift their mutual curse. Many spirited critters (including a trumpet-playing crocodile) musical numbers and manic adventures await but theres a prevailing familiarity to this material that even the inspired Big Easy setting cannot completely overcome. You know your cartoon is in trouble when your characters are much more engaging in human form than they are as animals. (Tianas endearingly spoiled and bratty childhood friend a real princess voiced by Jennifer Cody practically steals the movie.) And if you partake of the belief that Disney films are only as great as their villains then The Princess and the Frogs witch doctor whose main objective is of the vague and dull ""rule the world variety is a big disappointment. The animation in The Princess and the Frog is beautifully rendered and the movie doesnt lack for energy. But this is minor Disney at best forgettable at worst Even the underrated Treasure Planet box-office flop notwithstanding had a compelling and inspired conceit at its center -- something The Princess and the Frog sorely lacks.

Posted by chris brown | December 10 2009 at 0813 PM Its a very beautiful story and a beautifully animated movie. Watch the trailer on http//trailers-watch.com/ Posted by Jackson | December 11 2009 at 1207 PM BEWAREUNSUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN The writers create a character the firefly that delights and charms youngsters. He is heroic loving and loyal. He is funny too. Then after manipulating young children into caring about the firefly THEY MURDER HIM Dr. Facilier steps on him ON CAMERA You can hear the ""crunch"" This scene is followed by a prolonged death scene where the fireflys light slowly goes out. Children in the theater were wailing. Manny were carried out by their parents. THIS FILM IS RATED G This behavior by Disney going for cheap emotion (the murder is not motivated by plot necessity it is simply gratuitous) is UNETHICAL. Disney should be ashamed of itself. DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN TO SEE THIS FILM Posted by 24FPS | December 13 2009 at 0924 AM I firmly and fully agree with a previous poster that this film is unsuitable for small children. My little girl (almost 4 years old) wept for an hour after we left the theatre. She was terribly frightened by the horrible demonic images of Faciliers ""friends from the other side"" who finally dragged him screaming and begging to a hellish grave. The dark violence the gruesome death of the firefly and the overt presence of shed blood in the practice of voodoo was simply too much for children. Dont they screen test this stuff with little kids? I am a season ticketholder to Disneyland but I couldnt believe how the long-awaited African-American Princess was so reduced. Of all the plotlines to choose for this noble and colorful culture Disney chose Caribbean voodoo magic as the one to showcase. Tiana spent most of the movie as a frog and in the end married a prince that (unlike every other Disney princess ever) who was clearly of another (i.e. lighter) ethnic makeup. Whats wrong with a plot where a black girl makes it as a black girl (not a frog) and marries a handsome black guy? Im white but I can see that ethnic Africans are among the worlds most striking people. Why cant Disney? Posted by David Thomas | December 22 2009 at 0937 PM I thank the viewers above for warning parents about the murder of the firefly. My son is a teen now but when he was about four we saw the first Shrek in a theatre. It is difficult to calculate how powerfully the images on a screen affect a child. I was a single mom by then and had moved across country from an abusive dangerous man. When Princess Fiona sang the spoof of earlier Disney films with the bird echoing her the motive was to kill a mother so she could no longer protect her eggs - for Fionas breakfast. I leave it to you to figure out how that scene affected my son a loving trusting mother singing along with a supposed friend -until she dies- and leaves her chicks to the mercy... Posted by reginamia | December 24 2009 at 0929 AM The Princess and the frog movie should not have had a G rating. I would not want my young children watching such scary things. Voodoo. Evil Spirits just horrible content for even grown Christians to see. It was offensive. To make the Princess African American was not a good way to portray this race or to entice children of any ethnic group to watch. Commercials of only a good part to make children want to see this movie was wrong. Posted by Nancy Keller | March 30 2011 at 1039 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

The last time we heard from the hand-drawn animators at Disney they offered up the barnyard tale ""Home on the Range."" The 2004 toon was so forgettable it seemed as though it really might be the last time we ever heard from the hand-drawn animators at the studio where the art form was pioneered. Thankfully the spirit of animation maestro Walt Disney lives on. The studio has gone back to its roots with a fresh funny retelling of a classic fairy tale in ""The Princess and the Frog"" Disneys return to hand-drawn animation after a five-year hiatus. Like everyone else Disney and subsidiary Pixar Animation mostly are fixated on computer animation. But Pixar masterminds John Lasseter and Ed Catmull who now supervise all Disney animation love cartoons of every kind and have renewed the studios commitment to the pen-and-ink variety along with the pixelated. ""Princess and the Frog"" isnt the second coming of ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King."" Its just plain pleasant an old-fashioned little charmer thats not straining to be the next glib animated compendium of pop-culture flotsam. Updating the Brothers Grimm tale ""The Frog Prince"" into a toe-tapping musical set on the Louisiana bayou in the 1920s directors Ron Clements and John Musker deliver a satisfying gumbo of snappy dialogue lovable characters and bright-hued images spiced up with just the right touch of voodoo peril. Starting off in New Orleans the film centers on hardworking waitress Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) who saves every dime in hopes of opening the restaurant that was the dream of her late father (Terrence Howard). In a small role Oprah Winfrey provides the voice of Tianas mom. Tiana is sidetracked by some dark magic after Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) a jazz-loving dreamboat from a land far far away comes to sample the vibrant New Orleans music. Naveen falls under the spell of voodoo practitioner Dr. Facilier (voiced with oozing menace by Keith David) who turns the prince into a talking frog as part of a plan to unleash his evil ""friends on the other side"" in New Orleans. The frog prince encounters Tiana dressed as royalty at a costume ball in the mansion of her childhood pal Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) and her genteel dad (John Goodman). The inevitable kiss Naveen talks Tiana into doesnt restore his human form though. Rather Tiana is transformed into a frog herself and the two wind up pursued by Faciliers evil allies through swamp country. In fine Disney inter-species tradition Tiana and Naveen find comic sidekicks in Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) a goofy alligator who dreams of playing trumpet with a jazz band and Ray (Jim Cummings) a gap-toothed Cajun firefly with a heart as big as the heavens. The songs and score by Disney stalwart Randy Newman including a tune sung by Dr. John are brisk and catchy while theres plenty of action and slapstick humor for boys and dads in what is largely a love story for girls and moms. Sure the romance is a little sticky and cloying. But even the hardest of hard cases might sniffle a bit over how the unobtainable love of firefly Ray plays out. Clements and Musker whose credits include such hits as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" but also the mega-bomb ""Treasure Planet"" present rich worlds both in the city and on the bayou. Some of the animated sequences are downright trippy -- Disney influenced by the wild imagination of such masters as Hayao Miyazaki whose U.S. releases the studio handles. Like the jerky stop-motion animation of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" the silky canvas of ""Princess and the Frog"" stands as a nice counterpoint to the sharp virtual worlds of computer imagery that dominate todays cartoons. The hand-drawn style is where Disney feature animation started seven decades ago with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but eventually in Hollywood at least everything old is new again. ""Princess and the Frog"" mostly ignores the racial divides of the times. Tianas a poor black girl her best friends a rich spoiled white girl. How often did that happen in 1920s New Orleans? But this isnt ""Roots"" its a Disney family affair. In her favor Tiana joins a list of ethnically diverse Disney heroines -- Pocahantas Mulan Lilo -- that show how far things have come from the days when a pasty-faced princess hung out with seven little white dudes. 2 images Close Sign in Close Sign in Sign in with a linked account facebook yahoo Or use your East Valley Tribune account Username or Email Password Remember me Forgot Submit Need an account?

Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW BOTTOM LINE A dependably charming and enjoyable Disney effort that also introduces the studios first African-American princess. CAST Voices of Anika Noni Rose Bruce Campos Keith David LENGTH 135 As you might guess by the title ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a fairly familiar story. And because this animated musical comes from Walt Disney Pictures you can expect talking-animal sidekicks a perilous journey a budding romance and a moral to the tale. Whats new if you havent heard is the debut of Disneys first African-American princess Tiana. She adds another dash of color to a nine-member lineup of ink-and-paint Caucasians such as Snow White and Cinderella but also the Arabian Jasmine (""Aladdin"") the Chinese Mulan and American Indian Pocahontas. advertisement | advertise on newsday By setting ""Princess"" in the New Orleans of the early 1900s - a briefly seen newspaper headline reads ""Wilson Elected"" - Disney gets to focus on Cajun food Southern accents and Dixieland jazz rather than on skin color. In fact although Tiana (pleasantly voiced by the Broadway singer Anika Noni Rose) begins the film as a hardworking waitress she spends most of her screen time as a frog. Thats the result of her chance meeting with Prince Naveen (Bruce Campos) a freewheeling playboy hoodwinked by the local voodoo man Dr. Facilier (Keith David delightfully wicked). The newly green Naveen manages to charm Tiana into a kiss but after that backfires the two amphibians travel the bayou to find their voodoo fairy godmother Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis). Along the way theyll befriend a trumpet-playing gator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a gap-toothed Cajun firefly named Raymond (Jim Cummings). With songs by Randy Newman (himself raised in New Orleans) and some visually fizzy animation styles ""The Princess and the Frog"" sticks to a dependably pleasing Disney template. As for issues of race - you were expecting maybe ""Precious""?PLOT In jazz-era New Orleans a young girl kisses a frog prince with unexpected results.

The Princess and the Frog Great Directors Ron Clements and John Musker. Cast Voices of Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos and Keith David. Rating G. RELATED Cartoon continues Disney trend toward diversity Frog animators on voodoo villains Valentines Up Princess Fox vie for Annie top prize Disney/Pixar movies ""The Princess and the Frog"" It looked as if the digital revolution had put an end to the age of hand-drawn masterpieces such as ""Cinderella"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" Until now. ""The Princess and the Frog"" isnt just Disneys best traditionally animated feature since ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" in the early 90s. It recaptures the fairy-tale magic of a more innocent era but also updates it for a world-wise 21st-century audience. The smart storytelling combines with spectacular visual set pieces and a spicy musical gumbo to deliver one of the finest films of the year in any genre. The top headline leading up to this weekends release was that this is the first Disney movie to star an African-American princess. As cultural milestones go its not clear where that ranks with say the election of Americas first Black president. But its definitely big and its not just a token nod to diversity. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is set in jazz-age New Orleans where 19-year-old Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose of ""Dreamgirls"" fame) works double shifts as a waitress. Shes saving up nickels and dimes to realize her dream of opening up a restaurant of her own but her life plan is sent on a detour when a dashing Old World prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) comes to town and runs afoul a voodoo-practicing ""Shadow Man"" who transforms him into a frog. The adventure that follows is very much old-school Disney. The frog prince persuades Tiana to give him a kiss in hopes of being restored to his true self. Instead she turns into a frog too. The unhappy couple ends up on the run in the bayou where they meet an assortment of colorful characters including a trumpet-tooting alligator a decrepit Cajun firefly and a 197-year-old voodoo priestess named Mama Odie. It will come as no surprise that Tiana and Naveen first squabble then fall in love on their way to a ""Cinderella""-style happily ever after. But the writers throw in a few twists to the fairy-tale formula. Because the story is set in real historical America the divide between rich and poor isnt just the old medieval hierarchy of princes and peasants. There is no overt reference to racism - its still Disney not ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" - but in the opening scene when a child Tiana returns from the opulent home of her mothers client Big Daddy La Bouff to her own familys ramshackle abode the social context couldnt be clearer. As a result Tiana is no wide-eyed dreamer waiting for her Prince Charming to sweep her off her feet. She leaves those fantasies to her friend Charlotte Big Daddys spoiled belle of a daughter. In one of the movies wonderful musical interludes Tiana sings to Naveen ""Ive worked for everything Ive got and thats the way its supposed to be."" Its a clear critique of the fairy-tale logic that has defined the Disney brand and not a hip ironic one a la ""Shrek"" or ""Enchanted"" but a gently straightforward one that adds depth to the film. In ""Princess and the Frog"" the lesson Tiana must learn is that while dreams can be wonderful they are not as important as our day-to-day connection with other human beings. Of course this being Disney Tiana gets to give up her dream and have it too. And that is no complaint. Nuance and meaning are fine but a kids movie still has to entertain - and this one certainly does. The animation is gorgeous especially in big production numbers such as the kaleidoscopic visuals of ""Dig a Little Deeper"" Mama Odies inspirational sermon to Tiana and Naveen. And the songs are great which isnt much of a surprise The score was composed by Pixars Oscar-winning tunesmith Randy Newman who grew up in New Orleans and draws on Dixieland jazz zydeco and gospel music to give the soundtrack its own particular flavor. There are plenty of clever one-liners including a knee-slapping reference to ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" involving a drooling hound dog named Stella. And the minor characters are a lot of fun from fat and happy Big Daddy (John Goodman) to the Cajun firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) who harbors an unrequited love for a distant beauty named Evangeline (whos actually a star in the sky). From a cultural perspective there are some critiques to make starting with the nefarious Shadow Man a k a Doctor Facilier who perpetuates hoary stereotypes about voodoo that arent necessarily corrected by the presence of the nurturing Mama Odie. And its certainly interesting that Disney chose to make Prince Naveen brown-skinned and vaguely Arabic thus splitting the difference between the potentially audience-dividing options of a Black-White vs. an all-Black romance. But such concerns take nothing away from the film aesthetically. As an example of moviemaking art ""The Princess and the Frog"" is just about perfect.

Hardly less antique was the Disney companys notion to turn the gag into a cartoon in the old hand-drawn ""2-D"" style. Disney introduced this feature-length format with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and over the next 60 years just about perfected the mixture of story illustration and pop music. Today virtually nobody does animated features as original musicals. As for the technology CGI -- the computer-driven animation used in Pixars and DreamWorks hit movies -- is the princess and 2-D the frog. But frogs have more fun. The Princess and the Frog which opens Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and Dec. 11 in the rest of the country is a start-to-finish delight. It proves that 2-D can be more than 3-D when gifted filmmakers put old-fashioned snap back into animation. The lines are freer here the character movements more supple the sense of fun unfettered. The movie is a triumph for its directors and co-writers John Musker and Ron Clements -- the guys who jump-started Disneys cartoon renaissance with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and created a whole new world with the 1992 Aladdin then coasted (Hercules 1997) flopped (Treasure Planet 2002) and vanished. Entrusting an expensive freighted project like this to a couple of 56-year-olds might seem like letting an Old Timers Day pitcher start a World Series game but Musker and Clements show no sweat. Their piece has the lightness of an inspired improv session by New Orleans jazz masters. (See pictures of Disneys teen stars.) Louisiana in the 1910s and 20s is the locale for Pamp;F which set itself the further challenge of being the first Disney cartoon feature with an African-American princess. The heroine Tiana (voiced and sung by Tony-winner Anika Noni Rose) is a seamstresss daughter and would-be chef and her frog-consort the dusky-hued Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Nip/Tucks Bruno Campos). Musker and Clements might have worried about being considered racially insensitive -- or racially hypersensitive which would put a clamp on both the comedy and the characters. Instead they used the period setting as the springboard for an easy mixture of fantasy and reality and for a full musical score nine songs by Randy Newman. They also were savvy enough to cast Oprah Winfrey foolproof Racial Insensitivity insurance as the heroines mom Eudora. The strategy has already paid off Tiana merchandise is a boom pre-Christmas industry. Every Disney princess has to find two things independence and love. Tiana a culinary prodigy dreams of turning an abandoned building into her own restaurant. Tiana entertains the attentions of the dashing playboy Naveen but hes fallen under the spell of the black-magical Dr. Facilier (Keith David). The fateful kiss sends Tiana and Naveen now frogs into the bayou for refuge and retransformation. Among the Jungle Book-type denizens they meet there are Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) a friendly trumpet-playing alligator; Ray (Jim Cummings) a Cajun firefly; and the 197-year-old blind seer Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) among whose gifts may be the power to restore Tiana and Naveen to humanity. (See TIMEs photo-essay ""Animated Movies Not Just for Kids."") And were just short-listing the creatures that Musker and Clements toss into this savory gumbo. Its as if in the dozen years since Hercules their last comedy feature the pair had stockpiled so many funny characters that a few drop in get their laughs and are whisked off stage. Youll be tickled by Charlotte (Breanna Brooks as a child Jennifer Cody as an adult) the adorably addled rich girl whom Eudora babysits and by her father Big Daddy La Bouff (John Goodman in full bluster mode) who certifies his connection to Tennessee Williams riper alpha-males with a booming ""Hey Stella"" In any animated comedy the funny supporting figures threaten to overwhelm the leads; but Tiana has the class and grit and Naveen the immature charm to carry the story. Their cozying up while mincing mushroom for a bayou stew is one of the films emotional highlights. (See the latest news about movies at Techland.com.) Aside from reviving the moribund animation form the early features of Musker and Clements and Disneys other renaissance directors restored the importance of movies as a prime source for generation-spanning pop tunes Oscar-winning hits like ""Under the Sea"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" ""A Whole New World"" ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Colors of the Wind."" Newman the singer-songwriter who lived in New Orleans as a child and used the city as the setting for several songs on his finest album the 1988 Land of Dreams has the musical milieu in his muscle memory and flexes it knowingly here. The motifs span Dixieland zydeco blues and spirituals and give the animators solid foundations for their creativity. Tianas restaurant dream song ""Almost There"" might be a standard I-want ballad for a Disney heroine. Here it cues a fantasy production number which Disney vet Eric Goldberg (he did Robin Williams Genie in Aladdin) has gorgeously rendered in the silhouette fashion of Lotte Reiniger whose The Adventures of Prince Achmed was the first animated feature. In ""Friends on the Other Side"" Dr. Facilier morphs into a Cab Calloway Mephistopheles for a strutting skeleton dance. The movie lovingly ransacks the signatures of nearly a century of cartoon stylists from the body-stretching acrobatics of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett to the suave character intonations of Snow Whites famed animators the Nine Old Men. Musker and Clements the New Old Men have bucked the odds and made a cartoon feature that is true to vintage Disney traditions (like wishing upon a star) yet moves with a contemporary verve and bounce. In an amazing year for animation The Princess and the Frog is up at the top. Go on give it a big kiss. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week. See the best Disney animated movies.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Disney princess phenomenon has become a marketing gold mine spawning special branding a dedicated website a Broadway show and endless frilly products for little girls. So its hard not to see The Princess And The Frog as a calculated cash-in an attempt to add another highly salable princess (and the first African-American one) to the stable especially since so much else about the film is a calculated recycling of Disney successes of the past from the character design to the predictable story beats. But for those who grew up on Disneys animated films--or for those too young (and maybe too princess-crazed) to see the gleaming dollar signs in every frame--Disneys triumphant return to hand-drawn 2-D animation still holds an awful lot of familiar comfort-food charm. Theres nothing remotely challenging about the story the usual bantery modern-Disney routine about a couple who initially hate each other but come to love each other through half an hour of hardships and big musical setpieces. Theres nothing new about the characters except for their skin color Hard-working New Orleans waitress Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is yet another Belle/Jasmine/Pocahontas knockoff a tough smart capable girl who fights for her dreams but nonetheless ends up in a giant poofy gown just long enough to establish the iconography that will be used to sell her princess image for the next several decades. Her inevitable suitor vain Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) is another in a line of puffed-up handsome romantic leads whom the heroine has no use for--until she suddenly does. The villain of the piece a hoodoo man (Keith David) who changes Naveen into a frog for his own nefarious reasons is Jafar from Aladdin with darker skin and different accoutrements. But Ron Clements and John Musker--directing partners on Aladdin Hercules and Treasure Planet--put them through their preordained paces with a lot of energy and color. They get one boost from Randy Newmans down-home radio-ready versions of New Orleans jazz zydeco and gospel; they get another from an animation department presumably eager to prove itself after being disbanded in favor of CGI projects then re-formed under Pixar honcho John Lasseter. The hideous Cajun firefly character maybe borrows a little too much grotesquery from John Kricfalusis style and the bones of the plot are a little too close to Shrek albeit with a clever twist ending. But for the most part The Princess And The Frog is Disney business as usual a little bland but very pretty and calculated for maximum slick pleasantry. Its exactly as though the 2-D department never left at all.

The first is familiar a beautiful rich blonde who would do anything to nab a prince. With her classic pink ball gown and dreamy blue eyes Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) is the type of heroine Disney would slap on everything from sleeping bags to pencils. But when you look closer those blue eyes rimmed with teary mascara seem kind of mad nearly as crazy as her delusion that her prince will come. ""You cant just wish on a star"" advises her serving girl Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) and with that Disney makes amends for three generations of mealy indoctrination. (And theyre fully aware of it--one of the guests at the divas soiree is dressed like Ariel.) Charlotte gets her prince. The catch is hes secretly the princes resentful butler (Peter Bartlett) whos stolen his masters good looks with the help of a dastardly voodoo doctor (Keith David) after a number that burns down the hut. (Their attraction and engagement is a mercenary riot.) The real Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos hilarious) is a real charmer--too much so as hes just been cut off my his parents for squandering his life on girls and jazz. Now that hes been turned into a frog hes no less slimy. Tiana is immune to his sweet talk but not to his promises of helping her afford the rent on the restaurant of her dreams a real swinging New Orleans joint that were sadly aware has a shelf life only as long as her life span. (Shes hardworking by choice--no evil stepmother needed.) Ron Clements and John Muskers film has been plagued by the blogosphere doubtful that Disney was truly committed to what they feared was a half-assed PC fairy tale. To mollify cynics and grumblers Clements and Rob Edwards tweaked the script endlessly changing their heroines name from Kizzy to Tiana her profession from chambermaid to cook the cartoons name from The Frog Princess to The Princess and the Frog. But theyve got the best revenge theyve made a great film one so funny smart imaginative scary sad and soaring I was with it every step of its dance. Crafted in the 2D hand-drawn style of classic Disney the film explodes with visual whimsy when Tiana and Naveen are pitched into the bayou. Theres a choir of cranes a larvae played like an accordion and a toothless firefly (Jim Cummings) who yep made me cry. Just as importantly Tiana is a princess-to-be I would wear on a backpack and Im glad to see the blondes shove off and make room for her fabulous smile. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

In case youve been hiding under a lily pad the films heroine is famously the studios very first African-American princess. This handsome production is also Disneys first hand-drawn (with a few digital tweaks) feature cartoon since the dreadful ""Home on the Range"" five years ago. The racial angle and the technology are less important in this case than the fact that Walt Disney Animation is back doing what it does best -- musical romantic adventure with magic -- after 10 years of unfortunate forays into barnyard humor and science fiction (see the same directors ""Treasure Planet"" or better yet dont.) This clever politically correct update of the Grimms ""The Frog Prince"" is set in a gorgeously rendered 1920s New Orleans where spunky orphaned Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose of ""Dreamgirls"") dreams of opening her own restaurant. Her very blond friend Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) -- daughter of the wealthy Mardi Gras king Big Daddy (John Goodman) -- less ambitiously dreams of marrying the racially ambiguous Prince Naveen (Latino actor Bruno Campos) playboy heir to the throne of a mythical country. Naveen as you might imagine is more interested in Tiana who is so focused on her goals that she couldnt be less interested in the handsome womanizer. But they are thrown together through the magical machinations of the shadowy Dr. Facilier (the great character actor Keith David perfectly cast). As part of a plot to gather up all of the Crescent Citys souls the good doctor turns Naveen into a frog. And when Naveen persuades a very reluctant Tiana to kiss him in an attempt at a cure she turns into a frog too. That launches the two of them on a quest through artfully rendered bayous where they encounter some wonderfully colorful characters including a jazz-loving alligator named Louis (Michael Leon-Wooley) and a love-struck Cajun firefly (Disney standby Jim Cummings). These new slapstick-prone friends lead the way to Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) a 107-year-old voodoo queen who serves as this storys Wizard of Oz for Naveen and Tiana who have become more than friendly by this point. The songs by Randy Newman -- working in the jazz blues gospel zydeco Dixieland and Broadway idioms -- are very catchy belted out in style by a great voice cast. I especially liked Dr. Faciliers big spooky number ""Friends on the Other Side"" and Mama Odies showstopper ""Dig a Little Deeper."" Overall the film is not quite up to ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" from the same directing team of Ron Clements and John Musker not to mention the recent string of masterpieces from Pixar. Though Pixars John Lasseter oversaw ""The Princess and the Frog"" the story development isnt as sophisticated. A body-swapping subplot is needlessly confusing the emergence of the central romance could have been handled with more finesse and there are some awkward references to other Disney classics. Still theres more than enough magic in ""The Princess and the Frog"" to enchant an entirely new generation of Disney fans and their parents. Tiana is a worthy addition to the Princess Hall of Fame. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Days of their Wives Read Next Days of their Wives Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 45485 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 25403 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 15231 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Six decades after unleashing persistent NAACP bugaboo Song of the South (1946) and two after firmly suppressing it that peculiar cultural institution known as the Walt Disney Company has made a symbolic reparation by creating its first African-American princess--and plunking her down in the middle of Jim Crow-era Louisiana A patronizing fantasia of plantation life in post-Civil War Georgia Song could at least be understood--if hardly excused--as a product of its time (18 years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act). But is Disneys latest The Princess and the Frog the Obama-era fairy tale that anyone other than the ""birther"" crowd has been waiting for?Just when exactly Princess is supposed to be taking place is never made explicit save for a brief prologue set in the fall of 1912 (identified by a fleetingly glimpsed newspaper headline announcing the election of segregationist President Woodrow Wilson). Its there that we first meet Tiana the daughter of a New Orleans seamstress (voiced by Oprah Winfrey) and laborer father (Terrence Howard) as she plays at the very big house of her very white very blonde and very rich BFF Charlotte. The movie then flashes forward to the Jazz Age 20s--but is it before or after the Mississippi River flood of 1927 that burst Louisianas infamous levees and stranded hundreds of thousands of blacks in refugee camps? Now an enterprising young woman Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) works double shifts as a waitress trying to scrape together enough cash to make good on her late fathers dream of opening a swanky restaurant. Whatever the year we are firmly in the grips of ""separate but equal""--a reality the movie barely acknowledges.Like many a storybook maiden before her Tiana wishes upon a star for a handsome prince to ferry her off to some magic kingdom--or at least help her make a down payment. He then seems to appear in the form of the visiting Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos) a mocha-skinned dreamboat of indeterminate ethnicity (convenient given the anti-miscegenation laws on the books at the time) who alas has his sights set on Charlotte. Before he can say ""I do"" however Naveen finds himself transformed into the titular amphibian by a back-alley voodoo priest (Keith David). And when he subsequently persuades Tiana to kiss him as a way of reversing the spell instead she turns all ribbity too.They say it aint easy bein green but its certainly a hell of a lot easier than being black. So writer-directors Ron Clements and John Musker (whose 1992 Aladdin proffered a sinister ear-cutting Middle East) send newly anthropomorphic Tiana and Naveen hopping off into the bayou rather than continuing to dodge ol Jim Crow on the streets of the Big Easy. There Princesss rampant a-historicism gives way to a veritable Mardi Gras parade of risible stereotypes an Acadian firefly with the most exaggerated Cajun dialect this side of celebrity chef Justin Wilson I gua-ran-tee; a 197-year-old voodoo priestess named Mama Odie; and lest no Deep South caricature remain unturned a trio of toothless hillbillies.Much ballyhooed as Disneys return to its tradition of 2-D ""cel"" animation after a five-year hiatus The Princess and the Frog is pleasantly if unmemorably drawn. But the movie as a whole never approaches the wit cleverness and storytelling brio of the studios early-1990s animation renaissance (Beauty and the Beast The Lion King) or pretty much anything by Pixar which makes it all too easy to follow Mama Odies own advice and ""dig a little deeper.""This hasnt been a banner season for black characters in American movies from the women lusting after ideals of white beauty in Chris Rocks documentary Good Hair (FYI Tiana also sports a chemically ""relaxed"" do) to the high school football phenom showered with Sandra Bullocks charity in The Blind Side. Indeed it says something when excepting Nelson Mandela in Clint Eastwoods forthcoming Invictus the closest thing to an assertive self-confident role model onscreen right now is the obese illiterate abused and HIV-positive ""Precious"" Jones who eventually stops fantasizing that someday her prince might come and gets down to the business of getting her GED. But for all its superficial innocuousness--""Its only a kids movie"" you may already have exclaimed before reading this far--The Princess and the Frog is the most insidious of the lot precisely because it comes packaged as an all-ages entertainment bearing the imprimatur of the very studio that has branded the imaginations of several generations of the worlds children.Not that Disney is entirely at fault The PC watchdogs who scrutinized this movie since it was first announced and who reportedly succeeded at persuading studio bigwigs to change the title (originally The Frog Princess) the name of the protagonist (originally Maddy feared to sound too much like ""Mammy"") and her profession (originally a maid) seem to have entirely missed the forest for the trees--namely that Disneys first black ""princess"" lives in a world where the ceiling on black ambition is firmly set at the service industries and Tiana and her neighbors seem downright zip-a-dee-doo-dah happy about that. ""Rich people poor people they all got dreams/And dreams do come true in New Orleans"" goes one lyric from the films boisterous opening number a far cry from Newmans own ""Louisiana 1927""--the unofficial anthem of Hurricane Katrina--with its prescient lament ""Theyre tryin to wash us away.""

Five years ago the folks at Disney announced that they were getting out of the hand-drawn ""2D"" animation business -- and seeing that their current release was the utterly awful ""Home on the Range"" you couldnt exactly blame them. Except the fault wasnt the medium; it was the movie -- as proved by their nice new retro romp ""The Princess and the Frog."" The Princess and the Frog (G) Disney (97 min.) Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. With voices by Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos Keith David Jenifer Lewis. Now playing exclusively at the Ziegfield in New York; opens in New Jersey Dec. 11. Stephen Whittys rating THREE STARS Rating note The film contains some mild scares. This is not the sleek CGI animation weve become used to in which every texture is perfect (and every human looks like a blow-up doll). Its gaily colored handmade art with a straight stylistic link to old Baby-Boom offerings of the 50s and 60s. That translates to the screenplay too which avoids the usual (and tiresome) pop-culture japes to tell an old story the kiss-the-frog fable. In this Jazz Age version the enchanted amphibian is a playboy prince; the young woman who smooches him is a hard-working waitress. But their kiss only turns her into a frog too and puts them in search of a voodoo cure. But there is one new thing about this old-fashioned movie -- it has an African-American heroine. Thats a change for Disney and one theyve made gingerly having first tested the ethnic waters with ""Pocahontas"" and ""Mulan."" The studio has reason to be careful too; its ""Song of the South"" -- the one movie it has refused to release to video -- has been dogged by charges of racism since its opening in 1946. So Disney has naturally been nervous wanting to serve a broader audience but knowing that no good deed goes unpunished -- or at least goes without being heavily politically analyzed. ""The Princess and the Frog"" will be too -- and there are things here to annoy all sorts of people. The white characters are all at best buffoons; rural whites are portrayed as vicious and deformed; and even in the depths of the bayou every African-American character has ""good"" hair. Other more general Hollywood cliches are observed too. It is a given these days that any love triangle that features white and black characters has to have them fighting over a Latino; apparently thats true even in cartoon soundtracks since Prince Naveen -- whose origins are a little vague -- is voiced by the Brazilian actor Bruno Campos. But if you can ignore the occasional missteps and stereotypes ""The Princess and the Frog"" does deliver some charming fun. The 1920s New Orleans setting inspires some of the animators best work; ""Almost There"" about Tianas hopes for a career is illustrated with starkly colored cutouts; ""Friends on the Other Side"" a summoning of spirits explodes in neon shapes. And the music makes room for zydeco and gospel Dr. John and jazz. Its a shame that more of it didnt make room for Anika Noni Rose one of the ""Dreamgirls"" and the best singer in the cast. But Keith David a fine character actor gives a richly villainous performance as the voodoo man and Broadway actress Jennifer Cody steals the show as a fatuously squealing Southern belle. The middle of the film drags a bit; theres a giant cowardly gator who isnt very funny and a side trip to a conjure woman that doesnt seem to do anything except add another song and five or 10 minutes of running time. (And parents of toddlers be warned Some of the films summoned spirits are very scary indeed.) But the music is pleasant and the animation a nostalgic treat. And as ubiquitous (and cloying) as the entire ""Disney Princess"" phenomenon can be its nice that millions of little girls can go into a theater and finally see a character who looks a little like them.

For many the films use of old-school cel animation is a welcome return to an age of artisan texture; you feel like human hands actually sketched these images as opposed to simply clicking a mouse over them. While the Jazz Age fables characters are rendered in the usual house style--all wide eyes and Don Bluth--era rubbery faces--the movies replication of Harlem Renaissance aesthetics makes it look like an Archibald J. Motley Jr. painting come to life. More importantly its the first Disney film to add an African-American heroine to the largely pigment-impaired princess canon (Snow White indeed) and the only one to put an Afrocentric vision of life front and center. Yes a Cajun-accented lightning bug courts caricature but compared with Dumbos minstrel crows and the cringeworthy antebellum anecdotes of Song of the South this feels like a giant leap forward. So despite the cultural vibrancy and showstopping visuals why does this skewed take on the Brothers Grimm warhorse feel so inert overall? Blame the storytelling which introduces a clever conceit--both parties go amphibian after locking lips--but then simply relies on the usual anthropomorphic gags Broadway-ready tunes and follow-your-dream platitudes. In todays post-Pixar world such stock elements are less forgivable even if the colorful palette of The Princess and the Frog provides maximum dazzle. Eye-candy--wise the film plants a big wet smooch; everything else about this happily-ever-after tale however feels like a mere air-kiss.--David Fear Now playing.

Two little girls in full princess regalia sit together in a pink bedroom straight out of every miniature Disney fans fantasies listening to a story of wishing on stars transformative kisses and happily ever after. But this fairy tale is different. And though our doe-eyed heroine Tiana has a penchant for talking to animals and bursting into song this is not just another Disney princess branding opportunity. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is also the sweetest most sincere romantic comedy to come along in ages and a luminous love letter to a great American city.In Jazz Age-era New Orleans young Tiana works double shifts as a waitress to fulfill her dream (and her beloved late fathers) of opening up a restaurant. She scrimps she passes up socializing with her friends and just when she seems a hairsbreadth away from making it happen the local realtors tell the African-American beauty that they wont be doing business with ""a woman of your background.""Meanwhile Prince Naveen a handsome visitor from a fictional country where men speak in ethnically indeterminate accents has been cut off from his fortune. Hes in town to dance woo the ladies and find himself a rich bride to assume his debts. But when a visit to the nefarious voodoo ""shadow man"" Dr. Facilier (Keith David) becomes a teachable moment and transforms him -- and soon after Tiana -- into frogs these two kids from different worlds are going to have to work together to reverse the spell.Voicing their characters with aplomb and remarkable chemistry for an animated film ""Dreamgirls"" Anika Noni Rose and Brazilian actor Bruno Campos have a light easy rapport. As they drift through the swamps together searching for priestess Mama Odie to help them become human again they bicker and squabble with classic screwball timing. Shes the uptight practical one whos hiding her heart; hes the irresistible rake. And you can tell via the splendidly rich animation and the appeal of the two performers the exact moment those darn frogs fall hopelessly in love.Fairy-tale princesses especially those in the Disney pantheon have always been a product of their times. Generations ago it was enough for them to be hardworking and docile to accept suffering with grace and fall into deep sleeps when the plot required it. It was revolutionary when ""Beauty and the Beasts"" Belle came along in 1991 with her love of books and her disdain for the handsomest guy in town. Tiana takes the princess role a step further -- shes not just Disneys first African-American to wear the crown shes the first one with a regular job. (Unless you count Mulans gig as a warrior.) She also like ""Ratatouilles"" Remy makes the case for great food as a social leveler and the cornerstone of a good life. Tiana knows that food ""brings people together"" with more reliable results than even voodoo. You Might Also Like But the strides here arent just for princesses. Those Charming Guys of bygone days have traditionally been even less interesting than the ladies they rescue. Campos makes his Naveen such a cocky player that he doesnt stop seducing even when hes turned green and asks for just one kiss ... ""unless you beg for more."" Hes a spoiled rich guy who needs to grow up and the movie is just as much about his journey as it is about Tianas. And what a felicitous spot to take that journey. The Crescent City in all her early 20th-century glory shines like a jewel here an enchanted lively multicultural town full of bright blossoms and infectious songs. As they say in the movie ""Dreams come true in New Orleans."" Randy Newman who wrote the score does a bang-up job of paying tribute to the citys rich musical heritage in a series of colorful trippy numbers. Theres a jazzy Armstrong-like song (featuring a crocodile named Louis) a gospel-tinged showstopper a zydeco throwdown and a boogie-woogie paean to the town sung by Dr. John.Surely its no accident either that a movie delicately addressing race makes stirring use of light and dark interplay. A G-rated girl film that will move crazy amounts of dolls and lunchboxes may not have an in-your-face political agenda nor should it. But the glow of streetcars the light glinting off stars and fireflies in the night sky -- the way that every element every shade is more beautiful in context of the other -- that is some powerful lovely stuff.

"Review The Princess and the Frog - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Review The Princess and the FrogThe hand-drawn animated Disney film set in jazz-soaked 1920s New Orleans is a refreshing lively version of the fairy tale.November 25 2009|By Betsy Sharkey FILM CRITIC gt;gt;gt; ROYALTY IN HAND Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) holds Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos)... (Disney Enterprises )Go ahead and pucker up. Because long before ""The Princess and the Frog"" is over youll want to smooch the charming couple air kiss a romantic firefly and hug a voodoo queen in this foot-stomping smile-inducing heart-warming animated twist on the old Brothers Grimm frog-prince fairy tale. FOR THE RECORD ""The Princess and the Frog"" The review of the animated film ""The Princess and the Frog"" in Wednesdays Calendar said the lead character Tiana was a maid. She is a waitress. a The filmmakers have brewed up a delicious roots story in every sense of the word. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is set in the 1920s jazz age in the New Orleans heart of it all.Its the studios return to the lush fluid beauty of hand-drawn animation. Its an old-fashioned fairy tale even though theyve had some fun with the story. And its set to music in the grand tradition of ""Beauty and the Beast"" which is to say the neoclassic 90s brand of Disney animation. FOR THE RECORD This review incorrectly stated that the character Tiana was a maid. She was a waitress. That might make ""The Princess and the Frog"" seem like a creature of ancient times particularly since kids these days are raised on 3-D flash. The effect though is the opposite. After being bombarded by so much computer-generated motion-captured high-and-higher jinks the film feels fresh -- a discovery or a rediscovery depending on your age. At the keyboards we have the always flavorful Mr. Randy Newman creating a spicy gumbo of blues gospel jazz Dixieland and because we are in the Big Easy a dash or two of zydeco along with the Tobasco (nothing says ""now"" like product placement). Theres plenty of razzle-dazzle starting with Anika Noni Rose the perky third of the ""Dreamgirls"" whos lending her fabulous pipes to Tiana the hardworking lovely with big plans at the center of this story. Yes a prince on the side might be nice but this career girl from humble beginnings has her eye on an empty warehouse that will make a fine restaurant where the flappers will be hot the jazz will be cool and the food oh so divine. Though there are all sorts of barriers to be broken and despite a day job as a maid that has her forever pinching pennies Tiana is not one to give up. That shouldnt come as a complete surprise since she has the ultimate overachiever in Oprah as her mama though for some reason directors John Musker and Ron Clements who wrote the script with Rob Edwards call her Eudora. No matter. This being New Orleans the dark arts are a major factor in the story with Keith Davids Dr. Facilier making so many deals with so many devils it will make your head spin and possibly frighten some little ones when those voodoo masks start multiplying and moving. In keeping with the ethnic blend the song and dance man with the Hugh Jackman good looks only darker is Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) from the mythical kingdom of Maldonia. Whether its a worry about offending African Americans with ""cartoonish"" exaggeration or a desire to make the film palatable for white audiences or both the animators have been very careful with their pens when it comes to drawing black characters on the page. Just about everyone here has ""good hair"" and Tiana could be Halle Berrys kissing cousin. So while its not Disneys first time at dipping a toe in multicultural waters -- ""Aladdin"" ""Mulan"" and "" Pocahontas"" were there first -- ""The Princess and the Frog"" still feels like baby steps. With all of Dr. Faciliers scheming Naveen is about to be green anyway which makes him very jumpy especially since there are gun-toting moonshiners who fancy frying up his legs. He was supposed to be kissed by Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) a rich Southern belle but in a mistake of monumental proportions he smooches Tiana instead and we have two frogs not one and no happily ever after in sight. The rest of the film trots out many of the swampy tropes of childhood -- always be good be careful who you trust follow your dreams its whats inside that counts. But what could be tried as well as true is not because the filmmakers have done to the bayou what Mardi Gras does to the French Quarter -- put music magic light and laughter everywhere. There are the big Broadway-style numbers weve come to expect from Disney musicals of that only slightly bygone era the kind that let the animation team go wild. One of ""The Princess and the Frogs"" best comes when a swarm of fireflies seeks a blind voodoo queen named Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) who might be the only one powerful enough to break Dr. Faciliers curse. Led by a hopeless romantic named Ray (Jim Cummings) a bit of a dim bulb the bayou turns into a high-kicking extravaganza with singing and dancing swamp critters pulling off complicated choreography while Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) a gator with a jazz obsession blows a really mean trumpet. Clements and Musker are pretty much Disney born and raised with two of the studios best musical showstoppers ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" heading their rA(c)sumA(c)s. With ""The Princess and the Frog"" theyve gotten just about everything right. The dialogue is fresh-prince clever the themes are ageless the rhythms are riotous and the return to a primal animation style is beautifully executed. So shake a stick at those Grimm Brothers when it comes to princesses and frogs we now have a beautiful boisterous sister in charge. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDisneyland princesses moving in together at Fantasy FaireFebruary 1 2013Danielle MonA(c) Truitt The Princess and the FrogNovember 29 2009Princess and the Frog star Anika Noni Rose likes homey...November 27 2009Q amp; A with Princess and the Frog animatorsNovember 22 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentFairy TaleCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-princess25-2009nov25,0,6472123.story",200,theprincessandthefrog31,theprincessandthefrog,latimes

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Princess and the Frog   (out of four)Voices Anika Noni Rose Bruno Campos Keith David Jenifer Lewis Terrence Howard Oprah Winfrey Jennifer Cody John GoodmanDirectors Ron Clements and John MuskerDistributor Walt Disney Animation StudiosRating GRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles By Claudia Puig USA TODAY What a relief to watch an animated movie without 3-D glasses And what a pleasure after a season of bland computer-generated tales to be swept up in the visual magic of The Princess and the Frog the two-dimensional handsomely hand-drawn feature that is classic whimsical Disney. The story set in Jazz Age New Orleans features Disneys first major African-American female lead and its most extensive black cast. It also is the first hand-drawn animated feature from the studio since 2004s Home on the Range. Princess is akin to The Little Mermaid in its blending of gorgeous backdrops catchy musical numbers and a plucky heroine. But unlike dreamy mermaid Ariel Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is a hardworking woman. While her friend Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) encourages her to daydream about a handsome prince Tiana prefers to rely on determination to achieve her dreams. Tianas goal is to open a restaurant in the French Quarter and she is dogged in its pursuit saving the money she earns at a cafe. Meanwhile Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos) has come to New Orleans to find a rich bride after his parents cut him off. He turns to the witch doctor Facilier (Keith David) whose assistance results in Naveens transformation to a frog. Soon the fairy-tale premise turns on its head when Tiana meets the frog prince and gives him a smooch. But instead of returning Naveen to his human self Tiana turns into a frog too. The movie captures the traditional Disney aesthetic with some up-to-date spins. Tiana is African-American while Naveens ethnic origins are less evident. The film embraces diversity in a natural way. The films ethos is summed up by voodoo priestess Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) in her native patois ""Only thing important is whats under the skin."" Where Pinocchio was about wishing on a star The Princess and the Frog emphasizes backing up wishes with hard work. That proviso is a thoughtful message for young moviegoers.

This is the first Disney animated film about an African-American princess and this delightful fairy tale couldnt come at a better time what with the two little African-American princesses who live in the White House. The newest Disney royal is named Tiana and shes a young woman with pools for eyes a figure straight out of a fashion magazine and a big dream. Tiana wants to own a restaurant--she makes a mean beignet--but shes so busy working to save money for it that she barely notices when a prince comes to her corner of 1920s New Orleans. Like every Disney prince Naveen seems completely unattainable though for reasons that have less to do with his station or his dreamy French accent than with our own more modern concerns. Prince Naveen has a tannish complexion but he clearly isnt African-American. My fear is that for many in the black community the fairy tale may just end right there. (Article continued below...)Since the 1960s marriages between black men and white women have been steadily increasing--14 percent of all black men are now married outside the race. Yet only 4 percent of black women do the same. Why? Black women for better or worse have always seemed to maintain a loyalty to the ideal of the black family unit. Thats understandable even noble but it doesnt make a whole lot of sense when so many black men dont feel the same way. Combined with the disturbing number of black men in prison that means 47 percent of all African-American women today never marry. With those numbers I say its time for many black women to start thinking and acting like Tiana.Im certainly not suggesting that we all follow in the steps of a fictional character but I am proposing that we take a good long look at what the fairy tale is trying to teach the children of the world--and us. In The Princess and the Frog we see a young girl not inhibited by the color of her skin or her suitors. Of course the film makes that easy by changing them both into frogs--its a long story--so that color becomes the least of their concerns (after say the whole eating-flies thing). This gives them the opportunity to get to know each other without the added pressure of who comes from where and who looks like what. The dont-judge-a-book-by-its-cover idea may be a Disney cliche (see also Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Little Mermaid etc.) but it comes at a time when as Prince Naveen might say Plus ca change plus cest la meme chose. Just last month a justice of the peace in Louisiana was forced to resign after he refused to marry an interracial couple. It would be wonderful if the black family could stay together to face down societys prejudices but black women cant shoulder that responsibility by themselves. And they certainly shouldnt be consigned to a lifetime of loneliness. Princess Tiana is able to find happiness by wishing upon a star but all that black women have to do is open their minds.

But adults should This old-fashioned charmer holds its own beside the motion-capture elegance of Disneys A Christmas Carol the engrossing stop-motion universes of Coraline and Fantastic Mr. Fox the CG-enhanced genius of Up the wonder of 3-D technology and indeed the unique hand-drawn Japanese artistry of Hayao Miyazakis Ponyo as the years deepest most affecting and most inventive movies. Still for the greenest or the grayest in the audience the inclusive story of a resourceful African-American girl in 1930s New Orleans who kisses a frog with unexpected funny results is its own reward This A-level G-rated entertainment is a fresh twist on the classic fairy tale about a handsome prince temporarily out of commission due to a malicious magic spell a royal catch requiring the smooch of the right kindhearted risk-taking heroine to restore him to his waiting throne. (As an added benefit the smoocher gets to stand alongside her royal as his princess.) Only this time the kiss that the lovely heroine Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) bestows on frog-bodied Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) backfires. He ends up in the same shape that he hopped into -- and Tiana turns amphibian too. The patient beautiful hard-?working entrepreneurial young woman is particularly irked because she has no desire to be a princess at all; what she really wants to do is open her own restaurant. Great swampy mess The race to restore happily-ever-after order involves a jazz-loving alligator named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley); Ray (Jim Cummings) a bebopping Cajun firefly; Dr. Facilier (Keith David) a shady New Orleans gent who dabbles in dark arts; and Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) ancient royalty of the bayou magic world with the power to undo Dr. Faciliers treachery. And this being the Disney kingdom under the beneficent creative rule of veteran directors Ron Clements and John Musker (The Little Mermaid Aladdin) and composer Randy Newman (Cars Toy Story) the frolic also includes songs of gumption (""Almost There"") mischief (""Friends on the Other Side"") optimism (""When Were Human"") spiritual uplift (""Dig a Little Deeper"") and ? the love of something up above -- in this case an evening star (""Ma Belle Evangeline""). But while little kids laugh at the froggy humor (summed up in the excellent repeated punchline ""thats not slime you are secreting -- its mucus"") the firefly antics and the cute sight of a fat alligator wailing on his trumpet like Louis Armstrong adult viewers are rewarded with something more moving -- a Proustian remembrance of the durable ? power of Disney at its old-school best. The filmmakers trust in story over special effects and character over celebrity voices (there are almost none here save for a brief cameo by queen-of-all-she-surveys Oprah Winfrey as Tianas saintly mother Eudora). They steep the movie in colloquial American culture. They offer a sophisticated musical experience (ragtime zydeco gospel Tin Pan Alley) ? accessible even to the youngest ears. And in doing so the creative team behind The Princess and the Frog upholds the great tradition of classic Disney animation. The Princess and the Frog happens to introduce an African-American heroine a Disney animation first. The story also ? happens to be set in an idealized New Orleans of an earlier time a city whose historic beauty and cultural importance will forever be ? filtered by contemporary adults through grimmer awareness of the natural and man-made disasters of Hurricane Katrina. Its all the more effective though that this Big Easy of a movie needs no overt mention of Katrina to move our hearts and inserts no overt lesson in the history of civil rights to distract from the groundbreaking matter-of-factness of Tianas equality. What matters is that Tiana triumphs as both a girl and a frog that dreams are fulfilled wrongs are righted love prevails and music unites not only a princess and a frog but also kids and grown-ups.

Disney goes back to the drawing board with results more diverting than captivating in ""The Princess and the Frog."" Conspicuously outfitted with an African-American heroine and a vibrant 1920s New Orleans setting this cheeky update of a classic fairy tale boasts almost as many talking points as merchandising opportunities and should enjoy jazzy holiday biz starting with its Thanksgiving weekend bicoastal engagement and extending well past its Dec. 11 wide release. But whatever it accomplishes for Disneys reputation or bottom line this long-anticipated throwback to a venerable house style never comes within kissing distance of the studios former glory. While it will be criticized and defended by op-ed writers with equal vigor the companys first traditionally animated picture since 2004s ""Home on the Range"" -- and coincidentally its first inhouse toon of the Obama era -- behaves much like any Disney movie. It grafts easy stereotypes and funny accents onto warm likable supporting characters; it telegraphs its setting via recognizable cultural cliches (in this case beignets and voodoo); and it revolves around a lovely maiden who headstrong though she may be is in the end so blandly honorable that her ethnicity is pretty much beside the point. But Tiana unlike Snow White (to say the least) lives not in a castle but in a poor predominantly black Big Easy neighborhood. In a prologue that immediately establishes the films hip self-aware sensibility we learn why sassy-but-classy Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) has grown up believing not in stars or fairy godmothers but in ambition and hard work. Devoted to the memory of her late father (because it wouldnt be a Disney movie without at least one dead parent) shes determined to fulfill his long-held dream of opening the finest restaurant in New Orleans. But Tiana is thwarted when she crosses paths with visiting royalty handsome dark-skinned Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) who through an elaborately silly chain of events has been transformed into a frog by devious voodoo-peddler Dr. Facilier (Keith David). Mistaking Tiana for a princess the frog prince begs her to restore him with a kiss only to have the spell rebound on Tiana and turn her into a frog as well. Unlike most tales of its type in which the heroine spends the whole movie in pursuit of Prince Charming ""The Princess and the Frog"" follows the modern romantic-comedy template granting its amphibious duo plenty of shared screen time and making them polar opposites -- hes cocky and lazy shes uptight and bossy -- who initially cant stand each other. Of course its only a matter of time before Naveen realizes Tianas his dreamgirl but not before they leap through the Louisiana swamps to seek the help of wizened priestess Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis). Along the way they form friendships -- food chain be damned -- with trumpet-playing alligator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and gap-toothed Cajun firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) who do their part to make the picaresque adventure more engaging as it goes along. All of this is delivered in the usual riotous explosion of color and song. From the mansions of the citys upscale Garden District and the cast-iron balcony railings of the French Quarter New Orleans clearly offered the animators no shortage of visual inspiration and architectural variety. And whatever one makes of the material -- which sanitizes voodoo for mass moppet consumption and even serves up a G-rated Mardi Gras climax -- its an unmistakable pleasure to behold an old-school hand-drawn toon assembled with pristine craftsmanship and attention to detail at a time when CG 3D and even stop-motion animation are all the rage. Making less of an impression are Randy Newmans score and songs which though they encompass an impressive range of Southern musical styles wont have kids or their parents humming on their way out of the theater. With the exception of the films strongest tune (Mama Odies delightfully upbeat hymn to soul-searching ""Dig a Little Deeper"") most of the numbers play like rehashes of past Disney showstoppers in purpose if not in style Dr. Faciliers sinister ""Friends on the Other Side"" for example recalls Scars ""Be Prepared"" from ""The Lion King"" (while the bad doctor himself resembles ""Aladdins"" Jafar with a bared midriff). That derivative quality pervades the entire production as directors John Musker and Ron Clements -- who collaborated on such Disney new-wave masterpieces as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" but also 2002s poorly received ""Treasure Planet"" -- seem content to sample the companys back catalog and riff on classic conventions rather than forge an actual classic. Admittedly Musker and Clements (who scripted with Rob Edwards) are working in a looser more insouciant mode than the tradition of vintage Disney storytelling; for many viewers the mere effort will be enough even if it primes ones appetite for better things to come. Voicework is expectedly top-notch. Rose makes an eminently appealing lead while Campos invests his grinning frog prince with real charm; Lewis and Cummings upstage everyone with the pics most endearing and politically incorrect vocal turns. Jennifer Cody also amuses as Tianas spoiled-rich-girl chum Charlotte who says things like ""Why arent you just as pretty as a magnolia in May"" and seems to have been conceived along the lines of a young Blanche Devereaux.

(Disney) Joe Neumaier Updated Tuesday November 24 2009 516 PM Title The Princess and the Frog A girl and a prince become frogs. With the voices of Anika Noni Rose Oprah Winfrey. (135) G Animated peril. At area theaters. Imagine the burden of legacy that the Disney team faced with ""The Princess and the Frog."" The first real addition to its princess lineup in almost 15 years and the studios biggest non-CG - that is classically animated - cartoon in half a decade it also belatedly brings racial diversity to a genre thats been mostly snow white for seven decades. Jiminy crickets Thats a lot for one fable to carry on its slender shoulders. The good news is that ""Pamp;F"" quickly cruises past the fact that Tiana is Disneys first African-American heroine. Unfortunately the story that surrounds her often finds itself stuck in the swamp. When we first meet Tiana its 1912 New Orleans and she and her friend Charlotte both around 6 are hearing a tale of tiaras and magic from Tianas mom (Oprah Winfrey) a seamstress working for Charlottes rich father (John Goodman). Back in their working-class neighborhood Tianas own dad tells her his long-delayed dream of opening a restaurant. Fast-forward to the 1920s and as Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) saves her waitressing tips to make her late dads plan a reality the pompous Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) arrives in town looking for a wife. That is until nasty Dr. Facilier (Keith David) - in a far  too convoluted plot twist - uses voodoo on Naveen in an attempt to steal Charlottes family fortune. Suddenly a frog the Prince needs a regal kiss to break the spell When he spots Tiana dolled up for a ball he puckers up but since shes only royal in her dreams the kiss makes her small green and slimy too. Aided by a trumpet-playing gator and a Cajun firefly Tiana and Naveen travel the bayou to find a wise voodoo priestess who reveals the key to becoming human again is not just destroying an amulet that contains Naveens blood but separating what they want from what they need. Part of the problem with ""Pamp;F"" is that Tiana and Naveens connection feels superficial. Plus unlike some of his modern princess-courting brethren - the Beast Aladdin even John Smith in ""Pocahontas"" - Naveens inner change from shallow to decent seems as perfunctory as his physical one from man to amphibian. Other elements work better including the jazz-age setting and Randy Newmans zydeco-tinged music. And while Dr. Faciliers scary shadow monsters may be too intense for young kids theyre effective nightmare-makers in the classic Disney tradition. Which brings us back to Tiana. As drawn in the movies unexceptional style - which has nothing to do with format yet everything to do with the special spark that infused so many great movies from ""Dumbo"" to ""Tarzan"" - shes lovely and strong but achingly one-dimensional. And for all the movies modern touches she really has no reason to change which keeps much of the plot earthbound. Maybe when it comes down to it ""The Princess and the Frog"" could handle only so many wishes. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.
