After Frozen its a huge step back for Disney both in terms of simply telling an engaging story for kids and its underlying social messages. The first three female characters with dialogue are a killjoy mechanic who informs hero Dusty (Dane Cook) that he cant race anymore for health reasons a waitress with a single line and a pink sports car whos hit on by - groan - a pickup truck. The boys dont fare much better the main story arc is about an antiquated model of plane struggling to cope with obsolescence in his chosen job market. Its difficult to imagine how this parable of middle age will resonate with eight-year-olds. Of course you could say the same of something like Pixars grumpy-old-man odyssey Up but that was a triumph of characterisation and charm over a bare-bones narrative. Sadly the closest this lacklustre outing comes to wittiness is making forced puns about how Dusty kicked Aston Martin. The rockin MOR soundtrack also deserves special mention for Nickelback-esque services to dreariness.

Its a thoughtful touch from a studio based in the tinderbox West. And director Roberts Gannaway and a squadron of talented animators take seriously that commitment in the details. Vivid and folksy ""Fire amp; Rescue"" nicely exceeds expectations dampened by last summers stalled-out ""Planes."" When crop-duster-turned-renowned-racer Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) has a mechanical setback one sure to end his racing career he acts out. When his mistake costs a friend -- a rundown fire truck named Mayday (Hal Holbrook) -- Dusty volunteers to become the towns second firefighter. He leaves his Propwash Junction friends -- Skipper Dottie Chug -- for Piston Peaks for training and a new set of characters. Boarding this franchise for the first time are Ed Harris as Blade Ranger the helicopter leader of the Piston Peak Air Attack Base; Julie Bowen as Lil Dipper a gifted air tanker with a fan-crush on Dusty; and Wes Studi as a folklore-savvy helicopter named Windlifter. Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller sweeten the tale as old married RVs Winnie and Harvey. ""Fire amp; Rescue"" doesnt do narrative loop-de-loops exactly. The storytelling is conventional in almost every sense from its gruff leader with a past to its striving park superintendent who siphons funds from the firefighting budget for renovations of the Grand Fusel Lodge. Whats wild are the images. Dusty and Skippers swooping and arcing flight over the countryside is a preview of whats to come. When Dusty heads to Piston Peaks National Park the wooded terrain is altogether different and just as beckoning. Here 3-D doesnt just subtract from parents wallets but adds to the immersive ride. The animation effects veer toward the astonishing. A fave a magenta cloud of retardant enveloping the screen. The flames that climb trees and devour mountainsides are gorgeously rendered but also feel aptly dangerous. ""Planes"" hews closer to the G side of its PG rating. The bump-up comes from scenes of ""action and some peril."" And the flame-battling climax is an adrenaline-charged set piece. A U.S. Forest Service comic book about a singed bear cub named Smokey taught my generation about forest fires and their prevention. The current booster-seat set has an able hero in Dusty and his amiable cohort of other soulful machines.

Disneys Planes released last year felt less like a creative endeavor and more like an opportunistic bit of corporate synergy. Created by DisneyToon the folks who do downmarket straight-to-video sequels for the Mouse Houses classic films it was an attempt to broaden the world of Pixars Cars franchise thus allowing kids to buy more toys and experience more adventures with adorable anthropomorphic vehicles. The film originally intended solely for home-video was weak but inoffensive -- a generic underdog-outsider-competes-in-the-big-race story with a fairly dry visual style and bland humor. Unlike other animated movies that try to throw some irreverent bones to the adults Planes seemed to recognize the fact that parents who took their kids to see it could have used the opportunity to catch a quick in-theater nap. The sequel Planes Fire and Rescue is still a DisneyToon production but it does aim higher with a visual zip that was lacking from the first. It is in almost all respects a better movie. Its still not particularly good though. The first movie ended with lowly crop-dusting plane Dusty Crophopper (still Dane Cook sadly) realizing his dreams of becoming a world-class air-racer and the new one begins with him as a high-flying international celebrity hot-dogging his way through the racing circuit and grinning for the cameras. A failing gear box however cuts short his racing career and non-compliance on fire-safety issues gets his beloved Propwash Junctions airport permit pulled. (Damned government regulators) In order to save his airstrip Dusty decides to become an aerial firefighter and putters off to the Piston Peak Air Attack squadron to get certified. There he finds himself at odds with the crusty take-no-crap copter Blade Ranger (voiced by Ed Harris) who doesnt like Dustys impulsive go-it-alone attitude. Anyway something something something planes planes planes fire fire fire more planes life lessons the end. The only thing notable about the script this time around is how serious it is. The film is dedicated to firefighters and surprisingly it carries that solemnity throughout. I think I counted three jokes; The Purge Anarchy has more humor. Planes demonstrated that a world made up entirely of planes and cars has a vaguely uniform feel -- even if the vehicles come in all shapes and sizes. Put more simply Watching planes fly even when theyre going fast gets kind of boring after a while. But that first film did come alive during one sequence involving Dusty and the ocean -- the almost sensuous unpredictability of the waves felt like a reprieve from the straight shiny steel of this universe. Planes Fire and Rescue has learned its lesson and does it darnedest to deal with this inconvenient reality cutting faster and panning the camera vigorously (or ""panning"" the ""camera"" vigorously) as the planes whoosh past us. Its a more impressive cinematic environment too. Now the planes zoom through vast canyons of fire and thundering clouds of smoke. They swoop down to scoop water (and sometimes almost crash) in rivers and lakes. They spew out vast pink sprays of retardant. Visually what were seeing feels more charged and diverse filled with volatile and ever-changing elements. That may feel like a subtle distinction but its not. Planes Fire and Rescue has a big-screen vitality that keeps us watching. In the end its still a movie for little kids but this time around you may not be so compelled to snooze while the young ones are marveling at all those planes.

A spunky crop duster joins a fire brigade. Director Roberts Gannaway (123). PG Action peril. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Never tell a sentient airplane he cant be whatever he wants to be. In last years animated hit ""Planes"" the Dane Cook-voiced agricultural aerialist Dusty Crophopper was drawn to the loftier (and speedier) goals of being an international racing plane. Having won the big tournament against all odds this sequel opens with Dusty the hero of the airfield. But wear and tear on his gearbox -- a part no longer manufactured -- means that redlining is now too dangerous for Dusty. With racing behind him Dusty joins Blade Ranger (voiced by Ed Harris) at a national parks airborne fire brigade. A whisper-thin plot involving a corrupt hotelier a visit from the secretary of the interior and a forest blaze leads to inevitable acts of heroism. Among the supporting vehicles Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara add humor as Harvey and Winnie retired RVs visiting the spot where they fell in love. From left Winnie Dipper Dusty and Harvey in Planes Fire amp; Rescue (Disney) Cad Spinner and Dusty in Planes Fire amp; Rescue (Disney) Dusty and Blade Ranger in Planes Fire amp; Rescue (PLANES FIRE amp; RESCUE) The original ""Planes"" -- the first of these ""Cars"" spinoffs downgraded from Pixar to the DisneyToon Studios -- had round-the-globe adventure and some innovative design but ""Fire amp; Rescue"" is surprisingly dull. Its mostly just hanging around the park training to put out fires. The meek action plays to the under-10 crowd but the groaner puns will play only to masochists. Meanwhile the 3-D ticket upcharge here is a big ripoff -- the extra dimension is unnecessary.

This time its plane-with-a-heart-of-gold Dusty Crophopper (voiced by Dane Cook surprisingly likable when invisible) at front and center as he learns his racing career is over due to a gearbox flaw that renders him unable to push his engine too hard. This bad news comes just as Propwash Junction Dustys home base requires a new certified fire-fighting vehicle to keep its airport open and so Dusty in search of purpose figures hell get certified; how tough can it be? See video Meet Dane Cooks Competition in Newest Planes Trailer (Video) Early on Dusty and Propwash Junction are preparing for their big annual community celebration and a happy talking car notes ""Its going to be the biggest Corn Festival ever"" If this is in fact a sly aside from director Roberts Gannaway (who co-wrote with Jeffery M. Howard) its both appreciated and as subtle as ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" gets. Dusty puts himself under the tutelage of forest firefighter Blade Ranger (voiced by Ed Harris) but soon finds that it takes more than just showing up to fit in with Blade and his team. Disney of course is the studio that traumatized generations of kids with the the burning forest sequence from ""Bambi"" back in 1942 and ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" updates that kind of peril and awe now with 3-D computer-generated animation to real and terrific effect. There is of course a subplot about a new resort in the path of an oncoming fire and the greedy vain resort owner (John Michael Higgins) who doesnt want it to be evacuated for the big weekend; picture ""Jaws"" with talking vehicles. Once-proud racer Dusty eventually learns about duty honor and sacrifice and its a pleasure to hear plain-spoken dialogue in Ed Harris voice even if that voice is coming from a wide-jawed helicopter ""Life ... doesnt always go the way you want it to."" And even with all of the spark-billowing chaos and smoke-spewing fearsomeness of the forest fire sequences theyre less scary  (and weird) than some of the series other missteps like when ""Cars 2"" featured vehicle-on-vehicle homicide or the PTSD-plagued war veteran craft from the first ""Planes."" Also read Stephen Sondheim Changes His Tune on Disneys Into the Woods After Seeing Movie To be fair all kids movie characters end up as merchandise; credit to Disney then for figuring out how to slap googly eyes on vehicles and earn a pretty handsome mark-up with minimal work. And as it is in the merchandising aisle so it is on the big screen ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" is precisely long competent and entertaining enough to be sold and sold well. Cooks characterization of Dusty as the plane-next-door works even selling the sad moments when Dusty furrows his wipers and shrugs his wings. Other vocal standouts include Harris (of course) animation stalwart Patrick Warburton and Wes Studi and Curtis Armstrong. Also read Ed Harris-Eva Longoria Drama Frontera Acquired by Magnolia Pictures The plot leaves the female vehicle characters with less to do than even ""Planes"" did which is regrettable but it does show female characters serving in harms way firefighting as part of the team so it could be worse. ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" is pretty simple but its never simplistic; things work out great for Dusty but thats all part of the kid-movie experience. This movie hardly rates as first-class animation but it gets in gets the job done and moves on both swiftly and well. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Planes Fire amp; Rescue Heroics take flight in sequel review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPlanes Fire amp; Rescue Heroics take flight in sequel review Animated kids toon Planes sequel Planes Fire amp; Rescue sees crop duster-turned-racer Dusty Crophopper become a firefighter -- with some help from his friends.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 17 2014Planes Fire amp; RescueWith the voices of Dane Cook Ed Harris Julie Bowen Hal Holbrook Wes Studi Teri Hatcher Stacy Keach Cedric the Entertainer Anne Meara Jerry Stiller and Fred Willard. Directed by Bobs Gannaway. 84 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. GFeisty prop-spinner Dusty Crophopper makes another pass around the tower and finds a second chance gives him a new purpose in life in Planes Fire amp; Rescue.Once again voiced by comic Dane Cook the fear of heights that grounded Dusty in 2013s Planes is far behind him. Hes a full-fledged superstar racer. But theres some turbulence ahead for him in Disneys toon tribute to brave firefighters.Article Continued BelowWhile the sequel doesnt fly as high as the far superior Pixar Studios auto comedies Cars and Cars 2 its an improvement on the first animated adventure about the air and ground residents of Propwash Junction. Planes Fire amp; Rescue offers a dose of Disney firefighting action.Dusty is midflight when hes suddenly grounded by gearbox woes that cant be repaired even by ace mechanic Dottie the forklift (Teri Hatcher one of a host of celebrity voices). He can still fly but she warns him he cant push his speed into the red like he once did.Worse Dustys stubborn insistence he can soar higher than his damage leads to a fire at the airfield that aging fire truck Mayday (Hal Holbrook) cant handle. That brings in safety trucks who demand Propwash Junction up its fire protection.Convinced he can make amends Dusty decides to sign up for flying firefighter training to join Maydays team now that his racing career is on hold. He says goodbye to hometown pals like dimwitted-but-loyal Chug the fuel truck (Brad Garrett) and sets out for the aerial firefighting school at Yellowstone-clone Piston Peak National Park.But its not going to be easy to learn how to battle forest fires. Tough helicopter Blade Ranger (Ed Harris) is Dustys firefighting instructor. He isnt going to give him an easy ride constantly berating him for holding back when he needs to add speed. Dusty isnt about to share his faulty gearbox secret and as it turns out Blade Ranger has something hes keeping from Dusty too.Dustys engine gets plenty of revving anyway thanks to the advances of star-struck water-scooping plane Dipper (Modern Familys Julie Bowen) whose full-on crush makes Dusty decidedly nervous.The earnest Smokejumpers team of wee forklifts and bulldozers who parachute into hot spots deliver laughs. But for the most part Planes Fire amp; Rescue is more about chuckles than big guffaws coupled with thrilling 3-D flight and firefighting action scenes and lessons about friendship respect and loyalty.The planes and ground support decide to take a night off for the big reopening of the Grand Fusel Lodge (get it?) but wouldnt be so quick to sip the free oil if they knew developer Cad Spinner (a luxury SUV voiced by Bad Teachers John Michael Higgins) had diverted the firefighting budget to fancy up the resort.When a massive fire cuts off the main road and threatens the lodge and its four-wheeled guests the firefighting planes take off to save the day. But is Dusty up to the task?Fire amp; Rescue is squarely aimed at younger audiences (clocking in at a kid-friendly 84 minutes) and bolstered by Mark Mancinas chirpy score along with tunes from country star Brad Paisley Spencer Lee and even some AC/DC and Captain amp; Tennille.Adults will smile at CHIPS Erik Estrada in a clever cameo and a pretty funny Burt Reynolds joke plus Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara do a familiar shtick as devoted married RVs Harvey and Winnie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Planes Fire amp; Rescue soars amid blazing-hot visuals - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Planes Fire amp; Rescue soars amid blazing-hot visuals Planes Fire amp; Rescue Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Planes Fire amp; Rescue starring Dane Cook and Julie Bowen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Planes Fire amp; Rescue starring Dane Cook and Julie Bowen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Planes Fire amp; Rescue does an expert job putting us inside the action of aerial firefighting ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" sounds more like a category on Craigslist than the name of a new animated film. But what this Disney feature lacks in the title department it makes up for with fluid visuals and fast-moving action of the yes firefighting variety.A sequel to last years ""Planes"" this unabashed family film does have its standard-issue elements especially the overly glib rapid-fire remarks of the ""I kicked Aston-Martin"" variety that the films anthropomorphic planes and cars exchange like they were so many motorized Borscht Belt comedians. A little of this goes a long way. Fortunately these planes are not here to chit-chat but to fight fires. ""Fire amp; Rescues"" director Bobs Gannaway (who co-wrote with Jeffrey M. Howard) does such an expert job putting us inside the action and detailing how aerial firefighting is done that you feel like you could fight a fire yourself after youve seen the film at its 3-D best.""Fire amp; Rescue"" is primarily set inside Piston Peak National Park a bucolic spot inspired by Yellowstone and other parks. As big as the park is thats how great the fire danger is inside it and ""Fire amp; Rescue"" outdoes itself in featuring animated flames that shoot out in a most convincing even threatening way. ""Out of 1224 total shots in the film"" says effects animation lead John Patton ""more than half feature some kind of effect fire smoke water."" Those fires you may be sure are not left alone to burn out of control a team of aircraft goes at it hammer and tongs in a visually exciting way to contain things and keep everyone safe. Before we see even a hint of smoke however ""Fire amp; Rescue"" reintroduces us to the protagonist of the earlier ""Planes."" That would be Dusty Crophopper (voiced by Dane Cook) a former crop duster now turned into a world-famous air racer. Photos (By Christy Khoshaba) Dusty has returned home to Propwash Junction to help publicize the local Corn Festival. But before the fun can get underway he makes an unnerving discovery the high speeds hes been flying at to win all those races have done some serious damage to his gearbox and (gasp) he may never be able to go fast enough to fly competitively again.The films first fire takes place at the Propwash Junction airfield and its too much for ancient Mayday the local fire and rescue truck (voiced by the venerable Hal Holbrook). Officials pull the airports certification and put the fate of the Corn Festival in jeopardy unless wait for it a plane can be found to back Mayday up. Related Disney is developing Haunted Mansion animated special for TV Patrick Kevin Day Guillermo del Toro may still be struggling to figure out the script for his planned ""Haunted Mansion"" theatrical feature but Disney Television Animation is putting its own take on the popular Disney Parks attraction into development. Guillermo del Toro may still be struggling to figure out the script for his planned ""Haunted Mansion"" theatrical feature but Disney Television Animation is putting its own take on the popular Disney Parks attraction into development. (Patrick Kevin Day) Which is how Dusty ends up heading for the Piston Peak Air Attack Base to be trained and certified as a SEAT a single engine air tanker whose small size belies its usefulness for dropping flame retardant on a roaring blaze. At the air base Dusty meets up with the rest of Piston Peaks team all characters with a capital C. These include Blade Ranger (Ed Harris) a fire-and-rescue helicopter and the groups gruff no-nonsense top dog; Dipper (""Modern Familys"" Julie Bowen) an air tanker with an unfortunate flirtatious nature whos saddled with some of the scripts most unfortunate lines; and Windlifter (the veteran Wes Studi) a slow-talking Native American and an essential heavy-lift helicopter.Every animated cartoon needs a villain which is where the park superintendent the aptly named Cad Spinner (John Michael Higgins) comes in. Self-aggrandizing and hungry for celebrity Cad has the temerity to siphon off much-needed firefighting funds to refurbish the parks Grand Fusel Lodge. Imagine.Obviously ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" takes both its PG rating and its strong gee-whiz quality quite seriously but its admiration for the real firefighters the film is dedicated to is sincere and deserved. If you ignore the slicker aspects of the dialogue (and with a little effort you mostly can) its satisfying to find a film that is as innocent and as much visual fun as this one is.-------------------------Planes Fire amp; RescueMPAA rating PG for action and some perilRunning time 1 hour 24 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Action (Movie Genre) Planes (movie) Hal Holbrook ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" First Look Pixars Lava Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-planes-fire-rescue-20140718-column.html,200,planesfire&rescue8,planesfire&rescue,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a cheerful simplicity about the animated ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue."" Contrast it with the chaotic clanging ""Transformers"" movie made for a slightly older preteen audience. The high-flying new Disney cartoon has a clearer story more engaging characters more lucid action scenes and jokes that actually raise a smile. The production was overseen by Pixars head honcho John Lasseter and it feels like a junior varsity spinoff of ""Cars."" The characters are anthropomorphic aircraft and automobiles. They have soulful eyes in their windshields and expressive mouths on their lower fuselages. Their designs have a nice balance between whimsy visual appeal and technical accuracy. A young viewer could pick up a lot of information from this film about wing shapes of planes from different eras and the way that the moving and fixed surfaces of the tail steer and stabilize them in flight. The airborne planes sail along with the excitement of a kid on a great skateboard ride. They also demonstrate how changes in balance affect flying behavior and what a pilot must know to correct them. Firefighting techniques are also dramatically demonstrated. The story continues the adventures of Dusty Crophopper (voiced by Dane Cook) hero of last years ""Planes."" The onetime crop duster turned aerial race champ has developed a gearbox problem that sidelines him from high-speed competition. Rather than feeling sorry for himself he joins a crew of vehicles fighting forest fires in a Yosemite-like national park. Here he faces the challenges of a kid fitting in at a new grade school. Theres a tough instructor helicopter (Ed Harris) a flirtatious girl plane (Julie Bowen) a crowd of impulsive all-terrain vehicles and a blustering principal figure in the form of an SUV (John Michael Higgins). Dusty has to practice the firefighting teams challenging maneuvers even though some strain his damaged gearbox near the fatal red line. There are a scattering of inside gags asides and blink-and-you-missed-it details for the parents. The films focus though is pleasing the milk-and-cookies crowd. The story is thrilling and heroic without being bellicose. Dusty is a brave little plane giving his all to protect others from natural perils. He does this with great agility flying through waterfall mists and infernal forest blazes rendered with extravagant beauty. I wouldnt be surprised to see a spike in Air Force enlistments and Fire Department applications about a decade from now. Planes Fire amp; Rescue  out of 4 stars Rating PG for action and some peril. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 835 p.m. EDT July 17 2014Lil Dipper (voiced by Julie Bowen) left is infatuated with Dusty  (Dane Cook) in the animated sequel Planes Fire amp; Rescue.(Photo Disney)The animated world of vehicles and vessels in Planes Fire amp; Rescue lacks vibrancy and strands audiences in a creative wilderness.While Disneys latest film (  out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) features some swell 3-D visuals of soaring over flyover country and vivid shots of forest fires theres little excitement to be had in this ho-hum sequel. With the lackluster quality of its characters -- aircraft a smattering of trucks RVs and motorcycles -- the movie makes Pixars Cars and its sequel look like masterpieces.Following up on 2013s even-less-exhilarating Planes this movie about anthropomorphic machines seems to be aimed at kids younger than 10. The comedy is feeble at best and the story of second chances and courage is barely distinguishable from other well-meaning animated films. Even the derring-do seems strangely out of whack -- the story appears to come to a sudden halt amid montages of rapidly spreading blazes in a forest.USA TODAYExclusive Call on the Planes Fire amp; Rescue squadUSA TODAYBrad Paisley honors dad firefighters in Planes sequelUSA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsMuch of the action takes place at Piston Peak National Park a gorgeous Yellowstone-like wilderness where genial Dusty Crophopper (voiced by Dane Cook) a single-engine prop plane turned racer has gone to train to become a firefighting aircraft.Hobbled by a faltering gearbox part essential for racing Dusty has decided to change careers. Again. He started out as a crop-duster then became a racer and now is determined to fight fires. Ever affable and responsible Dusty is also fueled by an accident he caused and the desire to help a friend. But that nagging equipment failure could also impede his newly chosen career.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare When Dusty learns that his engine is damaged and he may never race again he shifts gears and enters the world of firefighting. He learns what it takes to become a true hero. VPCThe film is achingly earnest which is fine given the intended audience. But occasional jabs at bureaucracy such as a hotel exec who siphons money from firefighters to improve the fancy lodge hes building are sure to whiz miles above youngsters heads. The cynicism of those segments also seems at odds with the films dogged sincerity.The planes look a lot like the motor-mouths in Cars with eyes on their windshields or headlights. But one chopper gets an overt ethnicity Windlifter (Wes Studi) is an Apache helicopter with feathers filling in for rotors. He speaks in aphorisms and recounts legends for which he is often mocked making for an oddly offensive characterization. Why would the filmmakers be so insensitive especially in a story for impressionable kids?USA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesLess troublesome but still odd is the borderline stalker who loves to watch Dusty sleep. The ardor that cheery Lil Dipper (Julie Bowen)feels for Dusty will not be extinguished like the fires they fight. The rest of the movie is an unmemorable collection of one-dimensional characters bad puns (Dusty ""kicks Aston-Martin"") and jarring visuals such as cars motoring around inside a lavish park lodge. Did we mention the U.S. secretary of the Interior is played by a Jeep?Perhaps the highlight is the opening dedication a tribute to those who fight forest fires in real life.Though the final rescue has some well-choreographed drama this sequel would be better suited for direct-to-DVD distribution. Its mishmash of ideas and imagery feels slapdash and uninteresting. 26 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1mlwJrl",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/17/planes-fire-and-rescue-review/11407483/,200,planesfire&rescue11,planesfire&rescue,usatoday

Photo Disney Walt Disney Films Planes Fire amp; Rescue review OK for kids not so hot for parents 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Planes Fire amp; Rescue Animated comedy-adventure. Starring the voices of Dane Cook Ed Harris Julie Bowen and Stacy Keach. Directed by Roberts Gannaway. (PG. 84 minutes.) Four movies and several more short films into the world of ""Cars"" and ""Planes"" cynical adults will continue to ask hard questions. When a ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" character puts an AC/DC album on a record player does this mean that there is an airplane version of the Australian band or is the music left over from the now extinct/annihilated human race? Who lives in the skyscrapers we see in the film? Has anyone explained how the vehicles reproduce? Children who dont think about these things are the clear target audience for ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" an occasionally rousing but mostly just adequate sequel to last years ""Planes."" Disney has fortified its animation reputation in recent years with movies (from ""Frankenweenie"" to ""Frozen"" to the bulk of the Pixar catalog) that were clearly made by filmmakers trying to amuse themselves. These offshoots from the DisneyToon Studios have a different kid-first vibe. Its not a bad vibe. The sequel quickly removes spunky hero Dusty Crophopper from his established past as a racing plane and into the visually pleasing world of aerial firefighting. The isolated forest setting seems to be 75 percent inspired by Yosemite and 20 percent by Arches National Park in Utah with a Yellowstone Park geyser thrown in for fun. Much is made of Dustys celebrity from the previous film and the more humble/noble work of his new comrades. Although there are once again no humans (Are they underground? In a ""Battlestar Galactica""-style spaceship looking for a new home??) the movie serves as a fitting tribute to smokejumpers and other real-life forest service workers. ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" is at its best during the frequent aerial firefighting scenes which have a storybook feel while maintaining a disaster-movie-style momentum. The movie is rated PG but other than a few scenes of planes in peril it will play well with all but the most scare-prone children in the G crowd. The ""Planes"" writing team comes up with another pop culture nod (with a voice acting cameo) as pleasing as the ""Top Gun"" interlude in the first film. There are a few other lines that will elicit adult chuckles many in a country bar scene. The ""pick-up truck"" definitely delivers. The rest of the dialogue is hit and miss with too much sincerity and little attempt at nuance in the plot - which includes an over-the-top bureaucrat and yet another mentor figure for Dusty with a mysterious past. Also worth noting sadly ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" is more reliant on cheap bodily-function humor than anything else in the recent Disney catalog. Coming from a studio that isnt afraid to release animated films that approach two hours ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" ends abruptly at 84 minutes (including an extra-long end-credits sequence that feels a bit like that term paper you wrote with a 14-point font and two-inch margins to fool your professor). Of course that might be a selling point to some parent chaperones. Its not a poor movie. But its definitely a better movie for the kids.

(AP Photo/Disney) HONS This image released by Disney shows character Dusty voiced by Dane Cook in a scene from ""Plans Fire amp; Rescue."" (AP Photo/Disney) You have the right to remain skeptical of a second ""Planes"" cartoon. The first one in which a crop duster voiced by grating goofball Dane Cook races around the world was a nose-diving knock-off of ""Cars 2"" the first mediocre movie that Pixar ever produced. ""Planes"" like the sequel ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" was from the drones at Disney not the perfectionists at Pixar so the script was a formulaic underdog story that sprayed pesticides on the poor grown-ups who accompanied their kids to the theater.But Disney honcho John Lasseter is a proud Pixar alumnus and he has instructed ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" to do a loop-de-loop landing safely on the American byways that were so beautifully illustrated in the original ""Cars."" With Cook easing up on the throttle this brief flight is a breeze.In the small town of Propwash Junction Dusty Crophopper (Cook) is training to defend his plane-racing championship when he suffers a mechanical malfunction. The bad news is that hes got a worn-out gearbox that cant be fixed let alone pushed beyond the limits in a race. The good news is that theres a heroic alternative for daredevil planes fighting fires in Piston Peak National Park. Like almost every contemporary cartoon this is a story about a hot-shot rookie butting heads with a gruff old mentor (Ed Harris recycling the roles played by Stacy Keach in ""Planes"" and Paul Newman in ""Cars"") and theres the usual subplot about a local cutie (Julie Bowen) batting her big windshield-mounted eyes at the newcomer. While Disney still cant crack the code that makes Pixars characters and scripts so special the parent company has access to some of the same technology. Visually the ""Planes"" sequel is one giant leap for mouse-kind. The national-park scenery is wonderfully detailed and Dustys slow-rolling glides over the landscape are awesome especially in 3-D. Theres action too as the planes swoop over a lake to scoop up water and drop it on a forest fire before it destroys the parks luxury lodge.Without the kindling of character development ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" is no smoldering success but if Disneys flight plan is to share Pixars airspace its getting warmer.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet John Lasseter has officially taken his Henry Ford fetish too far. The Pixar honcho a car nut who became head of Disney animation a few years ago has converted one of his pet properties ""the world of Cars"" into an assembly line. At his command an efficient workforce of writers directors animators voice actors and marketing whizzes toil away on franchise continuations passing the product forward until its ready for consumption. There are few visible traces of human craftsmanship on their latest model Planes Fire amp; Rescue a sequel to last summers equally anonymous Planes which itself was a spin-off of Cars and its sequel. The film swipes parts from all of those movies sprays them down with a fresh coat of paint and calls the whole thing something new. Its nice to look at easy to watch and impossible to remember for the length of a car-ride home. If its a hit there will be another version of it a couple summers from now.Disney to be fair has been a well-oiled sequel machine for ages--at least since it started churning out straight-to-video follow-ups to its biggest hits. Planes in fact was originally conceived for DVD and Blu-ray only but got the theatrical promotion once the suits caught a glimpse of its ready-for-multiplexes animation. Only the shiny paint job disguises the franchises quickie cash-grab roots. Fire amp; Rescue like its predecessor is plotted with all the care of something meant to play in the background while the kids get ready for school. In what viewers may choose to read as an ironic wink to the projects faulty engineering the new story commences with a sputtering engine. Dusty Crophopper the anthropomorphized aircraft voiced by Dane Cook has to put his racing career on hold because of a malfunction with his gearbox. (Yes the cars of the Cars universe are both living breathing organisms and machines that require working parts. Just go with it.) After causing an airport blaze and nearly costing the local fire engine his job Dusty agrees to get certified in aerial firefighting--a process that relocates him to a national park where he has to prove himself again to a new group of naysayers. Its typical sequel strategizing Knock the hero back down to Earth so that he reverts to underdog status ready to rise from rock bottom to triumphant new heights. Getting down to brass tacks Fire amp; Rescue is a marginally better movie than the original Planes. There are fewer nattering sidekicks and fewer ethnic stereotypes. (Though Windlifter a helicopter voiced by Cherokee actor Wes Studi fills that unfortunate quota.) And the narrative which eventually builds to a massive wildfire allows for some faintly apocalyptic imagery--a raging inferno that proves again how much the animators keep these projects from crashing and burning. But only by comparison does Fire amp; Rescue soar. Its characters are still forgettable and one-note its voice-acting is still undistinguished and its jokes are still corny groaners. Especially desperate are the Dreamworks-grade appeals to the chaperone crowd as when these creepy living vehicles brag of having ""kicked Aston Martin"" or declare ""Aw Chevy"" at their bad luck. Meanwhile a split-second cameo by ""Boat Reynolds"" only raises further questions about the series truly baffling world. If theres a Boat Reynolds does that also mean theres a seacraft version of Boogie Nights? Wake us up for that spin-off.

But it doesnt take much imagination to realize that to lots of 6-year-olds Planes Fire amp; Rescue is pretty much the coolest movie ever. Talking aircraft and aerial fire-fighting? Come on. At the beginning of this sequel to last years Planes Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) the crop duster-turned-air-racing celebrity learns his gearbox is damaged and the replacement parts he needs to keep up his high-speed showmanship may not exist. For a career change he joins a forest-fire rescue team which includes battle-battered veteran Blade Ranger (Ed Harris) spiritual heavy-duty copter Windlifter (Wes Studi) and air tanker Lil Dipper (Julie Bowen). Despite somewhat of a direct-to-DVD plot the perilous and elaborate rescue scenes are certainly big-screen-worthy. Canny references to 70s television and some genuinely funny moments will give grown-ups enough fuel to cross the finish line.

Photo Disney Enterprises MOVIE REVIEW Planes Fire amp; Rescue Running time 84 minutes. Rated PG (some slightly scary situations). At the E-Walk Lincoln Square others. This Disney sequel to 2013s ""Planes"" is a lot like flying coach serviceable but not trying that hard. In ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" crop-duster turned racing star Dusty (Dane Cook) plagued by aging equipment finds himself looking for a slower line of work. The answer comes when his home airport is busted for its firetruck (Hal Holbrook) being outdated and in need of a second firefighter. Ed Harris voices Blade Ranger in the film.Photo Disney Enterprises Dusty leaves his pals and heads to the Yosemite-like Piston Peak to train with a new crew headed by Ed Harris as Blade a cop-show star turned ranger and his colleague Lil Dipper (Julie Bowen) whos fairly amusing as a stalker-level fan of Dusty and puts the moves on him immediately ""Yep theyre real"" she boasts when she puts down her landing gear. Much of the movie per its title consists of Dusty amp; co. putting out fires and rescuing other machines. Its generic stuff unless youre a kid whos really into playing with toy planes and trains and cars. Then Ill bet it provides you with some new story fodder and a whole arsenal of toys to demand from your parents. Well played Disney. Shameless but well played. Every now and then director Roberts Gannaway (""Secret of the Wings"") will throw a bone to the grown-ups such as the scene in the local dive-bar hangar. ""She left me for a hybrid"" groans one auto throwing back a can of oil. ""Didnt even hear him coming."" A pickup truck makes the ladies roll their eyes with his terrible opening lines. Dusty Crophopper is voiced by Dane Cook.Photo Disney Enterprises Later a character named Boat Reynolds makes an appearance at a gala ""I loved you in Best Little Boathouse in Texas "" someone yells. And the sequence in which the Piston Peak team first gears up to fight fire is set to AC/DCs ""Thunderstruck"" -- meaningless for the under-10 set but a rocking throwback for us olds. Ultimately though this isnt about us and ""Fire amp; Rescue"" doesnt make any pretense that it is. I could go on about how its a little depressing that Disney has taken a respectable-if-not-brilliant Pixar movie (""Cars"") and spun it off into other films of diminishing quality but I think that ship has sailed. Come to think of it guys theres an idea for your next transportation-themed cash grab.

Deep into Planes Fire amp; Rescue a time-killing kid-flick whose title is an exact summary of its plot the filmmakers introduce us to two creaky old Winnebagos a husband and wife in their sunset years revisiting the national park where they shared their first kiss years before. Theyre warmly loving immediately likable throwbacks to the Pixar films of once upon a time the ones that indulged in niceties like theme and feeling and whatever is the opposite of pointlessness. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - They meet some planes. After that theres a fire. And a rescue. And lots of static TV-quality scenes that drably cut from one car or plane to another as they sit in garages and discuss the importance of believing in yourself. But none of thats as interesting as the questions suggested by the idea of motor homes feeling nostalgic for the way they used to make out. A first kiss suggests that there were later ones that steel-and-plastic RVs not only possess lips and tongues but also the nerve endings that stir sensations of pleasure. When two Winnebagos love each other very much how far do they go? At his advanced age is the husband still capable of working a stick -- or have he and the wife settled for some kind of automatic transmission?Previous films have established that these cars and planes come from factories so vehicular marriage must be about love rather than procreation. Thats sweetly egalitarian. The idea of cars trucks helicopters and airplanes flush with erotic feeling deserves a more serious film than this one. Not since the hot fueling action of Dr. Strangelove has it been fruitfully examined although bored parents trying to get through a matinee might enjoy teasing out the nuances How intimate is it for a truck to tow a car? When Dusty (Dane Cook) a crop duster turned race plane turned firefighter discovers that his old gearbox is giving way and that he can never penetrate the heavens the way he used to are we supposed to think about the prostate?The film directed by Roberts Gannaway feels self-generated as if maybe as they made Cars Pixar was training an artificial intelligence to run infinite variations on the formula. Now plots spill forth from that AI like soft-serve from a spigot This time to save an old firetrucks job broken-gearboxed Dusty zips off to fight wildfires at Piston Peak with a helicopter that once starred on a chopper-themed version of the TV show CHiPS. Dustys mission is to become a fully accredited firefighter by the time of his hometowns Corn Festival one of those details that suggests no human brain was involved Why would cars/trucks/planes celebrate corn? Has someone finally made ethanol work?Its difficult to describe anything that happens in Planes Fire and Rescue without skidding out on some quandary about just what rules are meant to govern the Cars/Planes universe. So lets not dwell on what happens in the movie Theres a fire theres some farting and Dustys cheerily obsessive new love interest Dipper (Julie Bowen) is copy-pasted from the Internets ""Overly Attached Girlfriend"" meme. Instead here are some of its most curious revelations  Cars sometimes board a train to take them places.  There is still a U.S. government and it has appointed a jeep-like vehicle as secretary of the interior.  That government funds a robust National Park Service dedicated to preserving lands for the enjoyment of cars/trucks/planes.  Being a car is no impediment to landing a job as a park ranger.  Helicopter firefighter Blade Ranger (Ed Harris) sees his job as ""saving peoples lives."" Who are these people?  Windjammer (Wes Studi) an Apache helicopter speaks in a broad Native American accent and fireside tells a confounding legend about coyotes and a car that ate its own tires. The insensitivity of the stereotype aside does this mean that at some point in Cars/Planes history a bunch of imports chased the native vehicles off their own land?Like the previous Cars and Planes pictures this movie is much more edifying to think about than it is to watch. (The final rescue is impressive but its not enough to justify the rest.) Still this is the one kidd-o entertainment franchise that I hope a couple decades from now gets the grim reboot treatment How will the cars trucks and planes handle it when they discover that their emissions have destroyed the world their government hires park rangers to preserve?

But his gearbox is giving out. His fuselage is failing. It might be time to come up with lifes Plan B. Thats the start of Disneys new kids cartoon ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" and its a strangely different one. Most childrens movies preach the California gospel of self-esteem a contradictory creed (everyones the same everyone is special) built on one all-empowering commandment Believe in yourself. But in ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" even Dustys confidence cant overcome a body thats giving out and a career that may be quickly winding down. Its time to re-assess re-invent -- and either forge a new path or get out of the way. Is Disney making films for five-year-olds or the downsized 50-year-olds sitting next to them? Of course its not as if the studios suddenly channeling Arthur Miller here -- this is not ""Death of a Cessna"" full of anger and angst. But Dustys disappointments are certainly a break from the usual particularly in a series aimed at the tiniest tots. At least this films a marked improvement on last years ""Planes"" which borrowed some plotlines from the equally flat ""Cars"" added tired pop-culture references and stereotypes and at 92 surprisingly long minutes had you soon wishing for in-flight beverage service. This sequel thankfully is faster paced and has more action as -- beginning this new chapter in his life -- Dusty flies off to the Western wilderness to train as a firefighter where hell join a variety of flying machines in stopping blazes. Its a plot twist the film takes seriously with several characters in real jeopardy and a forest inferno that looks back to ""Bambi."" (Although sometime the film takes itself too seriously -- an introductory dedication to fallen firefighters feels like a bit much for a movie that is after all about talking planes.) Apart from the extra action though the movie has the same problems as the rest of the ""Planes"" franchise (as did the ""Cars"" series that inspired it). The character design with those giant googly-eye windshields is simply ugly. And the anthropomorphized all-vehicle universe can be a little jarring (I get the honeymooning trucks but four-wheel cows?) Dane Cook is fine as Dusty (its amazing how vocal performances dispense with the negative baggage some visual ones can carry) and Ed Harris is properly crusty as his firefighting instructor although theres not much to the other characters. (Except for a ditsy star-struck female plane Lil Dipper whos annoying.) There are enough silly jokes and simple excitement here however to keep the youngest ones interested and a few mild puns (""You bet your Aston-Martin"") to occasionally make the adults smile. That is the ones who arent like Dusty sitting there preoccupied with the turbulence ahead in their own lives -- even as the film fights its own headwinds to find a happy ending. Ratings note The film contains some very mild bathroom humor and some scenes of peril. Planes Fire and Rescue (PG) Disney (83 min.) Directed by Robert Gannaway. With the voices of Dane Cook Ed Harris.

After making a tin-eared debut with last years ""Planes"" an earthbound pileup of lame jokes and ethnic caricatures Disneys ""Cars"" spinoff franchise gets a bit higher off the ground with ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue."" Largely ditching the funny accents in favor of an earnest but emotionally effective salute to the everyday heroism of Americas firefighters this formulaic small-fry entertainment still doesnt possess the story smarts to justify a bigscreen upgrade for a property that was conceived with home formats in mind. Nonetheless there are honestly stirring moments to be found in the movies heartfelt tribute to the virtues of teamwork courage and sacrifice and in its soaring 3D visuals. Box office returns should land in the vicinity of the first pics 219 million worldwide haul; merchandising revenue and other ancillary streams look as unstoppable as ever. Having realized his dreams of stardom on the international racing circuit in the first film Dusty Crophopper (again voiced by Dane Cook) a single-propeller plane who resembles a 50/50 bar with wings is literally flying high when ""Fire amp; Rescue"" opens. But after he experiences some engine trouble during a routine test flight his four-wheeled mechanic friend Dottie (Teri Hatcher) peeks under the hood and offers a grim diagnosis Dustys gearbox is practically kaput and with no chance of repairing or replacing it (the part is so old its no longer in production) his racing days are effectively over. When a fire accidentally breaks out at their airport Dusty and friends look to Mayday (Hal Holbrook) a wheezy old fire truck whose faltering equipment makes it harder to extinguish the blaze than it should be. When the airport is subsequently shut down due to non-compliance with safety regulations Dusty is inspired to do his part to help save the day -- and find a second-chance career alternative to racing -- by joining an elite squad of aerial firefighters. Together these brave flyers are tasked with protecting the beautiful and historic Piston Peak National Park during wildfire season. The character dynamics are familiar but effective In addition to dodging the amorous attentions of one of his teammates a starstruck air tanker named Dipper (Julie Bowen) Dusty must accept the demanding leadership of Blade Ranger (Ed Harris the go-to actor for telling you how it is) a surly helicopter whos not convinced the new celebrity in their midst has what it takes to be a great firefighter. And so like ""Planes"" and the ""Cars"" movies before it ""Fire amp; Rescue"" becomes a sly riff on sports-movie conventions as Dusty must learn not just the most strategic way to drop a tankful of bright pink flame retardant (the visual detail here is especially lustrous) but also the importance of swallowing his pride accepting his limitations and working as a team when lives are at stake. Those lives of course belong not to humans but to machines -- whether theyre cars fleeing en masse from a soon-to-be-burned-down hotel (called the Grand Fusel Lodge natch) or a pair of lovelorn RVs who find themselves trapped on a burning suspension bridge the site of a long-ago romantic date. This surreal style of auto anthropomorphism will remain for many a bizarre and troubling existential riddle the stumbling block that prevents full surrender to this clearly man-made yet completely man-free vehicular universe. By this point anyone still paying attention to the ""Cars"" and ""Planes"" movies would probably do well to set any lingering reservations aside and accept this cartoon world on its own nonsensical terms even if the extreme borderline-obsessive realism with which it has been conceived and designed is what often makes it difficult to do just that. In writing their script director Bobs Gannaway (a longtime Disney TV helmer making his feature debut) and returning ""Planes"" scribe Jeffrey M. Howard were inspired by the fact that crop dusters were in fact used in wildfire air attacks -- a historical snippet that establishes a foundation of verisimilitude for the pictures impressively staged setpieces. The animation here is nearly flawless in its detailed rendering of a woodland setting from the shadows that creep up on a forest at sunset to the way a river churns and surges its way around sharp rocks. Most impressive of all is the fire beautifully realized by the f/x team in a production that makes more extensive and visually sophisticated use of said element than any previous animated feature. A sequence in which Dusty and friends fly through a cloud of smoke and ash directly into the path of a fire that has consumed an entire valley is a marvel to behold fully matched in its subtle intensity by the atmospheric crackle of Todd Toons sound design. If the stunning Yellowstone/Yosemite-style backdrops and Mark Mancinas supportive score (supplemented by songs from country star Brad Paisley and Spencer Lee) give ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" a classic American feel that harks back to the first ""Cars"" movie then the elemental simplicity of the conflict here (plane vs. nature) lends it a surprising measure of dramatic accessibility. Watching sentient hunks of metal race each other and exchange wisecracks can get tiresome pretty quickly but seeing them perform selfless acts of great individual and collective bravery can be unexpectedly ridiculously moving particularly when the stakes are so harrowingly realized. Theres more than a flicker of subtext here about death and mortality particularly with regard to Maydays sense of having outlived his usefulness which only makes the tacked-on happy ending ring all the more false. Until that contrived resolution ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" is a slight but improbably successful example of a movie that despite its profusion of chrome and steel somehow succeeds in touching something human.

And I am going to slap the next person that calls Planes a childs film; look dude I am a grown adult and the Pixar Cars and planes movies are two of my favorites. Great action roll-in-the-floor humor awesome voice cast beautiful animation touching story great soundtrack and coll cars and planes. Reply Mark says July 4 2014 at 518 pm Its a dreadful film. The direction is worse than even the first one which was truly awful. And whoever produced this crap is an embarrassment. For a film made in china its worse than youd expect.

TWITTER Dane Cook Ed Harris and Julie Bowen lead the voice cast for Disneys latest animated feature. Planes along with trains automobiles ships motorcycles --almost any vehicle -- are about the most photogenic inanimate objects you can feature in a movie but thats about all the new Disney toon Planes Fire amp; Rescue has going for it. Beautiful to look at this is nothing more than a Little Engine That Could story refitted to accommodate aerial action and therefore unlikely to engage the active interest of anyone above the age of about 8 or 10 at the most. As always the Disney name guarantees a certain level of automatic box office but the audience here is strictly small-fries and their parents. Set in an America that feels not disagreeably like the one Uncle Walt thrived in this is a story of second-chancers older planes and other machines that having outlived their original usefulness are put to work as firefighters in Piston Peak National Park which resembles a glorious combination of the most scenic aspects of the Wests marquee wilderness areas. PHOTOS Maleficent Inside the Costumes of Angelina Jolies Disney Villain Dusty Crophopper is a vintage gumption-driven single-engine prop plane accustomed to winning air races that involve buzzing around pylons -- which makes for some nifty 3D shots -- until his gear box comes apart in a warm-up for the years big event at the fabled Corn Fest. Told that hell have to keep his torque way down from now on -- which is like instructing Steve McQueen to drive his Mustang at no more than 25 mph -- a demoralized Dusty is farmed out to the sleepy HQ of the Piston Peak Air Attack team an over-the-hill gang that includes sage no-nonsense leader Blade Ranger peppy female air tanker Lil Dipper heavy-load chopper Windlifter and folksy vintage fire truck Mayday who does more than anyone to convince Dusty to embrace his new calling. The whole approach of director Bobs Gannaway and his co-writer Jeffrey M. Howard is achingly sincere in a dag-nabbit golly-gee sort of way entirely lacking the machine-gun wit and wisecracks of the new generation of animated features pioneered by executive producer John Lasseter. Other than for the vivid scenic backdrops and ultrarealistic fire effects this is a film that with its ""You can do it boy"" thematic thrust could have been made in the 1950s. Nothing wrong with a little inspirational message but old evergreens need more sprucing up than they get here. PHOTOS Brrrrrrr Disneys Frozen and 19 Other Wintry Movies Inevitably a terrible wildfire breaks out that threatens a gorgeous old lodge full of tourists and the closest thing to a villain in this story is a hotel executive visually represented by a luxury SUV who tries to convince the endangered automotive guests that theres nothing to worry about. To help save the day Dusty is naturally obliged to push his torque way past safe limit but there can be no doubt about how it all turns out. Akin to the visual approach in the Cars features the planes are anthropomorphized with eyes on their windscreens and mouths in vent space beneath the propellers. The vocal performances are good within the prevailing buck-up and gee-whiz attitudinal constraints with Ed Harris providing reassuring perspicacity as the seen-it-all old pro and Hal Holbrook infusing his lines with a winningly weary warmth. While Fire amp; Rescue clocks in at 84 minutes the action ends after 76 minutes with the remainder or close to 10 percent of the total running time devoted to very slowly scrolled end credits.
