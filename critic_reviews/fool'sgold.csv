The lure of Matthew McConaughey shirtless for extended stretches doubtless has some marketing value but after that ""Fools Gold"" offers small compensation -- a listless romantic comedy that almost out of desperation turns a little more violent than necessary near the end. Treasure hunting has certainly worked for the ""National Treasure"" franchise"" and an earlier McConaughey-Kate Hudson pairing enjoyed some success. Still after however many doubloons can be hauled up from the utterly review-proof its hard to envision Warner Bros. separating too many fools from their money. Reuniting the stars of ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" in a more adventurous setting surely sounded promising but in the hands of ""Hitch"" director Andy Tennant and his screenwriting collaborators Daniel Zelman and John Claflin they find themselves up the proverbial creek without a paddle. At times the pic feels like a comedic version of ""The Deep"" only without the comedy. McConaughey plays treasure seeker Finn obsessed with a Spanish galleon loaded with treasure lost off the Florida coast (as played here by Australia) in 1715. His frenzied pursuit of said riches has cost him his wife Tess (Hudson) who is divorcing Finn for having ""no clue how to behave like a responsible adult."" Its just then naturally that Finn actually finds a clue pointing toward the treasure which hes chasing with the patronage of a wealthy rapper-thug unfortunately named Bigg Bunny (comic Kevin Hart put to very poor use). Tess meanwhile has taken a job aboard a luxury yacht working for the wealthy Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland channeling Ronald Colman). After some finagling by Finn Nigel agrees to finance an expedition for the loot mostly as a way to entertain his visiting daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena of ABCs ""Invasion"") a pampered heiress and complete airhead. Aside from the central couples painfully flat banter and bickering the movies only real recurring gag is that Finn keeps getting whacked in the head with blunt instruments -- yielding wounds not to be a stickler about continuity that magically heal as if he were ""X-Mens"" Wolverine. Ray Winstone also pops up as a rival treasure hunter and Finns former mentor but this subplot is so underdeveloped as to foster suspicions that sequences were left on the cutting-room floor -- hard as that is to believe given the sluggish pace. When the action does pick up near the climax its too late to redeem whats already transpired and a bit grittier than it should be tonally as if weve detoured into a different movie. Nor is the missing-treasure riddle intriguing enough to sustain interest though beyond the fauna displayed the well-shot tropical scenery might be a balm to some coming as it does in the dead of winter. The point clearly is for Finn to woo Tess back along their shared journey but despite the scripts contrivances theres not much chemistry between them. Indeed the only real energy comes from Dzienas bubbly dim-bulb. Granted thats a rather tired image but as Finn demonstrates during one skirmish with Bunnys henchmen a drowning man -- or even just one dispatched on a ""Fools"" errand -- cant be too choosy when grasping for lifelines.

Equally broke Hudsons Tess now works as a deckhand for Donald Sutherlands frightfully English billionaire Nigel Honeycutt currently holidaying with his dim daughter aboard his super yacht. Having lost his (and Tesss) boat to the sea in the opening credits opportunist Finn sees a chance to rope in some help and contrives a meeting with Honeycutt who warms to Finns salty charms. But just as the treasure hunt resumes caricatured gangster Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) gets wind of it all and throws a large spanner into the works...Weve all seen this kind of scenario in umpteen treasure trovers yet what makes Fools Gold at least vaguely watchable is the presence of Hudson who shares many of her mother Goldie Hawns more likeable comedic skills. Its the badly timed pratfalls that bother most aside from one laugh-out-loud moment involving Hudson thwacking McConaughey across the head with a borrowed walking stick they are almost universally insipid. Yes the formulaic script is often laughable and overly convoluted; yes it takes a while to adjust to Sutherlands Blighty accent; and yes Ray Winstone is badly miscast as a Yank. But for some unfathomable reason I succumbed to the very occasional charms of this fair good-natured romcom adventure and left the screening in quite a good mood.

"Fools Gold Brassy flick | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFools Gold Brassy flick Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson possess two of the brightest smiles in all of Hollywood.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 8 2008(out of 4)Starring Matthew McConaughey Kate Hudson Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena. Directed by Andy Tennant. 90 minutes. At major theatres. PGMatthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson possess two of the brightest smiles in all of Hollywood.The combined wattage of their pearlies plus the pairs undeniable personal chemistry kept audiences grinning through the unremarkable 2003 date movie How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.How then do we explain the curious lack of electricity in their reteaming five years later for Fools Gold a romantic comedy that possesses little heart and even less mirth? Article Continued BelowIts not a complete power failure but its close. Fools Gold should have been a date-night no-brainer. Remove McConaugheys shirt slide Hudson into a swimsuit place them in a sunny locale (Florida as played by Australia) and let the sexy banter and calypso music fly.Whats not to like especially with snow on the ground and Valentines Day on the horizon?But as the captain of the Titanic could have told you even sure things have a way of sinking.Director Andy Tennant (Hitch) and his co-screenwriters Daniel Zelman and John Claflin found a way to make comedy without laughs and drama without tension.They even managed to make McConaughey and Hudson look all wrong for each other. We have no trouble at all understanding why Hudsons brittle careerist Tess is so eager to divorce McConaugheys beach bum Finn at the top of the movie. (Anyone remember when McConaughey used to play serious roles?)Tess is fed up with Finns lack of responsibility (""Your uselessness is epic"") and shes no longer going to assist or fund his eight-year quest to find a Spanish galleon loaded with gold that sank off the coast of Florida in 1715. Her resolve stiffens when she discovers hes managed to lose the family love boat last seen going stern up in a prologue that is among the films few amusing moments.The only thing these two have in common now is a fond memory of a sexual technique referenced in a gag that is flogged so mercilessly if it were a horse the animal cruelty people would be summoned.Finn always seems to find a way get his way and this leads him to the luxury yacht of billionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) who is idly killing time while waiting for his jet-setting dim-bulb daughter Gemma (a very game Alexis Dziena) to finish her latest shopping expedition.For reasons too tedious to mention Tess and Finn both end up aboard Nigels yacht and they set out squabbling to find the treasure that Finn is now convinced he can locate.But Finn forgot to watch out for sharks (the human kind). His treasure hunt is being stalked by a stooges gallery of bad guys led by a rich rapper named Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) who is neither big nor cuddly. Nor is he the least bit frightening - a much bigger problem.Bunnys cronies include a thug played by Britains Ray Winstone a role remarkable for two things (a) it could be the most inconsequential of Winstones career; and (b) he uses a terrible Southern accent.Incredibly its neither the most inconsequential role nor the most terrible accent in Fools Gold. Those honours go to Ewen Bremner a Scot who plays Finns Ukrainian sidekick. Why Ukrainian? Who cares? Bremners Alfonz is an early candidate for the Most Useless Film Character of 2008.Speaking of bad accents why have Sutherland attempt a British one? It spoils an otherwise genial performance by the 72-year-old Canuck actor who was probably delighted to winter in sunny Australia even if he does live in L.A.

Pictures romantic comedy adventure ""Fools Gold."" (Warner Bros. Pictures/MCT) 1054139 Movie review""Fools Gold"" with Matthew McConaughey Kate Hudson Donald Sutherland Alexis Dziena Ray Winstone Kevin Hart. Directed by Andy Tennant from a screenplay by John Claflin Daniel Zelman and Tennant. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for action violence some sexual material brief nudity and language. Several theaters. Do I really need to write a review of ""Fools Gold"" or would it suffice just to write a haiku about Matthew McConaugheys chest? On second thought perhaps ""overexposed"" has too many syllables. The Chest which long ago usurped the rest of McConaugheys body and launched a career of its own is in fine form in this witless romantic comedy/adventure; unfortunately nothing else is. McConaughey employing his usual affable dudeness is Finnegan an unemployed fellow obsessed with finding a cache of 18th-century treasure lost in the sea off Key West. Kate Hudson smiling gamely is Tess his soon-to-be ex-wife whos working as a steward on a yacht owned by a millionaire (Donald Sutherland hamming it up with a bizarro British accent) with a dimbulb socialite daughter (Alexis Dziena) and ... Oh for heavens sake. You know how this storys going to play out. And if in the midst of a gray Seattle winter you really want to watch a gang of attractively tanned people frolic in the sun and model an impressive variety of swimwear (including for Dziena a high-concept bikini with suspenders that makes her look like a junior Bond Girl) far be it for me to stand in your way. Be warned however that this is the sort of movie in which McConaughey gets hit on the head a lot (not that it seems to matter; Finns pretty clueless even before he gets bopped) Hudson gets stuck being the sensible one who explains all the back story Dziena mostly stands around smiling with her entire body and nobody ever gets sunburned. I kept hoping that Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow might show up to challenge Finn for the treasure and share a bottle of rum and some eyeliner with Tess but no such luck. This movie feels very generic and very very long; after its over you might need a little sunscreen for your brain.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Vince Valitutti)  NO ... more Photo Vince Valitutti Review Searching for booty in Fools Gold 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Fools Gold Romantic comedy. Starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by Andy Tennant. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The funniest thing in ""Fools Gold"" wasnt intended to be funny. It comes a third of the way in and its the scene in which Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson tell about the shipwreck of a treasure-bearing Spanish vessel hundreds of years ago. This is the scene in which they more or less give you the story - the story thats supposed to fascinate and enthrall you. But the story they tell is so intricate so convoluted and so full of various character names that it becomes impossible to follow. The funny part is that at a certain point they look as if they have no idea what theyre saying too. And Donald Sutherland who plays the rich man who might bankroll their expedition looks as if he cant follow it either. They all have that funny look youve seen before a look similar to the one actors get when theyre playing scientific geniuses and have to discuss their discoveries Their smiles are fixed the eyes are frozen and theyre white-knuckling it through the close-ups. Theyre bluffing and theyre miserable about it. But then why should they have it any easier than the audience? ""Fools Gold"" is a romantic comedy and an adventure story but in this case that just means it bombs in two distinct ways. It presents us with a photogenic but estranged couple and invites us to want them to get back together. And it shows the two of them collaborating in the search for ancient treasure. But from the opening credits to the unsatisfying finish it remains a matter of profound indifference whether these people ever find love or wealth. Good for them if they do but it would be no more pleasing than reading about strangers winning the lottery. McConaughey and Hudson previously teamed in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" which had a funny setup and gave them a chance to work their charms. McConaughey is a charismatic actor but in ""Fools Gold"" he plays a total washout with big plans and a line of patter but nothing much going for him. Essentially hes the comic character but hes much better at reacting than being zany while Hudson spends most of the movie looking worried when shes potentially the more bubbly and skilled comic personality. When a movie is this bad (and it is - this one seems an hour longer than its actual running time) the way to make it bearable is to find something anything interesting happening on screen. I found it in watching Hudsons use of herself - of her eyes and her mouth as instruments of comic timing and information. As she gets older shes still only 28 Hudson gets more generic looking losing the radiance of extreme youth and becoming pretty in a nondescript sort of way. But then a lot of comedian faces are nondescript in repose. The important thing is that Hudsons confidence remains and her comic facility is improving and if somebody would ever write her a decent script she might actually make a good movie. For McConaughey he is too handsome to hide it so its best when he plays someone whos about more than his looks. But ""Fools Gold"" presents him in a beefcake-goofball role in which he goes through most of the movie with his shirt off. He looks great but in the end the role is no more flattering to him than a bimbo role would be for Scarlett Johansson or Katherine Heigl. By playing up the most obvious aspect of his allure the movie diminishes him. It diminishes everybody. Even Donald Sutherland looks dazed and awkward in the sentimental role of a lonely multimillionaire. The movie moves back and forth from light farce to disturbing violence introducing a gangsta rapper character - played by 50 Cent look-alike Kevin Hart - who goes through the movie trying to kill the McConaughey character. After about an hour I began to see his point. -- Advisory Sexual situations sexual innuendo and violence. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

Too bad they couldnt fit ""50 Ways To Show Matthew Mc- Conaughey Shirtless"" on a theater marquee. Mr. Perfect Abs shows off a lot more skin than co-star Kate Hudson who looks very uncomfortable in her single bikini scene. She seems unhappy in general again playing straight woman to Hollywoods favorite male bimbo - their first pairing 2003s ""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" while forgettable was more tolerable. This time around she plays Tess who has just divorced her irresponsible dimwitted hubby Finn (McConaughey) when she learns hes discovered the whereabouts of a treasure theyve been seeking for a decade. Actually she and we learn at tedious length about the treasure called the Queens Dowry with several eyeball-glazing scenes devoted to repeating information imparted after the opening credits presumably for the benefit of audience members who cant read. Its all basically an excuse to show off the scenery which includes not only Mr. McConaugheys well-toned body but a younger actress (Alexis Dziena) whose role seems to exist only for her to loll around in a bikini in Hudsons stead. Theres also the Caribbean adequately impersonated by Australias Gold Coast. But the entire enterprise is sunk by a combination of listless direction by Andy Tennant (""Hitch"") who drags out perhaps 70 minutes worth of plot into a waterlogged mess than feels like three hours. Not to mention the meandering script attributed to Tennant and two screenwriters for ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid."" The whole thing is symbolized by a ridiculous scene in which McConaughey - topless of course - hops along the bottom of the ocean while carrying an anchor. His Finn also gets hit over the head by various objects by Hudsons Tess - when she isnt praising his prowess in the bedroom in the most tedious of the flicks many unfunny running gags. These include a gangster (Kevin Hart) named no kidding Bigg Bunny who is also after the treasure. Hart fares no better than usually reliable British actor Ray Winstone sporting a dubious Southern accent as another treasure hunter. Also enjoying an Australian vacation is Donald Sutherland as a demi- billionaire and Tess current employer whose daughter the principal bikini wearer briefly flirts with Finn. ""Fools Gold"" never flirts with reality as it slowly winds its way to a surprisingly bloody climax thats as ludicrous as it is convoluted. At least costume designer Ngila Dickson didnt have to work too hard on McConaugheys wardrobe. FOOLS GOLD Topless jerk in mindless flick. Running time 112 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (action violence sexual innuendo brief nudity profanity).

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 1136 AM FOOLS GOLD. Romantic comedy about divorced treasure hunters forced to work together. With Matthew McConaughey Kate Hudson. Director Andy Tennant (152). PG-13 Nudity sexuality violence language. At area theaters. Just how long will it be before Matthew McConaughey finally fulfills his destiny by dropping out of Hollywood and opening a chain of nudist colonies? His heart clearly isnt in acting right now so when it was time to make ""Fools Gold"" he asked his abs to do the job for him.Having apparently signed on for the chance to score a killer tan McConaughey ambles his way through the role of Finn an easygoing treasure diver living in the Caribbean. Unfortunately hes a little too easygoing for his wife Tess (Kate Hudson) so the movie begins with their divorce. A ship steward for billionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) Tess intends to sail far away as soon as the legal proceedings are over. Finn however has other ideas. Having infuriated the rapper (Kevin Hart) financing his latest quest he needs a new infusion of cash fast. To Tess annoyance the ink is barely dry on their divorce papers before Finn is onboard her boss boat talking him and his spoiled daughter (Alexis Dziena) into a sizable donation. Its not easy to make a treasure hunt boring but any sense of adventure is buried under endless speeches about the 18th-century Spanish shipwreck Finn plans to find. And when the characters finally stop talking theyre forced into silly slapstick fights with other divers none of whom is remotely memorable. Actually nothing about the movie is memorable unless you happen to be McConaugheys undoubtedly proud personal trainer. Stuck with a soggy script director Andy Tennant goes overboard finding ways to keep his star shirtless while assuming that wacky music crazy accents and the mere presence of flamboyantly gay characters are enough to keep his comedy afloat. The setting is gorgeous and a very likable Hudson does work harder than her co-star. But theres little chemistry between them despite the box office alchemy of their last movie ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" As for Sutherland his boredom couldnt be more obvious. Or maybe hes just annoyed that no one asked him to take his clothes off. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

A treasure-hunting comic romance set in the Florida Keys its sunshiney enough to correct your midwinter vitamin D deficiency and very easy on the eyes. But you could find a more intellectually stimulating plot on the Golf Channel. When the lovably daffy Kate Hudson is cast as the storys deepest thinker expectations must be lowered. Hudson a multilingual history scholar married immature treasure diver Matthew McConaughey after a spring break fling that turned into a passionate but aggravating romance. ""You married a guy for sex and you expect him to be smart?"" marvels her lawyer at the inevitable divorce hearing. The dauntingly buff McConaughey looking as though he drinks a brew of Bovine Growth Hormone and Hawaiian Tropic wants her back. The prospect of locating a sunken Spanish treasure boat reunites them. Think ""National Treasure"" but with more romantic bickering and less clothing. The upshot is often silly rarely funny. Hudson works aboard the yacht of a megamillionaire (Donald Sutherland) whose riches have been unable to buy him a convincing upper-class English accent. His featherbrained daughter Alexis Dzenia who may as well have ""romantic rival"" stenciled on her forehead gets the best of the scripts slim pickings with such lines as ""The oceans are all connected right?"" For no convincing reason Sutherland sponsors the treasure hunt and they race against comic-violent rap mogul Kevin Hart who wants the loot and also wants them dead. The script repeatedly assures us that McConaughey is a tiger in the sack. Maybe this is the pasty envious middle-aged guy in me talking but somebody who works out as much as McConaughey probably writes love notes to his mirror. In any event theres no electricity in his scenes with Hudson nor even a sense that this is a welcome reunion after 2003s ""How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days."" Portraying an emotional iceberg slowly melting under McConaugheys doofus charm shes unpersuasive. The characters lack warmth and the actors deliver detached paycheck performances. Director Andy Tennant (""Hitch"" ""Sweet Home Alabama"") allows the subplot-heavy story to run on for nearly two hours which is more than formulaic romantic comedy can bear. We know that market researchers insist that these films be predictable but cant they be predictable in an unpredictable way? FOOLS GOLD  1/2 out of 4 stars The setup Newly divorced treasure divers (Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey) reunite to find a sunken galleon. What works The film is visually very attractive blue water sunny skies attractive stars. What doesnt Assembly-line plotting halfhearted performances. Great scene Theres a lot of pleasant-looking scuba diving although curiously no fish. Rating PG-13 for action violence some sexual material brief nudity and language.

Matthew McConaughey stars as Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan and Kate Hudson stars as Tess Finnegan in the romantic comedy adventure Fools Gold. Photo Warner Bros. Fools Gold 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The sacred rules of journalism dictate that articles should lead with the biggest news and sorry that isnt Matthew McConaughey minus his clothes. Chronic beach-side shirtlessness is already too much a facet of his public image for Fools Gold to shock or titillate or whatever its meant to do. You might even forget youre watching a movie and think youre having flashbacks to Us Weekly. But bare feet - well thats news. He spends approximately 69 minutes of the films 113 unshod a fact I can report with confidence after sheer restlessness drove me to clock his feet or die of boredom. Or maybe it was despair. Hard to tell. Having sprained my eyesight and my good will trying to see the funny in this waterlogged Caribbean caper I resolved to time and analyze (for lack of a better word) the protoganists shoelessness against a backdrop of startlingly inane filmmaking cliches. For the purpose of my study I counted diving flippers as barefoot; call it a rule of toe. In Fools Gold McConaughey plays Ben ``Finn Finnegan a purportedly charming screwup who hunts for sunken treasure in the Bahamas while giving off the unseemly whiff of a thirtysomething Narcissus in search of a life. When we meet him hes diving off the shore of Topsail Cay where he and his bizarre Ukrainian sidekick (Ewen Bremner) discover a chunk of dinner plate bearing remnants of the crest of Vangor. And hes elated because Vangor is a clue in his search for the Queens Dowry a legendary stash of gold and bling that sailed into a hurricane in 1715 never to be seen again. What pray tell is Vangor? Why the key to the entire movie thats what. I could try to explain it to you but then Id have to kill you because you would comprehend in an instant just how little I understood of the plot. After a few reels of hearing characters spout Weird Lost Factoids of History (alternated with bursts of ``Oh my GOD) I started to get that queasy sheepish National Treasure-y feeling of being the stupidest kid in the room. Which is saying something considering the vast tonnage of ignorance on display here. Finns feet are bare when he finds the shard. Theyre bare when he pads into the den of an imbecilic gangsta rapper named not kidding Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) whos peeved about 62581.43 that Finn still owes him. Theyre bare when Bigg Bunnys dull-witted Stepin Fetchit henchmen try to drown him off the Cay. (Can we please retire that oafish racial stereotype? Please?) Theyre bare when Finn not dead bolts to a conference rubber-stamping his divorce from sometime-wife Tess (Kate Hudson) in the hopes he might persuade her otherwise. But the divorce is finalized. And hes barefoot when she whacks him with a cane. Fools Gold boasts two real attractions the sun-kissed blues and greens of Don Burgesss gleaming cinematography which was actually shot in mostly Australia; and Hudson. She is it turns out worth watching in almost anything her sparkly acumen giving some much-needed pop to her scenes with McConaughey. Director Andy Tennant aims once more for that love-hate vibe he milked in Sweet Home Alabama but he and his screenwriting partners (John Claflin and Daniel Zelman) labored under the collective delusion that they could revamp a classic screwball scenario (say The Awful Truth) with flabby humor and birdbrain characters substituting for madcap wit. Some of these characters like the wealthy heiress played by Alexis Dziena are supposed to be dense. Others like her elegant and world-weary father are supposed to be wise. And normally Donald Sutherland does convey a prickly brand of wisdom. But sporting a cravat and a bogus English accent (``Hello daahhling) he conveys only profound discomfort in the presence of boobs.

Is there any other actor so content to be the sunny jaunt audiences take to escape the cold? His shirt famously comes off. He grins and flashes his pearly whites. It pleases him to please us. He so often seems at peace with his inner goofball. Of course Mr. Just Keep Livin doesnt come solo in the ever-so-slight romantic comedy ""Fools Gold."" Kate Hudson plays sensible gal to McConaugheys foolhardy fella responsible adult to his feckless guy. Tess provides the brains to Finns treasure-hunting hunches. Too bad shes breaking up the team. RATING | Romantic Comedy Finn already has sunk a treasure salvage ship (his hers or theirs is hotly debated) and been left for dead by bumbling thugs when his soon-to-be- ex persuades her new boss to steer his yacht toward Key West for divorce proceedings. In credit-score hell thanks to her former mate Tess has taken a job as steward on the luxury yacht of Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) to make enough money to return to Chicago for her graduate degree. Something about Finn pulled Tess away from that higher ambition. And each time she begins to tell folks like the gay longtime couple who cook aboard the yacht why the marriage ran aground she finds herself hinting at what was so very right about Mr. Wrong. Even in this solidly PG-13 affair its clear he knew how to map her treasures. On the eve of their divorce Finn finds a clue to a cache they worked years to uncover the Queens Dowry. Because ""Fools Gold"" waves its preposterous flag proudly Finn and his ex wind up on the same yacht. Shes an employee. Hes trying to persuade Nigel and his too ditzy daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena) to sign on for the hunt. Finns first patron Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) is a gangsta rapper turned pure gangster who thinks hes dead. Directed by Andy Tennant ""Fools Gold"" is meant to be as easy to down as the cocktails served at Club Med. If a warm Fuzzy Navel were a good thing this would be it. Sutherland does his part to anchor the material. His large lidded eyes register the confusion and pain of a spoiler trying to connect to the spoiled child he helped create. Perhaps its contempt for Paris Hilton and Co. that led the filmmakers to make Gemma so spectacularly stupid. Five years ago -- almost to the day -- the likable leads appeared in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" It remains Hudsons best box-office showing to date and McConaugheys second-best. To cynics this reteaming suggests a studio panning for box-office ore. But the producers have it half right Theres a certain charm to this duo. Never heavy-handed Hudson offers ballast to McConaugheys forever-adolescent energy. Hes the dumb blond here -- and the movie has fun with that. Yet its easy to imagine their roles reversed in a future pairing. What didnt figure into the equation was fresh writing. Written by Tennant John Claflin and Daniel Zelman ""Fools Gold"" is ""National Treasure"" without the history lessons. This despite the overly detailed lecture about the Queens Dowry that Finn and Tess give Nigel and Gemma. Its ""Sahara"" without the Clive Cussler edge or Steve Zahn. Ewen Bremner plays Finns Ukrainian sidekick. (It would have been half a star better just for having Zahn but then nearly everything is.) There are a few surprising touches. Hudsons Tess provides one when she pointedly asks Gemma why she always plays dumb. Its big-sibling stuff and Tess and Finn take turns bringing Gemma along. ""Fools Gold"" doesnt mine Hudson and McConaugheys possibilities fully. At its best the film is silly fun. And you can stick a little plastic umbrella in that.

Save for later Saved Fools Gold is an unabashed Hollywood moneymaking vehicle. It only rarely succeeds as a form of real entertainment. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 8 2008 Save for later Saved Fools Gold Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson look for treasure. Vince valitutti/Warner bros. pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The aptly titled ""Fools Gold"" is a retread of a retread - an attempt to cash in on such movies as the ""National Treasure"" series which in turn were rip-offs of ""Indiana Jones"" which as it happens is being revived this summer. And so it goes.Actually a better title for this movie would be ""Treasure Chest"" since Matthew McConaughey playing Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan a treasure hunter in pursuit of a sunken Spanish galleon spends most of the movie with his shirt off. Not since the second and third ""Rambo"" movies has a movie star done less for the clothing industry. Given the fact that Finn spends most of his time in the sunny Bahamas its surprising that the filmmakers didnt work in a plethora of suntan lotion tie-ins.McConaughey is paired with Kate Hudson who plays his ex-wife Tess. They last teamed up in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" an inexplicably successful romantic comedy that proved you dont need chemistry to make moolah. The chemistry in ""Fools Gold"" isnt so hot either - maybe because the chief object of McConaugheys affections is himself. Finn is supposed to be helplessly in love with Tess who of course still loves him despite/because of his roguish ways. Since its a foregone conclusion that these two will reunite I kept waiting for something nifty to bring them together again. No such luck. Theres only fools gold in this galleon. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Bahamian locations are beautiful though - even if they were in fact shot in and around Queensland Australia. The underwater diving footage occasionally conveys the dreamy poetry that is possible in deep-sea photography. And thats about it on the plus side. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Only Fools rush in... Several good actors turn up to no particular effect - including Ray Winstone as Finns surly mentor and Donald Sutherland as a mega-yacht-owning billionaire. Sutherland sports an incredibly phony-sounding upper-class British accent. Was he trying to mimic John Cleese or is he (or the director Andy Tennant) tone deaf? As the billionaires bimbo daughter Alexis Dziena is cheerfully vacuous. If its true that you have to be smart to play dumb then Dziena is a genius.The treasure hunt in ""Fools Gold"" is of course meant to be about more than money. But the only reason for this movie to exist is to make money. Thats not an unadmirable goal but one must be deft about it. Otherwise what you end up with is something like ""Fools Gold.""

"A pair of fools little to treasure - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A pair of fools little to treasure Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson in ""Fools Gold."" (Vince Valitutti/warner bros.) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 8 2008 ""Fools Gold"" is a tedious adventure-romance about a himbo treasure hunter Finn (Matthew McConaughey) his soon-to-be-ex wife Tess (Kate Hudson) and the hundreds of millions of dollars in coins and jewels they stop squabbling long enough to find. Its ""National Treasure"" the Kathleen Turner-Michael Douglas edition.When I was bored watching it (which is to say often) I thought about admiring the hard work McConaughey did for this picture and how all that work appears to have gone into his abs. Hes shirtless 70 percent of the movie and thats not quite the arousing dream it ought to be - mostly because McConaughey is more or less saying ""Im an arousing dream""On their treasure hunt Finn and Tess manage to rope in Donald Sutherland as Nigel Honeycutt a rich Englishman whose silky white mane of hair could double as a slip or an ascot. Tess works on his boat which his dim American socialite daughter (Alexis Dziena) is visiting. Shes a ropy creature whose next career could be as a plumbers snake. (To Dzienas credit shes often the most charismatic person in the movie.)Nigels boat winds up rescuing Finn from drowning - to Tesss annoyance - and what adventure there is begins. These four are racing to find the treasure against both the gangsta (Kevin Hart) who wants the money Finn owes him and a grizzled boat captain (Ray Winstone complete with Southern pirate accent).Director Andy Tennant has been taking stabs at film romance for years (""Fools Rush In"" ""Ever After"" ""Sweet Home Alabama"" ""Hitch""). But all he shows us are the puncture wounds. Here he gets script credit along with John Claflin and Daniel Zelman and the movie lazily drags along failing to realize even its basest screwball potential. The zing between Hudson and McConaughey which was more or less there in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" goes un-zung.""Fools Gold"" plays like a product that began life as one thing in the Hollywood cannery and wound up something else. Its full of plastic sentiment chases buffoonery and dull lewdness not to mention the macho gay couple stuck cooking the meals on Nigels boat. Seventy years ago they would have been platonic black dudes. Sometimes progress stinks.Hudson no longer seems to care that she hasnt come close to discovering how good she could be in movies. Instead she spends a lot of screen time pointing out who in ""Fools Gold"" is dumb and whos dumber. (She never gets around to the composer whose brass-and-steel drum score says ""Weekend at Bernies 5."") Of course if Hudson were so smart she wouldnt be here floating around a movie that makes the most beautiful waters seem like theyve been colored with 2000 Flushes.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

But when Finn (McConaughey) whose chief interests are pirate booty and the sexual kind discovers a long-buried treasure off a Bahamian reef he rekindles his relationship with Tess (Hudson) scholar () of Spanish history. Finns find does not rekindle the movie which is to put it politely all wet. Despite the presence of Donald Sutherland as a billionaire with a conveniently located yacht a floating five-star hotel if this movie were a treasure chest its contents would be dross. No doubt conceived as an underwater version of National Treasure Andy Tennants film plays like a Three Stooges movie with scuba gear. It should be said though that a Three Stooges movie is enlightened next to this one that trades in cheap jokes about a celebutard heiress (Alexis Dziena) and the black henchman of a shady rap mogul (Kevin Hart). The choppily paced Fools Gold has two gears. Low is eye-glazing exposition about the whereabouts of a 16th-century Spanish galleon that carried ""the Queens Dowry."" High is characters bashing one another with oxygen tanks and flashlights. While there are worse things than watching McConaughey and Hudson disport themselves - except to see them walking around in the briefest of bathing gear I cant think of why anyone would want to endure this soggy mess. ""Theres no fool like a gold fool"" quips one character in a line that may be taken to dissuade ticketbuyers.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Bringing these two back together doesnt make sense Its like planning a banquet at a restaurant where you once got food poisoning. This time around McConaughey plays ""Finn"" Finnegan a treasure hunter who needless to say walks around shirtless a lot. Hudson is Tess his estranged wife and former partner in treasure hunting. She now works as a steward aboard a yacht owned by billionaire Nigel Honeycutt (a sly Donald Sutherland) and is hoping to put her life back together. The couple had shared an obsession with the Queens Dowry a Spanish treasure that was lost at sea in 1715. After Finn discovers a clue to the dowrys location he teams with Tess and Honeycutt to try to get their hands on the loot. Thats the Cliffs Notes version. The film which drags anyway comes to a screeching halt during an endless expository scene on the yacht in which Finn and Tess babble on about the history of the treasure to Honeycutt and his daughter. You literally need to take notes to keep track of the complex scenario - if you care that much. As directed by Andy Tennant (Hitch) the movie crawls along with occasional bursts of rather graphic violence to jar viewers awake. Of course its hard to get too shaken up This is the kind of movie in which a character will be smacked viciously in the head yet the bruises and blood will magically disappear in the following scene. McConaughey seems a little too grizzled and weathered for whats required of him here. At least he feigns enthusiasm which seems beyond the terminally mopey Hudson. You imagine the actress thinking ""They paid me to say these stupid lines but Im not going to sound as if I mean them."" Its a big waste of time all the way around. The film exec who apparently thought that these two were the next Tracy and Hepburn was sadly mistaken. Heck Matthew and Kate arent even the new Frankie and Annette.

"Fools Gold | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fool-s-gold ) Fools Gold (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Five years ago Hollywood paired Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and the match rewarded the filmmakers with box office receipts exceeding 100 million. No doubt the hope was that a reunion of these two in a script intended to recall Romancing the Stone would reap similar benefits. Somehow however Fools Gold doesnt have all the necessary elements. The movie isnt entirely successful as a romance or as an adventure which makes the experience of watching it feel shallow and hollow sort of like the stars and the plot. It would be nice to say that Hudson and McConaughey connect the same way they did in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days but the fitful chemistry from that film has all but evaporated here. There are occasional moments when it threatens to flare back to life but not enough of them. Plus McConaughey seems to be trying to appear as grungy and un-sexy as possible. He looks like a burnt-out surfer in desperate need of a shave a shower and a haircut. Hudson is a little flat (this is a reference to her performance not any other attributes) but thats been the tale of her career since she blew the cinematic world away by becoming Penny Lane. The screenplay and its transition to the screen by director Andy Tennant (who is also listed among the co-writers) has major tone problems. The first 75 minutes are so top heavy with character building and exposition that they will threaten to put some viewers to sleep. The abbreviated (but nevertheless tedious) discourse about why a Spanish treasure ship wasnt where it was thought to be nearly lost me. If ever there was a scene that could be said to stop a movie dead in its tracks this is it. The final act which comprises the last 30 minutes is reasonably entertaining with action that culminates in a little James Bond-style derring-do. The problem is that it takes too long to get to that point. The only instances of ""action"" preceding this are when Matthew McConaughy gets his ass kicked - something that happens with a regularity you dont expect from a leading man not named Jack Black Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler. Fools Gold starts somewhere in the Caribbean with Finn (McConaughey) and his sidekick Alfonz (Ewan Bremmer) diving for treasure. Theres a little accident and their boat sinks but it represents an excellent marker for what Finn believes may be the end of a long and painful search for a lost Spanish Galleon. He tells his ex-wife Tess (Hudson) about the find and shes intrigued until he is unable to provide proof that his discovery is more than a figment of his imagination. Soon however he has enraptured a rich multimillionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) and his bimbo daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena) with tales of old ships and sunken treasure. Tess currently working for Nigel ends up on board almost by default. Soon theyre in a race to find the sunken ship against an old rival - Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone) who was at one time Finns mentor. But the two have additional competition from gangster rapper Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) who has deals in place with both Moe and Finn but intends to take everything for himself. Fools Gold is comprised of three distinct elements the treasure hunt which despite being overly long is moderately engaging; the romance between Finn and Tess as they reconnect under the water and in danger which is lukewarm; and the father/daughter bonding between Nigel and Gemma which would be laughably absurd even if Donald Sutherlands accent wasnt so awful. Alexis Dziena (best know for giving Bill Murray an eyeful in Broken Flowers) adds some energy to the production playing a brunette so dumb you cant believe shes not blond. One has to hope this is good acting although her ""serious"" scenes with Sutherland dont support such an interpretation of her skills. Am I the only one who is beginning to find McConaughey more creepy than sexy? Put in the right role he can be effective (Two for the Money comes to mind) but the constant desire of filmmakers to shoehorn him into adventure movies seems at best to be an instance of minor miscasting. The hero of a movie like this should at least be able to stand up for himself. McConaughy gets hit in the face at least a half-dozen times and on most of those occasions he doesnt get up. Do we really want a romantic comedy action film with a scraggly unkempt wimp as the male protagonist? Tennant has a pretty good resume when it comes to affecting lighthearted romances (he directed both Hitch and Fools Rush In) but he doesnt have the right actors to pull it off here. Hudson and McConaughey are both passive. Pair Dziena with either of them and a few fireworks might have gone off. Overall Fools Gold is not unwatchable and the action-overloaded final 30 minutes passes quickly and easily. Its getting to that point that can be a chore. At best Fools Gold deserves a bronze.

Posted February 6 2008 -- 1200 AM EST The words ""bad romantic comedy"" may now add up to a redundant phrase but bad is still a relative concept. I had fun at Miss Congeniality Music and Lyrics and at parts of last years The Heartbreak Kid. Does that make them good movies or me an easy connoisseur of bad ones? Lets just say that enjoyment even trashy enjoyment is not to be sneered at. Boredom on the other hand is -- and thats the real crime committed by the dead-in-the-water Fools Gold and the cold-as-last-years-catchphrase The Hottie amp; the Nottie comedies that have all the zing of a gossip item you dont want to bother reading to the end. Fools Gold is the sort of knockabout ""romp"" in which folks clunk each other over the head with shovels. Its the dialogue though that clunks most painfully. Matthew McConaughey plays some sort of neer-do-well man-child treasure hunter and from the moment he finds a broken heirloom dinner plate while diving off Key West hearing him ramble on -- and on -- about how this relic is going to lead him to the legendary Queens Dowry treasure chests makes you wish you were listening to a forum on the erotics of tax policy. Its normally a measurement of star wattage when an actor beams through the dreck around him but McConaugheys relentless monkey-dimpled good cheer isnt contagious -- its annoyingly impervious. You could put this guy on the deck of the Titanic 10 minutes after it hit the iceberg and hed still be looking on the bright side cracking wise high on his ""Ya know ya caint resist me"" cornpone-beefcake charm. As McConaugheys ex-wife lured back by his sexy adventurers spirit (the flip side of his flaky refusal to grow up) Kate Hudson is as blah and dazed as her costar is cloyingly enthused. If its possible to have too even a tan Hudson in Fools Gold would be the poster child for it. Her bronze glaze stiffens her hardening the sparkle in her face. She goes through the motions of vivacity but she seems to have forgotten that shes a star and so do we. Fools Gold makes you long for the half-baked amusement of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days in which the same pairs peppy hostility was less canned than the contraption it powered.

The lure of Matthew McConaughey shirtless for extended stretches doubtless has some marketing value but after that ""Fools Gold"" offers small compensation -- a listless romantic comedy that almost out of desperation turns a little more violent than necessary near the end. Treasure hunting has certainly worked for the ""National Treasure"" franchise"" and an earlier McConaughey-Kate Hudson pairing enjoyed some success. Still after however many doubloons can be hauled up from the utterly review-proof its hard to envision Warner Bros. separating too many fools from their money. Reuniting the stars of ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" in a more adventurous setting surely sounded promising but in the hands of ""Hitch"" director Andy Tennant and his screenwriting collaborators Daniel Zelman and John Claflin they find themselves up the proverbial creek without a paddle. At times the pic feels like a comedic version of ""The Deep"" only without the comedy. McConaughey plays treasure seeker Finn obsessed with a Spanish galleon loaded with treasure lost off the Florida coast (as played here by Australia) in 1715. His frenzied pursuit of said riches has cost him his wife Tess (Hudson) who is divorcing Finn for having ""no clue how to behave like a responsible adult."" Its just then naturally that Finn actually finds a clue pointing toward the treasure which hes chasing with the patronage of a wealthy rapper-thug unfortunately named Bigg Bunny (comic Kevin Hart put to very poor use). Tess meanwhile has taken a job aboard a luxury yacht working for the wealthy Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland channeling Ronald Colman). After some finagling by Finn Nigel agrees to finance an expedition for the loot mostly as a way to entertain his visiting daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena of ABCs ""Invasion"") a pampered heiress and complete airhead. Aside from the central couples painfully flat banter and bickering the movies only real recurring gag is that Finn keeps getting whacked in the head with blunt instruments -- yielding wounds not to be a stickler about continuity that magically heal as if he were ""X-Mens"" Wolverine. Ray Winstone also pops up as a rival treasure hunter and Finns former mentor but this subplot is so underdeveloped as to foster suspicions that sequences were left on the cutting-room floor -- hard as that is to believe given the sluggish pace. When the action does pick up near the climax its too late to redeem whats already transpired and a bit grittier than it should be tonally as if weve detoured into a different movie. Nor is the missing-treasure riddle intriguing enough to sustain interest though beyond the fauna displayed the well-shot tropical scenery might be a balm to some coming as it does in the dead of winter. The point clearly is for Finn to woo Tess back along their shared journey but despite the scripts contrivances theres not much chemistry between them. Indeed the only real energy comes from Dzienas bubbly dim-bulb. Granted thats a rather tired image but as Finn demonstrates during one skirmish with Bunnys henchmen a drowning man -- or even just one dispatched on a ""Fools"" errand -- cant be too choosy when grasping for lifelines.
