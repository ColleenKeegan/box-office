By Anthony Lane Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler in a new movie by Mike Binder.   Credit EDEL RODRIGUEZ Of all the things to make you pause hand on wallet before shelling out for a movie ticket try this a film about the aftermath of 9/11 starring Adam Sandler. What possible cultural need one might ask could be met by such a project? It is thus with a degree of amazement that I find myself nominating ""Reign Over Me"" written and directed by Mike Binder as a movie that might be worth your time. Sandler stars as Charlie Fineman whose existence is a wild rebuke to his name. Charlie is far from fine. He is a human heap whining through New York on a small electric scooter his hearing cut off by a pair of headphones the size of avocados. You might almost think he wanted to be flattened by a truck. He has sheepdog hair graying to the color of old newsprint. For kicks he likes to sit in his apartment and play a video game ""Shadow of the Colossus"" on a huge screen. Over time we discover the colossus in whose shadow Charlie lurks and mumbles to himself. He lost a wife and three daughters on September 11 2001 and then he lost the capacity to admit that he had a wife and three daughters in the first place. Without the will to remember the movie suggests there can be no will to live. That is an unusually gloomy proposition not just for a studio movie but for a society that despite the acts and sites of official commemoration must find good cause to forge ahead from catastrophe. ""Reign Over Me"" closes with at best a cautious hope leaving us more anxious than when we went in and throughout the film there is a stunned and bewildered air hanging over the city like a heavy smog. The action takes place in the present day years after the collapse of the Twin Towers yet when Charlies friend Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) a dentist runs into Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler) a psychiatrist who works in his building and tries to tell her about Charlies family all he can say is that ""they were killed in a plane crash."" How far can denial spread? It isnt only the Charlies of New York in other words who are stuck for words or trapped in immovable feelings. Its the Alans too--a curious fact since Alan is successful and married to the immaculate Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith) with daughters of his own. Long ago he was Charlies college roommate; now he bumps into him again and makes an effort to resuscitate him. To the movies credit the scheme is hardly a triumph. The moment you think that Charlie is back in the swim he starts to thrash and splutter--laying waste to Alans office or foaming with anger in a coffee shop. Though Alan hooks him up with Angela all that Charlie can do is congratulate the doctor on her breasts and when she starts to ask about bereavement scroll up the volume on his iPod. And yet something does seep through as if to show that fate is not unchangeably malign a channel-flipping Charlie stumbles on ""You Were Never Lovelier"" with Rita Hayworth smiling at Fred Astaire and nearly smiles himself. Better still he persuades Alan to hitch a ride on the back of his scooter which leaves us with the cheery spectacle of two grown men standing bolt upright like shop dummies zipping along to the strains of the Pretenders. ""Stop all your sobbing"" Chrissie Hynde tells us with that imploring crack in her voice but the movie treads haltingly as if to reply Not yet. All the relationships in ""Reign Over Me"" are either busted or badly in need of repair. There is Alans marriage which is seizing up; there is his professional flirtation with Angela (he wants therapy but darent ask for it); and there is the other sort of flirting not so much professional as pornographic which is launched in his direction by Donna Remar (Saffron Burrows) a dental patient of surpassing beauty and unsound mind. I didnt quite believe in her pursuit of Alan and it soon becomes clear that the main weakness of Binders movie is its approach to women which veers between the idolatrous and the petrified. By the end Charlies plight has won the sympathy not just of Angela but of Donna at which point my thoughts drifted into the heretical tragedy is tragedy but if Liv Tyler and Saffron Burrows are tending to your needs might life not be getting a little brighter? These implausibilities may jolt the movie but they dont derail it because they run in line with Binders vision of a fractious off-kilter world. Back in 1990 Binder wrote a fine and underrated film called ""Coupe de Ville"" about three bickering brothers; it was incidentally almost womanless but it proved that he had an ear for the snap and swerve of argument--still well tuned in ""Reign Over Me"" and matched by the eye of Russ Alsobrook his director of photography. Alsobrook works in high-definition digital to rid the city of serenity everything is haste and jumble with pleasure being grabbed and lost on the run and the long nocturnal streets promising more desolation than romance. Even Don Cheadle classy and controlled as he is gets thrown back onto his nerves and his striving to keep himself together though far less anguished than Charlies is somehow the meat of the film. Which leaves us with Adam Sandler. I cannot remember laughing at a single scene of his comedies but here for once his chosen persona--the slurring and disconnected goofball--makes sense although I still think of him as an oddly hollow presence on which to build a movie. His grief is less convincing than his vacancy and one effect of ""Reign Over Me"" is to make you ask Who will improve on Sandler? Who can do for New York in the wake of 9/11 what the young Scorsese De Niro and Keitel did for the city in earlier years and under less threatening skies? The new Sandra Bullock film ""Premonition"" is about a wife and mother who foresees that her husband is about to die. Then he dies. Why is it in movies that people with clairvoyant powers see only the dire and dangerous things that will befall them? If you can predict a death why not the winner of the Belmont Stakes so that you can amble down to the bookies before the beginning of June? No such luck for Bullocks character Linda Hanson who looks fairly stressed even before the premonitions kick in. She is married to Jim (Julian McMahon) she has two adoring daughters but does she look happy? No she looks like someone posing for Edvard Munch. This is bizarre given that Bullock is one of the few leading ladies--Meg Ryan having temporarily vanished into the mists--who know how to carry a comedy and to make that difficult burden seem as light as a kite. She has always been a frowner and a fretter but in movies past beginning with ""Speed"" those worry lines could be erased with ease; they were part of her quick-response skills and of her determination to ride the bumps of mischance. The first sin committed by Mennan Yapo the director of ""Premonition"" is that he manages to make his heroines face look at once drawn and swollen as if the sight of a pretty woman might like a dirty joke inflict frivolous damage on the drama. Tell that to Carole Lombard. Or Myrna Loy. The chronology is all chewed up with Linda waking the day after the funeral to learn that Jim is still alive then waking again to find the opposite and so on. It might have been simpler to call the movie ""Groundhog Death."" Slowly a plot emerges. Just as the two daughters are seen early on carefully putting pieces into a jigsaw puzzle--well now their mom has to solve a puzzle of her own. (""Reign Over Me"" pulls an almost identical trick. I live for these delicate hints.) Linda discovers thanks to her Sibylline gift that Jim is about to sneak off with a colleague named Claire (Amber Valletta) and that it is en route to the tryst that he will crash and burn. According to Linda ""Maybe it was supposed to happen. Even though he didnt do anything yet maybe it was enough that he was going to."" This was a new one to me ""Minority Report"" for the lustful. In short the moral of ""Premonition"" is that you can expect to be killed for wanting to sleep with Amber Valletta. According to my calculations this means that ten million Americans will die by tomorrow morning half of them in the shower. Call it dark call it spooky but somehow I knew that ""Premonition"" would be a stinker. Was it a dream or did I really foresee that Kate Nelligan would be wasted in the role of Lindas mother? Or that the name of Peter Stormare in the opening credits meant that at least one of the characters would be a menacing fruitcake? Scoff if you will but such coincidences cannot be swept aside. Listen to Lindas minister who happens to have a book of famous premonitions at hand when she drops by its weirder passages marked with yellow stickies. People who have lost their faith he says are ""empty vessels"" waiting to be filled with ungodly prophetic talents such as hers. So there you have it go to church keep your husbands gaze averted from stray blondes try not to think about the future and all shall be well. Although ""Premonition"" is not a frightening movie it is aimed squarely at an audience of frightened souls.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Friday March 16 2007 659 PM View the photo gallery Read also Sandras just got a feeling Premonition Psychological thriller about a woman who sees the future -- and tries to change it. With Sandra Bullock Julian McMahon. Director Mennan Yapo (150). PG-13 Violence language disturbing images. At area theaters. Can anyone explain Sandra Bullocks baffling professional path? For every ""Crash"" theres a howler like ""The Lake House."" For every ""Miss Congeniality"" theres well ""Miss Congeniality 2."" And not even her most ardent fans will consider Mennan Yapos tedious ""Premonition"" a step in the right direction. The convoluted premise which may incite a case of deja vu in anyone whos seen ""Memento"" (or ""Deja Vu"") finds Bullock playing suburban mom Linda Hanson. After her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) dies in a car crash a dazed Linda plans his funeral and consoles their distraught daughters. The next morning she wakes up to find - you guessed it - hes very much alive. She tries to dismiss the experience as a bad dream but its clear something weird is going on. Jim and his gorgeous co-worker (Amber Valletta) are a little too friendly. A bottle of lithium appears on Lindas sink out of nowhere. And it cant be a good sign when that dead bloody crow drops on her lawn. Bullock does convincingly portray the confusion of a woman who wonders if she has glimpsed a terrible future. But what other emotion could she express? Despite the hyperactive score the movies a total tease. Why does Lindas mother (Kate Nelligan) wants her committed to a mental hospital? Whos the creepy doctor (Peter Stormare) slinking around the sidelines as Linda races to save her husbands life? And why is she stuck in this treacherous time warp in the first place? At least all this uncertainty is leading up to a spectacular twist ending - oh wait. No its not. We never get a sensible explanation for Lindas bizarre double life or uncover any reason - any reason at all - why Bullock would pick this lazy patchwork script out of all the ones she surely receives every year. We do however sense our own premonition coming on If she doesnt start choosing her projects a little more wisely she may wake up one day to the scary realities of squandered opportunity. elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(AP Photo/TriStar Pictures/Ron Batzdorff) NO SALES. NO MAGAZINES. Photo Ron Batzdorff Hes dead not dead -- who cares? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Premonition. Thriller. Starring Sandra Bullock Julian McMahon Nia Long and Kate Nelligan. Directed by Mennan Yapo. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It doesnt take a soothsayer to foretell that things arent going to go well for the suburban couple portrayed by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon in ""Premonition"" -- a supernatural thriller that keeps your attention while failing to hold you in its grip. The first tip-off is a surreal white light enveloping the blissfully-in-love twosome Linda and Jim Hanson. Nobody can be this over the moon at the start of a movie and remain that way. Theyre standing outside their dream house for the first time. When next seen the Hansons have filled it with two picture-perfect daughters and color-coordinated furnishings. Lindas meltdown starts in her matching sheets and coverlet. Some mornings she wakes up and her husband is alive and other times hes dead. No need to wait for the scene where she bestirs herself to check for proof of life. Just notice how Bullock looks in bed. If shes all movie-star glamorous in lacy sleepwear and curls unperturbed by nocturnal tossing and turning then the family is still intact. But if Bullock is pale unkempt and swaddled in a mans wrinkled shirt its widowhood for Linda. The plot device of somebody learning through otherworldly channels of a loved ones impending demise in time to prevent it was used far more effectively in ""Frequency"" which managed to create drama out of preposterous circumstances. But screenwriter Bill Kelly is unable to move you beyond the trying-to-fit-all-the-pieces-together stage. There are two reasons ""Premonition"" never grabs you. First the pieces arent ever going to fit. Thinking about the timing of Lindas visit to a shrink or Jims stopping by an insurance office to triple his death benefits -- allegedly crucial elements in figuring out whatever is supposed to be figured out -- will only give you a headache. The more serious problem is that the Hansons dont emerge as a family worth investing in emotionally. Youre not told enough about them to make them interesting. Linda and Jim appear to have a perfect marriage (how boring is that). The possibility that Linda might want her husband dead or even be complicit in his untimely end comes out of nowhere and is insufficiently developed. Bullock does her best with the anemic script convincingly showing Linda in a depressed state after learning of her husbands fatal car crash then frantically charting both of their actions in an attempt to stop him from driving the road to his doom. McMahon is no match for his co-star. His bland good looks and manner are perfectly adequate on ""Nip/Tuck."" But hes a stiff on the big screen -- even before Jims rendezvous with the grim reaper. Nia Long and Kate Nelligan put admirable energy into the thankless roles of respectively Lindas best buddy and mother. Its great to see Nelligan who doesnt work nearly enough in anything. Mennan Yapo a Turkish director who works mainly in Germany tricks up the horror elements in ""Premonition."" Theyre hokey rather than scary. To the sound of ominous music (a bad imitation of Bernard Herrmann) Linda walks toward one of her children shown from the back on a swing. Yapo seems to be setting the stage for the little girl to crank her head all the way around like Linda Blair. She doesnt but the sight of her face meant to induce fright is instead laughable as is Jims funeral when something unfortunate happens to his casket. After listening to Lindas story about not knowing from day to day whether her husband is among the living her psychiatrist dryly says ""Seems a little complicated."" ""Premonition"" is unnecessarily so. The convoluted setup doesnt produce a payoff worthy of the attention this film demands. -- Advisory Violent content and disturbing images.

And then he dies. Or maybe he doesnt. Movie review ""Premonition"" with Sandra Bullock Julian McMahon Nia Long Kate Nelligan Amber Valletta Peter Stormare. Directed by Mennan Yapo from a screenplay by Bill Kelly. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some violent content disturbing images thematic material and brief language. Several theaters. Theres a moment in the feverishly convoluted thriller ""Premonition"" when Sandra Bullock whose character is enduring what can only be called a very dark version of ""Groundhog Day"" whips out a marker and paper and begins making a chart. Her husband it seems has died in a car accident or maybe he hasnt; maybe the accident hasnt happened yet and her week has somehow repeated itself for reasons unknown. On the paper she frantically scribbles the days of the week and what happened each day and who it happened to and it was all I could do to keep from reaching up into that screen and grabbing that chart for myself. Perhaps the studio might consider making a small handout version to be thrust at moviegoers who leave the cinema mumbling ""um what?"" ""Premonition"" directed by German filmmaker Mennan Yapo and written by Bill Kelly is a very odd film but you cant quite dismiss it (in the way that all but the most hopeless romantics can dismiss Bullocks other recent flirtation with trippy time juggling ""The Lake House""). Behind the hypercomplicated details of its plot is a very simple story that actually resonates that of a marriage turned perfunctory and stale. Linda (Bullocks character) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) are shown in the movies prologue as starry-eyed blissfully happy newlyweds. Fast-forward about a decade and add two daughters to the mix and theyre barely connecting moving through their busy lives in parallel. When the movie begins with the news of Jims death (delivered by a cop so creepily odd you know somethings not quite right) we dont know anything about their marriage but as the details fall into place Lindas grief becomes more complex and more meaningful Shes not just grieving Jim but their marriage. Bullock a consistently underrated actress whos very good here is a welcome point of stillness in the whirling complications of the plot. As the action screeches back and forth from present to past to I-know-not-what she keeps her performance quiet (except for a few essential moments of rage) simple and clear. You connect with Linda even as the movie leaves you behind. Thanks to Bullock and to some gripping swirling camerawork by Torsten Lippstock some of the scenes are genuinely haunting such as a moment at Jims funeral when a distraught Linda demands to open the casket. But ""Premonition"" works hard at wearing out its welcome with numerous scenes that dont seem to add up and too many characters who feel underwritten (particularly Lindas best friend played by Nia Long). Ultimately a scene in a doctors office hits perhaps a little close to home. ""It all seems a little complicated"" says the doctor pondering her story. ""Tell me about it"" echoes Linda.

Linda (Sandra Bullock) is happily married -- or so she thinks -- to her handsome husband Jim (Julian McMahon) in Premonition. Photo TriStar Pictures Premonition 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Somber but soulful Premonition has a strong dramatic performance by Sandra Bullock and a gimmicky plot that doesnt grate until the end. But what is truly the end and not a vivid premonition in a tale like this? Linda (Bullock) is happily married -- or so she thinks -- to handsome husband Jim (Julian McMahon). They share a cozy domesticity with two young daughters in a large and warm home. This perfect world ends -- or seems to -- when Linda awakens one day to learn Jim was killed in an auto accident. But her awakening it turns out was only into an elaborate dream. Waking again -- this time for real -- she learns that Jim is alive. In fact he hasnt left yet on a business trip. But will he die or are Lindas recurring premonitions merely nightmares? Premonition thus plays out like a grave Groundhog Day crossed with Mementos clue-driven mind-games. Linda somehow must discern a puzzle in real time based on disturbing looks at a possible future. Among such glimpses one of her daughters suffers severe facial cuts a pretty blonde at Jims office looks like trouble and the caskets arrival at Jims funeral goes horribly wrong. Through it all lurks a horrifying suggestion that Jims pending death may be a deserved karmic fate. Can Linda somehow prevent it? Or even worse given the questions awful implications Should she? All this unfolds in a surprisingly clear narrative given its jumbled structure. Even if you struggle to keep up at least like Linda youll have a fighting chance. The resolution is shaky but it still adds up. What keeps the film from crumbling though isnt crafty plotting. Its the bonds between its flesh-and-blood characters. Though grim and often violent Premonition is less of a thriller at heart than a love story. Told entirely from Lindas point of view it shows a woman whos done nothing to deserve her torment yet must find a way to defeat it. Driven by love and cursed and gifted with precognition only she can defy a presumed fate. Though McMahons role is underwritten he conveys a decent but conflicted man whos taken his family for granted. His Jim at least is no heel. But Premonition is Bullocks film and she delivers like a dream -- a good one in this case. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals GameStop Summer Sale Fredericks of Hollywood Sale and Clearance Up to 77% off +...

"Premonition Earth to Sandra | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPremonition Earth to SandraSandra Bullock now playing a wife who experiences her husbands death days before it occurs in Premonition is in danger of being typecast as a space cadet.By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterFri. March 16 2007  (out of 4)Starring Sandra Bullock Julian McMahon and Kate Nelligan. Directed by Mennan Yapo. Written by Bill Kelly. 110 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowIt never pays to think too much about movies constructed to make you think. Unless its David Lynchs Mulholland Drive a film to outsmart your average moviegoer or something like Memento which eventually submits to a plausible explanation close scrutiny of a jigsaw puzzle of an artless movie like Premonition can only lead to logical dead-ends and the revelation of irritating inconsistencies.One things for sure Sandra Bullock having taken the female lead in the frustratingly time-warped The Lake House (""How do you hold on to someone youve never met?"") and now playing a wife who experiences her husbands death days before it occurs is in danger of being typecast as a space cadet. And another thing we can nail down writer Bill Kelly and German director and minor actor Mennan Yapo were out to demonize the medical profession equating modern psychiatry with 17th-century witch-hunting. But that subcurrent and the introduction of a religious angle about losing ones faith that carries us through to a sort of resolution are really minor elements in a house-of-mirrors joy ride that finds Linda Hanson (Bullock) losing her mind and in danger of losing her young daughters Megan and Bridgette. As the screen either goes white (Heaven?) or black (alcoholic oblivion?) and Linda wakes up each morning on a different day her mate Jim (a pretty bland standard-issue husband Julian McMahon) is either alive or dead. Its up to her to establish which reality to believe. Is she awake or dreaming? Mad or perfectly sane? Guilty or innocent?While steering too close to the more philosophically underpinned Groundhog Day this film grabs ones attention like a detective novel challenging the reader to find out whodunit.Linda is a stay-at-home mom in a once-happy marriage that has lost its edge as marriages are wont to do with dull repetitive routines of raising children maintaining a home or keeping a career going. Jim is a banker (or something). It really isnt important but hes away on a business trip the first morning Linda wakes to her two daughters urging her to get them to school on time. Flashbacks such as the one that opens the movie where Jim has brought Linda to the home he has bought them are helpfully shot with the colours bleached out like fadedmemories.As for Lindas other experiences theres no filmic device to indicate what state shes in. Feeling in need of professional help she seeks psychiatrist Dr. Norman Roth (a hostile-looking Peter Stormare) who listens with little sympathy to her predicament and prescribes her lithium.Cast well below her talents Kate Nelligan is Lindas mother Joanne come to help after the husbands death but we cant be too sure about her either. The repeated phrase ""Everythings going to be just fine"" keeps entering everyones dialogue like an ironic mantra signalling to the viewer that in fact things are not fine at all.But the over-arching irony is that the movies ending gives us exactly that puzzle complete with a sunny view as if we didnt notice that some pieces were jammed together without really fitting.

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY If you had a sixth sense that this Sandra Bullock movie might be an incoherent unoriginal psychological thriller you were right. Then again your assessment might have nothing to do with being psychic and everything to do with the awful ads and trailers. Premonition is both dreary and absurd suffering from a lack of intrinsic logic and terrible pacing a one-two punch that kills off any chance of entertainment value. CLIP Get a glimpse of Premonition The film is a kind of dim-witted supernatural Groundhog Day meets Sixth Sense in which its heroine wakes up and doesnt know if her husband presumably killed in a car accident is dead or alive. The biggest problem is we dont really care what happens to her or to her spouse thanks to the convoluted confounding and unconvincing story. Bullocks acting is fine particularly when shes challenged in some of the films better scenes to appear as if shes going crazy. But why does she keep choosing such forced and clunky pseudo-surreal material like this movie and last years The Lake House. The film opens with an intriguing set-up but it loses steam fast. Bullock as Linda a strangely distracted housewife and mother appears to have an idyllic life with a lovely house handsome husband and a pair of sweet daughters. She has her Stepford wife moments but were rooting for her. Our sympathies are particularly engaged when she gets the shattering news that her husband (Nip/Tucks Julian McMahon) was killed in a highway crash. But she wakes up the next morning with her husband unequivocally alive. Did she imagine the disaster or does she have the gift of clairvoyance? This question haunts the movie until the end when things are resolved not exactly neatly but with a distinctly maudlin touch. The puzzle is never fully solved just posited and explored but rarely intriguingly. If you value your time and money youll waste neither on this time-bending exercise in pointless frustration.

After seeing the movie I have postmonitions about Sandra Bullock (how could she have done it?) and her hapless filmmakers (how could they have done it so badly?) plus one admonition Pay real money to see this feeble fiasco only if youre in the mood for ""Groundhog Day"" without the laughs. ENLARGE ""Premonition"" tells the story of a loving wife and mother Linda Hanson who comes unstrung because shes living her days out of order. Why is that you may ask. Well she just is. ""I wake up every morning to find my husband has died again"" Linda tells a shrink. Thats not quite right though. She finds that her husband has died when she wakes up every other morning or maybe its every third morning except during leap weeks. Meanwhile we come unstrung watching her frantic efforts to figure out whats going on by plotting significant events in her life -- i.e. ""JIM DIES"" -- on a big hand-drawn calendar. Theres something mysterious here but it isnt the plot device which is one of those arbitrary notions thats as good or bad as the writer makes it. The mystery is that Ms. Bullocks time-out-of-joint thriller arrives in theaters nine months to the day after her time-out-of-whack romance ""The Lake House"" which was just as dumb and confusing except that the problem was lovers struggling with a bi-temporal relationship. (She was living in 2006 and Keanu Reeves was in 2004.). What is it with Sandra Bullock and time? Does she keep yearning in the here and now for the now and then? Why would an actress who can act as well as she did in ""Infamous"" (as Nelle Harper Lee) fall twice for dramatic equivalents of droopy Dali clocks? Since those questions are imponderable and since the logic of ""Premonition"" is incomprehensible -- to the writer and director it would seem as well as the audience -- I tried to make time pass faster in the screening room by pondering other matters. ENLARGE Time traveler Sandra Bullock in ""Premonition."" One is a glimpse early in the film of Linda smoking a cigarette. Its her only cigarette from start to finish. She doesnt smoke when her husband keeps dying when she discovers that he has a mistress or when her daughter has a terrible accident. And the odd thing about this single ciggie is that she takes a single furtive drag then extends her arm slowly so that only her fingers and the object in them disappear off screen. Whether that constitutes a statement on tobacco pro or con its tempting to imagine the producers -- all eight of them -- debating the position of a coffin nail in a movie that makes a muddle of life and death. Another is an encounter between Linda at her most distraught and a local priest who delivers a bizarre lecture on precognition -- ""history is full of unexplained phenomena"" he says solemnly -- and who tells her to fight for whats worth fighting for. Good advice if a bit tautological but the writing and acting is of such time-warped earnestness as to make the scene transcendently dreadful. The history of Hollywood is full of unexplained folly. The Wind That Shakes the Barley ENLARGE Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delaney in ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" The strongest character in ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" is Damien a young physician turned guerrilla fighter after being radicalized by the brutality of British troops in the thatched-roof Ireland of 1920. (Hes played quietly but charismatically by Cillian Murphy.) The strongest sensibility in this powerful film is that of the director Ken Loach who needing no radicalization at this point has made a long and honorable career of naturalist working-class drama. Some of Mr. Loachs earlier feature films have been easier to admire than to enjoy. This one which won the Palme dOr at last years Cannes Film Festival fairly vibrates with dramatic energy. By following the men of a Republican brigade as they become seasoned combatants the film like a modest Irish version of ""The Battle of Algiers"" offers yet another telling account of guerrilla warfare taking its toll on uniformed soldiers. The director and his writer Paul Laverty are unsparing in their portrait of the Black and Tans who inflict a reign of random terror on Irelands towns and villages. Yet ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" depicts just as graphically the ruthless violence that the Republicans visit on Britains forces. Most painful of all is the spectacle of Irish revolutionists fighting Irish turncoats. ""I studied anatomy for five years and now Im going to shoot this guy in the head"" Damien says in horror and anguish. Then the physician turned guerrilla turns executioner. DVD TIP ""Sliding Doors"" (1998) follows its heroine Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) along two different life paths determined by whether she misses or makes a train in the London Tube. Peter Howitt directed this stylish debut film from his own original script.

A mild cleft in her chin helps her look rooted. It has turned out to be an interesting face for close-ups. For spunk (""Speed""). For frustrated fury (""Crash""). For klutzy sweetness (""While You Were Sleeping""). Having a compelling mug is both a help and a hindrance in her latest ""Premonition."" Before the thriller begins to morph into something of a vanity project it counts on the subtle array of emotions Linda Hanson (Bullock) goes through on learning her husband is dead then isnt then is then. ... In a grim gloss on ""Groundhog Day"" Linda awakens again and again. Sometimes Jim is asleep beside her. Other times shes in his shirt but his space is cold with absence. Is she experiencing a dream foretold in which her husband dies on a business trip? Or a bottomless nightmare brought on by grief? When one of her daughters appears with sutures on her face it poses yet another possibility. Maybe Lindas mad. Much like ""Deja Vu"" and ""The Number 23"" this star-driven thriller (directed by German filmmaker Mennan Yapo) starts to show the strain of keeping us guessing. And not just about what may happen to the protagonist. Thanks to shifts in mood we ponder what genre of movie were watching too. The films first power moment comes as a state trooper knocks on Hansons door. Hes come to tell her that her husband died in a car accident. Jim (""Nip/Tuck""s Julian McMahon) left the day before on business. Its all underplayed reaction. Eyes turn red but tears dont flood the scene. Bullock skillfully calibrates the balance between hearing the news and grasping it. ""Premonition"" has a few of these quiet sharp moments. After listening to a cryptic message Jim left from the road Linda sits on the deck with a cigarette. Its stress smoking. But we just dont see that sort of untidy realism much. The filmmakers also pay heed to what a house built decades ago might actually look like especially for a young couple that doesnt have the means to rehab it attic-to-cellar before boxes and babies arrive. When they first pull up in front of it Linda worries its beyond their means. Years into the marriage the house is full of signs of wear and tear and life being lived. All these details and Bullocks early gestures bode well. Lines of shrewd dialog (written by Bill Kelly) give us the hope well see a movie that maneuvers emotions as well as twists. (How many thrillers wanted to imitate the emotional heft of ""The Sixth Sense""?) ""Nobodys ready for this but youll be surprised how strong youll be"" says Lindas mother (Kate Nelligan) when Linda says she cant face Jims death. But ""Premonition"" has enough red herrings to fill an icebox for a hard winter. There is something fishy about the shrink (played by Peter Stormare). Could this be a thriller about Lindas sanity? Or is it merely an extended metaphor for marital anxieties? Part of the problem is the Hansons are already having muted marital tensions when we enter the picture. And grainy memories of their wedding day dont do enough to connect us to their former bliss. McMahons Jim doesnt gain much traction with us before we watch him meet his end on a two-lane roadway. Nelligan starts off solidly real as Lindas mom. But as the movie twists her presence recedes. Similarly Nia Long (""Alfie"") as Lindas best friend becomes another promise deferred. Actually the animal of choice here isnt fish but fowl a crow who meets its end while chattering on a wire. Or does it? Clues the crow a casket the stylish co-worker (Amber Valletta) who may or may not be Jims lover start to accumulate. But thats not the same as adding up. Movies obsessed with keeping us guessing can miss out on providing reasons to keep us caring.

"Premonition gives off bad vibes - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Is he dead or not and will anyone care? By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 16 2007 Fans of horror thrillers and the films of Sandra Bullock will find ""Premonition"" puzzling since it fails to honor any of them.Instead its a movie only a psychic could love since a psychic would know to stay home or see ""Zodiac"" instead. The rest of us? Well we wanted to be scared for Sandra knowing that shed be playing a woman who wakes up in different non-sequential days of the week and that on some days her blandly handsome husband (Julian McMahon ) would be dead. But from the first scene Bullock looks dead herself. Maybe she knows shell be upstaged by a musical score and sound effects that cant wait to go crazy around her which they do for pretty much the entire movie.The morning after hearing that her husband was killed in a car crash -- day two of her shuffled life -- Bullock walks slowly (always very slowly) into the kitchen as the music explodes and the camera stares at a pillar with a man behind it. The screeching orchestrations are meant to signify that something shocking is about to be revealed. But the shock is only that the screenwriter Bill Kelly and the director -- Mennan Yapo  a German making his Hollywood debut -- think they have one in store for us. Who other than the husband did they believe we would expect to see behind that pillar? (OK my money was on Keanu Reeves but still.)Every morning Bullock wakes up and remembers the previous days events and slowly begins to piece together that shes in a relentlessly stale copy of ""Groundhog Day."" Her mother (Kate Nelligan ) and her only friend (Nia Long) conspire to have her institutionalized. Amber Valletta plays someone harboring a hokey secret about Bullocks marriage. And after one of her two little daughters runs through a glass door a dead crow is stumbled upon and Lithium is prescribed Bullock turns to a priest who tells her she needs to believe in something greater than herself. But the last thing anybody wants from a horror-thriller let alone from a Sandra Bullock movie is a lecture on faithlessness.Since it wont -- or cant -- scare ""Premonition"" opts to moralize. This would be tolerable if the moral werent such a joke and the movie werent such a cynical suspenseless slog. Bullock doesnt seem remotely interested in being here anyway. This is a case of a star forgetting what an audience loves to see her do. If she found comedies too confining schlock seems to box her in too just as it did for Jim Carrey in ""The Number 23."" Bullock doesnt lower herself to embarrassing material the way say Julianne Moore gamely can. Bullock chooses to give virtually no performance at all. The nasally sarcasm she uses so effectively in her comedic work turns petulant and defensive here. Its as if her new default setting for seriousness is that nasty woman she played in ""Crash.""There are occasional moments where Bullock seems to be in on some cosmic joke like when she mutters a hilarious quip to McMahon about how tomorrow he could be dead. A movie this stupid requires a star willing to tell us she knows whats up in pretty much every scene. Instead Bullock sucks the life out of whatever kick this movie might have had. In her defense few stars could have redeemed the oppressive contraptions of the script or the illogic of the filmmaking. Maybe she thought that she too could wake up and this movie would never have happened. If so that would make two of us.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

After a day of mourning she wakes up the next morning to discover Jim sipping coffee in the kitchen. What gives?Billed as a supernatural thriller ""Premonition"" is thematically closer to movies such as ""Memento"" or ""Deja Vu"" or ""The Lake House"" Bullocks previous foray into the realm of now-you-see-him-now-you-dont. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""The Lake House"" she was romanced by a suitor played by Keanu Reeves who existed a few years in the future. In ""Premonition"" it quickly becomes apparent that shes living the days of her life out of order. The week of Jims accident has been fractured into days that either precede or follow his death. Once she figures this out Linda tries to prevent the accident from happening. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Since she has two young daughters and the marriage is chilly - Jim has been contemplating an affair with a co-worker (Amber Valletta) - I was hoping Linda would stay the course and hold out for Keanu Reeves. Obviously were supposed to want her to save the day despite a love that is less than undying.""Premonition"" would have been much more interesting if instead of dabbling in shuffled days the filmmakers had left Lindas predicament more open-ended. Is she imagining her husbands death as a kind of wish fulfillment? Or is she in fantasy denial over her loss? Is she crazy? A psychological dimension would have leavened a lot of the mumbo jumbo.And the absence of nuance is all the more disappointing in light of Bullocks transformation into a fully adept actress. In ""Crash"" and even in the portentously silly ""Lake House"" she showed a range and a depth of feeling that made me almost forgive and forget her previous girl-next-door blandness.But the way ""Premonition"" is set up theres not much she can do with the role except look increasingly haggard and flummoxed. At times Bullock seems as confused by the plot as we are. Even if you cut the writer Bill Kelly and the director Mennan Yapo a lot of slack there are plot holes galore.May I suggest that its time to declare a moratorium on movies about time? Grade C Rated PG-13 for violent content disturbing images thematic material and brief language.Sex Nudity 4 cases of innuendo. Violence 8. Language 4 strong uses and 6 milder ones.

"A Little Short On Foresight washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On A Little Short On Foresight Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 16 2007 Sandra Bullock is a disheveled grumpy adorable mess in ""Premonition "" a psychological thriller that was no doubt pitched as ""Medium"" only longer and brunette. Or maybe ""The Eternal Sixth Sense of the Spotless Groundhog Day."" If youve seen the ads youve seen the movie Bullock plays Linda Hanson whose perfect life (gorgeous husband played by ""Nip/Tucks"" Julian McMahon; two cute daughters; an awesome prairie-school house) is suddenly thrown out of whack when shes told her husband has died in a car crash -- only to have him reappear the next day. Linda then embarks on the most scrambled week ever as Monday and Thursday and Tuesday and Friday rearrange themselves in a Dali-like dreamscape of disasters revelations and Lindas frantic attempts to rewrite the future (or is it the past?). Director Mennan Yapo does a good job keeping the incoherence coherent and capturing whats at the root of Lindas grief those crushing mid-marriage blahs a houseful of smiley-face stickers cant cover up. And Bullock rumpled and intense recalls her performance in ""Crash"" in a convincing serious turn. But ""Premonition"" fatally falters in its last moments with a happy-sad payoff that will leave audiences groaning whether they see it coming or not. -- Ann Hornaday Premonition PG-13 96 minutes Contains violent content disturbing images thematic material and brief profanity.

"Premonition | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; premonition ) Premonition (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Time travel movies meddle with paradoxes and causality - these things lie at the core of their essential fascination. The difference between a good time travel movie and a bad one often rests with one simple quality Having established a set of ""rules"" by which the paradoxes are governed does the film remain constrained by them or does it mutate them to fit the circumstances? Unfortunately Premonition is plagued by inconsistencies. Theres some interesting material in the film about pre-destination and questions about whether its possible to change fate but the movie is less interested in the philosophical implications of this than it is in developing a mystery and seeding red herrings. Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) is going about her daily chores when a police officer arrives at her door to inform her that her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) has been killed in a car accident. Linda is devastated and must inform her young daughters Megan (Shyann McClure) and Bridgett (Courtney Taylor Burness). Her mother (Kate Nelligan) arrives to help out. By nightfall Linda is exhausted and grief-stricken she curls up on the couch and falls asleep. She awakens the next morning to discover that not only is Jim alive but the calendar has been peeled back from Thursday to Monday. Gradually as the days and nights pass Linda discovers that she is no longer living life in a linear fashion. Instead of her days progressing sequentially from Sunday to Saturday they are jumbled up with the fulcrum being the day of Jims death. Knowing what happens can she stop the accident? Should she stop it? A weakness of the film can be traced to Lindas passivity. Instead of being proactive she is reactive and this robs the script of possibilities. Linda does not rage against fate. For the most part she accepts it which limits the films dramatic tension. A classic victim Linda isnt always interesting and although Bullocks acting is fine there are times when the characters lack of strength limits the movies ability to engross. The film has its high points and the ending evidences potency (although the epilogue is not only ineffective but raises more questions than it answers). Another mistake on the part of the screenplay is to offer a metaphysical explanation of sorts for Lindas unusual journey. Premonition provides a scene between the lead character and a priest in which we are granted insight into the possible supernatural device that has disrupted Lindas chronology. It sounds a little silly and reminds us why movies like Groundhog Day prefer to leave the method of time travel to the imagination. Typically the more we learn about such mechanics the harder they are to digest. (There are exceptions - such as in the novel The Time Travelers Wife - but this isnt one of them.) One wonders whether Bullock is trying to become the modern queen of time travel stories. This is her second consecutive film to dabble with non-linear movement through the fourth dimension. Her previous effort The Lake House was a romance. This is more of a drama with elements of a thriller and mystery built in. It may be overstating matters to suggest that Premonition keeps the viewer guessing but it is constructed with sufficient efficiency that most viewers will stay with it to the end. Whether one forgives the film its lapses of consistency and logic is another matter. The films tone and approach presided over by German director Mennan Yapo (making his English language feature debut) from a screenplay by Bill Kelly (Blast from the Past) lies somewhere in the twilight between art house and multiplex fare which may make it a hard sell to either audience. The star and the more overwrought aspects of the plot are mainstream but the philosophical implications will not appeal to those who prefer easily digestible cinematic portions. Its also true that the more deeply one considers the movies themes and structure the less sense it makes. Instead of the paradoxes transforming into delicious puzzles they become jigsaws where the pieces dont necessarily fit. So although aspects of Premonition tantalize other elements frustrate and that makes for an uneasy final result.

One of the current stars most savvy about her constituency Sandra Bullock ventures into supernatural suspense with too much demographically targeted care in ""Premonition."" Very redolent of ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Memento"" and other bendings of time/reality into contrived puzzles this slick exercise about a housewife whose spouse might or might not be dead is effective until a downright maudlin close as if chicks might not withstand a horror pic (which PG-13 tale barely qualifies as) sans sniffling embrace of family values. Nonetheless combined Bullock and genre lure should propel strong mid-level B.O. First flashback sequence shows Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) surprising wife Linda (Bullock) with a 1920s wood-frame house that -- though she worries they cant afford it -- is now theirs. A decade later Linda is a full-time housewife and mother of 10-year-old Bridgette (Courtney Taylor Burness) and 6-year-old Megan (Shyann McClure). All appears to be well until a policeman visits Linda with news that Jim who was on a business trip died in a car accident the day before. Traumatized Linda recovers enough in the short term to prepare her girls for bad news once theyre home from school. She calls her own mother (Kate Nelligan) and best friend (Nia Long) over for comfort before finally curling up to sleep on a couch. Linda wakes up in the morning in her bed. She goes downstairs -- and discovers Jim routinely drinking coffee. Apparently it was all a bad dream. Only the ""next"" morning Linda wakes up to find her husband is very much dead again -- a wake taking place downstairs mom and best friend presiding. Her protest ""Hes not dead"" is taken for grief-stricken mental instability. Then comes the next morning and the next. Its not spoiling anything to reveal what Linda eventually discovers Time has somehow become unstuck and shes experiencing the week of her husbands fatal accident in randomly reshuffled ""before"" and ""after"" days. Tension centers on whether she can prevent Jims demise. En route we discover the Hansons marriage maybe wasnt so perfect (though its flaws are poorly defined); that Jim was considering an extramarital affair (with Amber Valletta as a sexy coworker); and that time-warped Lindas understandably confused responses to her post-Jim circumstances will have serious consequence for herself and her children. ""Premonition"" owes everything to the school of chronology-and-reality-messing suspense. Bald imitation can have its charms -- and this exercise is involving enough as long as Lindas struggling to figure out whats happened to her world. A curious choice given his prior experience writing producing directing and acting in films of modest international repute Turkish-German director Mennan Yapos English-language feature bow is glossily pro but lacks assertive directorial personality. Stronger style and atmosphere would have greatly benefited a pic that seems to abandon its own supernatural aspects to sheer plot mechanism. Nor is the always watchable Bullock up to limning more than the most feet-on-ground elements of a character whose possible insanity (or at least marital dissatisfaction) should be milked for as much ambiguity as possible. (Offering a master class in sustaining such tensions was Nicole Kidman as the good/bad mother in 2001s ""The Others."") As ""Crash"" proved Bullock can do dislikable. Enigmatic complexity? Maybe not. Her straightforward playing renders simply off-key some of the scripts odder ideas as when Linda realizes Jim was thinking about cheating on her and her grief over his demise abruptly turns into something like grim satisfaction. But where ""Premonition"" really stumbles is in the last reel when Linda seeks comfort from a priest who suggests her problems are due to lack of (ever-so-vaguely non-denominationally specified) ""faith"" though theres been no prior evidence she lacks it. Closing gush of family-values affirmation feels false in both emotive and plot-logic terms. Supporting perfs production and tech values are all polished if undistinguished. Pic was shot in Shreveport La. though setting comes off as generic.
