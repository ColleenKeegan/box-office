Photo Credit Blue Sky Studios advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A family of endangered Spixs macaws discovers that it is not alone. Rated G BOTTOM LINE Kiddie-level humor make this animated movie thoroughly family-friendly as long as discerning adults are not in your family. CAST Voices of Jesse Eisenberg Anne Hathaway Andy Garcia Bruno Mars LENGTH 135 Itll be interesting to see what the Fox Business Network will say about the animated kiddie film ""Rio 2."" That channels hosts were the ones who accused Disneys ""The Muppets"" Universals ""The Lorax"" and Warner Bros. ""The Lego Movie"" of brainwashing children with anti-corporate rhetoric because of the movies villains an oil baron an entrepreneur and a CEO respectively. ""Hollywood"" one Foxer said ""has its own agenda."" If those movies were propaganda ""Rio 2"" may qualify as full-blown eco-terrorism. Its heroes are two endangered Spixs macaws one a Woody Allenish urbanite Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) the other a spirited beauty named Jewel (Anne Hathaway). They met in 2011s ""Rio"" and are now raising a family in that Brazilian city but theyve also discovered a large population of Spixes hidden in the rain forest. This films villain is the Big Boss (Miguel Ferrer) a mustachioed clear cutter with a hatred for ""tree-huggers."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Rio 2"" may sound like a commie plot but in fact its pure cost-benefit analysis. Directed by Carlos Saldanha and written by a four-person team the movie has one goal to amuse the most children with the least amount of effort. Despite a range of voice talent (from Leslie Mann to the bossa nova princess Bebel Gilberto) and some colorful Brazilian music supervised by Sergio Mendes ""Rio 2"" lazily recycles countless old movies into a barely new one. Among the cliches are two hip-hop sidekicks (Jamie Foxx and will.i.am) a domineering father-in-law (Andy Garcia) and a puffed-up Ramp;B crooner played by Bruno Mars. One bright spot is Kristin Chenoweth as Gabi a poisonous frog whose unrequited love for the evil cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) results in a Broadway-style showstopper. Generally ""Rio 2"" loathes nonfamiliar ideas and loves easy ones Its characters rap sing old disco nuggets and break into large musical numbers to pad a short running time. The serviceable animation is by Blue Sky Studios and Fox Animation. That raises a point The studio behind ""Rio 2"" is along with the Fox Business Network entwined in the media conglomerate 21st Century Fox. Clearly theres good business in pushing anti-business messages that pro-business anchors can denounce. If nothing else ""Rio 2"" can be your childs first lesson in economics. 204 MoviesRio 2 trailer _____ advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A family of endangered Spixs macaws discovers that it is not alone.

The not-so-great ones prompt a childlike sense of fidgeting as you start squirming around in your seat and wondering if this thing is ever going to be over and can we go home please? The latter is the presiding sentiment of ""Rio 2"" a sequel to 2011s ""Rio"" an animated film whose only real defining characteristic was that it was less crappy than the ""Ice Age"" movies. (Granted its other memorable feature in certain quarters was the fact that it grossed nearly half a billion dollars worldwide. Hence another visit with characters that barely anyone over the age of nine can remember.) Also read How Rio 2 Could Beat Captain America at Box Office Since their last dreary adventure macaws Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have settled down in environmentally protected bliss in Rio where theyre now raising three hatchlings. The family is the last of the blue macaws -- or so they thought. Blu and Jewels human keepers Linda (Leslie Mann) and Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) stumble upon evidence of more blue macaws deep in the Amazon rainforest which prompts Jewel to plan a family vacation to the jungle despite Blues continued citified-ness. (Get ready for lots and lots of jokes about fanny packs and GPS.) Blu feels even more out of his element when forced to go beak-to-beak with Jewels father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and her childhood boyfriend Roberto (Bruno Mars). And if those two werent adversaries enough theres also a nut-tree turf war with the local parrots as well as a greedy developer (Miguel Ferrer) illegally cutting down trees and trying to stop Linda and Tulio from having the rainforest declared off-limits. Watch video Anne Hathaway Sings Broadway Version of Snoop Doggs Gin and Juice with Jimmy Fallon (Video) Oh and did I mention that cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) is seeking revenge against Blu because of things that happened in the first movie that have completely slipped my mind? Nigel has followed the birds down the Amazon with lovesick poisonous tree frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth) in tow. Chenoweth gets the movies best scene a musical number in which she laments the fact that she can never embrace her beloved because of her toxic touch. Its a song that allows the Broadway and TV star to trill belt and generally diva it up to the hilt. The musical moments on the whole stand out as the highlights of the film; whether its the Sergio Mendes contributions to the score a psychedelic dance routine that suggests Busby Berkeley choreographing the Enchanted Tiki Room or Clement breathing hammy new life into that chestnut ""I Will Survive"" ""Rio 2"" becomes watchable when the flat characters shut up and sing. Also read Kristin Chenoweth in Negotiations to Join Jennifer Lopez in The Boy Next Door Alas the music eventually stops and were back to the umpteenth movie about the outsider proving himself and saving the day; even Eisenberg and Hathaway sound bored out of their wits. There are a handful of amusing gags most of them having to do with jungle creatures auditioning for a Carnaval extravaganza but the film too often crawls when it could be launching skyward. If there must be a ""Rio 3"" let it follow the lead of the surprisingly delightful third ""Madagascar"" movie which followed two unexceptional installments. Hire Noah Baumbach as a co-writer throw a polka-dot afro on one of the characters -- do whatever it takes. Otherwise well be stuck with another dreadful ""Ice Age""-ish franchise albeit with brighter plumage. Cue the fidgeting. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Political Footballs Draft Day The Unknown Known and Rio 2 << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Political Footballs Draft Day The Unknown Known and Rio 2 Summit Entertainment Movies April 11 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print So much of Draft Day takes place on the phone the filmmakers had to come up with a way to make the calls exciting. So they split the screen down the middle. Sometimes the line separating the speakers moves a little to the left or to the right and one person on the call -- are you sitting down? -- walks past the other characters frame. Sometimes the entire frame slides across the screen I mean can you stand it? The other person on the phone doesnt know that say Kevin Costner is crossing a room or walking through a corridor but we do. What access The first time this happens its a nice kinetic touch. But it keeps happening and every time it does youre meant to notice whose shoulder is violating the barrier -- who is quite literally thinking outside his allotted box. Mostly its Costner playing the made-up general manager of the Cleveland Browns Sonny Weaver Jr. Early on a countdown clock pops up onscreen giving Sonny about 12 hours to angle for the first pick in the draft. The world thinks the Browns need a hot new Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback (Josh Pence). But Sonny isnt so sure. Weve seen the phone calls. Hes unconventional. Fun fact He even fired his beloved coach-slash-father from the team. The father who was ill has of course recently died. Its that kind of movie. Its also the kind of movie that opens with Sonny finding out the woman hes been sleeping with is expecting a baby. Its not the kind of movie in which he asks ""Is it mine?"" -- just the kind of movie in which the news that hes going to be a father is simply another thing to deal with. Its the kind of movie in which the woman tells him on or very near draft day. This woman -- her name is Ali Parker and shes played by Jennifer Garner -- is one of the teams lawyers and handles the financial logistics. She must know what shes doing. Is Ali testing his priorities? Because this is the sort of movie in which Sonnys phone can be counted on to ring often and because he must take every single call Ali doesnt get a satisfactory response. Nor does she get nasty about it. Shes beyond professional at home and at work. The writers have given every scene at the Browns office a kind of sitcom nuttiness which is understandable once you know the director is Ivan Reitman. (Yes that Ivan Reitman.) The office scenes come complete with a new nerdy intern (Griffin Newman) and the unannounced arrival of Sonnys mother (Ellen Burstyn) and ex-wife (Rosanna Arquette). They show up not long after the teams quarterback (Tom Welling) has trashed Sonnys office and the coach (Denis Leary) has set flame to a guidebook and dropped it on Sonnys desk. In saunters Ali who proceeds to extinguish the fire in a way that says ""I also do this figuratively."" Through it all Sonny is juggling calls to and from the teams flashy owner (Frank Langella wonderful in shades and good tailoring) prospective draftees curiously desperate to play for him and the coaches and managers of other teams. He does this while backing Ali into a closet for some very short-lived real talk (knock knock Its the intern) and trying to assuage the stresses of Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) a linebacker with a neck tattoo bullet-chamber watch and two adorable nephews to raise. The rest of the cast includes Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs Chi McBride Kevin Dunn Terry Crews Wallace Langham Sam Elliott and Jonah from Veep. So on top of everything else this is the kind of movie that isnt cast so much as clogged. But Costner as usual makes most of this look easy. His hair is slightly mussed and only vaguely gray and his tanned skin is a seemingly natural freckled leather. And he spends the movie in a snug dress shirt that doesnt hide a paunch and gray slacks that gather near his crotch. (Of course hes going commando.) Its a sign of Costners enduring stardom that he can skate through a movie this hyperactive and dull yet still have you like him. As always he needs better material but I liked that he doesnt play it entirely cool. He lets enough of the stress overtake him that you reach for a Tums. Draft Day is the least offensive film one could make about the National Football League. Its about the business of building a team and the movie has a decently dramatized climax that manages to show what a chess match the draft itself can be. It just takes a lot of silliness to get there. The movie wants to show several prongs of the NFL power cord but its not really interested in the lives of these players. It would say it cares about the Vontae Macks of the league and Boseman last seen as Jackie Robinson in 42 goes for a curious sort of macho emotionalism. But its taken mostly with the corporate power structure and what the NFL can do for guys like Mack and the son of Crewss retired veteran. The movie also likes the idea of what football can do for a place like Cleveland which is depicted as a pitiful postindustrial city on NFL spiritual life support. Thats a loaded characterization that without a more serious treatment is condescending. Of course every person and entity in Draft Day is desperate everyone except the pregnant lawyer who handles the money. That might have to do with Garners rigor as an actor -- her flavorless pluck works better here than it did in Dallas Buyers Club. But I could feel her wondering how shed been trapped as a romantic device. Garner started her career setting the traps. Now look. Shes staring into a bathroom mirror with her hand on her stomach while Costner stands in the mens room splashing his face with water. She cant even leave the split-screen framing device. In any case you watch a story about a sports teams inner workings and you just know someone involved said ""Lets do Moneyball but for the NFL."" Moneyball of course had very good source material that it managed to dumb down without turning stupid. Draft Day is just a store-brand Toasted Oats-versus-Cheerios approximation Runnyball.  At some point late in his documentary interrogation of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld Errol Morris asks the question Id been thinking the entire time up till then ""Why did you agree to do this?"" It isnt so much that Morris has been particularly hard on Rumsfeld. If anything his film -- The Unknown Known -- succumbs to Rumsfeld but not unreasonably and not completely. Rumsfeld happens to be an utterly captivating public figure. He was of course one of the architects of the Iraq War and as such has captured Morriss interest -- though rarely here his opprobrium. But surely Rumsfeld and the people around him understand that Morris has mounted searing examinations of the detainee abuses at Abu Ghraib (Standard Operating Procedure) and of former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara (The Fog of War Eleven Lessons From the Life of Robert S. McNamara) an architect of the nightmare in Vietnam. Had no one seen any of Morriss moralistic editorials in the New York Times? Surely Rumsfeld understood that even if the filmmaker wasnt going to gather a journalistic firing squad Rumsfeld at the very least would be expected to account -- if not atone -- for the misinformation that led to war and for the mistakes made in its waging. What could he possibly hope to gain from subjecting himself to the Morris treatment? For the better part of 103 minutes Rumsfeld sits before Morriss cameras looking straight into the one facing him and gives what amounts to a grand self-explication not simply of his role in Iraq but of the professional and historical events that seemed to inform his state of mind as secretary of defense under both Gerald Ford (he was the youngest ever) and George W. Bush. He served in the Nixon White House and during the Reagan administration was brought in as a special Middle East envoy. With Morris prompting him from somewhere offscreen Rumsfeld walks back through many of the significant events of his assorted tenures. Throughout hes charismatic reflective and jolly but also serious and committed to defending himself. When Rumsfeld claims never to have seen the torture memos that authorized so-called ""enhanced detainee interrogation"" Morris exclaims in disbelief and Rumsfeld complains about the news reports misunderstanding of what constitutes torture. The Unknown Known lacks the impeccable assembly of The Fog of War which formally speaking brought Morris as close to perfection as hes ever likely to come. This time hes settled on moving pie charts and dictionary definitions that fill a dark screen like constellations. There are many cutaways to oceanic vistas a roiling snow globe and once or twice to words spilling into a black hole. Good design has always been crucial to the Morris experience. This time its symbolism feels bluntly symbolic. Getting McNamara meant something to him and you could feel Morris not wanting to ruin the strategy of reeling his subject in. But the shock of that movie was just how candid and in need of self-exculpation McNamara was. He seized upon Morriss filmmaking apparatus. He transformed it into Sunday school. Its as if Rumsfeld saw the McNamara film as a kind of game hed like to play. McNamara gave a lot away. Rumsfeld offers very little thats new. What emerges is a fascinating portrait of a bygone approach to power marked by a seemingly contradictory mix of transparency and obfuscation. Rumsfeld embodies that discrepancy. Its the key to his endless allure. Indeed the high points of the film tend to involve clips from his press conferences during the Iraq War. There really was nothing like them. The journalists in attendance pelted him with skepticism and he parried in exasperation. His responses were koans that answered no questions. Maybe they were prevarications. Maybe he believed them. But he became famous for his pseudo-philosophical stonewalling. Often it tipped into condescension sometimes into anger. He suffered the press and seemed to hate having to explain even loosely what transpired at the Pentagon. Which makes his participation here reading aloud his old writings (in a way that redefines ""torture memo"") ironic. The assumption of course is that if Rumsfeld agreed to sit with Morris there must be a smoking gun that Rumsfeld must have a confession concession or correction. This is a subtler less sensational movie than that. Hes like an old movie star sitting for a profile. The best we get is a repetition of his outrageous shrugging admission that ""stuff happens."" I dont know that the other major players in and around the Iraq War -- Dick Cheney George W. Bush Colin Powell Condoleezza Rice John Yoo -- could have withstood Morris. His opening question to Rumsfeld involves the word ""obsession"" which Rumsfeld rejects. We then get a partial answer ""Im cool"" he says. ""Im measured."" He might have come to clarify the thinking behind the war. But its in his nature to spread more fog.  Theres a type of animated movie in which the plot doesnt matter where you honestly dont know what youre watching but you sit there passively mesmerized for 90 minutes. Rio 2 is like that. Its just like 2011s Rio except the domesticated Minnesota macaw (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) who wound up in Brazil is now to be redomesticated as a husband and father of three bratty birds. Theres some business involving the wife (Anne Hathaway) bringing the family back to her Amazonian jungle roots. Conveniently theres a deforestation plot thats perfect for an ecology-minded climax (hey Mister Leave those trees alone) a very funny talent-audition montage that almost makes the jive of Nico and Pedro (Jamie Foxx and Will.i.am as ""city birds"") worth putting up with and just enough shiny production numbers for Jemaine Clement (cockatoo) Kristin Chenoweth (pink dart frog) and Bruno Mars (slickster macaw) to go to town on. Its perfectly split between generic and new and doesnt do anything with 3-D but make you wonder about all the packaging for the glasses. Yet that matters not. Rio 2 has a childish delicious-looking beauty. Its like watching a box of Froot Loops explode just beyond the tip of your nose. Bring milk.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 11 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 11 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Carlos Saldanha Written by Don Rhymer Carlos Saldanha Jenny Bicks and Yoni Brenner Starring Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg Classification G Year 2014 Country USA Language English Theres not much new but a lot thats vibrantly blue in Rio 2 the sequel to Foxs ultracolourful 3-D animated 2011 film about a domestic macaw Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and his relationship with a Brazilian jungle bird Jewel (Anne Hathaway).The new movie which offers no backstory for the uninitiated opens with Blu Jewel and their three chicks living in odd-couple sitcom domestic bliss in Rio where the mother macaw tries in vain to teach the kids a natural lifestyle Fewer pancakes more Brazil nuts. When Blus former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and her zoologist husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) discover evidence of other blue macaws in the jungle Jewel sees her chance. She convinces Blu and the kids to make the 2000 mile journey into the rainforest. Coming along for the trip are three of the friends from the first film toucan Rafael (George Lopez) and rapping cardinal Pedro (will.i.am) and canary Nico (Jamie Foxx) while the slobbery bulldog Luiz (Tracy Morgan) stays behind.It turns out the flock includes some of Jewels family who she thought had been exterminated. That includes her father proud tribal leader Eduardo (Andy Garcia). The comedy here is essentially a feathered version of Meet the Fockers as the nerdy Blus attempts to ingratiate himself with the skeptical Eduardo. That requires trying to hide his reliance on creature comforts (GPS electric tooth brush fanny pack). As well as his embarrassing history as a ""pet"" Blu is hopelessly outclassed by Roberto (Bruno Mars) Jewels childhood sweetheart with a divine singing voice a state-of-the-art nest and champion fighting skills.Rio 2 (like Foxs Ice Age series) relies on derivative plotting and slapstick visual gags in contrast to Pixars more cerebral originality. Where the film excels though in an even more pronounced way than the first film is in the choreographed animation for the musical numbers.The dance sequences begin with the films opening New Years Eve celebration where the camera pans up from the Rio harbour in a throbbing mass of humanity with birds flitting above among the coloured confetti and fireworks. From there on at regular five-minute intervals theres another production number. The bossa nova/samba score includes selections from Milton Nascimento Carlinhos Brown and executive music producer Sergio Mendes with cast members Bruno Mars adding some Ramp;B thrills and Kristin Chenoweth providing her showtune belting.The superiority of the musical sequences and laziness of the writing creates a dynamic where you find yourself wishing the characters would shut up and dance. The worst fault here is a surfeit of villains introducing a fresh peril every few minutes. The roster includes a logging magnate and his team of bulldozer driving thugs. More fun is the villain left over from the first movie the Sidney Greenstreet-like cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clements) who with his poison-frog sidekick (Kristin Chenoweth) and a Chaplin-impersonating ant-eater plot Blu and Jewels demise. Add to the enemy list a tribe of red macaws ready for a rumble at the first case of an encroachment on their Brazil nut grove though it turns out the battle is a form of aerial soccer which resembles Harry Potters Quidditch.Among the fresh villains the stand-out is easily Chenoweth as the teeny pink shrill-voiced poisonous frog Gabi. Though profoundly in love with the narcissistic cuckoo Nigel she is unable to touch him because of her poisonous skin. (Theres a nice moment when she catches a tear before it can reach him). Chenoweth has one big solo number (Poisonous Love) and a duet with Clements on his lip-smackingly campy rendition of Gloria Gaynors I Will Survive.As with the previous Rio director Carlos Saldhana and his animation team are exhaustively creative with the use of aerial scenes in 3-D format and the teeming jungle and favela backdrops. Even if the story occasionally feels like mental clutter visually Rio 2 is consistently complex and elegant.Follow me on Twitter LiamLacey Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story Bad boys Whats behind our love of gangsters?

"Review Amid Rio 2s cacophony the musical numbers shine - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Amid Rio 2s cacophony the musical numbers shine ""Rio 2"" Blue Sky Studios Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their music-loving daughter Carla (Rachel Crow) enjoy the exotic sounds of the jungle in ""Rio 2."" Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their music-loving daughter Carla (Rachel Crow) enjoy the exotic sounds of the jungle in ""Rio 2."" (Blue Sky Studios) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Wonderfully animated and well-voiced ""Rio 2"" is nevertheless too much. Too much plot too many issues too many characters. But not too much music.Yes the musical numbers reach saturation levels but the Latin-influenced jamming and singing are absolutely fabulous. ""Rio 2s"" music might even save the 3-D animated action-adventure about endangered South American blue macaws from the terrible 2s that affect so many sequels. The eclectic animal and human cast and respective star voices that ""Rio"" introduced in 2011 have all reconvened to continue the party. And the central troika responsible for ""Rios"" progressive percussive sound -- composer John Powell executive music producer Sergio Mendes and Brazilian singer-songwriter Carlinhos Brown -- are back and even better.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 The movie starts with a massive new years celebration that looks and sounds a lot like Carnival. The great-looking character style of the first has been further refined filling this imaginary world with appealing faces and intricate plumage color bursting and completely in sync with the eye-popping frivolity going on most of it seen from a birds eye view.Those rare billing and cooing macaws Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have become quite domesticated while raising their expanding brood. The chicks -- studious Bia (Amandla Stenberg) adventurous Tiago (Pierce Gagnon) and teenage Carla (Rachel Crow) -- are in various stages of becoming their own bird which sets up some family friction.Blus human friends eco-activists Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) and Linda (Leslie Mann) are off in the Amazon trying to stop unlawful logging in the rain forest. When Tulio spots a random blue macaw feather he becomes convinced there are more birds to be found. Word of the discovery hits the 24-hour news cycle and Jewel decides a search for a flock is as good a reason as any to give her citified kids a chance to connect with their inner wild thing. Blu still nerdy after all these years sporting a fanny pack using a GPS for navigation is reluctant but outnumbered.This is merely director Carlos Saldanhas sometimes sluggish windup. Blu Jewel family and friends -- Nico (Jamie Foxx) Pedro (will.i.am) Rafael (George Lopez) and Luiz (Tracy Morgan) -- may be heading to the Amazon but Yoni Brenners script is heading in a dozen different directions. PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVTo the Rio waterfront for one where the pompous Nigel (Jemaine Clement) is quoting Shakespeare decrying the carnival sideshow hes chained to and deflecting the unwanted attention of his terribly annoying terribly adoring fan Gabi. Kristin Chenoweth is the irresistible voice of the poisonous frog and stands as one of the films best new additions.This trio is responsible for some of ""Rio 2s"" cleverest hijinks as Gabi and a tap-dancing anteater named Charlie who uses his tongue not for talking but for several super sight gags set Nigel free and follow him to the jungle so he can settle a grudge with Blu.Then its off to tour the directors favorite regional attractions. At least this detour across Brazil is made visually interesting with a temporary shift to a paper cutout animation style so that the screen occasionally looks like a pop-up book brought to life.Things improve significantly when all the parties finally arrive in the Amazon truly an animation paradise of possibilities from the dense undergrowth to the exotic creatures.Throughout the film Blu is in the pressure cooker with Eisenberg improving as the temperature rises. No one turns it up higher than Eduardo (Andy Garcia) the father-in-law the nerdy birds just met. The crusty old leader of the Amazon Rivers hidden macaw tribe isnt exactly impressed with his son-in-law or his son-in-laws fanny pack. There will be tests.RELATED More movie reviews by The TimesA major one is Roberto (Bruno Mars) Jewels old flame. Thanks to Mars Robertos a smooth operator flirty and funny -- and that voice. If there is a ""Rio 3"" sigh lets at least lobby to have Roberto and Gabi the lovely Broadway frog take over.That the film doesnt need Blu so much is underscored when Nico Pedro and pals set up Carnival auditions in the heart of the jungle. All the musical and animation stops are pulled out for a series of show-stopping numbers.Meanwhile the illegal loggers log Tulio and Linda protest Jewel goes slightly wild the kids go rogue the Carnival auditions go overtime Nigel shows up with his scraggly remaining feathers seriously ruffled and Blu loses his GPS. Whatever is a very blue blue macaw to do?In trying to fly too high ""Rio 2"" does too much flailing and floundering to soar. At least the music never misses a beat.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--------------------------------------Rio 2MPAA rating GRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Musical Theater Animation (Movie Genre) Music Music Industry Theater Rio 2 to take on Captain America The Winter Soldier at box office Review Kevin Costner inhabits his own league in Draft Day Review Amid Rio 2s cacophony the musical numbers shine Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-rio-2-20140411,0,7007793.story#axzz2yVW7FcVW",200,rio27,rio2,latimes

Grade B+ The first spring heat wave has abated but ""Rio 2"" keeps it going in a good way. The ramshackle riotously beautiful sequel to the smash 2011 musical-comedy cartoon takes the two love-and-hate birds of the first film - neurotic domesticated Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and wild independent Jewel (Anne Hathaway) - and flies them into the steaming core of the Amazon jungle. In ""Rio"" the suspense came from whether they would mate and perpetuate their close-to-extinct blue-macaw species. In ""Rio 2"" they return to the rain forest three kids in tow after Blus human protector Lucy (Leslie Mann) and her fellow ornithologist and husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) find evidence of a hidden blue-macaw colony. Blu and Jewel hoping to help the couple locate their winged brethren stumble onto the tribe of the fearsome blue macaw chief Eduardo (Andy Garcia) - who turns out to be Jewels dad. The yawning psychological gap between fastidious nervous Blu and brusque take-charge chieftain Eduardo leads to some broad ""Meet the Squawkers""-type comedy with Bruno Mars adding to the farcical friction as Jewels homeboy sweetheart. But what makes the movie a delight is its loving fantasy of Blus friends Nico (Jamie Foxx) a hip canary and Pedro (will.i.am) a hip-hopping red-crusted cardinal following Blu and Jewel into the jungle to audition fresh talent for Rios next carnival season. When director Carlos Saldanha isnt choreographing jungle creatures into airborne Busby Berkeley chorus lines or Esther Williams water fantasies hes putting together a flying soccer game pitting red macaws against blue macaws - with brazil nuts The crimson and azure waves and splashes are exhilarating and the action rivals any of the quidditch matches in the Harry Potter films. The movie is fairly chaotic in its attitudes toward human contact with indigenous creatures or keeping wild birds in the wild. But its heart is in the right place. Only after Blu leads legions of red and blue macaws to attack illegal loggers does he feel comfortable in his own feathers. Compared with ""Rio"" ""Rio 2"" operates less like a storybook and more like an episode of ""Laugh-In."" Jolly creatures pop out of every window tent flap and knot hole. None is funnier than Jemaine Clements villainous Shakespeare-loving cockatoo Nigel - except perhaps for his biggest fan and would-be lover Kristin Chenoweths passionate poisonous frog Gabi. Even if youre way beyond the target audience ""Rio 2"" makes you think of childhood things like hula hoops and Froot Loops. It offers a vision of an extreme climate that actually energizes humans and animals and birds and gets all living things to shake their tail feathers.

"Rio 2 features feather-flying jungle fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRio 2 features feather-flying jungle fun reviewRio 2 unites the voice cast of the 2011 film Rio with a new adventure sequel set mostly in the Amazon rain forest.In Rio 2 the animated characters Luiz (Tracy Morgan) Rafael (George Lopez) Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) Pedro (will.i.am) and Nico (Jamie Foxx) gather to plan for the future - in the Amazonian rain forest  (Blue Sky Studios)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. April 10 2014Rio 2Starring the voices of Jesse Eisenberg Anne Hathaway Bruno Mars. Directed by Carlos Saldanha. At GTA theatres. 101 minutes. G.Blu is back and hes still to use a metaphor with an animal theme a fish out of water.Rio 2 picks up where the first one left off and despite an opening scene that takes place during New Years Eve celebrations in Brazils party-hearty capital most of the action takes place in the Amazon jungle to the north.Article Continued BelowThere Blu and Jewel and their three boisterous chicks go in search of a flock of fellow Spixs macaws in a remote forest enclave where Blu -- raised as a pet in Moose Lake Minnesota -- finds it hard to adapt to all the ""creepy"" bugs and such.Blu is still much too attached to his GPS device and fanny-pack much to the disgust of his disapproving and derisive father-in-law Eduardo. Blus old adversary Nigel is also back and bent on revenge after having his feathers fatefully clipped in the first film.Meanwhile Blus former owner Linda and her Brazilian ornithologist friend Tulio are menaced by a gang of illegal loggers led by an evil guy who dismisses them as tree-huggers.Director Carlos Saldanha doesnt mess with the formula that made the first Rio a 500-million box office bonanza with many of the same characters -- such as Luiz Pedro and Nico -- back.But using the jungle setting Saldanha also introduces a couple of new animal characters including a poison dart frog named Gabi (delightfully voiced by Kristin Chenoweth) and a silent tamandua named Charlie along with some delightfully mischievous monkeys a couple of amusingly slow-dancing turtles and a boa constrictor who plays a brief but important role in dispatching the chief villain.The voice work is well done with Jesse Eisenberg as Blu and Anne Hathaway nicely fleshing out their respective characters and Jermaine Clement is wonderfully arch as the Shakespeare-quoting Nigel. Bruno Mars is good fun as the preening Roberto a prospective rival for Jewels affections and Andy Garcia is the archetypically haughty father-in-law Eduardo. Theres plenty of lively and inventive production numbers throughout and the animation including the 3-D effects is top-notch.The storyline is a bit on the scant side so adults arent going to find it terribly engaging. But younger audiences preteen and earlier are going to come away with a couple of useful lessons -- the first about not rushing to judgment about others and the larger one on the importance of protecting nature from human depredation -- that are presented in a way that is entertaining with a minimal of preachiness.Those who enjoyed the adventures of Blu and Jewel and company in the first Rio are going to find the sequel an equally pleasing diversion.

(Blue Sky Studios/Associated Press) By Stephanie Merry April 10 2014 Follow stephmerry There are a couple of ways to make a sequel. The ""Hangover"" school of thought for example dictates that all successors lazily follow the same formula with only the minutest of variations. The ""G.I. Joe"" route on the other hand is more like an Etch a Sketch The writers find a way to wipe out previous characters to make way for fresh faces. ""Rio 2"" introduces a hybrid approach which might be called ""hoarding."" Not only does it incorporate the story lines and characters from the original but it also adds new villains and complications making it an overstuffed mess of too many personalities and plot points. I never thought Id say this but maybe the ""Hangover"" strategy isnt so bad after all. The animated movie returns to the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) two Spixs macaws living at a sanctuary in Rio de Janeiro with their three bird-children. Blu is your typical embarrassing dad with a fanny pack filled with emergency supplies and an aversion to the tiniest inkling of adventure. But Jewel is more of a free spirit so when she hears that another group of blue macaws has been spotted in the Amazon she decides the family needs to take flight and track them down. Blu is not too jazzed about the idea but seems heartened to be joined by his old pals Nico the canary (Jamie Foxx) and the cardinal Pedro (voiced by musician Will.I.Am) who are using the trip as a way to recruit talent for the next Carnival. Almost as soon as the group leaves town theyre spotted by the villain from the original ""Rio"" the now flightless cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) who is hellbent on revenge. His new sidekicks are Charlie the mute anteater and Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth) a creepy and annoying poisonous frog who has a not-so-secret crush on Nigel. Once Blu and family make it to the Amazon they realize that the other group of macaws isnt just any flock; its leader is Eduardo (Andy Garcia) Jewels long-lost father. Eduardo doesnt exactly hit it off with his dorky city-dwelling son-in-law and tension between Blu and Jewel begins to brew. As if thats not enough to fill a kids movie theres also a parallel plot with Blu and Jewels matchmakers an ornithologist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) and his wife Linda (Leslie Mann). They find themselves up against a lollipop-sucking cowboy boot-wearing logger who will resort to evil tactics in order to keep illegally cutting down trees. Theres more too including an ""American Idol""-like talent tryout a love triangle between Blu Jewel and her old pal Roberto (Bruno Mars) and a ""West Side Story""-caliber rivalry between the Spixs macaws and the scarlet macaws that share the rain forest. Like the first movie ""Rio 2"" looks great with vibrant colors and lovely animation that pop off the screen. And among the many layers of plots some are winners. One of the most successful is the talent competition. ""Rio 2"" is curiously devoid of decent comedy but the song-and-dance routines which are beautifully choreographed lead to the movies biggest laughs especially when the contestants keep getting eaten by predators. All in all though the movie feels at once too busy and too derivative. Thats no easy feat but its also one sequel-makers probably shouldnt aspire to.   G. At area theaters.

Winds N at 5 to 10 mph. Updated July 30 2016  653 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews AP Rhythmic Rio 2 is dazzling but overloaded By Jessica Herndon Associated Press Apr 10 2014 (...) A vivid and delightful animated spectacle ""Rio 2"" is chock-full of colorful 3-D wonder and jubilant musical numbers set against a tale of family dynamics and environmental dilemmas.The sequel opens with a vibrant New Years Eve bash as partying in the music-filled streets of Rio de Janeiro is punctuated by fireworks bursting above the Christ the Redeemer statue.Supervised by composer John Powell more emphasis has been placed on the music of this film which benefits from numbers by artists like Bruno Mars (who also voices the smooth bird Roberto in the film) Janelle Monae and celebrated Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown. After mating in Brazil in 2011s ""Rio"" rare macaws Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) now have three lively kids who have become accustomed to the same domestication Blu was brought up on in Minnesota. Theyre attached to gadgets like iPods and eat pancakes for breakfast which irks the raised-in-the-wild Jewel.But the family heads off to the Amazon rainforest to Jewels delight and Blus strife when they get wind that a tribe of blue macaws may live there and are being pursued by Blus past owner and animal lover Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) and her husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro).With a few of the quirky supporting characters from the first film in tow -- including birds voiced by George Lopez (as frisky toucan Rafael) and Jamie Foxx and will.i.am (as rapping canary-and-cardinal duo Nico and Pedro) -- they soar through a dazzling journey to the rainforest making the often-wasted 3-D effect worth it as we take in the broad scope and graphically layered flair. Once there Jewel discovers the large macaw crew is led by her long-lost father (Andy Garcia) who is unimpressed with his daughters choice of a mate. He cant help but roll his eyes over Blus use of a GPS or a Swiss Army kit rather than the use of his own sharp beak.Brazilian native writer-director Carlos Saldanha and Don Rhymer returned to pen the story. But they try too hard to make up for the minimalist plot of the original and drown in subplots Blu battles with Jewel over staying in the wild versus returning to the city; Linda and Tulio clash with a few bad guys threatening to cut down the rainforest (the films eco push); and Blus old rival Niguel (Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"") pops up with a beautiful yet poisonous neon pink and purple frog (Kristin Chenoweth) plotting revenge. With so much going on its a wonder this kids movie is only five minutes longer than the original.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1249 p.m. MST April 10 2014There is nothing wrong with this movie which is visually stunning. But theres nothing magical about the story either.This image released by 20th Century Fox shows (from left) Blu voiced by Jesse Eisenberg Jewel voiced by Anne Hathaway and Carla voiced by Rachel Crow in a scene from the animated film ""Rio 2.""(Photo Blue Sky Studios/20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsThe movies look is stunning particularly in 3-D where the Amazon rain forest comes to life.Eisenberg is always good as a put-upon character and Hathaway gets to sing.The plot is too busy with too many story lines to juggle.""Rio 2"" would be a terrific movie if no one had ever made ""The Lego Movie"" or ""Toy Story"" or ""Up"" or ... you get the idea.Theres nothing particularly wrong with the film in which Blu (voice of Jesse Eisenberg) is now married to Jewel (Anne Hathaway) whom he met in the first film. And the visuals are beautiful with the rain forests of the Amazon brought to multicolor 3-D life by director Carlos Saldanha who returns from the first film.Theres just nothing magical about the story nothing that lifts it above its status as an agreeable song-and-dance movie a laugh here a laugh there pleasant but overly busy for seemingly no real reason other than to throw a few more set pieces at the wall to see what sticks.Blu and Jewel now have three children and they travel from their home in Rio de Janeiro to the Amazon in search of other rare blue macaws that Blus former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and her husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) think they have found.Once they get there they do indeed find a tribe of blue macaws led by Jewels father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) who is elated to see his long-lost daughter but less enamored of Blu whom he sees as a citified wimp. Blu doesnt really do anything to dissuade him of the notion.In addition to that clash Blus enemy Nigel (Jemaine Clement) is also along for the ride seeking vengeance. Hes accompanied by the poisonous frog Gabi (Kristin Chenowith) who loves him in vain; the poison from her skin will kill him if they touch.What not enough? OK there is also a turf war with other birds an ""American Idol""-like talent show and naturally the biggest enemy of all man who is threatening nature by chopping down all the trees.Oh and theres Bruno Mars.Hes Roberto Jewels childhood friend who does just about everything better than Blu who is planted firmly in the fish-out-of-water camp as he tries to impress everyone and fails miserably.This wont last of course and thats not really a spoiler because there arent any surprises here. Blu is the hero after all. That doesnt mean there isnt any fun -- there is. Those song-and-dance numbers alluded to earlier? Theyre plenty enjoyable. Eisenberg excels at the kind of put-upon neer-do-well sort he plays here and Hathaway gets to show off her voice.But its a competitive world among animated features these days. Its not for nothing that people are still finding new and inventive ways to sing ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen."" ""Rio 2"" is a pretty good time in the theater but theres not much here for you to take home once its done.Rio 2Director Carlos Saldanha.Cast Jesse Eisenberg Anne Hathaway Jemaine Clement.Rating G.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Rio 2 movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Rio 2  Rio 2 Blue Sky Studios Scene from ""Rio 2."" Scene from ""Rio 2."" (Blue Sky Studios) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In the commercial animation realm there are movies that reach for something or many things. Others are content merely to baby-sit.The 2011 hit ""Rio"" was a baby sitter. And so is ""Rio 2"" a routine sequel following the perilous adventures of the rare blue macaws Blu (wow clever character name) Jewel and their offspring as they leave urban Rio life for a chaotic trip to Amazon rain forest country. In the jungle the birds sympathetic human protectors Linda and Tulio (now married) have discovered more endangered blue macaws. Instant family Jewel senses an opportunity to reconnect to her roots even before she learns her father (Andy Garcia growling his way through the Robert De Niro ""Meet the Parents"" role) is alive and missing his daughter. In the first ""Rio"" the humor however meager came from Minnesota-bred Blus nervous immersion in the tropical Rio universe. The sequel throws the bird again voiced by Jesse Eisenberg opposite Anne Hathaways Jewel outside his latest comfort zone. Armed with a GPS and a most unbirdly fanny pack the anxious urbanite Blu faces an onslaught of trouble. Theres Nigel the vicious cockatoo (Jemaine Clement doing what he can with weak faux-Shakespearean gags) and his henchfolk a mute aardvark and a shrill love-besotted pink frog voiced by Kristin Chenoweth.The script credited to Don Rhymer Carlos Kotkin Jenny Bicks and Yoni Brenner overpacks its complications by roughly a steamer trunks worth. Blu must prove his mettle to his father-in-law; fend off a potential romantic interference from Roberto (Bruno Mars Mr. High Note) Jewels dashing macaw friend from the old days; and help save the rain forest and its crucial Brazil nut tree growth from illegal loggers. The latter brings the story to an ""Avatar""-inspired climax innocent and valiant forest-dwellers versus marauding interlopers with heavy machinery. The movie is heavy machinery of a different kind. Directed by Carlos Saldanha ""Rio 2"" offers roughly the same approach to story and to story clutter as did the first movie. A little conflict followed by domestic strife and reasons for Blu to panic followed by something flying in your face (3-D you know) followed by another ensemble samba number. Millions of kids and Im guessing a few parents will like it well enough. Sergio Mendes returns to oversee the music which is pretty tasty. The movies an acceptable if tiring baby sitter. At one point Jewel chides her children for being addicted to iPods which is ironic given how many young people are destined to see or re-see or re-re-see ""Rio 2"" exactly that way once its theatrical exhibition duty has been fulfilled.mjphillipstribune.com""Rio 2"" - 2 starsMPAA rating GRunning time 141Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Heavy Engineering Manufacturing and Engineering Rio (movie) Anne Hathaway REVIEW Under the Skin  1/2 Latest movie reviews REVIEW Draft Day  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-rio-2-movie-review-20140410,0,3778183.column",200,rio214,rio2,chicagotribune

Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their music-loving daughter Carla (Rachel Crow) enjoy the exotic sounds of the jungle in ""Rio 2."" Photo Blue Sky Studios Twenieth Century Fox Rio 2 review Fun but flawed 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Rio 2 Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Jesse Eisenberg Anne Hathaway George Lopez and Leslie Mann. Directed by Carlos Saldanha. (PG. 101 minutes.) The makers of ""Rio"" really backed themselves in the corner with their last-blue-macaws-on-Earth plot ending the first movie with three brother and sister hatchlings that are somehow supposed to repopulate the species. ""Rio 2"" deftly quashes future inbreeding discussions - a secret second colony of blue macaws is discovered - but the sequel has a new flock of problems. Its a bright and fun movie but also repetitive and overloaded with plot. A nice enough diversion but not a necessary one. Thats the problem with happily ever after Its hard to come up with a story good enough to warrant another chapter. ""Shrek 2"" and the second and third ""Toy Story"" films pulled off this difficult trick. ""Rio 2"" barely tries. The conflicts are similar to the ones in the first ""Rio"" the setting is still South America; and even some of the villains return recycling their same lines and motivations. ""Rio 2"" is saved from sub-mediocrity by its positive vibe and some notably sharp and soaring visuals. The musical interludes in particular provide a lot of the momentum that the narrative otherwise lacks. Its a movie that features clear-cut logging of the Amazon forest and there isnt a moment that feels depressing. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway return as the voices of Blu and Jewel a pet bird and wild bird that were presented in the last film as the last of their species. They discover a new flock members of which ostracize Blu because he trusts humans. The seemingly endless roster of bad guys includes the sadistic Cockatoo from the last film a blue macaw lothario (Bruno Mars) who has his eye on Jewel a rival flock of parrots and the head of the company about to clear-cut the secret grove. Its hard to care because the four screenwriters credited choose one-liners and funny moments over a cohesive narrative. (Eisenberg as Blu becomes distractingly nebbishy. Youll start hoping the new flock of blue macaws includes a good divorce attorney for Jewel.) So many new characters join the old ones that everything feels diluted. Its like the last ""Hobbit"" movie - so much time passes between side plots that you have to jog the memory when a minor character appears again. Whos that toucan again? Is he a bad guy? The filmmakers make the most of Mars and holdovers including will.i.am and Jamie Foxx join a variety of new singers including Kristin Chenoweth as a poison dart frog and the underused Rita Moreno as one of Jewels relatives. None of their songs are especially memorable but it sounds as if the voice actors were having a good time which adds to the movies infectiousness. The sights are also impressive a huge leap beyond previous Blue Sky Studios animation efforts. The key with 3D animation is moderation; knowing when to pull back and when to let the visuals soar. The flight scenes in this sequel are particularly enjoyable. One final note about Bruno Mars who is a terrific addition After his Super Bowl halftime show performance and game-for-anything recent appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" Mars is quickly entering Timberlake territory as a pop star whos becoming impossible not to like. Theyre our first choice for a remake of ""Road to Singapore."" Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

According to Birdlife.org the Spix is in severe danger of extinction due to ""destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended"" and ""the illegal live bird trade."" In the 2011 Rio that rapacious trade throughout Brazils rain forest led to the capturing of Blu (Eisenberg) who was transported to the U.S. and found by the bird-loving bookkeeper Linda (Leslie Mann). Raised as a nerd bird Blu returned to Rio to mate with another survivor the perky indigenous Jewel (Hathaway). In the new sequel Blu Jewel and and their three offspring -- studious Bia (Amandla Stenberg) mischievous Tiago (Pierce Gagnon) and teen-misfit Carla (Rachel Crow) -- fly back to the rain forest and Jewels long-lost kin for a very special episode of Meet the Flockers. (READ Corlisss review of Rio) All very sweet and tweet until human civilization sends in its giant beasts -- dozens of earthmovers -- to cut down the parrots imperiled habitat. Fox News Channel may take this as eco-ganda another attempt from left-wing Hollywood to poison the minds of little ones as The Lorax and The LEGO Movie supposedly did. But director Carlos Saldanha and the new films writers (Carlos Kotkin Jenny Bicks Yoni Brenner and the late Don Rhymer) didnt invent the threat to the Spixs macaw. As Birdlife.org reports ""The last known individual in the wild disappeared at the end of 2000 and no others may remain."" And now on with the show (READ The Socialist toys in The LEGO Movie) Rio 2 faces the problem of any animated sequel introducing new characters -- here Jewels stern father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) his sister Mimi (Rita Moreno) and the preeningly macho Roberto (Bruno Mars) to stoke Blus envy -- while finding work for all the creatures in the first episode. Tullio (Rodrigo Santoro) who protected Jewel while she was in captivity returns as do Blus rambunctious bird pals Rafael (George Lopez) Nico (Jamie Foxx) and Pedro (will.i.am). The cockatoo villain Nigel (Jemaine Clement) seemingly kaput at the end of the first Rio is improbably revived and gets a cross-species love interest in a poisonous frog named Gabi (Kristen Chenoweth). Only the pit bull Luiz (Tracy Morgan) is left behind though he shows up at the end somehow having navigated the 2000-mile inland trek. A little less agreeable and way more aggressive than its better begetter Rio 2 has the overstuffed agenda of a movie thats been focus-grouped to death. Realizing that an animated features prime customers are moms who take their kids the filmmakers paint a feisty sensitivity on the adult females Jewel and Linda while turning Blu and Tullio into clumsy stubborn dolts who endure more humiliation than a freshman at a fraternity hazing. (The two males are subject to about a dozen castration gags.) (SEE How Disney and Pixar toyed with motherhood) More focus-grouping Anticipating Brazils hosting of this summers World Cup the movie conjures an all-bird soccer match avian Quidditch which the city-bred Blu naturally screws up. Nominally an adult he is essentially a troubled kid in a hostile environment -- like the protagonist of virtually every animated feature dating back to Dumbo and Bambi and up to Toy Story 3 and Frozen. Jewel feels at home in the jungle to which Blu who cant cope without his fanny pack and smartphone GPS is the intruder. She Tarzan he Jane. Many a classic musical comedy of the kind the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced through had a disposable script and ineffable production numbers. Rio 2 no classic comes alive whenever it sings and moves. The movies opening celebrates New Years Eve with the vivid ""Sapo Cal"" colors and characters exploding everywhere to the samba percussion of composers Sergio Mendes Carlinho Brown and John Powell. Hathaway exercises her expert chops on the ballad ""Dont Go Away""; Broadway legend Moreno and previous non-singer Garcia duet on ""Beautiful Creatures."" In fact most of the good comedy in Rio 2 is connected with the music as in a snatch of spectacular funny-intentional bad singing (by Bebel Gilberto daughter of Joao Gilberto) or when some cute birdies start to sing ""Memory"" (from Cats -- already a sly joke) and are instantly devoured by a panther. (SEE Our choice of the all-TIME 25 Best Animated Features) Clement nearly stealing the limelight with his Anglo-ham foppery gets an unnecessary but delightful solo -- Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive"" -- and supports Chenoweths knockout diva turn ""Poisonous Love"" (by Brown Powell and lyricist Randy Rogel) which Gabi sings to the sleeping Nigel. Escalating from Broadway patter song to Tristan und Isolde intensity it challenges Josh Gads ""In Summer"" from Frozen as the cleverest and most passionately rendered original number in recent movie history. Enjoy the silly symphony of jungle colors in that lush Avatar palette and unexpected moments of inspiration like the montage of the Blu familys flight to the rain forest in which tourist sites are fleshed out from pop-up book items to the fulfill the movies 3-D potential. Even when its coarse and calculating this is an eager entertainment machine that will keep the kids satisfied. Just dont tell them that the Rio movies are musical comedies about an avian genocide.

(Blue Sky Studios) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 10 2014 1200 PM Title Blu 2 Film Info G Mild violence crude humor. Area theaters. Were grading on a sliding scale here. But if ""Rio 2"" is hardly Pixar quality its certainly better than the average animated sequel. When we last saw the nervous macaw Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) in 2011 he had fallen in love with Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and then they stayed in their native Brazil and started a family. Now theyre settled in Rio de Janeiro with three mischievous kids and Blus life is perfect. The more adventurous Jewel though misses the community she left behind in the wilds of the jungle. So when they wind up in the Amazon rainforest by mistake -- and reunite with friends and family she thought shed never see again -- shes thrilled. Blu on the other hand is miserable. Suddenly hes got a bossy father-in-law (Andy Garcia) interfering in his life. Jewels old boyfriend (a funny Bruno Mars) is a little too interested in her. A bitter Cockatoo (Jemaine Clement) and poisonous frog (Kristin Chenoweth) are stalking him. And surely hes too domesticated to fight the evil loggers ready to decimate Jewels family home? Director Carlos Saldanha aims squarely for the middle neither soaring impressively high nor depressingly low. The jokes are geared toward the G-rated level with mildly amusing supporting turns from Jamie Foxx George Lopez Leslie Mann Tracy Morgan and will.i.am. And the lessons about ecological responsibility while minor are at least commendable. Most impressive the striking vibrancy of the animation. This is the rare movie that earns the extra cost of 3-D glasses. And then of course theres the fact that its out just in time for spring break. Come next week Saldanha may well be the best friend a frazzled parent has.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 744 p.m. EDT April 10 2014Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their three kids arrive in the Amazon for more adventures in ""Rio 2.""(Photo Blue Sky Studios/20th Century Fox)Rio 2 teems with colorful animated splendor and elaborate musical numbers but its rambling hectic if good-hearted story is for the birds ( out of four; rated G; opens Friday nationwide).Blu (affably voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a neurotic macaw formerly from Minneapolis and now living in Rio de Janeiro. Hes found his mate in fellow Brazilian blue macaw Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and they believe they are the last of their kind. Theyre contentedly raising their three young birdies though Blu has a fondness for such creature comforts as kitchen gadgetry and processed foods while Jewel presses for a more natural diet of Brazil nuts.When the film opens this fine feathered family is living comfortably in the Brazilian metropolis which is depicted in all its exotic exuberant fabulousness. But after Blu and Jewel learn they are not the last members of their species they and their little tweeties wing their way to the vibrantly hued rainforest in search of their brethren.SNEAK PEEK In Rio 2 love is not just for the birdsVIDEO Janelle Monae performs on Rio 2 soundtrackREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersJewel joyously reunites with her father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) whom she thought was dead. Eduardo welcomes Jewel and the kids but has mixed feelings about the wimpy Blu deriding him as ""a pet."" Admittedly Blu is rather blind to the splendors of his surroundings and his attempts to fit in with Amazonian ways are predictably disastrous.Blu also must compete with Jewels charming former beau the macho crooner Roberto (Bruno Mars) and contend with meddling Mimi (Rita Moreno) Jewels beloved aunt.The hapless hubby is aggressively pursued by the vengeful cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) who was sucked into a plane engine in the first film (2011sRio) and blames it on Blu. Nigel in turn is being chased by love-struck Gabi (Kristen Chenoweth) a rare pink frog.Looming largest among Blus adversaries is a nasty logger (Miguel Ferrer) bent on ruining the habitat. Linda (Leslie Mann) Blus former human companion and her husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) stumble upon the colony of macaws and help thwart the tree-cutting.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Rio 2 Blu begrudgingly leaves the big city to help Jewel and their kids reconnect with their Amazon roots. VPCAdding to the cluttered feel of this Amazon holiday are singing and dancing creatures from the first film. Pedro (will i.am ) a cardinal and Nico (Jamie Foxx) a canary are a rapping duo and Rafael (George Lopez) is a festive toucan who have their own forced subplot involving a talent show.The Brazilian music is particularly rousing with lyrics sung in both Portuguese and English and the addition of Mars and Chenoweth adds a vibrant element to the soundtrack. But with so many characters and subplots theres a hectic feel and a lack of focus.Blessedly the story is devoid of potty humor but the fish-out-of-water or bird-out-of-cage jokes are too predictable.The colors and intricate dancing and flying sequences as directed by Brazilian-born Carlos Saldanha are stunning. But this sequel feels frenetic mashing up an ecological message with a survivalist journey a love story a tale of redemption and an American Idol-like singing competition.For those seeking a more clever Amazon-centered tale it might be worth tracking down 1992s FernGully The Last Rainforest which had a more pointed environmental message and catchier tunes. 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1gQ1FNI",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/04/10/rio-2-review/6888613/,200,rio218,rio2,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There is a puzzlingly extensive history in computer-animated films (especially sequels) of stories about confronting the perils of fatherhood. From Ice Age Dawn Of The Dinosaurs and Shrek Forever After to Finding Nemo and this years Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman nearly every animation studio has a film designed to occupy kids with kaleidoscopically bright colors while dealing with adult domestic consternation. Rio 2 is another addition to that legacy shifting from the romantic-comedy adventure of the first installment to depict the difficulties of compromising an ideal lifestyle to adjust for family responsibilities. Following the events of the previous film endangered Spixs macaw Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) now have three rambunctious kids. They live in Brazil with coupled owners Linda (Leslie Mann) and Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro the hated Paulo from Lost) who now work together as ornithologists. Jewel wants the kids to know how to survive in the wild while Blu struggles to let go of his domestic perks. While on an expedition Linda and Tulio uncover a hidden flock of Spixs macaws inspiring Jewel and Blu to take their kids on a journey through the Amazon. But the owners also run afoul of an illegal logging operation that threatens the birds secluded habitat. Once out in the forest Blu and his family find the macaws including Jewels missing father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and pretty-boy childhood friend Roberto (Bruno Mars). Blus over-reliance on technology--he brings along a fanny pack with a GPS and breath mints--doesnt mesh with Eduardos anti-human leadership. And his discomfort with rainforest life puts him at odds with his rejuvenated partner and thriving kids. He doesnt fit in sure but its because he fears inadequacy and the community wont make room for a strange bird of his type. Like the first film Rio 2 is almost oppressively bright bombarding the screen with flashes of saturated rainforest colors and even a bird version of soccer (timed a bit too perfectly to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil). But what really drags things down is an overabundance of subplots. Will.I.Am Jamie Foxx and George Lopezs characters all tag along into the forest under the guise of scouting new talent for Carnival. The auditions (especially an inspired use of capoeira) are the funniest part of the film but theyre also a largely unnecessary time-filler. And Nigel (Jemaine Clement) the disgraced evil cockatoo from the original reappears in a bumbling attempt at revenge accompanied by a lovestruck tree frog (Kristin Chenoweth) and a vaudevillian hungry anteater. Think of these superfluous characters as an additional comic-relief insurance policy. Rio was largely confined to the Brazilian city leading up to Carnival and stuck to a smaller subtextual purview of anti-smuggling and endangered animal protection. Rio 2 expands this viewpoint underlining rainforest conservation deforestation and broader state-mandated preservation. Put another way If Fox News found the blatant satirical humor of The Muppets anti-capitalist somebody will find a way to clutch pearls over the environmentalist message and industrial villain here (regardless of his business deliberately shady nature). But despite the attempts at broadening the secondary ideological themes this is another familiar father-in-crisis tale dotted with musical interludes for Chenoweth and Clement and dressed in brighter plumage.

Photo Blue Sky Studios MOVIE REVIEW Rio 2 Running time 101 minutes. Rated G (nothing objectionable). At the 84th Street the Empire the Magic Johnson others ""Rio 2"" is not what I would call Amazon prime but its got enough silly songs and daffy critters to keep the little ones happy. Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) a rare blue macaw from Minnesota reckons ""Im not the birdliest bird in the flock."" Yeah we figured. He wears a fanny pack. Also he needs a GPS to find his way from his urban home in Rio de Janeiro to the Amazon rain forest where he and his mate Jewel (Anne Hathaway) decide to visit their old human pals naturalists who have discovered more members of the exotic species. Anne Hathaway voices Jewel (left) and Bruno Mars voices Roberto (right).Photo Blue Sky Studios ""Rio 2"" a sequel to the hugely successful 2011 animated feature piles up the conflicts without making any of them especially scary (or interesting). Theres a pompous cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) who is bent on revenge after his plot to kidnap Blu failed in the first film; evil loggers who want to clear-cut the refuge of the blue macaws ruffled feathers between Blu and a new character Jewels disapproving dad (Andy Garcia); and in a development that seems to have come straight from the marketing department a soccer game in which Blu finds himself playing a star role. (Brazil is hosting the World Cup this year and the film is already playing there.) Still I had to smile when a referee pulls out a canary to use as a yellow card. Gabi a poisonous frog is voiced by Kristen Chenoweth.Photo Blue Sky Studios The movie isnt in any particular hurry to get where its going which is fine because Blu and Jewel are likable enough even if theyre upstaged by the nutty romance between the stuffed shirt thespian Nigel and a poison tree frog (Kristin Chenoweth) who cant touch him lest she kill him. Her love song to him is one of the highlights of the film whose dazzling colors and lushly imagined scenery give it a chirpy energy. Much of the films DNA is shared with the ""Ice Age"" franchise Director Carlos Saldanha directed or co-directed three of those films which like this one is a product of the Blue Sky animation studio. Pixars storytellers dont need to fear anything from the folks at Blue Sky The loggers for instance are such vaguely-defined background figures that they never feel like a serious threat and the disapproving father-in-law gag is straight out of a 1960s sitcom. The movie is ever ready to drop everything for some cute slapstick or light goofing around with Blus friends. Like the city its named after though ""Rio 2"" proudly stands for music colors and partying. Unlike the city though at least the movie wont leave you with a hangover a sunburn or a missing wallet.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Having settled down with his mate Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to raise three hatchlings in a Rio de Janeiro sanctuary blue macaw Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) learns from the T.V. that biologists have discovered a flock of his own endangered species in a remote region of the Amazon. The family migrates to the jungle where Jewel finds her father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) a Great Santini figure who cant relate to Blus domesticated attachment to the GPS he keeps in his fanny pack. Mean parrot Nigel (Jemaine Clement) having been resurrected between films via some improbably human emergency medical intervention pursues the family bent on revenge. Rio 2 wants to be a musical but instead of timing songs to say the emotional peaks of the characters director Carlos Saldanha opts for high-intensity intervals of singing every four minutes.Whenever the writers cant come up with a deafening enough punch line they just kill something as a gag -- piranhas leap out of the river and munch a chorus line of capybaras to their bones; a jaguar leaps out of the foliage and swallows a ""Memories""-singing arboreal ingenue. Oh and theres some stuff about loggers cutting down the jungle.Film Details Rio 2 RatingG GenreAnimation Running Time101 min.

From the Ice Age series which the Brazilian co-directed through to his new Rio franchise every movie he makes is stuffed with warmth charm and simple but effective lessons about family responsibility and friendship. Sure they can tip over into sentimentality - theres a lullaby scene in Rio 2 thatll have cynics reaching for sick bags - but theres no denying the integrity. Rio 2 finds our avian hero Blue (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) living happily with his wife and chicks in Brazil. But when an entire flock of their rare species the Spixs Macaw is discovered deep in the Amazon Blue and his brood swoop off to investigate. There are problems here the middle hour runs perilously close to the story of Meet the Parents and a subplot involving a talent show feels a little calculating. But the characterisation is feisty and memorable the song-and-dance sequences intricate and colourful and itll charm the socks off little people.

TWITTER Anne Hathaway Jesse Eisenberg and Jemaine Clement return for Carlos Saldanhaas sequel joined by Kristin Chenoweth and Andy Garcia. Again pegging its 3D Rio series to an April release date 20th Century Fox Animation looks set to benefit from the final weeks of the spring break holiday period as vacations draw to a close. Despite recent uneven response to family-friendly animated fare from an over-saturated demographic the sequel stands to capitalize on strong franchise recognition and association with the studios hugely popular Ice Age movies also directed by Rio 2s Carlos Saldanha. As Fox continues to roll out its international release following the films March 27 opening in Brazil it can aspire to notch in the neighborhood of the originals 486 million tally although a larger share of Rio 2s total take can probably be expected from home-entertainment formats. Rios impressive voice cast returns for the second outing largely intact augmented by some notable additions including Andy Garcia as a patriarchal parrot and singer-songwriter Bruno Mars in a tunefully comedic role. Although the significance of some of the musical and visual references may not register with the youngest viewers theres plenty here to attract both kids and adults alike in Saldanhas colorful imagining of the Amazon rain forests avian communities. AUDIO Kristin Chenoweth Jemaine Clement Cover I Will Survive on Rio 2 Soundtrack Opening with one of the movies frequent musical numbers Rio 2 finds Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) settled down with mate Jewel (Anne Hathaway) in Rio de Janeiro raising a brood of three young blue macaws in the heart of the city. And even if he doesnt totally fit in now that hes mostly cut ties with his former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) hes making a good show of it celebrating a traditional New Years Eve high above one of Rios iconic beaches where local residents congregate. Although she grasps her familys precarious position as potentially the last of their rare species for her part free-spirited Jewel hasnt quite shaken off the call of the wild. So when her former guardian geeky ornithologist Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) and Linda make an expedition to the Amazon rain forest shortly after their marriage and discover the existence of a surviving group of endangered blue macaws Jewel decides its time for the family to get back to their rain-forest roots with a trip to the jungle making good on the movies ""Its on in the Amazon"" tagline. Bookish little bird Bia (Amandla Stenberg) hellraiser Tiago (Pierce Gagnon) and aloof teen Carla (Rachel Crow) are up for the trip but Blu can only consider making the journey with a supply of creature comforts stashed in his fanny pack including an all-purpose multi-tool and GPS navigation he can use to locate Linda and Tulio in the forest. PHOTOS Top 10 Movie Songs of All Time Blus buds pile on for the adventure including party-hearty toucan Rafael (George Lopez) and his sidekicks the musically inclined Nico (Jamie Foxx) and Pedro (the Black Eyed Peas will.i.am). Two thousand miles from Rio in the depths of the Amazon rain forest they encounter a fiercely independent band of dozens of blue macaws led by proud patriarch Eduardo (Andy Garcia) along with his sister Mimi (Rita Moreno) and the preening protector Roberto (Bruno Mars) Jewels childhood playmate. The clincher however is that Eduardo is Jewels long-lost father whos leading the defense of their isolated forest habitat against encroaching loggers. Blu and his family are also menaced by his former nemesis the brain-addled cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) who was badly injured at the conclusion of Rio but returns more evil than ever. Although now flightless hes resolutely bent on revenge and accompanied by an admiring protege the poisonous frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth). Whether Blu can prove his worth to his disdainful new father-in-law and help offer an effective defense against the mounting threats to his adoptive avian tribes forest enclave present towering challenges for a formerly domesticated bird now tentatively reclaiming his wild side. Although the writing team of Don Rhymer (who passed away in 2012) Carlos Kotkin Jenny Bicks and Yoni Brenner tends more toward cloying character humor than the situational comedy that propelled brisk pacing and abundant thrills in Rio the script remains well attuned to the comic talents of the individual actors and moments of inspired zaniness are frequently uproarious particularly when instigated by the moody Method-acting Nigel. STORY Rio 2 Adds Kristin Chenoweth Bruno Mars to Voice Cast With the nefarious bird smugglers of the original movie replaced by more diffuse threats to the rain-forest habitat Blus ongoing obstacles relate more to inter-avian issues than direct threats to beak and wing. The subplot tracking the advance of the menacing loggers at least has topicality in its favor although it remains too generalized to represent an advantageously teachable moment. A soccer-inspired competition for dominance of the forest grove inhabited by Eduardos macaw clan in homage to Brazil hosting the upcoming 2014 World Cup offers some more relatable action however. Hathaway and Eisenberg although perhaps an odd pairing on paper are well matched as the endangered blue macaws now guardians of the next generation. Hathaways line readings animatedly convey Jewels spirited personality as well as her affectionate impatience with her mates abundant phobias. It takes little effort for Eisenberg to make Blus neuroses believable although all the anxiety begins to wear a bit by the midpoint. Although singing clearly isnt Eisenbergs strong suit Hathaway really gets the chance to shine with her vocal performances. The three young actors playing the pairs offspring provide plenty of energy in roles that will be instantly recognizable from any number of animated films and TV sitcoms. The other returning castmembers pretty much reprise their Rio supporting roles although their screen time is diminished to make room for new characters with Chenoweth and Garcia the real standouts. Playing the petite poisonous frog Gabi Chenoweth literally drips with amusingly outsize menace but scores major points primarily for her two duets with Clements megalomaniacal Nigel particularly in a ridiculously re-jiggered version of Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive."" Garcias turn as Jewels proudly independent father with exaggerated expectations for his family members is so effectively accomplished that it could have come straight out of any of his previous live-action comedic roles. STORY Rio 2 Soundtrack Set for Release March 25 Saldanha recently honored as CinemaCons International Filmmaker of the Year never seems to run out of inspiration engendered by his native Brazil. Although the technique of employing Carnaval as a plot contrivance has probably run its course over two movies now the sheer diversity of rain-forest plants and animals he draws upon for roles in Rio 2 is enthralling. Under Saldanhas guidance an extensive team of animators and visual effects artists elevates the 3D format to an alluring level with character details dense background imagery and often complex action and aerial sequences (including the requisite Busby Berkeley-inspired musical number) appearing effortlessly executed. Easily recognizable Brazilian music particularly bossa nova and samba comprised the rhythmic heart of Rio but in the sequel the filmmakers branch out with a range of styles performed by a stellar lineup of musicians that adds national treasure Milton Nascimento and includes returning Carlinhos Brown and Sergio Mendes who also serves as executive music producer. Musical artists Janelle Monae and Bruno Mars sound more contemporary notes with songs that are prominently featured on the films recently released soundtrack album.

"Rio 2 Review More Is Less in Overstuffed Sequel | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Rio 2 Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 3 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 26 2014 | 0900PM PT Domestic and ecological dramas abound in this bright noisy overstuffed sequel to Foxs 2011 surprise hit. A rather misleading title is just one reason to be slightly suspicious of ""Rio 2"" an eye-popping ear-tickling animated sequel that labors to fold a cheeky family sitcom an earnest environmental primer an exotic jungle tour a broad survey of popular music and an avian remake of ""Meet the Parents"" into one bright and noisy package. Mining an unwieldy number of domestic and ecological dramas from the continuing saga of a rare Brazilian blue macaw here venturing with his new family into the perilous Amazon rainforest this hyperactive toon extravaganza has color flair and energy to burn. But its the sort of relentless juggling act that finally proves more exhausting than exhilarating as it lectures you about respecting Mother Nature one minute knocks you over with a Gloria Gaynor cover the next and squeezes in a lot of questionable comic relief in between. For those not inclined to resist this over-insistent brand of educational entertainment Foxs latest collaboration with Blue Sky Studios should deliver still more of the winning formula that made the moderately charming ""Rio"" a surprise 2011 hit grossing 486 million worldwide. Of that amount about 341 million came from overseas and ""Rio 2"" is already off to a similarly sunny start internationally having grossed more than 10 million in a few territories (it opens March 27 in Brazil and April 11 Stateside). What may lend the film an extra commercial boost is an aggressively pre-marketed soundtrack that offers a vigorous fusion of hip-hop beats samba riffs and Broadway-style showstoppers (once again overseen by composer John Powell executive music producer Sergio Mendes and songwriter Carlinhos Brown). As a result ""Rio 2"" plays even more like a full-blown musical than its predecessor did reflecting a general spirit of inflation thats evident from the opening scenes more jubilant revelry in the streets of Rio de Janeiro more fireworks exploding over Christ the Redeemer and more town-vs.-country lifestyle angst for Blu (again appealingly voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (the sweet-toned Anne Hathaway) the extremely rare blue macaws who were united at the end of the first film. Now theyve got three cute spirited chicks (Rachel Crow Pierce Gagnon and Amandla Stenberg) and are living more or less happily ever after although the Minnesota-raised Blu still exasperates the jungle-born Jewel with his reliance on man-made gadgets and amenities; instead of fetching fresh Brazil nuts for breakfast the way she does hell cook the kids pancakes instead. Part of Jewel longs for the family to return to nature and she gets her wish when Blus former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and her wildlife-enthusiast husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) discover evidence that the blue macaws may be not be quite so endangered a species as initially feared. Eager to reunite with others of their own kind Jewel convinces Blu and the kids to embark with her on a 2000-mile journey into the rainforest where the macaws were spotted braving such dangers as boa constrictors tarantulas and piranhas. Also along for the trip naturally are party-hearty toucan Rafael (George Lopez) and that rap-happy duo of cardinal Pedro (will.i.am) and canary Nico (Jamie Foxx) there to ensure that not a single moment passes unsullied by rat-a-tat banter or random beatboxing. (Mercifully Luiz the slobbering bulldog voiced by Tracy Morgan is left behind in Rio for most of the pics duration.) The screenplay (by returning scribe Don Rhymer and three new writers) fleshed out from a story by Brazilian-born director Carlos Saldanha (taking the helming reins once more) does a shrewd enough job of building on the central tension of the first film Blu may have left the pleasures of human captivity behind in ""Rio"" but this nerd-bird has yet to give up his creature comforts entirely. Hes reminded of this when the macaw tribe they stumble upon turns out to be Jewels long-lost presumed-dead family ruled over by her proud authoritarian father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) who is delighted by his daughters return but is rather less taken with her former housepet (er ""companion"") of a husband. Not helping matters is the presence of Jewels childhood playmate Roberto (Bruno Mars) now a soft-crooning Rico Suave type who understandably brings out Blus jealous side. Thats more than enough dramatic conflict to sustain a 101-minute kids movie especially when almost every plot turn is signaled by some sort of musical performance or interlude. ""O vida"" sung in both Portuguese and English accompanies Blu and his familys journey from Rio to the rainforest while ""Beautiful Creatures"" performed by the Brazilian body-percussion group Barbatuques is a lovely tribute to the macaws natural way of life illustrated in synchronized flying routines that grant full expression to the films vibrant colors and exquisite textures (which look particularly striking and tactile in 3D). Elsewhere Hathaway gets to show off her superb singing voice in the lovely lullaby ""Dont Go Away"" while other cast members including will.i.am Foxx Crow Garcia and Rita Moreno (cast here as Jewels aunt) strut their stuff in ""Batucada Familia"" a climactic number set during an Amazon version of Carnaval. The music is lovely if rarely memorable (theres nothing here to give the ""Frozen"" soundtrack a run for its money). But ""Rio 2"" begins to feel like a narrative blender gone berserk as subplot after subplot takes the stage. First the eco-conscious Linda and Tulio run afoul of some shady deforesters encroaching on the macaws habitat; then in an unrelated and ultimately unnecessary strand Blu and Jewels old nemesis the malevolent cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) hatches a deranged revenge scheme that for some reason occasions a hammy rendition of ""I Will Survive."" His accomplice is Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth) a strikingly visualized pink dart frog whos madly in love with Nigel but whose venomous flesh makes it impossible for her to act on her cross-species desires; their nutty Mrs. Lovett-Sweeney Todd dynamic reaches an amusingly demented peak in Gabis solo number ""Poisonous Love"" performed with showtune-style verve by the very game Chenoweth. Sounds fun no? Sometimes it is. But its typical of the competing agendas in ""Rio 2"" that the experience of watching it is sometimes like attending a block party at a wildlife preserve where someone barks orders at you every five minutes Dont cut down that tree Put away that GPS/smartphone/iPod Happy wife happy life Look out for that cockatoo As Saldanha and his collaborators orchestrate a reconciliation between domesticated Blu and his more rugged relatives leading to an epic men-vs.-macaws battle thats just a few bodies shy of Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" the final lessons of this silly overstuffed story -- protect your family and protect the environment all while dancing the night away -- feel by turns inarguable well-meaning and a bit harder to swallow than they should be.
