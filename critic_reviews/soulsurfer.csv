Her story is tailor-made for an inspirational film so the makers dont look beyond the obvious delivering a succession of would-be rousing cliches. Ones soul remains resolutely unstirred even if the surf sequences are engrossing and convincing (thanks in no small part to stuntwork from Ms Hamilton) AnnaSophia Robb meets the physical demands of the central role and parental support from Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt is surprisingly classy. Viewers who dont share Hamiltons faith however may find that (admittedly authentic) aspect tougher to take not least when American Idol winner Carrie Underwood holds court as a stomach-churningly sincere Christian youth worker. With the Lord on Hamiltons side triumph is made to seem glossily inevitable and hence less dramatically potent since its actually the moments of post-attack doubt that make the most impact.

I watched this on a subscription TV service as I enjoy a spot of surfing and the true story aspect seemed like it might have a good narrative. I get that it is a light hearted family movie but the script at times is really poor and they seem to skirt around any real dramatic feeling towards the keys aspect of the film (The loss of a limb). The surgeon walks in saying hey hows my favourite patient in an upbeat hawaiian shirt after shes just woken for the first time since the accident and is yet to face the reality of the situation. Its a shame as with a little more realistic drama and reality the messages they seem so keen to promote about faith and christianity might get through to viewers without feeling forced. On the plus side the special FX are fine the 2 known actors Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid are fine considering. The surf shots are nicely shot and the film is well produced. The script and choice of mood at times just ruins what I imagine is a moving real life story.

Then before you know it a shark tears off 13-year-old Bethany Hamiltons (Race to Witch Mountains AnnaSophia Robb) arm. Beside her her best friend screams but Bethany appears calm. A calm that you might call shock except its a composure that prevails (along with a carefree can-do attitude) even after the traumatic attack as she fumbles plates of oranges struggles to tie her pony tail misses out on her Rip Curl photo shoot and otherwise adjusts to a one-armed existence. Minus of course a few sniffles and moist moments that dont come close to what youd expect under the circumstances -- a promising pro surfer handicapped just as shes staring to make a splash in the scene. It makes us all look like drama queens for lamenting common catastrophes like broken legs and tax returns. Perhaps her stoicism stems from her family arguably the most loving and supportive parents (Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid) and brothers. A surfing mom and pop still in love enough to canoodle on the beach and challenge each other to surfing matches while their children score them from the shore. Or it could be due to her fairy god-mother/youth counselor Sarah (Carrie Underwood) who helps her get perspective by showing her walnut close-ups and taking her on a mission to help tsunami survivors in Thailand. Soul Surfer seems simply too sugar-coated to be true. When the blond beautiful pearly teethed Bethany yanks an arm off her Barbie its a perfect likeness -- of the movie her (not the lisping braces-wearing 13-year-old who wrote the biography the film as based on). Yet in interviews and footage that plays as the credits roll the real-life Bethany seems much like movie Bethany -- optimistic nonplussed determined to triumph -- and most of the films characters appear to be based on real people in her life. Maybe whats unbelievable is Robbs acting or director Sean McNamara overselling and glossing his postcard-perfect Hawaii. If you werent already thinking it his peppy pop score spells it out for you ""this is the life"" On the other hand Hunt and Quaid (Hunt especially) deliver their share (and then some) of anguish and anxiety about Bethanys accident. So maybe Soul Surfer is truer than it looks. Even if its not its an inspiring feel-good biopic chock full of life-affirming spiritual lessons that would especially appeal to young girls families and anyone fond of saying they ""owe it all to Jesus"". And who wouldnt want to root for an upbeat underdog who defiantly competes against two-armed surfers (with her dads custom board)? Though the surfing footage disappoints overall -- more glowing soul surfing into the light glamour shots than sports quality competition footage. That could be another reason why despite the profoundness of Bethanys plight Soul Surfer might make you feel like you never left the shallows. It makes one wonder if a Soul Surfer documentary wouldnt have been a better idea.

""Soul Surfer"" is a by-the-book biopic about Bethany Hamilton the real-life teen surfer who lost an arm in a shark attack and then fought her way back to competition and a renewed sense of self. Its an inspiring story but as directed by Sean McNamara not an especially inspiring movie. Hamilton is played blandly by Anna Sophia Robb and her devoted parents less bland are played by Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt. The surfing footage much of it shot off the coast of Kauai is not bland at all.

So it comes as a nice surprise that as of today there are three young heroines for moviegoers to cheer on as a feral teen named Hanna and a resilient survivor named Bethany join the ever-intrepid Jane Eyre on the big screen. Charlotte Brontes protagonist continues her saga anew in director Cary Fukunagas gorgeously atmospheric film starring Mia Wasikowska. But adaptations of 19th-century tales can tell us only so much about present-day teenage girls. So its good to have the determined Hanna and Bethany take on bravado be it real or fantastical engineered or nurtured secular or faith-based (Christian we should add). To tease an album title of yore Hanna and Bethany could be the twin daughters of different mothers. One fights. The other surfs. Hanna kills. Bethany struggles to heal. Each is determined. Each is confounded at times by the hand shes been dealt. And each has a father who pushes his only daughter past her doubts. Irish actress Saoirse Ronan reunites with ""Atonement"" director Joe Wright in the propulsive ""Hanna."" We first meet her as she tracks a reindeer in a snowy field -- with bow and arrow. ""I missed your heart"" she tells her felled quarry with what might be regret. Its hard to tell with Hanna because shes been raised in such isolation. Eric Bana portrays Erik. The CIA asset has trained his daughter to be lethally ready for the necessary battle with Marissa Wiegler the colleague responsible for their off-the-grid exile. If youve seen the thumping racing preview then you know Hanna executes her task efficiently. Only the woman she dispatches is not Wiegler. The red bob that a finely focused Cate Blanchett wears does nothing to thaw the ice in the real Marissas veins. Shes a wicked witch with a Texas drawl. Ignoring CIA protocol to hunt down Erik and Hanna she contracts with an off-the- books killer named Isaacs. Baby-faced Tom Hollander seems to have taken his inspiration from the creepy insouciance of baddies from ""A Clockwork Orange"" and Michael Hanekes terribly unfunny chiller ""Funny Games."" Hes oh so pleased with himself so poisonous. He whistles while he works and his nasty biz leaves collateral damage. Hanna is overprepared for conflict and woefully unschooled in just about everything else friendship first kisses and more. ""Hanna"" plays out as a visceral fairy tale about a naif discovering a world both fascinating and dangerous. ""Soul Surfer"" meanwhile unfolds as a faith- based reality-inspired parable. Denver native AnnaSophia Robb portrays Bethany Hamilton who in 2003 lost her left arm in a shark attack in Hawaii. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt offer a steady presence (and comfortingly professional performances) as parents Tom and Cheri. Based on Hamiltons 2004 memoir ""Soul Surfer"" recounts the incident and her recovery. Hamilton now 21 remains a competitor on the professional circuit. And last month she was in Denver along with Robb for the movies Colorado premiere at the Women + Film Voices Film Festival. With its emphasis on a kind of honed invincibility ""Hanna"" doesnt take fear seriously. Thats part of the point. When a new friend asks her ""Are you scared?"" Hanna replies ""Of what?"" But ""Soul Surfer"" faces fears head on. After all getting back in the water was hard enough for the masses who went to Steven Spielbergs ""Jaws."" What must it be like for Hamilton to paddle back into that blue expanse after her near-fatal encounter? And then theres her not-unreasonable confusion about Gods plan. Robb does an able job of capturing that anxiety and spiritual anguish. And the combination of prosthetics and special effects used to render her wound is at once fascinating and convincing. But shes not helped here by the script. Directed and co written by Sean McNamara (""Bratz"") ""Soul Surfer"" is preachier than it needs to be. Theres much that is moving and admirable about the Hamilton family bond and its religious foundation. Theres plenty to trust in Bethanys story without straining to prove its evangelical cred. While there may be too much telling once Bethany hits the waves -- before and especially after the attack -- the movie shot by John Leonetti puts on an inspiring show. Still the films best pleasure comes in its depiction of the relationship between Bethany and best friend and fellow surfer Alana Blanchard (Lorraine Nicholson Jacks girl). There the morning Bethany was attacked Alana struggles with her friends loss. Sure there is a half-hearted mean-girl subplot. Sonya Balmores Chung does spiky work as a ""no-apologies-forthcoming"" competitor. But its Bethany and Alanas friendship -- its sturdiness and vulnerability its laughs and sincere apologies -- that rules the day.

Joe Neumaier Friday April 8 2011 400 AM SOUL SURFER  A teenage surfer recovers from a horrific shark attack. (146). PG. At area theaters. A by-the-numbers biopic about young surfer Bethany Hamilton (AnnaSophia Robb) whose sports trajectory hit a bump when her arm was bitten off by a shark. Despite the setback Hamilton became a top wave rider and the shots of her in action are great to watch. But those moments are too heavily edited to be fully exhilarating and the films depiction of her family and friends is from a pious standard TV-movie-style kit -- just add water. Dennis Quaid lends some needed saltiness as Hamiltons supportive dad. MEET MONICA VELOUR A teenager searches for a former porn star (138). R Sexuality. At Clearview Chelsea.Its sweet that ""Meet Monica Velour"" has an appreciation for idiosyncratic side trips in pop culture such as weird-looking food-service trucks and 1980s porn stars. One comes away from the movie however feeling like too many of these passions were stuffed into its herky-jerky story of a teenage nerd (Dustin Ingram) who sets out for Indiana to get an autograph from his fave former Triple-X star (Kim Cattrall). The dorkster and the pornster strike up an odd friendship and a gentle Americana seeps through. The deepest chord is hit by Cattrall who almost manages to wipe away the memory of ""Sex and the City 2.""HENRYS CRIME An ex-con uses a theater company as a cover for a heist (148). R. At the Sunshine and Clearview 1st amp; 62nd St.Keanu Reeves gives an adroit turn in this pleasantly deadpan caper as Henry an ex-con framed for a heist he knew nothing about. Released from prison and with the help of a wry career criminal (spot-on James Caan) he decides to actually rip off the bank he served time for robbing. Vera Farmiga (""Source Code"" ""Up in the Air"") is the no-BS would-be actress whose theater is located conveniently next to the target. Director Malcolm Venville who made the British gangster flick ""44 Inch Chest"" has a strong handle on the tone so even the familiar twists feel fresh.

"Soul Surfer review After horrific incident a surfer returns to her sport |       NJ.com comments Soul Surfer review After horrific incident a surfer returns to her sport Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 08 2011 at 822 AM View/Post Comments Mario PerezFrom left Dennis Quaid Helen Hunt and AnnaSophia Robb in ""Soul Surfer"" a family movie with a strong message about faith. Can a movie preach a message without getting preachy? Thats been a problem faced by a lot of films made by or marketed to faith-based communities. They have a point that they want to make. And too often they have a scene that yells Heres our point Its a danger that ""Soul Surfer"" mostly avoids -- but like staying on that board its a balancing act. Beautifully photographed on location in Hawaii with a few solid names among the cast this slick family movie is the story of Bethany Hamilton a young athlete who lost her arm to a shark but fought her way back to her sport. Anyone who was watching morning news shows or picking up news weeklies eight years ago remembers the story. But what you might have forgotten was that Bethany credited her Christian faith with helping her persevere. Movie Review SOUL SURFER (PG) TriStar/Film District (106 min.) Directed by Sean McNamara. With AnnaSophia Robb Helen Hunt Dennis Quaid. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains some disturbing material. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS These filmmakers havent forgotten nor should they; religion is a part of this story because its a big part of Bethanys life. Making sure it has the right emphasis on-screen though takes work and the going sometimes gets a little choppy. Still the film is helped immeasurably by its setting and some gorgeous surf photography that literally gets inside the curling waves to show us these trim sun-burnt teens practically defying gravity. Helping too is a solid cast. Dennis Quaid the go-to guy for dads in family films is a nice presence as Bethanys father. Helen Hunt a little more relaxed than usual is a plus as her mom (and shows off some surprising surf moves herself). And AnnaSophia Robb holds it all together as Bethany suggesting both the girls determination and her doubts. Its on the faith question that the movie is occasionally clunky. Theres a bit too much of Carrie Underwood as a flatly written youth pastor and a few too many plugs for the World Vision charity that Bethany devoted her time to. And theologically the film may ask more of some audiences than theyre willing to give. Its one thing to use Bethanys story as an example of how faith can keep us going; its a bit more to insist that her awful accident was obviously part of a divine plan. (Did the plan have to include permanent maiming?) Putting those secular objections aside though the film is well produced (the production crew are mostly tween-TV vets) and free of bad language substance abuse and all the other things so many parents cringe at when they take a youngster to the movies. The faith issue? Thats a difficult balance to strike and one that never pleases everyone (the films IMDB page already contains a viewer complaint that the movie doesnt proselytize enough). But for plenty of family viewers this film will catch a wave.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 08 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English An inspiring tale even when true doesnt necessarily make for an inspiring movie. The facts may speak for themselves but if the goal is to turn them into a dramatic feature they have to be made to speak eloquently and touchingly. On screen at least life needs an assist from art to seem real and without that help the heart stays unmoved. Well it barely budges here - Soul Surfer is a true story that plays like bad fiction. Movies Soul Surfer The official trailer The facts are this. Back in 2003 still in her early teens Bethany Hamilton was a talented surfer riding the waves at school competitions in her native Hawaii. Then one fateful October day a shark attack took off her left arm up to the shoulder. Mere months later buoyed by her Christian faith Bethany returned to the water adjusted her technique and continued to compete well enough to eventually join the pro ranks and enjoy success at the highest level. Inspirational indeed. So why isnt the movie? That gaggle of screenwriters is the first bad sign - turns out most of them are Baywatch alumni and apparently keen to prove it. Proof comes early with voice-over narration on the order of ""Life is an adventure and sometimes you wipe out."" Quickly it looks like heavy weather on the dialogue front and Im afraid the forecast doesnt improve. Expect even the best actors to wipe out. So no blame should attach to AnnaSophia Robb in the title role. The establishing scenes show her as a model kid in the model family attending church with mom and dad (Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid) or strutting her stuff in those famous breakers off the North Shore. Director Sean McNamara captures the surfing action adequately if not thrillingly then dives the camera underwater and rumbles the score. Oh its just some clever foreshadowing a false alarm. When the actual attack does come her brush with death gives the picture its one spark of life - the quick-witted ministrations of a friend the frantic rush to the hospital the massive loss of blood the verdict of an astonished doctor that her survival is ""a living miracle."" But from there as the script pads its line count of cliches the miracle starts to look awfully mundane. The one-armed Bethany climbs back on her board struggles through a few minor setbacks and a single moment of weakness (""I cant do this any more"") then heads off to post-tsunami Thailand with her church leader (singer-turned-sort-of-actor Carrie Underwood) to check out some real suffering and feel relatively blessed. Oh I forgot to mention a cameo appearance by the Venus de Milo - not much of a surfer but in Bethanys eyes a beacon of beauty for the limbless. Along the way perhaps fearful of getting typecast as a Bible-thumper the film goes light on our heroines ardent Christianity. Here the soul in the surfer is more secular than spiritual with New Testament quotes giving way to old chestnuts like ""I have to believe something good is going to come of this."" No doubt for the real Bethany Hamilton and for those she has truly inspired much good did come of this - what didnt alas is anything resembling a good movie.

But the inspiration gets bogged down in overly cliched storytelling. Starring Dennis Quaid AnnaSophia Robb Helen Hunt Carrie Underwood Craig T. Nelson Kevin Sorbo Jeremy Sumpter Lorraine Nicholson David Chokachi Ross Thomas Director Sean McNamara Running time 145 Release Opened Apr 8 2011  Editorial Review Platitudes sink see-worthy taleBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 8 2011Based on the memoir of Bethany Hamilton -- a surfer who at 13 lost her arm in a 2003 shark attack and then went on to become a top-rated pro -- ""Soul Surfer"" contains enough platitudes to stock a Hallmark shop. Like little waves they break one after the other in a screenplay credited to director Sean McNamara and three other writers (six if you count the ""screen story"" credits). But the whopper comes when Bethany played by an appealing and fresh-faced AnnaSophia Robb visits Phuket Thailand to help with relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake and catastrophic wave there. Love she tells us is ""bigger than any tsunami.""If a line like that triggers your gag reflex then this tale of the triumph of pluck over adversity is probably not for you. Its not that the movie is relentlessly upbeat. To its credit McNamaras dramatization confronts Bethanys doubts as much as it credits her Christian faith. But it never fully escapes its Pollyannaish vibe. The swells of inspirational storytelling sometimes threaten to swamp the underlying inspirational story.The basic facts are handled without too much fuss. One morning while surfing with family friends in Hawaii a shark tears off Bethanys arm just below the shoulder. Theres lots of blood in the water in this brief but scary scene but McNamara wisely pulls back focusing on Bethanys stoic face instead of on the gore. We barely see the injury let alone the shark. For the next several minutes its like an episode of ""ER"" with paramedics barking things like ""hypovolemic shock"" and other medicalese as the girl is rushed to the hospital. Within weeks shes talking about getting back into the water.Now most normal parents would probably balk at this. But Bethanys mother and father (Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid looking suitably sun-baked and crinkly-eyed) are like their daughter surfing-obsessed. Soon Bethany is back on her board though her frustrations over having to relearn every aspect of her technique -- balance control paddling diving -- lead to a temporary abandonment of the sport.A more serious crisis arises when Bethany who at one point breaks off the arm of her Barbie wonders out loud ""How can this be Gods plan for me?"" Its a good tough question and it belongs in the movie. ""I dont know why terrible things happen to us sometimes"" says Bethanys youth minister (singer Carrie Underwood). The movie as it turns out does know. And so in short order will we whether we like it or not.Before the closing credits there will be a breakthrough and there will be a lesson learned. There will even be quite literally a rainbow (though thankfully not a double rainbow).""Soul Surfer"" is to be commended for presenting a positive role model in an adolescent girl who is strong and athletic not just a pretty face. Thats all too rare these days. So is the movies unapologetic emphasis on faith. But it wont leave well enough alone insisting on tying up lifes messy questions in a tidy little package. The Lord may work in mysterious ways but Hollywood does not. Contains a brief but intense shark attack and some blood.

Youd think it would be hard to make an uninteresting movie based on the true story of Bethany Hamilton a teenager who bravely resumed competing as a surfer after losing her left arm in a 2003 shark attack off the Hawaiian island of Kauai. But the terminally bland ""Soul Surfer"" comes perilously close. Shamelessly pandering to the elusive Christian family audience a committee of 18 producers and seven writers has removed nearly every trace of grit from this airbrushed portrait. In pursuit of a PG rating even the shark attack isnt especially scary in what could well have been a cross between ""Jaws"" and ""127 Hours"" in different hands. As colorlessly directed by Sean McNamara (the Disney Channels ""Thats So Raven"") the movies protagonist Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb of Disneys ""The Bridge to Terabithia"") is largely personality-free both before and after the attack. Even when asking ""How can this be Gods plan for me?"" A scene where she rejects a prosthetic arm proffered by ""Inside Edition"" is especially awkward and not just because her family seems far too well-off to require such assistance. When a mean girl in Bethanys first surfing competition pushes our one-armed heroine off her board it comes off as phony a shameless manipulation of the audience. A frustrated Bethany gives up surfing at least until she joins her supportive best friend (Lorraine Nicholson) on a trip to Thailand to help victims of the 2004 tsunami. Luring the natives back into the water with the encouragement of a Sunday school teacher (a treacly Carrie Underwood of ""American Idol"" fame wearing a ton of eye makeup) Bethany decides to go back to competitive surfing -- where she faces the same mean girl at the national finals. Helen Hunt seldom seen on the big screen these days lends some gravitas as Bethanys concerned mother. Dennis Quaid largely phones it in as her hard-driving father who owns a huge beachfront estate in Hawaii without seeming to hold down any kind of job. I wouldnt be dwelling on this stuff if ""Soul Surfer"" managed to be more involving. As it is the most notable contribution here may be the gorgeous aquatic cinematography by the veteran John Leonetti coming right off . . . ""Piranha 3-D.""

The other half is hard to argue with Its a compelling tale of surf and survival.In this true story Bethany Hamilton (AnnaSophia Robb) is a 13-year-old oceangoing daughter of two ardent surfers (Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt) who is bitten by a shark. Brittany loses most of her left arm yet theres not much moping here even when she discovers that activities from surfing to slicing fruit are far easier with two arms. Brittany has faith focused on a youth ministry run by Sarah Hill (Carrie Underwood).Theres a sting to the fact that Brittany is bitten after forgoing a religious mission to compete in a surfing competition. And Sarah doesnt have a satisfactory answer for how Brittanys accident fits into Gods plan. But her recovery and re-entry into competitive sports is inspirational.The surfing scenes many with seamless effects to simulate the missing limb are world-class. What happens on shore is a little too breezy but the cast keeps the movie on sure footing.

Warner Bros. Pictures By John Anderson Updated April 8 2011 1201 a.m. ET ""Mirthless"" is not the kind of adjective that makes its way onto full-page movie ads but its the most charitable way of describing the new ""Arthur"" a remake of the celebrated 1981 comedy about a wealthy wastrels eviction from dipsomaniacal paradise by his family and Liza Minnelli. Its always been a problematic premise Dudley Moores original Arthur Bach dissolute heir to an Old New York fortune was gleefully unburdened by aspirations or stress or work and he had enough money to remain that way. His only concern was how quickly he could slip into the next tumbler of scotch. He may not have been a role model. But he was certainly a guilty pleasure. Watch a clip from the modern day remake of the classic Dudley Moore comedy. Starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren. Courtesy Warner Bros. Theres no reason to feel guilty about the updated ""Arthur"" directed by Jason (""Modern Family"") Winer except for the seemingly endless amount of time one spends with Russell Brand. The suddenly ubiquitous Mr. Brand was fast becoming Hollywoods go-to guy for debauched Brits (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" ""Get Him to the Greek"") before someone decided to make him adorable--a horrifying idea made worse by his casting in a movie which at this point in our social evolution might just as well have been made on another planet. No one outside of the filmmakers apparently need to be told that ever since Mr. Moore made drunkenness hilarious there have been seismic shifts in attitude and opinion regarding substance abuse addiction 12-step programs general health etc. etc.--call it the New Puritanism call it good sense--to which the new ""Arthur"" seems fairly oblivious. The very idea of this movie suffers from a form of myopia that simply cant be overcome. And of course all would be forgiven if only the thing were funny. It is not. Arthur is still a good-natured drunkard When he and his chauffeur Bitterman (Luis Guzman) take Arthurs Batmobile on a tear through Lower Manhattan and collide with the Wall Street Bull (whose anatomical correctness is the movies first ""joke"" and an indication of where were going) even the cops are happy to see him--although you suspect that Arthurs barracuda-impersonator of a mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) is making large and frequent contributions to the Patrolmens Benevolent Association. Vivienne wants Arthur to marry Susan (Jennifer Garner) because the voracious Susan is just what the family firm needs to maintain the kind of client confidence and loyalty the companys heir presumptive is causing to evaporate like last New Years tequila shooter. Arthur is despondent at the prospect that his lifes work i.e. despoiling women and Manhattan will be interrupted. But under his mothers threat of instant poverty he becomes affianced anyway at an engagement party that almost makes one sympathetic for Susan (Ms. Garner is quite the convincing villainess). Then--ta-da--Arthur rescues an about-to-be-arrested damsel in distress Naomi (""mumblecore"" maiden Greta Gerwig) a Grand Central Terminal tour guide who lacks a city permit but has a personality Arthur cant resist. The police--again the police--practically hail the happy couple a cab. And our heros transition from tottering reprobate to upstanding citizen is under way. Was Arthur ever really happy? That of course is--and was--the question. Mr. Moores Arthur was so busy laughing at his own jokes it was hard not to laugh along with him. But theres nothing infectious comedically speaking at least about Mr. Brands Arthur. The dialogue is virtually wit-free. All playfulness is forced. In a feeble concession to the times Arthur has to see the light long before its dramatically necessary which burdens what should be a silly comedy with a ball and chain of righteousness. Even Helen Mirren a casting choice so obvious it hurts cant alchemize the role of Hobson (which won John Gielgud an Oscar) into much besides a humorless scold. And even for a New York fantasy the situations are ridiculous enough to be offensive At one point Arthur ""rents"" the cavernous main concourse of Grand Central so he and Naomi can dine there alone. Its too absurd an idea even to be cute and the admission that hes delayed 100 commuter trains in order to pull off his little stunt exemplifies the tone-deafness that affects the whole enterprise. Alcohol and ostentation? Not a recipe for a lot of laughs. ENLARGE Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb in Soul Surfer. TriStar Soul Surfer No one actually walks on water during the fact-based sports drama ""Soul Surfer"" but the Christian signifiers arrive with the regularity of waves slamming against the Hawaiian shoreline. It was there in 2003 that up-and-coming teen surfer Bethany Hamilton lost an arm in a shark attack and not only recovered but went on to surf competitively again. Its a great story one told with a great deal of polish and passion by director Sean McNamara adapted from Ms. Hamiltons memoir (co-written with Sheryl Berk and Rich Bundschuh). The movie is bright blue and buoyant. And it has a religious agenda as wide as the ocean. Which does not of course make ""Soul Surfer"" a bad movie. Far from it. Even if you instinctively resist the kind of subtle proselytizing that goes on throughout the film--the prayers the hymns the Bibles the implied heavenly guidance the prominent placement of the evangelical organization World Vision--its bubbling optimism and spectacular scenery are hard not to like. But ""Soul Surfer"" is also part of a growing movement dedicated to making and distributing Christian films in the mainstream films that dont advertise their spirituality but carry a very distinct religious message nonetheless. And once your antennae are up of course everything becomes symbolic. The shark attack for instance comes almost directly after Bethany--given an energetic portrayal by AnnaSophia Robb--decides not to go on a church charity trip organized by her pastor Sarah (country music star Carrie Underwood). Having her pay a price for choosing the good of her surfing sponsor over the good of the poor in Mexico is rather graceless as storytelling goes. It seems oddly coincidental too that in a movie teeming with churchly blondes including Bethanys mother (Helen Hunt) the one meanspirited character in the movie--Bethanys rival Malina Birch (Sonya Balmores Chung)--is also the darkest of skin and blackest of hair. She also wears black in case youve missed the point. ENLARGE Saoirse Ronan in Hanna. Focus Features Hanna A very different kind of blonde is at the center of the Joe Wrights globe-trotting assassin thriller ""Hanna"" which before collapsing into itself like a black hole is one moody shiny exciting romp. A major departure for a director known for very proper British fare--including ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement""--""Hanna"" is quite the improper little package stylish rich in singular images and one that carries itself with both the bravado of a spy thriller and the winsomeness of a fairy tale. It is a childs story after all albeit with a twist Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been raised in the forests of northern Finland by her father ex-CIA agent Erik (Eric Bana) to be the worlds most efficient assassin an expert in weaponry martial arts and strategy. She has killer instinct to spare. Given its fantastic elements ""Hanna"" is on a certain level ridiculous. But the way Mr. Wright conjures his images and parcels out his narrative is hypnotic and so seductive that wherever the film is heading we want to follow. The mission for which Hanna has been trained involves a particularly unpleasant and lethal operative named Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett at her most lunatic) whose connections with Erik are old and baroque. The reasons Marissa wants Hanna in her clutches and what the girls history means amid all those flashbacks are less important than the momentum of Mr. Wrights storytelling and action. The problem as it often is with any vehicle operating at high velocity is loss of traction The increasingly implausible ""Hanna"" cant slow down and ultimately hits the wall of our disbelief. The result? Flaming wreckage. One wants to like ""Hanna"" for all its thrills and good looks and the performance by the young Ms. Ronan (who received an Oscar nomination for ""Atonement""). Also for Mr. Wrights willingness to take risks which in this case dont quite pay off. Watch a clip from ""Born to Be Wild"" a 3D IMAX documentary about orphaned elephants and orangoutangs narrated by Morgan Freeman. Born to Be Wild 3D For those still wondering what in the world 3-D is good for the answer is nature--specifically ""Born to Be Wild 3D"" a moving engaging and revelatory IMAX attraction with two heroines and a crowd of charming beasts. Swinging back and forth between Kenya and Borneo director David Lickley and yes narrator Morgan Freeman tell--and more importantly show--the work of Daphne M. Sheldrick who rescues baby elephants whose parents have been killed by poachers; and primatologist Birute Mary Galdikas who adopts orphaned orangutans eventually freeing them into the rainforest of Borneo. The work of Ms. Galdikas and Ms. Sheldrick in returning wild animals to a wild state is the point of the movie though the two women are not really its stars. Those would be the apes and elephants a cast of happy sad playful incorrigible children who when they stare into the camera communicate an eerily profound connection with the viewer. They seem almost human as cliched as that may sound and that magic seems possible only via the technology used in making this 3-D animal attraction a movie that provides such an intimate look at the animals it could well put zoos out of business. Considering the content of so much of what passes for nature entertainment it need to be noted that this movie is entirely kid- and squeamish-adult friendly; no mammals are injured nor will they be upset during the viewing of this motion picture. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is away. DVD FOCUS The Lost Weekend (1945) This remains the best-known and most influential movie about the ravages of alcoholism a film that won Oscars for star Ray Milland screenwriter Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder who was inspired to make the film by author Raymond Chandler (who fell off the wagon during the making of ""Double Indemnity""). One of only two films to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Cannes Film Festivals Palme dOr (the other was ""Marty"") it incorporated a number of pioneering visual effects co-starred Jane Wyman and was based on a story by Charles R. Jackson. The Thin Man (1934) A deep and enduring fondness for martinis never kept Nick Charles (William Powell) from solving a murder case and wife Nora (Myrna Loy) was never more than a few drinks behind over the course of six delightfully marinated mystery/comedies made by the pair through 1947. Based on the detective novel by Dashiell Hammett (and supposedly based on his relationship with Lillian Hellman) the movie and its sequels reflected a lingering sense of post-Prohibition joy in all the liquor consumed by Nick and Nora who could probably have drunk the casts of ""Animal House"" ""Cocktail"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" under the table. Drunks (1995) A little more humor would probably have helped this multicharacter drama starring comedian Richard Lewis although its portrayal of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is raw and unfiltered. Mr. Lewis plays Jim whose struggle is the centerpiece of the movie that also features Amanda Plummer Parker Posey Dianne Wiest Spalding Gray and perhaps most memorably Faye Dunaway all of whom portray characters trying to wrestle demon rum to the floor.

Soul Surfer makes very few waves - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Soul Surfer makes very few waves By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | |   | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The inspiring story of surfer and shark attack victim Bethany Hamilton deserves a better dramatization. While well-meaning this montage mashup comes across more like an extended commercial for Hawaii tourism than a stirring tale of resilience. By Mario Perez FilmDistrict/TriStar AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany Hamilton who lost her arm to a shark in 2003. EnlargeClose By Mario Perez FilmDistrict/TriStar AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany Hamilton who lost her arm to a shark in 2003. A documentary featuring the real Bethany would have been far more compelling than this simplistic version. AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany a Kauai native who grew up on a surfboard. Her sun-dappled life marked by a strong Christian faith seems golden. As she rises up the ranks of Hawaiian surf competitions her supportive parents (Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt) and two brothers love her unconditionally. About the movie Soul Surfer  out of fourStars AnnaSophia Robb Dennis Quaid Helen Hunt Lorraine Nicholson Carrie Underwood Director Sean McNamara Distributor TriStar/FilmDistrict Rating PG for an intense accident sequence and some thematic material Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Opens Friday in select cities Then the unimaginable happens. Bethany (who was 13 at the time) goes surfing with best pal Alana (Lorraine Nicholson) and out of nowhere a shark bites off her arm. Strangely this moment is the least dramatic shark attack ever put on film. Singer Carrie Underwood has an awkward acting debut as Bethanys religious mentor. She should definitely not quit her day job. Quaid and Hunt engagingly portray loving parents. Robb has a casual grace convincingly playing a surfer thanks to effective stunt work and digital effects. But most of the other roles could be cardboard cutouts. Bethanys determination and faith are remarkable. Its too bad this movie made a brave young womans life appear like an unremarkable soap opera.

The church is a somewhat stealthy supporting player within the film based on the true tale of Bethany Hamilton the rising 13-year-old amateur competition surfer in Hawaii who in 2003 lost an arm to a shark. But the piety takes a backseat to the welcome glimmers of grit. As a portrait of a spirited resilient athlete the movie succeeds best unafraid to face its heroines daunting challenges directly.After scenes introducing its characters including Bethanys surfer parents (Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt both excellent) Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb) is attacked in Hanalei and raced to a hospital. (The sequence while gore free is agonizing and not for young children.) From there the film presents her efforts to get back in competition; her fitful painful setbacks; and a lesson in context when she helps tsunami victims on a volunteer church expedition to Thailand. Ms. Hunt and Mr. Quaid may be a surprising presence here but not the country singer Carrie Underwood as a saintly youth counselor. Photo Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb in ""Soul Surfer."" Credit Mario Perez/FilmDistrict and TriStar Pictures The movie dazzles in its surfing sequences in which the director Sean McNamara works nimble editing and a tropical palette to a fine sheen. And Ms. Robb makes an appealing Bethany wounded but determined and largely self-reliant. During the closing credits the real Ms. Hamilton appears on screen and thanks Jesus in voice-over. While this story is certainly about faith ""Soul Surfer"" is most inspiring when it exalts faith in ones self. ""Soul Surfer"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Though it flirts with saccharine Sunday-school uplift theres a redeeming core of sincerity in this story of real-life tragedy and perseverance. Bethany Hamilton was a 13-year-old competitive surfer with a promising future when a shark took her left arm at the shoulder. News of the attack grabbed the attention of media everywhere. Her survival after the trauma was in doubt but Hamiltons Christian faith and supportive family sustained her as she successfully returned to the waves and her recovery spawned feel-good followup stories. Some might see her story as one of simple bad luck followed by good luck or of cable news outlets that go ballistic when bad things happen to blond women. Hamilton saw it as Gods plan bringing her to prominence so she could deliver a message of inspiration. In fact thats the tag for her personal Web page ""Bethany Hamilton -- Professional Surfer Role Model Inspiration."" ""Soul Surfer"" benefits from a solid lead performance by AnnaSophia Robb (""Bridge to Terebithia"") who makes Hamilton an idealistic trusting innocent ray of sunshine. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt slide into the roles of her devout middle-class beach-bum parents as comfortably as bare feet into flip-flops. The story is drained of conflict and urgency however by the characters faith that a loving God guides their fates and all will work out for the best. The emotional fallout of Bethanys accident is nothing more than one huffy mealtime argument; a bit less optimism would make a more gripping drama. Still theres plenty of visual excitement in the exceptional surfing scenes. Longtime kids TV director Sean McNamara not only gets inside the action he gives the towering waves and roaring pipelines a spiritual resonance. COLIN COVERT WINTER IN WARTIME  OUT OF FOUR STARS  Rated R for some language. In subtitled Dutch and German and English.  Where Edina At this stage of the game its not easy to make an original World War II movie. The competent but derivative Dutch ""Winter in Wartime"" goes down a well traveled path but on training wheels Kids under German occupation shelter a downed Allied flier. The youth perspective gives this moderately effective film its novelty. Fourteen-year-old Michiel (Martijn Lakemeier) resents his cautious father the mayor of their town because he believes he appeases the Nazis. He idolizes his uncle who shares tales of cloak-and-dagger adventure with the Resistance. When an RAF pilot (Jamie Campbell Bower ""Sweeney Todd"") parachutes into the forest Michiel hides him and plans to move him past German patrols to safety. As the noose tightens around the pair Michiel learns that the adult world is more complex than he imagined. Unfortunately the tale is dragged down by too many stock situations. If youve seen one slow-motion ""Noooooooo"" as a firing squad lets loose youve seen em all. COLIN COVERT Born to Be Wild 3D  out of four stars  Rated G  Where Great Clips Imax This nature film -- celebrating the efforts of two intrepid women half a world apart to rescue animals and return them to the wild -- is very much ""a fairy tale"" as Morgan Freeman narrates. Director David Lickley (""Jane Goodalls Wild Chimpanzees"") and his crew follow Birute Galdikas an orangutan researcher on Borneo where habitat is being destroyed to make way for vast palm-oil plantations. Her staffers become mothers to the orphaned orangutans feeding bonding and singing lullabies to them keeping just enough distance to let them remain ""wild."" Once the apes are old enough theyre taken to a national park and released. Daphne Sheldrick does something similar in Kenya with elephants orphaned because their moms have ivory tusks. For half a century Sheldrick has been perfecting elephant baby formula and raising orphan elephants that return to the wild as a herd. Cute but never insufferably so ""Born to Be Wild"" uses 3-D playfully -- to stick an elephants trunk in your face and kids will get a kick out of orangutan burps and elephant soccer.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I dont know whether actors can tell how sloppy a movie is ultimately going to look when theyre on the set. Presumably they trust the director to give them what they need. In the case of the seasoned cast members of the new family drama ""Soul Surfer Im guessing the director Sean McNamara trusted them to make him look good. McNamaras done a lot of tween television and hes brought all the same food-processor editing suffocating close-ups and checkout-line songs to a movie about Bethany Hamilton the 13-year-old competitive surfer who in 2003 lost her left arm to a tiger shark.AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany. Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid play her surfer parents and what they do is remarkable given the generic weakness of the material. McNamara telegraphs the shark attack at least twice before it happens with ominous shots of human legs kicking underwater and that sort of thing. The news of the attack occurs right before father Hamilton is about to undergo knee surgery. The doctor (Craig T. Nelson) will need the operating room to save Bethanys life. The Hamiltons are church-going Hawaiians and the movie which required four writers to adapt the book Bethany wrote with two other people cant decide how flagrantly Christian to make them. The media however are relentless. You cant miss the look on the Hamiltons faces when Bethany returns home from the hospital and is mobbed by reporters great more sharks.The actors to their credit play faith as the most normal thing in the world. Bethany is tough and home-schooled. I like that the movie doesnt present this as either the most ideal or the strangest life for an adolescent. Its normal for them. Before and after her accident Bethany is well adjusted and in love with surfing. Hunt doesnt work nearly enough so her arrival in what feels like glorified ABC Family uplift is unexpected. Neither she nor Quaid has much to do but they smile cry cheer and ride surfboards with feeling. Theyre especially good standing in the background watching Bethany at press conferences or from the beach.The best moments come when Robbs all-purpose toughness experiences vulnerable doubt. These moments are flickers but theyre bright and human. Bethany has only a stub jutting from her shoulder (its a so-so special effect). But after she relearns to chop fruit its back to surfing where she can notice the surf industrys weird objectification of girls and resume sparring with her main rival. She comes to see herself as blessed. Faith for some is a combination of a belief in God and a belief in oneself. When Bethany goes from ""How can this be Gods plan for me? to ""I dont need easy I just need possible I stopped rolling my eyes and just said ""Amen.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Somewhere not far beneath the glossy pop skin of Soul Surfer the true story of Bethany Hamilton is struggling to get out. Its a headline-grabber as a 13-year-old up-and-coming competitive surfer Hamilton lost her left arm in a shark attack then fearlessly returned to surfing ultimately going pro. But the films bubbly narration relentless pop soundtrack wearying MTV editing and desperately intense positivity wash away most of her storys drama as well as any sense of reality. Director/co-writer Sean McNamara (Bratz The Movie) and a committee of six other writers give the script an unusual specificity of detail especially regarding subsidiary characters and minor relationships; throughout theres a sense that theyre trying to map Hamiltons actual life over the conventional beats of a sports-underdog film. But the conventions mostly win often in saccharine ways. Soul Surfer launches with Hamilton (Bridge To Terabithias AnnaSophia Robb) explaining her life in a breathless rush of narration and faux home-video footage which suggests that life in Hawaii is a nonstop beach party where no one has to work and the days pass in a reverie of music sun water sports and occasional starry-eyed open-air religious gatherings. Hamiltons biggest personal issue is a pouty moment when her youth-group leader (Carrie Underwood in an irritatingly stiff strident film debut) chides her for choosing a surf competition over a missionary trip. Then the shark attack changes Hamiltons life though not her priorities Shes still all about her need to get back on the board and back into competition. Soul Surfer has plenty of strengths to go with its faults The underdog story is compelling and the surf-contest footage is beautifully shot and tautly edited. The action sequences including the struggle to save Hamiltons life after the blink-and-youll-miss-it shark attack are breathless and stylish. And Soul Surfer is unique as an inspirational personal-achievement film in the way it focuses on the protagonist not merely as a bastion of strength but as part of a supportive community and family including Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid (the only convincing members among a generally plastic cast) as the loving parents who struggle more with their daughters injury than she does. The scenes focusing on the adults in Hamiltons life are generally the most convincing even when they largely address her saint-like wisdom and grace in helping them cope with her new situation. Much less convincing a sequence where Hamilton begins to understand Gods plan for her as she inspires a mute lost toddler--and his entire applauding village--to love the ocean again after Thailands devastating 2004 tsunami. At moments like these Soul Surfer feels like history by way of High School Musical all cheery Disney wholesomeness without any threat of authenticity encroaching.

"Soul Surfer a heartfelt look at a surfing tragedy - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Soul Surfer a heartfelt look at a surfing tragedySoul Surfer a 2.5 starsApril 07 2011|By Glenn Whipp Special to Tribune Newspapers""Soul Surfer"" begins like most other coming-of-age movie dramas. Our young heroine surfer girl Bethany Hamilton (AnnaSophia Robb) sketches out the details of her sunny life in a quick voice-over. She lives on the Hawaiian island of Kauai has a loving family and from the moment she rode her first wave knew she wanted to be a pro surfer. ""Its my passion my way of life"" Bethany says with matter-of-fact conviction. We then see Bethany practicing her passion in the Pacific and next thing you know shes slipping on a sundress and (wait a minute whats this?) joining her family at an outdoor church service where Carrie Underwood playing a youth group leader is singing. And five minutes in even if you dont know Hamiltons rather remarkable story you realize the conflict in this movie might not come from a boy or a parent or from buying the wrong bikini. Its going to come from God and its going to address the timeless question of why bad things happen to good people. Now before we get too existential here realize that the people posing the question in ""Soul Surfer"" are the creative folks behind ""Baywatch"" the live-action ""Bratz"" movie and innumerable (and may we add insufferable) Disney Channel sitcoms. That ""Soul Surfer"" rates as a giant leap for this team speaks well about the conviction the movies actors bring to the material as well as the respect afforded the Hamilton family and their faith. The Hamiltons lives were shaken when a 14-foot tiger shark sawed off Bethanys arm during a morning surf eight years ago. She lost 60 percent of her blood but survived. Recovering Bethany discovers she lost something else that day -- her identity as an up-and-coming surfer. ""How could this be Gods plan for me?"" Bethany asks. Her parents played with tremendous feeling by Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt offer support but also know that their daughter will need time and space to work through her issues of image and faith. True theres neither a lot of grappling nor many dark nights of the soul on display here. Part of this is a function of the writers (four are credited) penchant for mining the most obvious aspects of Hamiltons story in ways that sometimes feel rushed. But if youve seen the real-life Hamilton on the ESPYs or the Teen Choice Awards you know shes as much a force of nature as the waves she rides. And yes thats Hamilton or at least her body performing most of her own surfing scenes. LA-based effects company Engine Room later morphed Robbs head onto Hamiltons body and digitally removed one of Robbs arms throughout the film. As for the shark attack you dont see much and its over in six minutes not 127 hours. ""Soul Surfer"" owns its PG rating not to mention its Christian themes proudly. MPAA rating PG (for an intense accident sequence and some thematic material) Cast AnnaSophia Robb (Bethany Hamilton) Lorraine Nicholson (Alana) Dennis Quaid (Tom) Helen Hunt (Cheri) Carrie Underwood (Sarah) Credits Directed by Sean McNamara; written by McNamara Deborah Schwartz Douglas Schwartz and Michael Berk; produced by David Zelon Douglas Schwartz Dutch Hofstetter McNamara and David Brookwell.

Comments click to enlarge Soul Surfer Rated PG  106 minutes  2011 Bethany Hamilton a promising surfer from Kauai nearly died in 2003 after a shark bit off her left arm and her memoir inspired this biopic. AnnaSophia Robb (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is too subdued as the teenage heroine; one might expect more affect from a young woman fighting to overcome disability and return to competitive surfing. Hamiltons recovery was spurred by her Christian faith and the loving support of not only her parents (Dennis Quaid a strong Helen Hunt) but the leader of her church group (Carrie Underwood). Theres plenty of God talk here but its counterbalanced by the big surfing sequences (for which Hamilton performed some of the stunts). Disney Channel veteran Sean McNamara directed.

Faith clearly does not assure a good movie.Hamilton half tomboy/half mermaid was a surfing prodigy who grew up in a family of surfers in Hawaii. (She is not however related to big wave legend Laird Hamilton).In 2003 barely into her teens she lost her left arm to a tiger shark. (Gratefully Soul Surfer does not depict the incident in graphic detail.)The film is primarily devoted to her struggle with diminished capacity (""How can this be Gods plan for me?"" she asks weeping) and her determination to get back in the water.The comeback is a given. Even as she lies in a hospital bed after losing a limb and most of her blood Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb) pleads with her father (Dennis Quaid) ""When can I surf again?""First she must struggle to accept her limitations. Even mundane tasks such as fixing her hair or playing her beloved ukulele are beyond her.Her guide through the morass of despair is the youth minister at her beachfront church. Its the acting debut for country singer Carrie Underwood.Her stiffness is hardly noticeable in this March of the Wooden Actors. Even Helen Hunt as Bethanys mom goes through the film with a single expression scared sick.Soul Surfer has a strikingly eclectic cast including Craig T. Nelson General Hospitals Ross Thomas Kevin Sorbo and stock villain Branscombe Richmond who resembles a swarthy Dog the Bounty Hunter cast against type and ethnicity here as a sunny native Hawaiian.And no your eyes are not deceiving you. The paramedic rushing Bethany to the hospital? Thats Baywatchs David Chokachi.The aquatic and surf scenes are spectacular. The story a clichA(c)ed climb to inspiration. Soul Surfer is more parable than plot.If youve been waiting for a faith-based movie about surfing your outrigger just came in. The rest of you - back in the water.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Considering that she maintained her sanity and spirit through her Christian faith -- this dramatization of her story has been aimed in no small part at the evangelical market -- the more cynical viewers out there may say ""Not for me."" But Soul Surfer while formulaic in design is an authentic and heartfelt movie. At first you think youre watching Jaws remade as a Miley Cyrus drama. But as Bethany recovers from her cataclysmic wound AnnaSophia Robbs performance comes to life. She gives Bethanys belief in God a concrete depth and understanding. When Bethany gets up on that surfboard again refusing to wear a prosthetic limb her pluckiness hits home because we see that shes out to impress no one in the world but herself. As her surfer-jock parents Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt do likable things with their too-wholesome roles and the surfing scenes borrow the techniques of Blue Crush to make the impossible look easy. Which is just what Bethany Hamilton did.

Tween-flick director and co-writer Sean McNamara (Bratz) sets up his glorified movie of the week as a series of obstacles to be neatly overcome through blind optimism and trust in God as Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb) struggles with her body image post-attack and her desire to surf again and a mean-spirited nemesis on the waves must be thwarted with kindness. Nearly every conflict is built on market-tested platitudes of empowerment and registers as insincere especially a spurious re-creation of Bethanys visit to Thailand to aid tsunami victims. Congratulations Holly-wood for commissioning your own modern parable about a strained family questioning their faith in which marquee names Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt hardly break a sweat as our heroines picture-perfect folks. Young Ms. Hamiltons story is inspiring but if you need it spoon-fed by American Idol winner Carrie Underwoods youth-group leader youre better off lost and godless.

The true story of one-armed surfer girl Bethany Hamilton keeps its balance in ""Soul Surfer"" a kind-hearted coming-of-age drama with killer waves. As played by AnnaSophia Robb the pics Hawaiian heroine gradually uses her limb-losing encounter with a tiger shark as a way of calling attention to the resilience of disabled persons -- and not only those riding giants. Distinguished by splashy cinematography engaging performances from Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as the girls go-get-em parents and understated scenes of the family practicing its Christian faith ""Soul Surfer"" likely wont break waves at the B.O. but itll stay on the board. Beautifully lensed by d.p. John R. Leonetti the film opens with born-to-surf Bethany proclaiming in voiceover her near-fatal attraction to big swells. The introduction of the Hamiltons and their dog goofing around at their Kawai beach house has a few too many canine reaction shots for its own good but it clearly establishes the familys fun-lovin life force which will be put to the test when Bethany in a scene that pushes the PG rating almost as much as ""Jaws"" did gets her arm chewed off while riding the waves with teen gal pal Alana (Lorraine Nicholson) and Alanas father Holt (Kevin Sorbo). That Bethanys dad happens to be on an operating table for knee surgery when he gets the news of his daughters attack is but one example of the movies penchant for high-pitched melodrama. But co-writer/director Sean McNamara (""Bratz"") wisely keeps the focus on his articulately faith-spouting characters who struggle to comprehend how their God can permit such suffering. Only in a scene of armless Bethany tearing a limb off her old Barbie doll does the fact-based soap give way to excessive lather. (Shame she doesnt instead take out her frustration on her bedroom poster of ""The Endless Summer."") Repudiating prosthetics as well as a coveted slot in the Hawaiian Island Regionals Bethany travels with her Christian youth group led by Sarah (Carrie Underwood making her bigscreen debut) to Phuket Thailand to help victims of the 2004 tsunami. Its here that ""Soul Surfer"" like its real-life heroine reveals a stirring commitment to humanitarianism one thats exceedingly rare among American movies. Nevertheless McNamara heads back to the surf for a rousing sports-film finale set at the Rip Curl Nationals where Bethany enjoying her new celebrity faces off against her archrival the mercilessly competitive Malina Birch (Sonya Balmores). Thesping quality is strong across the board but Quaid stands out delivering even the scripts shakier lines with humor and sincerity. The well-toned Robb makes a convincing surfer thanks in large part to excellent stunt coordination and a judicious deployment of digital effects. Action scenes are set to blaring pop-rock tunes that while bordering on cheesy help get the blood pumping anyway. Leonettis widescreen images remain razor-sharp above and below water.

TWITTER AnnaSophia Robb Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt star in director Sean McNamaras idealized take on one-armed surfer Bethany Hamilton. Sportswriters invariably call any last-minute heroics or unbelievable upset a ""Hollywood ending"" yet in reality Hollywood usually does a poor job with sports stories based on real-life events. Such stories force filmmakers to drastically alter the filmmaking playbook draining away all color or quirks of personality from characters based on living people and removing any complications that might distract viewers from the ""inspirational"" message theyre determined to convey. Which is what happens in Soul Surfer a true story of courage determination and guts that deserves a more exciting approach. No doubt the film will reach its target faith-based audience but a wider audience may elude the TriStar release. However if the films real-life heroine Bethany Hamilton promotes the film with enough personal appearances Soul Surfer may break through to general audiences. Her story has certainly been told repeatedly including an autobiography and an earlier short doc Heart of a Soul Surfer made by her sister-in-law. A lifelong surfer born to a family of Hawaiian surfers she lost her left arm in a 2003 shark attack when she was 13. She returned to surfing a mere month after her harrowing ordeal and continues to compete in contests today having perfected a one-armed surfing technique. Few stories can be more inspiring but this one apparently didnt inspire the filmmakers to think outside the box. Director Sean McNamara and no less than seven credited writers in additional to the three that co-authored Hamiltons book recite the basic facts in dramatic form but give a viewer little sense of who these people -- Bethany her family and friends -- are or what makes them tick. The films main actors do fill in some of the gaps especially young AnnaSophia Robb as Bethany and Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as her parents. Robb goes full-bore in her surfing scenes -- she is actually a beginner -- as well as the dramatic ones giving the heroine the determination of youth broken only a couple of times by doubts or self-pity. Having been virtually born to surf she had no real way to give it up. It goes against her entire upbringing. With little makeup Quaid and Hunt play people who spend as many hours as possible in the sun Their leathery lean skin and unadorned faces speak to a deep love for the outdoors and especially the ocean. Taken together this trio along with Ross Thomas and Chris Brochu who play Bethanys older brothers present a family of pro surfers whose sport has given them a competitive spirit and a commitment to excellence that see them through this terrifying ordeal. But the filmmakers treat them with kid gloves. Put it this way you would never create such nearly perfect idealized characters for any fictional story. Youd bore an audience to tears. The 10-minute episode concerning the shark attack and rush to a nearby hospital is the best sustained sequence in the film. Additionally all the water work involving cameras mounted on surfboards and jet skis is superb as is the surfing often performed by doubles that include Bethany herself. On land though the film suffers from the Hollywood-itis those sportswriter so frequently invoke. A fictional villain is created in a rival surfer played by a perennially scowling Sonya Balmores who ridicules and cheats Bethany at every opportunity. The film uses a 2004 humanitarian aid trip to Thailand by Bethany following the devastating tsunami to give its heroine a sentimental shot in the arm to further motivate her to return to competitive surfing. The film curiously characterizes the media that descends on the Hamilton house as a force of terror that drives Bethany and her family to cover. This is an all too common even cliched movie portrayal of reporters but in this instance more than a little mendacious given the countless interviews the young woman has given in the weeks following the attack up until today. Singer Carrie Underwood makes her film debut in a superfluous role as Bethanys church young group leader while Kevin Sorbo and Lorraine Nicholson play the father and daughter who no doubt saved her life by their quick thinking and reactions in the moments following the attack. As with all the roles throughout the movie they perform a specific function within the known storyline but are thinly characterized. Composer Marco Beltrami should be singled out for a score that brilliantly utilizes old Hawaiian music and songs.
