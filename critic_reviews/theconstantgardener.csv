Comments click to enlarge The Constant Gardener Recommended Watch on Netflix This adaptation of the John Le Carre best seller by Jeffrey Caine plays like Graham Greene redux. Ralph Fiennes stars as a mild-mannered member of the British High Commission in Kenya whose radical activist wife (Rachel Weisz) is brutally slain; investigating her murder he gradually pieces together a tale of corruption involving the pharmaceutical industry thats every bit as horrific as (and much more timely than) Harry Limes killing of babies with diluted penicillin in The Third Man. Fernando Meirelles codirector of City of God stresses old-fashioned storytelling and takes full advantage of his cast including Danny Huston. R 129 min.

With his liquid beseeching eyes and fine-drawn features he resembles an alabaster saint made flesh.In ""The Constant Gardener"" directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted by screenwriter Jeffrey Caine from the John Le Carre bestseller he plays Justin Quayle a midlevel career diplomat in the British High Commission whose puttery existence while stationed in Kenya is overthrown when his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is brutally murdered.Fiennes is so effetely accomplished a performer that despite his beauty he often leaves me cold; he calibrates his emotions to the millimeter. For about the first 15 minutes of ""The Constant Gardener"" he appears to be up to his old hyper-refined tricks. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But then something molten happens. He has a morgue scene where he is asked to identify Tessas body. It is a devastating marvel of technique - in a matter of moments his smooth facade withers into an inconsolable sadness. The scene sets up the entire movie and Fiennes delivers on it. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 His modulated performance is balanced by Rachel Weiszs more overtly temperamental one. Tessa is a hothead activist who first meets up with Justin when she shouts down a lecture at which he is halfheartedly intoning in support of the Iraq war. They soon end up in bed (proving once again that politics arent everything). But Tessa is no empty sloganeer. She risks her marriage and ultimately her life in order to expose the collusion between the High Commission and Big Pharma which sacrifices impoverished Kenyans as unknowing guinea pigs for a so-called miracle drug not yet approved in the West.Tessa is operating in a postcolonial arena where wives are still expected to be ornamental. At first Justin is mortified by her lack of decorum but soon this careful privileged man develops a grudging respect for her willfulness. She acts out the rebellion that he is too emotionally walled in to express. Tessa explains her attraction to Justin when she says ""I feel safe with you"" but safety is actually not a high priority for her. Or for Justin as it turns out. ""The Constant Gardener"" is a romance in which the husband does not fall in love with his wife until after she has died and he is compelled to root out her killers across two continents. He puts himself in harms way almost as if he were sacrificing himself up to Tessas memory. He wants to consecrate her valor.I disliked ""City of God"" the previous film by director Fernando Mereilles because it converted the misery of the Brazilian slums into a cinematic assault. Hyperkinetic as a rock video the movie was just about as deep.The Le Carre material has toned down his flash although the films hectic nonlinear structure fractured by flashbacks is often annoyingly disruptive. Mereilles is trying to craft a love story crossed with international intrigue and he doesnt quite have the emotional amplitude to pull it off. In particular many of the scenes of political corruption featuring reptilian tycoons uncoiling in the shadows are overly familiar - although excellent actors like Bill Nighy Gerard McSorley and Danny Huston try to unfamiliarize us.""The Constant Gardener"" is essentially two movies for the price of one. But those halves add up to more than most movies right now. And in those moments when it all comes together - like that morgue scene or a hospital sequence where Tessa looks on in horror at an African woman hurt by the ""miracle"" drug - the film rises to a pitch of terror and outrage that leaves one shaken. Grade A- Rated R for language some violent images and sexual content/nudity.

(AP Photo/ Focus Features/Jaap Buitendijk) Photo JAAP BUITENDIJK Love focuses fight against corporate marauders in Africa 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Constant Gardener Drama. Starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Fernando Meirelles. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Constant Gardener"" based on a John Le Carre novel is a movie about greed and political intrigue thats played out over two continents. Its a love story only in passing. And yet the love story is what lingers in the mind and gives energy and meaning to everything that happens on-screen. It unites Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz who in their first love scene - - shot in a white room -- look like the palest English people on the planet. They also look like two people meant to be together. The scene follows their first meeting which is more than the usual obligatory clash. He is a junior diplomat giving a lecture and she is in the audience berating him vociferously about Britains participation in the Iraq war. She is almost out of control and he is almost too much in control. They look at each other and see whats missing in their own nature. Fiennes can be an austere actor but this role calls for different notes a softness almost a sweetness. He plays Justin a diplomat sent to Africa in the British foreign service with a specific and rather interesting form of diffidence -- as interesting here as when one finds it in real life Its the diffidence of someone who is meek by disposition but whose self-image is at bottom healthy and confident. Such people are interesting because theyre rare in that most people if anything tend to be the reverse blustering on the outside and unsure on the inside. ""The Constant Gardener"" is beautifully structured an artful mix of forward motion and flashbacks. For the flashbacks director Fernando Meirelles employs a handheld camera but subtly not ostentatiously as if to suggest subliminally the shaky and fragile nature of memory. Justin and Tessa (Weisz) meet and shortly thereafter shes accompanying him to Africa. Shes a care worker and an outspoken political activist not the usual match for a diplomat. She is that appealing entity the English wild woman whose direct neurotic emotional energy is combined with a forceful and articulate intelligence. We see Justin and Tessa as a young married couple Their physical closeness their delight in her pregnancy the evening bath with the door left ajar. This is something movies rarely do well Eros without mystery the erotic in its cozy married form. ""The Constant Gardener"" could easily end up being remembered as the movie that made audiences fall in love with Weisz and she deserves that for her free bright and full-blooded performance. But we cant overlook Meirelles and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine for providing these loving contexts. The filmmakers take pains to impress upon the audience the realness and happy functionality of this union because this becomes an important contrast to the evil of the political and business sphere. In Kenya while treating the sick Tessa stumbles upon something that doesnt seem quite right about the medicine being supplied by a major pharmaceutical company. She becomes a pit bull asking questions and demanding answers making a spectacle of herself when necessary and never letting up. Fiennes and Weisz are supported by a pair of fine British character actors the slippery Bill Nighy and the rough-hewn Pete Postlethwaite and by a superb American actor Danny Huston who has not yet got his due. Huston is an expert at playing moral weakness and his role here as a family friend irresistibly drawn to Tessa gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. Ultimately Tess journey obsession becomes Justins obsession and with that the movie broadens its canvas and becomes truly international spanning from London to Africa with a stop in Berlin for good measure. As a tale of intercontinental intrigue the movies mechanics are flawless. As an examination of the ways in which the First World routinely rapes the Third World its point of view is persuasive. But underlying everything is that other thing the romantic. In a sense ""The Constant Gardener"" depicts a search for two truths. The husband wants to uncover the shady symbiosis of the British government and the pharmaceutical giants and he wants to better understand his wife and the dynamic of his marriage to her. The first search provides the action but its the personal search that makes it matter. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations strong language and violence.

"Gardener settles for familiar ground - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Gardener settles for familiar ground By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 31 2005 Who do you mourn for most in The Constant Gardener""? Author John le Carre whose richly intelligent thrillers have become more moralistic and less nuanced as the Cold War fades into history? Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles who here gets his tepid big-budget reward for making the astonishing City of God"" in 2002? Or is it the topic of big corporations arrogantly using Africa as their test lab thats most poorly served by this movie?Wilted bouquets all around The Constant Gardener"" is a predictable conspiracy thriller that somehow ends up diminishing the real urgency of the Wests humanitarian disconnect from Africa. If it sends audiences home to log on to the Amnesty International website terrific -- but that still doesnt make it a very good movie.Some will think so nevertheless seduced by the antic post-Bourne Identity"" camerawork by the seriousness of the films concerns and by Ralph Fienness exquisitely understated performance in the title role. He plays Justin Quayle a midlevel British career diplomat who has a way with houseplants and a lifelong inability to offend anyone. When his friend and boss Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) breaks the news that Justins wife has died in mysterious circumstances its the widower who ends up consoling his consoler.Sandy and Justin are the British Embassys men in Kenya but its a woman -- Justins late wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) -- who has caused all the bees to swarm out of their hives. The Constant Gardener"" opens with Tessas (offscreen) murder by the side of a remote African lake and then moves backward in time detailing the couples courtship and Tessas uncovering of a plot by a shadowy pharmaceutical company to use impoverished Africans as guinea pigs. Were not killing people who wouldnt be dead anyway"" rationalizes one of the players with a shrug.This is how the world [expletive] Africa"" says another character a cynical truism screenwriter/adapter Jeffrey Caine wants to stick in the complacent throats of Western audiences. The message might be heard more clearly if it werent sugarcoated with cliched derring-do. As Justin retraces his dead wifes steps he comes up against threatening notes ominous black BMWs not one but two incriminating letters and the sort of miraculous computer hackery that suggests screenwriters might find a profitable sideline as IT consultants.Theres also a thuggish corporate head (Gerald McSorley) and a Machiavellian dandy of a British lord (Bill Nighy) both characters written and played with the complexity that is a le Carre hallmark. And yes there are a few Africans such as Tessas doctor friend (Herbert Kounde) but Gardener"" is one of those well-intentioned tales that largely denies its victims the dignity of a role in their own saving. White folks made this mess the film implies and white folks can clean it up. So the movie puts all its chips on Tessa as a ferociously committed idealist whose zeal leads her into questionable moral choices that threaten her marriage. There are two problems here. First you have to twist your suspension of disbelief into a knot of yogic contortion to accept that Justin and Tessa are a believable couple (Youre quite scary"" he tells her at their first meeting and hes right).Second there are those of us who find Weisz one of the most irritating actresses currently working a performer who emits the strident self-righteousness of the roles she habitually plays. Loving protestations to the contrary Tessa treats her milquetoast husband as a patsy and while thats an interesting movie its not the one intended.But maybe thats just me. Luckily Weisz is offscreen much of the time leaving us to contemplate Fiennes as he carefully prunes the weeds out of Justins personality. The character emerges a stronger if more endangered species especially after he returns to Europe for a final connecting of the dots A scene in which he revisits the London apartment where he and Tessa first lived and quietly weeps for all he has lost is the most emotionally true moment in the entire film. The reticent hero moved to action by love is a device le Carre borrowed from Graham Greene and its a deeply British concept Fiennes seems to understand in his bones When everybodys shouting its best to watch the quiet ones. In this movie sadly the plot shouts louder.Meirelles is working again with his City of God"" cinematographer Cesar Charlone and The Constant Gardener"" is a visual feast of off-kilter angles saturated film stocks and shifting focal planes. None of this particularly strengthens or detracts from the movie but you could argue that its merely another form of shouting. Is it possible in the end to get American and European mass audiences to care about Africa without resorting to tired huggermugger? Would a straight-up drama reach the most people? Would a factual documentary go unseen? Or should Hollywood just pull out the stops send Tom Cruise to Niger with the Mission Impossible"" team and a fistful of McDonalds vouchers and get it all on Oprah""? Its a knotty question and The Constant Gardener"" never addresses it. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Gardener nurtures a complex beauty By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Dont be put off by the title The Constant Gardener (    out of four) is a masterwork of suspense romance and political intrigue. It is a taut and gripping thriller that dazzles the eyes and engages the brain in a way that few recent films have come close to approaching. More than scratches surface Mystery surrounds Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes against Kenyan backdrop. Focus Features Told in a non-linear style that requires close attention the film is vastly rewarding to viewers who seek a smart and complex love story. That it offers passion betrayal gorgeous cinematography social commentary stellar performances and clever wit puts it in a special category near perfection. Based on a John Le Carre novel the movie has an epic feel that could make it a best-picture Oscar contender and result in nominations for several actors. In his best performance since Schindlers List Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin a reserved British diplomat who is drawn to the passion and intensity of a human-rights activist Tessa who is played with just the right amount of brio and feistiness by Rachel Weisz. The two fall in love marry and move to Kenya where the pregnant Tessa teams with a local doctor to help Africans who are afflicted with AIDS and tuberculosis. She also embarks on secret research that implicates a major pharmaceutical corporation in criminal activity. When she ends up dead signs point to a possible cover-up. Fueled by grief and haunted by things left unsaid Justin sets out on a complex journey to uncover the details of her demise. His dangerous odyssey takes him across Africa and back to Europe where he becomes politicized in the process of working out his sadness. There are a host of possible conspirators and implied infidelities possibly involving diplomats played by Danny Huston and Bill Nighy who delivers a top-notch performance and a crusty doctor played by Pete Postlethwaite. In classic thriller fashion Justin ends up in a web of paranoia not knowing whom to trust. But there is nothing formulaic about the way the story plays out often through a series of flashbacks under the expert direction of Fernando Meirelles. The Constant Gardener proves that Meirelles brilliant and unsettling last film City of God was no fluke. Lauded for his work set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro his achievements shine on this larger-scale effort. Screenwriter Jeffrey Caine took Le Carres multilayered novel and adeptly fashioned it into an intelligent and riveting movie. The chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz is palpable and their fiery love story is all the more moving as it is set against the vibrant backdrop of the African countryside. The film fuses their romance with a consciousness of the vast tragic poverty and disease rampant in Africa the arrogance of corrupt politicians and greedy corporations and the ineptitude of local governments. The Constant Gardener is at once romantic and purposeful poignant and thought-provoking but it is not medicinal. The story hurtles jolts and fascinates from start to finish.

"The Constant Gardener. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Constant Gardener. The Constant Gardener. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 30 2005 508 PM Mr. Fiennes I Presume? In The Constant GardenerRalph Fiennes clams ups and goes to Africa. By David Edelstein Ralph Fiennes Constant-ly fine The anger that builds when you read John le Carres novel The Constant Gardener is rooted in the term ""proper channels."" As in ""Be a good chap and go through the proper channels."" Or ""There are proper channels for this sort of thing old boy."" How often le Carre must have heard that phrase in his time in the service. How often we all hear it even outside the realm of diplomacy. It isnt long before you realize that ""the proper channels"" are the ones full of strategic blockages and diversionary tributaries. To find other ways to the source you have to be something of a gardener. The protagonist of Fernando Meirelles film of The Constant Gardener(Focus Features) is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) an apolitical midlevel British career diplomat posted in Africa--a mild plodding fellow evidently happiest when hes digging in the dirt in back of his house. He has to dig in a different way when the body of his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz)--a strident rich-girl political activist who was an odd match for him to begin with--turns up mutilated in a dry North Kenyan lake bed. Justin knows that Tessa was going on about the fact that African men women and children were dying by the thousands for reasons that had less to do with malnutrition and infection than with ... what? It had something to do with the multinational pharmaceutical companies--""Big Pharma""--but he doesnt remember the particulars. It wasnt really any of his business. Advertisement This is among le Carres least twisty plots. The suspense isnt in whodunnit and why Whats happening is clear from the outset. Its in whether Justin has the wiles and the tenacity and the guts to dig through the cover-up in the face of friends colleagues and superiors telling him--as they told his wife--to go through the proper channels. In his case those channels are the only ones he has ever known. Is Fiennes miscast? Perhaps. Hes a high-strung somewhat clammy actor--not the first to spring to mind for this warmly self-effacing plodder. But hes remarkably fine. As Quayle retraces the steps of his wife and her colleague a Kenyan doctor named Bluhm (Herbert Kounde) who has disappeared amid hints that he was both Tessas lover and killer Fiennes shows Quayles self-protective mask beginning to melt under the vicious African sun. Jittery and disoriented Quayle has nothing in this world to hold on to. The Brazilian Meirelles (City of God) was not the obvious choice to direct The Constant Gardener--thank heaven. Hes no Anglophile and he doesnt seem drawn to the paneled studies and old-boys clubs in which much of le Carres work takes place. He plunges us into the maelstrom of African poverty starvation and disease--of raw-sewage-saturated shantytowns and clinics overrun with dying mothers and children. He has an Impressionists palette The emotion in the latter part of the film is in the funereal purple clouds against the stark white skies and the reds that leap out of the overbaked landscapes; in the swervy streaky camera; and in the way the frame seems to expand or contract according to the characters anxieties. Theres more of Tessa in the movie than in the book and Meirelles and the screenwriter Jeffrey Caine keep their syntax swervy too. They weave in and out of Quayles memories--dredging up moments of revelation as when he stood cringing while Tessa posed rude questions to high English and Kenyan muckety-mucks or when she confronted him about his true loyalties. Le Carre and the filmmakers make their own loyalties plain. They were working from documented cases in which Big Pharma conducted drug trials on the populations of developing nations. But how far up the ladder does the conspiracy go? Are the coldly formal diplomats and ministers willfully oblivious or are they in bed with the rapacious capitalists who threaten them over rounds of golf while their African caddies watch impassively? Danny Huston (Johns son) is effectively squirmy as Quayles friend and colleague Sandy--one of le Carres familiar bureaucratic vacillators. But is the awkwardness in the character or the actor? The bogus English accent muddies the issue. The other actors playing members of the British High Command are perfect among them Bill Nighy as a conscienceless minister--the exact opposite of the tender halting bureaucrat he played in the recent HBO political drama The Girl in the Cafe (which was kind of a simplified nonviolent version of The Constant Gardener). Of course if youd like a summer vacation from all the conspiracy theories floating around (from Judith Millers role in Plamegate to Tom DeLays support for the sweatshop/sexshop paradise Saipan under the direction of Jack Abramoff) dont see The Constant Gardener. Its too infuriating and invigorating It might inspire you to haul out those garden spades and get digging. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Constant Gardener The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; constant-gardener-the ) Constant Gardener The (United States/United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli For his follow-up to City of God Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles has elected to adapt John Le CarrA(c)s The Constant Gardener into movie form. A slow-burn thriller simmering with international intrigue the book would at first seem too long and complex to be crammed into a two-hour motion picture. But Jeffrey Caines screenplay does a solid job of distilling the essence of the novel into something manageable and Meirelles kinetic in-your-face style lends energy and immediacy to the proceedings. This is not a thriller designed for the crowd that prefers shoot-outs chases and other action-packed incidents. The Constant Gardener is talky and intelligent and never takes the cheap way out. Its also something of a downer both it terms of how the main characters are handled and in its cynical attitude toward the pharmaceutical industry. Theres no mistaking The Constant Gardener for anything other than a ""message movie."" Yes theres also a love story here but the most powerful aspect of the movie is what it has to say about the way medicines are tested in third world nations without the consideration of negative side effects and how bad things that happen during these trials are covered up. The Constant Gardener is fiction but the incidents it portrays are based on real-world events from Africa and Asia. The first character we meet is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) a soft-spoken British diplomat in Kenya. Within a few minutes we learn that his young wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) has been killed while traveling in a jeep along a lonely stretch of highway. The official cause of death is a bandit raid but Tessa was a known activist and Justin suspects a cover-up. There are other loose ends. Was Tessa having an affair with Arnold Bluhm (Hubert KoundA(c)) the black doctor who accompanied her on many of her trips? And why was she obsessed with a new drug being used to cure TB? His superiors (Danny Huston Bill Nighy) are tight-lipped and urge him to drop the matter as well as to return a letter that Tessa allegedly stole - if he should happen to find it that is. At the root of his investigation lies Justins need to determine whether Tessa loved and was faithful to him. The more he probes into her life and the nature of her activism the more galvanized he is to act. Through Justins mission we learn as much about Tessa after her death as we do during the 30 minutes of flashbacks that occur early in the film. Meirelles makes the movie as much about Justin and Tessas relationship as about the political situation although his docu-drama style (with lots of hand-held camera shots) works against strong character identification. Justin never comes vividly to life and his romance with Tessa engages us on an intellectual but not emotional level. Perhaps this is because Justin is a reticent man and the story is told from his point-of-view. Regardless we understand how each revelation changes Justins comprehension of his relationship with his late wife but feeling for him is another matter. Meirelles has chosen his cast for acting ability rather than name recognition. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are perfect for the roles. He brings a cool reserve to his part. Justin is a gentle individual a tender of flowers who would rather talk than act. Fiennes captures the essence of such a man and how he reacts when pushed. Weisz despite being in less than half the movie is a firecracker and Tessas shadow looms large even when shes not around. She brings passion and energy to the part; The Constant Gardener crackles when shes on-screen. In secondary roles Pete Postlethwaite (as a field doctor in the Sudan) and Bill Nighy are exceptional. Gerard McSorley is memorable as a knighted thug. The only one to strike a slightly ""off"" note is Danny Huston who is miscast as Justins slimy boss. Like Hotel Rwanda another film about atrocities in modern-day Africa The Constant Gardeners biggest challenge may be finding an audience. Despite being based on a Le CarrA(c) book the final product is more reminiscent of City of God than it is something from the pen of the worlds foremost spy novelist. Yet despite the lack of surprises and cheap theatrics there is plenty of tension and drama and the acting by Fiennes and Weisz is top notch. The Constant Gardener is a movie with something to say and it speaks its message loudly and with eloquence. The only question is how many people will hear it?

As literature the novel is strictly old school bare of stylistic frills and thick with moral outrage -- which may be just whats needed to address the pillaged morass that is Africa. But though hes a deft and nuanced creator of characters he identifies with Le Carre (like the filmmaker Mike Leigh) can be a petty caricaturist when it comes to the rich and powerful whose linguistic and physical tics he lampoons with effortless not to mention endless reams of malicious prose. Gripping though it is The Constant Gardener is in dire need of a loving fearless editor and it has found one in Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles who made the feverish Rio de Janeiro slum melodrama City of God. A superb stylist who fell disturbingly in love with the frenzied extremity of his subject in that movie Meirelles seems on paper exactly the man to bring out the worst in Le Carre -- his reflexive paranoia and simplistic contempt for all things American post-industrial or upper crust -- while slighting the writers immense gifts as a realist interpreter of character. Its a fate that with the exception of the masterful television adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) has overtaken almost every attempt to film the authors work up to and including John Boormans wispy The Tailor of Panama (2001). The Constant Gardener though is a smart beautiful piece of storytelling attentive to Le Carres broad intent while boldly taking a knife to his more egregious longueurs. You can never go wrong casting Ralph Fiennes as a nerd and the actor is terrific as Justin Quayle an effete British diplomat coasting in his midlevel job while indulging his two passions -- a lush garden and (more passively) a young activist wife Tessa (played by the luscious and intelligent Rachel Weisz) who haunts the slums of Nairobi looking to help wherever she can and bugs the stiffs at the British High Commission to get behind her efforts. As the movie opens Justin is devastated by news of Tessas brutal murder in an isolated rural outpost and the disappearance of Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kounde) her African traveling companion and rumored lover. The movie zigzags nimbly back and forth in time and place setting up with tender sensuality Justin and Tessas counterintuitive union. Theres a little of Le Carre the ambivalent equivocal son of a con artist in Justin and perhaps more of Le Carre the late-blooming lefty crusader in Tessa whos also loosely based on Yvette Pierpaoli the French human-rights activist to whom Le Carre dedicates his novel. Justin and Tessa make up an unlikely pairing of opposites and as the diplomat sets out to find who would want to kill his wife their marriage is posthumously cemented and Justin is ever more possessed of Tessas strength and bloody-minded persistence. Hes going to need it for as this febrile thriller picks up speed he finds himself caught in a web spun by a bizarre coalition involving high-level Kenyan and British officials and a drug corporation that promises treatment to thousands of AIDS-afflicted Africans on condition they take a tuberculosis vaccine in the early stages of clinical trials. Meirelles clearly shares Le Carres rage against the machine but he and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine artfully nudge the point of view in Africas direction. Its a fine aesthetic move Meirelles has a sense of place at once visceral and lyrical and the same skills that went into making City of God such a blast show up in his Nairobi slums which though hardly sentimentalized teem with vivid life and movement their luminous yellows oranges and browns glowing in sharp contrast to the glum gray-green murk of London. (Though its in London that Justin lunches with the desiccated ominously evasive High Commissioner Sir Bernard Pellegrin whos wonderfully underplayed by the great Bill Nighy in what is one of the movies funniest and most insidious scenes.) Focusing on Africa is also an astute political shift that takes the edge off Le Carres glib Western patronage of a poor old powerless Dark Continent that can only be saved by crusading whites. Though The Constant Gardener is far from dewy-eyed about the enormous problems faced by sub-Saharan Africa its enlivened by a sense of agency and excitement thats palpably missing from most Western discussions about the region. As for our mousy hero by the end he has discovered in himself a lion a way to keep faith with his wife and a place however briefly to call home.

This review was updated on August 16 2005. If Bob Geldof were a film director he would undoubtedly aspire to make a movie very much like ""The Constant Gardener."" Topically urgent and ripe with outrage over injustices visited upon the African poor Fernando Meirelles screen version of John le Carres incisive novel succeeds in capturing the books essential themes and concerns albeit in a hectic style that could not be more antithetical to that of the literary master of international intrigue. By opening the film domestically Aug. 31 prior to the September wave of top tier festivals Focus Features backed by undoubted critical support should succeed in establishing this high-minded well-cast drama as the first significant specialized attraction of the fall. Although untempered anger seethes from all 560 pages of le Carres best-selling 2001 novel it is channeled by the authors acute ability to release it in precisely modulated quantities through the cracks in his characters fastidiously rendered British diplomatese. Le Carre uses the sharpest of scalpels in performing a comprehensive sociopolitical autopsy on the remains of a murdered young woman whose provocative discoveries threatened to explode the hypocrisies lax ethics betrayals and assorted other ills of international pharmaceutical giants and government bureaucracies -- Western and African -- that support the use of Third World populations as guinea pigs. Meirelles working from a script by Jeffrey Caine has managed to arrive at basically the same destination as le Carre but via a very different artistic road. Employing the same helter-skelter style that brought vibrant immediacy to his international hit ""City of God"" on which Meirelles collaborated with Katia Lund helmer employs in-your-face camerawork to bring the Kenyan locations intensely alive; at the same time the rapid-fire approach is nothing like a visual correlative of the elegant relentlessness of the authors style. Simply put this film will probably not suit the tastes of fans who considered the sublimely nuanced miniseries ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" ""Smileys People"" and ""A Perfect Spy"" the ne plus ultra of le Carre screen adaptations but will likely please younger less classically minded auds just fine. In this telling of the powerful tale of a mild-mannered middle-level English diplomat who falls more deeply in love with his wife as he stealthily searches for the truth about her life and death the pic sacrifices emotional connection at the altar of political expose. With the instincts of a muckraker Meirelles tilts ""The Constant Gardener"" in the direction of a docu-drama which gives the ""revelations"" of corporate greed and corruption modest but important priority in the overall shape of things. Ralph Fiennes does some of his finest screen acting right off the bat with his quivering but controlled reaction to news of his wifes apparent death. Pic wisely retains le Carres cinematically non-linear narrative structure which adroitly delivers the backstory of the relationship between middle-aged old-school diplomat Justin Quayle (Fiennes) and his live-wire younger wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) just as it delineates Justins increasingly perilous search into the whys and wherefores of her murder. Thus the couples first round of joyful sex just after they meet in London is juxtaposed with Justins identifying her body after it has been found in a remote part of the country. As the storys strands are extended in impressionistic from-the-hip style the portrait emerges of an emotionally contained rep of Her Majestys Government whose impassioned mate becomes a loose canon once she observes first-hand how new drugs are being used and tested on unknowing Kenyans some of whom die as a result. The thicket of corruption both complicit and implicit active and passive runs the gamut of the administrative business and medical communities. It is the mandate of the British High Commission in Nairobi to foster economic opportunities for Brits hence the wide path cleared for thuggish but knighted tycoon Sir Kenneth Curtiss (a terrifically vulgar Gerard McSorley) who looks to enlarge his fortune with the wonder-drug Dypraxa whichhas not been approved in the West. When Tessa who has lost her own baby in childbirth witnesses the withering away of an African woman who has taken the drug she relentlessly campaigns to expose the dangers of Dypraxa and the layers of malfeasance that foster its use. Its an effort in which she is joined by a sharp young African man Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kounde) with whom she is widely assumed to be conducting an affair and who is initially blamed for her murder. Upholding the status quo of understated decorum and hidden white mischief are among others acting head of the High Commission Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) aging spy Tim Donohue (Donald Sumpter) and their Foreign Office boss Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) all of whom are rightly alarmed by Tessas bulldozing confrontationalism and after her death are forced to deal in their own ways to Justins taking up her torch. Justins journey first takes him to London where he meets with Ham (an excellent Richard McCabe) Tessas effusive and crucially helpful cousin. A subsequent luncheon with Pellegrin makes for one of the films best scenes; the exclusive club setting forces Meirelles camera to sit down with the characters and allow le Carres terrific skill at ever-intensifying one-on-one dialogue exchanges to flourish onscreen. Posing as a journalist in increasingly intrepid mode Justin travels to Germany where he obtains crucial information and is beaten to within an inch of his life. Now as undaunted as his late wife he returns to Kenya to confront those hes concluded were most directly responsible for Tessas death then on to a besieged village in southern Sudan where he believes he will find both his own heart of darkness and release. Thesping is first-rate even though they sometimes seem to be fighting an uphill battle not to be upstaged by the backgrounds Meirelles obviously finds so enthralling. Fiennes is ideal as the ineffably polite diplomat who only after his wifes death can fulfill his own potential for love and passion for a cause. Weisz equally seems to have stepped straight from the pages of the book onto the screen as she fully embodies the driven lusty unstoppable Tessa. Nighy keeps his customary wild streak in check to register memorably as the guardian of the gate for the diplomatic corps and Pete Postlethwaite socks over his crucial role as the mystery man Justin eventually must track down. Huston somewhat overdoes the sinister aspects of a diplomat who tries to conceal the depth of his involvement in the case. Despite the books ferocious criticism of Kenyan government corruption (the specifics of which are significantly reduced in the film) to its credit the nations administration approved shooting there and Meirelles has gone all out to portray the country in close-up from the exclusive digs of its foreign compounds to the stupefying squalor of the Kibera shantytown. With lenser Cesar Charlone and production designer Mark Tildesley leading a production crew that reps Kenya as both striking and squalid pic takes full advantage of its location and roving camera. Claire Simpsons cutting which in its persistent use of visual shorthand recalls her background with Oliver Stone facilitates the telling of a complex tale in a reasonable length of time while Alberto Iglesias score blends with select outside tracks to offbeat understated effect. End credits note location shooting in Manitoba but Canadian scenes didnt make the final cut.
