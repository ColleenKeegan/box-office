"Review Swing Vote is a losing ticket - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Swing Vote is a losing ticketStory Highlights ""Swing Vote"" attempts modern-day Frank Capra tale Neer-do-well is key to presidential election; hes feted by candidates CNN.coms Tom Charity Film tries to make points but jokes land flat Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- ""Swing Vote"" hits on a premise even the average American voter will find hard to credit a presidential election so close it comes down to just one state one county one town and finally one ballot. Kevin Costner plays a neer-do-well whose ballot could tip an election in ""Swing Vote."" A voting machine malfunction means the ""fate of the free world"" -- as the screenplay rather quaintly puts it -- rests on the shoulders of Ernest ""Bud"" Johnson (Kevin Costner) a none-too-bright and rarely upstanding citizen of small-town New Mexico who will break the deadlock after a 10-day campaign solely for his support. This hanging chad of a man is raising a bright articulate 12-year-old Molly (a very confident Madeline Carroll) though it seems more like shes raising him. She cooks his breakfast packs his lunch and in one running gag she wakes him up every morning in time to run her to school. Written by Jason Richman and Joshua Michael Stern and directed by Stern ""Swing Vote"" is a pokey lackadaisical comedy taking broad satirical potshots at politicians who will say anything to get elected. (As if) Watch Costner talk about the movies points >> The incumbent is Republican Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) who wheels in Richard Petty to catch Buds eye lets him smell the leather in Air Force One and declares his favorite fishing spot a national park. Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) has Willie Nelson in his corner but airs ads against immigration and abortion in the mistaken belief thats what Bud wants to hear. In point of fact Bud doesnt have much of a position on anything unless its live and let live. Hes the first to admit Molly is the brains of the operation. Dont Miss Kevin Costners real-life Swing Vote iReport.com What do you think?  Send us your movie reviews Stern means to give us an update on the kind of American fable Frank Capra made in the late 1930s and early 40s ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe."" Those pictures were contemporary fairytales too screwball morality plays of metropolitan chicanery faced down by the essential virtue of the Little Man. They were sentimental sure but they were rapt in their own idealism an immigrants utopian vision of what America could -- and should -- mean. That ardor is best expressed in Jimmy Stewarts inspiring filibuster before the Senate in ""Mr. Smith"" no matter that his only agenda is to secure future boys camps. An actor who seems to float in and out of fashion without doing anything much different on his part Kevin Costner does hark back to that core American Everyman quality embodied by Stewart and Gary Cooper a kind of bedrock integrity thats a little slow unapologetically small-town and in Costners case topped off with a goofy grin. Here hes goateed with jailhouse abs but the beginnings of a beer gut. Bud isnt malicious or vindictive but hes coasting through life and losing ground -- he cant even hold on to his job in an egg-packing factory not so much because of outsourcing (or what a paranoid workmate dubs ""in-sourcing"" -- Mexican laborers coming in to take American jobs) but because hes always late and a congenital slacker. Costner has played losers before -- most eloquently in Ron Sheltons ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup"" -- but these were grand romantic underdogs who still savored the game. This guy Bud is just asleep at the wheel. Still if ""Swing Vote"" is surely peddling its own brand of syrup and soft soap in its effort to capture Capra its got a bit of steel in it as well. The film doesnt shy from painting an authentically sorry picture of the state of the union from one of the ladders lower rungs. The view around Buds home features poverty insecurity racial and ideological divisions and broken families. Indeed Mare Winningham is notably harsh in her one scene as Mollys absent and pill-popping mom. Opportunistic politicians may not be helping but in Buds big moment he wonders whatever happened to his own hopes and dreams -- and takes responsibility for the drift. Its a sentiment Capra might well have echoed though he would surely have punched up the gags while he was at it. ""Swing Vote"" is too limp to make a lasting impact but it is a rueful reflection on where we find ourselves -- or more pertinently where we lost ourselves. A tighter focus on that subject along with sharper jokes could have made ""Swing Vote"" a winner. ""Swing Vote"" is rated PG-13 and runs 110 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys review click here.

Costner as gratingly ingratiating as ever plays Bud the lovable ramshackle ever-hungover blue-collar single dad to 12-year-old verbal sharpshooter daughter Molly (Madeleine Carroll) in Texico New Mexico who finds the presidential election is hung on his single vote. How? Dont ask- its a hanging chad kinda thing which results in Kelsey Grammers overconfident sitting Republican president and Dennis Hoppers Democratic hopeful outdoing each other both in their shameless courting of the first frightened then flattered ordinary joe and also in the spineless policy reversals they offer in response to his homespun political appeals. Costner is the presiding spirit here rather than director Joshua Michael Stern (whos slated to direct our Keira in the upcoming King Lear) and must take all the blame - he shoots simultaneously for wake up America inspiration and good ol boy charm but ends up putting both barrels through his own cowboy-booted foot.

ABOUT THE MOVIESwing Vote  1/2 (out of four)Stars Kevin Costner Kelsey Grammer Dennis Hopper Paula PattonDirector Joshua Michael SternDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG-13 for languageRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesOpens Friday nationwide SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Swing Vote cant decide whether it wants to be an edgy political satire or a heartwarming family drama. Consequently it bounces awkwardly between the two creating disconcerting shifts in tone. One minute youre laughing at its sendup of the political process and the next youre stricken by the sorry state of the sweet and brainy protagonists family. That smart child is 12-year-old Molly (a very natural Madeline Carroll) the daughter of beer-swilling unemployed factory worker Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner). As a father hes just a notch above negligent. He and Molly even joke about the Department of Child Services coming to take her away. He forgets to pick her up at the appointed time repeatedly passes out and cant be roused to take her to school then encourages her to be truant while she begs to go to class. Mollys anger with her dad (and grief over her errant mothers lack of concern) feels surprisingly authentic even wrenching at times thanks to young Carrolls strong performance. But as can happen only in movies Molly is a stellar student and a nearly perfect kid. She cooks cleans takes care of her overgrown adolescent father writes the best reports in her class and is a parents dream of maturity and wisdom. Heck she can even drive a car. On Election Day fed up with her fathers apathy Molly takes matters into her own hands. Through an unexpected turn of events the fate of the presidential election rests upon one vote. And wouldnt you know it would be Bud one of the least informed humans on the planet? Costner is good at playing lovable-loser parts and he doesnt disappoint here. The movie tries to convince us that a national election could conceivably work out this way. New Mexico becomes the pivotal state and the election is so close as to be a draw. Pundits draw parallels to Floridas key role in the 2000 election. But rather than coming down to a few hanging chads the future of the country rests on the re-vote of one dodgy John Q. Public in this case a subpar Everyman. A parade of real-life usual suspects make appearances. James Carville Arianna Huffington and Larry King have cameos intended to add realism to a movie that by its conclusion seems artificial. Thats not to say there arent some clever and humorous moments. Both the incumbent conservative president (Kelsey Grammer) and the liberal challenger (Dennis Hopper) blatantly try to win Bud over. Not only do they court him in strategic ways but they also devise commercials targeted to Bud that fly in the face of their own ideologies and agendas. Their efforts to get Buds vote are among the movies funniest. But this reasonably entertaining movie falters by trying to be both a dark comedy and a sentimental treatise on family and country. It takes a rare film to blend such disparate genres artfully. Dave came close Swing Vote falls short of the mark.

"Swing Vote Political flick fails to deliver on promises | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentSwing Vote Political flick fails to deliver on promisesOne person one vote is a fine philosophy - unless the last voter standing is a suds-swilling good ol boy who thinks political platforms are those wooden boxes short presidents stand on to reach the mic.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Aug. 1 2008Starring Kevin Costner Kelsey Grammer Dennis Hopper Stanley Tucci Nathan Lane Paula Patton and Madeline Carroll. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. At major theatres. PG One person one vote is a fine philosophy - unless the last voter standing is a suds-swilling good ol boy who thinks political platforms are those wooden boxes short presidents stand on to reach the mic.Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner handsomely craggy) is a scruffy loser who gets by on beer and bull. He lives in a trailer in a dusty corner of New Mexico so small its not even on a map. Hes just lost his job and hes struggling to raise his young daughter Molly (newcomer Madeline Carroll) a resourceful smarty who is actually parenting him.Molly a serious miss with civics on her mind wants Bud (whom she calls ""Bud"" not ""dad"") to vote in the upcoming presidential election. Her passionate speech to her Grade 5 class on the responsibility of casting a ballot even gets her a spot on the local news thanks to go-getter TV reporter Kate Madison (Paula Patton) whos hoping to score a network break.But the sirens call of his namesake brew means Bud misses his date with Molly at the polling place. As far-fetched an idea as they come the race ends in a tie and apolitical Bud ends up being the one to determine who will lead the nation in a runoff ballot for one voter.Article Continued BelowJust to make sure Bud gets their message the two presidential candidates and their entourages swoop down to woo the sole voter.Republican Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) the incumbent president arrives on Air Force One and invites Bud aboard for a few beers and a chinwag. Democrat Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) ups the ante by arranging both early jail release for the bass player in Buds Willie Nelson tribute band and a reunion concert.Soon Greenleaf and Boone are flipping and flopping on their policies to cater to what they think Bud supports. In truth all Bud wants is for the fat TV reporter to quit leaning on his car and for someone to buy the next round.There are some genuinely funny moments and a lesson about what happens when power lust obscures all. But its not enough to carry the day and Costner appeals more playing sage sweethearts (Bull Durham Field of Dreams) than an occasionally tart-tongued screw-up.Its the campaign managers who steal the show both veteran character actors. Twitchy desperate Democrat Art Crumb (Nathan Lane) and GOP cool cat Martin Fox (Stanley Tucci) both have their own reasons for wanting their guy to win at any cost.Mare Winningham is outstanding in a brief turn as Buds ex a panicked delusional woman who swears that shes going out on the road to be a country star. The filmmakers may have been dreaming Frank Capra dreams borrowing from Mr. Smith Goes to Washington right down to an impassioned speech from Costner to the candidates as a closer.But as often happens with politics even as Swing Vote entertains it leaves us feeling like weve been subjected to some slick manipulation and worse left with promises unfulfilled.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Kevin Costner Madeline Carroll Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Its not easy to play a stupid guy. The temptations are everywhere - to wink at the audience as if to say ""Im smart actually"" - or to try to make being stupid a form of adorable. Kevin Costner plays a good-natured idiot in ""Swing Vote"" a middle-aged man who has squandered what little potential he had in favor of life as a hard-drinking good-for-nothing and he gives a remarkable performance. Its not the kind of role that wins Oscars because Academy Awards usually go to actors playing high-status roles powerful souls either good or evil. By contrast Bud the likable loser in ""Swing Vote"" is low status all the way a man who can barely function socially whose instincts are all wrong whose impulses are either vulgar or diffident. Costner slips right into that mode of being bringing to the characterization precision observation and a heretofore unexploited flair for physical comedy. If the advance advertising has communicated one thing about this movie you already know that its about an average fellow (actually below average) whose single vote will determine the winner of the presidential election. The scenario is this It all comes down to New Mexicos electoral votes and the popular vote in New Mexico is tied. However Buds ballot was never tallied and so he has the right to cast a written ballot - in effect to choose the winner. Political junkies are an obvious natural constituency for this movie and they will be amused by the presentation of the candidates and their political ads. Kelsey Grammer is the Republican incumbent a borderline idiot and Dennis Hopper plays the Democratic challenger the perfect image of the kind of liberal candidate that inevitably loses two parts Mondale and one part Dukakis with just a dash of Kucinich. When he goes skeet shooting with Bud the recoil of the rifle sends him flying backward. The campaign comes down to a crazy effort to court one mans vote and so each candidate starts pandering - with the Republican posing as a pro-gay marriage environmentalist and the Democrat espousing anti-abortion anti-immigration positions - in television ads that are the comic highlight of the picture. However anyone who approaches the movie with hopes of finding a serious elucidation of an intriguing political hypothetical will be disappointed. For example until I realized it was not that kind of movie I wanted to know who was ahead in the national popular vote (an important weight to throw in the balance in a deadlocked election). I also kept waiting for the candidates to get serious in discussing the issues with Bud. But of course such a story direction would have led to a dead end a polemic for one side or the other. The movies real interest isnt in political issues so much as in presenting Bud as an archetype of a certain kind of American living on the fringes with little sense of the world around him. The script by Jason Richman and director Joshua Michael Stern is very good at showing us the thought patterns of a guy who really doesnt know how life works or how to comport himself outside his limited sphere. The scenes between Bud and the political honchos that come courting him are painfully accurate portrayals of someone whose social compulsion is to bring everything down to a comfortable level of clowning even if it means being perceived as a buffoon. Costner has the internal workings of this guy down and hes well matched by young Madeline Carroll who plays his precocious loving daughter an adults mind in a childs body. The movie is a bit long. Sometimes the audience is ahead of the story and the setup itself has some built-in challenges that no script could have overcome. But the mix of comedy and drama is winning; Costner couldnt be better and the little girl is a find. The film is characterized by fine performances throughout including that of Mare Winningham who turns up in a single scene and brings to it a whole anguished life history. Real-life political reporters and commentators such as Chris Matthews and Campbell Brown make appearances. Arianna Huffington has the agony of actually having to say ""Somewhere Franklin and Jefferson are smiling"" as though either founder would have liked the prospect of an idiot choosing the president. Not likely. After all it was Jefferson the ultimate democrat among the founders who said ""If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be."" Jefferson would not be smiling on Bud. Bud was his worst nightmare. -- Advisory This film contains strong language.

After a week of broad hints Colbert announced on his show ""The Colbert Report"" that he would ""seek the office of the President of the United States."" He says he plans to run in the upcoming South Carolina primary election but - at least for the moment - has no plans to run elsewhere. And hell run as both a Democrat and a Republican so ""I can lose twice"" he told viewers. ""After nearly 15 minutes of soul-searching I have heard the call"" Colbert said about his candidacy. As it turns out all he needs to get on the ballot in South Carolina is money. Under state election rules anyone can get on the Republican ballot for a fee of 35000 according to officials. To get on the Democratic ballot the more popularly priced fee is 2500. Several years ago The Palmetto State abandoned the practice of collecting voters signatures on petitions. The deadline for getting on the ballot is Nov. 1 just a bit more than two weeks away. Colbert says he chose South Carolina because thats where he was raised (he was born in Washington D.C.) - and where he could capitalize on his status as a ""favorite son."" ""Right now politics is hot and heavy and we certainly welcome Colbert to enter into the primary"" South Carolina GOP chairman Katon Dawson told The Post yesterday. But ""my advice to him is to take the 35000 and buy a sports car and get a girlfriend"" Dawson said. It remains to be seen what if any impact Colbert could have on the South Carolina primary. One barometer is Pat Paulsen the deadpan comedian who shot to fame on ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" and ran for president in 1968 - the Nixon-Humphrey election - becoming a media sensation at least partly because many voters were not enthusiastic about either major-party candidate. Paulsen garnered nearly 200000 votes in 1968. ""One vote is taking a vote away from somebody else but will [Colberts impact] be substantial? No"" says Dawson. ""Will there be a big protest vote? No."" Reps for Colbert declined an interview request.

"Swing Vote (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Swing Vote (PG-13)  Politics aside this Buds for you. Kevin Costner and Madeline Carroll star in ""Swing Vote."" Photo Touchstone Pictures. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Its tempting to say that the election-day shenanigans in Swing Vote are too preposterous to happen but I live in Florida so perhaps its best in this case to never say never. Reality is beside the point anyway. Swing Vote aims to be a Capra-esque fantasy in which that old adage about every vote counting is true even if that man is an ignorant trailer-park slob who knows nothing about politics cant keep a job and spends more time nursing a Budweiser than nurturing his young daughter. Kevin Costner plays the aptly named Bud and hes having such a good time as this affable loser that he distracts you from the plots more trying developments. Bud his Bass Pro Shops cap never far from his unkempt head isnt even registered to vote -- like many nervous citizens he fears jury duty -- but his precocious daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) registers him and even tries to cast his vote when hes too drunk to make it to the polling precinct. Technical problems ensue and Bud is offered a second chance to vote. Meanwhile the presidential election hinges on his decision. Costner wears his disheveled role so engagingly he almost makes up for the fact that Molly is supremely annoying. (She says that when she grows up she wants to be a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.) Her sourpuss reaction as Bud giggles his way through the desperate overtures of the Republican president (an excellent Kelsey Grammer) and his Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper) makes you wish Bud had packed her off to the appropriate child-care agency long ago. She may be mad at her clueless good-timing dad but shes smart enough to know voter fraud is a felony so why is she mad at Bud whos trying to save her bacon? The film eventually bogs down in drama with an unnecessary subplot involving Buds estranged wife and an ethical dilemma for a local news reporter (Paula Patton) that never really gets off the ground. The most inspired bits are the candidates rapidly deteriorating ads aimed only at Bud as the conniving campaign managers (Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane) struggle to decipher what he wants to hear. His careless Who doesnt like life? comment leads to a horrifyingly inappropriate anti-abortion ad from the Democrats a hilarious new low in pandering. Everyone including the candidates will recognize the importance of civic duty leaving Swing Vote to end with swelling music and uplifting speechifying but on a completely unsatisfactory note. As pushy little Molly will tell you Youve got to pick a side to make a difference.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 2 2008 Save for later Saved Kevin Costner is in full-blown Everyman mode in ""Swing Vote"" a political comedy that also tries to pull your heartstrings.With the upcoming presidential election looming ""Swing Vote"" is certainly timely but it also strains to be timeless. Its as if a moldering old Frank Capra script had been retrieved from the Hollywood vaults. Dusted off and brought up to date its still the same old Capracorn - minus the populist pizzazz he might have provided.Bud Johnson (Costner) is a good-natured goof-off with custody of his precocious 12-year-old daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll). He spends most of his time napping and guzzling beer and getting canned from jobs. But hes not a bad guy really - just aimless. He doesnt follow politics and doesnt much care who wins the presidency but Molly makes it her business to see that he votes - it doesnt even matter for whom. When he screws up on election day she steps in for him. Through a series of implausibilities too risible to relate here Buds vote which went unprocessed becomes a do-over. Oh and his choice will become the next president. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Theres no point in deriding the ridiculousness of this premise. But having set up this every-vote-counts scenario why didnt director Joshua Michael Stern and his co-screenwriter Jason Richman put some teeth in it? This is the kind of ""political"" movie in which all sides are given equal time. Republicans and Democrats are made to look equally good-bad and no real-world issues are introduced except as the stuff of one-liners. Its all so mushily ecumenical. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Swing Vote When the network TV folks and demonstrators of all stripes and creeds descend on Buds tiny town of Texico New Mexico the circus-like atmosphere is remarkably well-mannered. (About the worst thing that happens is that an obese cameraman leans on Buds car.) Incumbent Republican President Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) courts Bud by bringing him aboard the presidential plane for a chat. Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) goes for a more down-home approach setting up a shindig where Bud can jam with his band performing covers of Willie Nelson hits.Grammer is surprisingly robust as the president. Maybe he should think about going into politics for real. (After all if image is indeed everything these days why not?) The casting - or I should say the miscasting - of Hopper is difficult to fathom. He tries mightily to look noble but he carries too many stoned-hippie vibes to pull it off.Costner is pleasant enough but his affability here carries too much ideological baggage. At his best in films like ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup"" he could be marvelously easygoing and yet temperamental. Those guys had gumption. Costner wasnt trying to be an Everyman and so paradoxically he sort of became one anyway. He brought us into the commonality of his characters experiences.In ""Swing Vote"" Buds ordinariness is intended to certify his deep-down all-American decency. The fact that this single father spends most of his time loafing is presented as ""cute."" Molly is exasperated but of course since were also in ""Paper Moon"" territory here she truly loves him and is undamaged by his shenanigans. She just wants Bud to be an upstanding voter.Molly hammers home the point that one should not give up on the system but its not clear that Bud ever bought into it. If he at least was exposed to a range of policy issues by the two candidates his trajectory from slacker to model citizen might have made sense. But in the world of ""Swing Vote"" its enough that you vote - why or for whom is secondary.The filmmakers want to fashion a civics lesson but they dont bother to include anything of substance. The only time they stretch their necks out - and its only a millimeter or two - is when they show the two candidates shamelessly pandering for Buds vote. Of course they come to see the error of their ways. No one after all ever won an election in America by pandering to the populace.And speaking of shamelessness The high civic tone of ""Swing Vote"" is belied by its vast array of product placements. (Why do you think Bud is so named?) It also showcases a galaxy of real-world newscasters and commentators including Chris Matthews Arianna Huffington Bill Maher and Larry King. I find this sort of display unseemly - further proof if any were needed that news and entertainment are becoming indistinguishable. The piece de resistance will come when Larry King gives this film a good review. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for language.)

"Swing Vote An election for dummies - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Swing Vote An election for dummies Kevin Costner as a dolt dad and the deciding vote in the presidential election. (ben glass/disney via associated press) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / August 1 2008 With several months left before the presidential election ""Swing Vote"" arrives to remind you whats important. The movie goes on and on about honesty. Illegal immigration gays in the military and abortion all come up. But to paraphrase a successful presidential campaign Its the screenwriting stupid.""Swing Vote"" is comedy about a 12-year-old who winds up voting for president because her father was too drunk to do it himself. The whole fictitious election comes down to her fraudulent vote which because of a power outage at the polling station didnt count. So both campaigns (Republican incumbent Kelsey Grammer versus of all people Democrat Dennis Hopper) and a frenzied news media (Mary Hart that includes you) descend on dusty little Texico N.M. where Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner) a single dad and factory worker and his daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) live in what passes for poverty in the movies - a modest house full of nicely art-directed clutter.The ensuing activity - 10 days for the recently fired Bud to pretend to have cast the original vote make up his mind and pick a winner - puts a dolt in the lap of the American political machine. Or is it the other way around? Neither side seems all that comfortable with their assignments. The folks running the respective campaigns - Nathan Lane (blue) and Stanley Tucci (red); neither in top form - dont understand Bud and Bud doesnt understand the issues. Nor does he care to vote which is fine with us. But hes an embarrassment to Molly. His crimes include being oblivious to what ""civic responsibility"" even means and it really burns her up.Molly is basically raising Bud. She wakes him up with breakfast every morning drives him home from the bar and leaves him notes urging him more or less to be a father. This is social tragedy presented as tidy sitcommery. As Molly Carroll furrows her brow and juts out her mouth to make us see a plucky little woman rather than someone more pitiful. The movie italicizes bolds and underlines her self-sufficiency along with everything else. The night Bud forgets to vote he smacks his head on a sign that reads ""Vote today."" In a display of restraint the director and co-writer Joshua Michael Stern declines to have him hold up a sign saying ""Ouch.""When the local reporter (Paula Patton) asks Molly what shed like to do for a living Molly says ""veterinarian or chairman of the Fed."" Not to be all social services but you have to ask how a girl who barely knows her mother and has a useless father turns out to be such a well-adjusted angel and judgmental patriot. There is the fact that shes the daughter of a Kevin Costner character and while the star has played his share of lovable losers this one is unworthy of his redemptive charm.""Swing Vote"" is a satire thats afraid to satirize. Its predicated on so many forces of incompetence converging in a single spot that it feels like farce for dummies. A movie about two presidents and their operators pandering to one man could have produced a withering comedy. But its reluctant and restrained when it needs to be ruthless. The fake ads the campaigns concoct after hearing where on the issues Bud stands arent bad. (And theres an odd marijuana motif - theres Bud and Dennis Hopper is playing someone whose last name is Greenleaf trying to woo a guy named Bud.)Otherwise the movie has no teeth no vision and no real insights. It also lacks a sense of modernity. Its 2008. Why are we still microwaving Frank Capras old casseroles? The movie turns racism class woes and social issues into jokes instead of engaging them with intelligence wit or a whiff of drama. All we get are platitudes (see every vote really does count). Many are contained in Buds big speech at the end of the film. Before he reads it to America (with sudden eloquence) he tells someone ""Oh God I think Im going to puke."" Me too.

"Swing Vote reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Swing Vote reviewed. Swing Vote reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 31 2008 519 PM Dances With Roves Kevin Costner in the political ""satire"" Swing Vote. By Dana Stevens Swing Vote Swing Vote (Touchstone Pictures) isnt exactly a toothless political satire. Its something worse a satire with dentures. What little bite it manages to apply against the American electoral system is fake to be removed at will whenever a truly chewy topic comes up. Some of the issues the movie gums include abortion immigration and the unacknowledged alcoholism of its own main character. For starters the moment in American politics this comedy spoofs now feels so remote it might as well be the Harrison/Van Buren race of 1840. ( Tippecanoe and Costner too)Given our current political reality two foreign wars a terrorist threat and the first racially diverse presidential campaign in American history--the hanging-chad woes of the 2000 election are the last thing on our minds. The films premise that a hotly contested presidential race somehow comes down to a single vote is not without its populist charm. Frank Capra could have done something with it. But I knew Frank Capra (OK Ive seen a lot of his movies) and you director/co-writer Joshua Michael Stern are no Frank Capra. Advertisement Nor is Kevin Costner a Gary Cooper. But it isnt Costners fault that Swing Vote is such a formless pasty blob of a movie. As Bud Johnson a divorced father on the verge of losing his job at an egg-packing plant hes in his comfort zone as an actor playing the kind of dim-bulb salt-of-the-earth loser hes carried off nicely in movies such as Bull Durham and Tin Cup. (Its when Costner roles get steely-eyed and morally upright that you need to start worrying.) Bud and his young daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) live in semi-squalor in a trailer on the Texas/New Mexico border. Their relationship--hes a low-functioning drunk; shes a hectoring enabler--is depressing to a near-tragic degree though the filmmakers seem convinced of its bantering charm. Molly a precocious political junkie (when she grows up she wants to be ""either a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed"") spends Election Day nagging her father about his civic responsibility to vote. But while she waits for him at the polling station hes passed out drunk in the cab of his parked truck. Molly then sneaks past the dozing poll workers and tries to vote in her fathers stead. Thus in a series of events as incomprehensible as they are unconstitutional an incomplete ballot with Buds name on it becomes the deciding factor in the election. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In the ensuing 10 days before he casts his vote this apolitical dumbbell is desperately courted by both the fatuous Republican incumbent (Kelsey Grammer) and his spineless Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper). The efforts of these two are coordinated respectively by Stanley Tucci as a Rove-esque Republican operative and Nathan Lane as a Bob Shrum-style Democratic strategist who cant seem to win an election. The scenes of pandering one-upmanship that follow afford some of the movies rare mirthful moments including a pro-life political commercial thats just sick enough to be funny. But the countrys most waffling swing voter cant be as confused as this movies script is. Besides the central have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too problem--how do you combine cynical satire with sappy civic idealism?--theres a fundamental flaw in the father-daughter plot. Costners Bud Johnson is not a lovable rascal of a dad; hes a boozing derelict who ignores and betrays his daughter in scene after uncomfortably painful scene. But the 12-year-old Madeline Carroll is the only person involved--including the director and screenwriter--who seems to perceive just how terrible Mollys life is. As the grownup actors go through their purportedly comic antics she skulks at the edge of the frame her little face pinched in agony. Its a reaction entirely consistent with the crappy treatment her character receives but the unresolved question of Mollys neglect lends the movies faux-uplifting ending a sour taste. A late appearance by Mare Winningham as the girls drug-addicted absentee mother also hits a disconcertingly realist note Is this a political comedy or a drama about child abuse? If its the latter that would at least explain the lack of laughs. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Youve had it drummed into your skull since junior high civics class Every single vote counts. Diebold machines and hanging chads notwithstanding its still a resonant if improbable message Any citizen of our nation might cast the deciding vote in an election. ""Swing Vote"" puts a seriocomic twist on the premise turning a trailer park layabout (Kevin Costner) into the sole decider of a presidential tie. Through an electoral college stalemate the race comes down to the swing state of New Mexico. It comes down in fact to Bud Johnson a beer-marinated single dad who promised his socially responsible 12-year-old daughter (Madeline Carroll) that he would shake off his usual lethargy and visit the polling station. Through a mechanical malfunction Buds ballot is not recorded and hes allowed to cast it again. But first hes courted one-on-one by the Republican incumbent (Kelsey Grammer) and Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper) who converge on his flyspeck home town to convince disenfranchised Bud that they deserve his vote. The films strengths are Costners laid-back work as Bud an affable ignoramus with a heart of gold and the absurd policy contortions the candidates go through to woo him. In a series of satirical campaign commercials the conservative beams approvingly at gay couples and champions environmental protection while the liberal lashes out at Roe v. Wade and praises ""Gods intelligent design."" The bits are funny in and of themselves. The antiabortion spot features a playground full of happy children who vanish one by one in little mushroom-cloud poofs. But the ads are also a well-deserved poke at candidates tendency to wuss out compromise their ideals and run to the middle as Election Day nears. Costner is a past master at this kind of lovable loser role. Hes blissfully silly in a scene where he hears a no-nonsense knock on the door concludes that the child protection authorities are after him again and slips a crucifix necklace over his daughters head. Hopper successfully plays against type as the milquetoast Democrat and Grammer brings some executive gravitas to the part of the president. To give the story a touch of verite a slew of media personalities join the journalistic invasion force that descends on Buds single-wide. Chris Matthews Aaron Brown Larry King Arianna Huffington and Bill Maher play themselves. The film is handsomely produced -- Costner poured 21 million of his own money into it -- with an all-star cast including Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane as PR spinmeisters. Like many vanity projects its a bit overlong and self-important. Still its heart is in the right place. At a time when 80 percent of the public despises political officeholders its fun to see them take a shellacking. Yet ""Swing Vote"" doesnt take the facile route of mocking and blaming politicians with Costners character as national savior. Bud has convictions sort of and a core of decency but hes woefully underinformed and lazy -- a real mainstream American the film implies. His precocious daughter shames him into making more of an effort to understand the issues and the consequences of his decision. SWING VOTE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for language. ""Swing Vote"" captures the spirit of an election year when many once-apathetic Americans are keenly interested in the outcome. We have met the enemy and he is us. But so is the hero.

One is the self-effacing schlub of Bull Durham and Tin Cup a winning loser who carries himself lightly. The other the self-important somebody of The Postman and Waterworld whose messianic heavyosity scuttles both films. Swing Vote a disarming political satire perfectly calibrated to the national mood and to its revitalized star (who also produced) boasts a scruffy Costner as Bud self-effacing loser. Because of a voter-machine malfunction Bud can pick the winner of a hung presidential race that all comes down to New Mexicos five electoral-college votes. While this sounds like a plot hatched by Frank Capra it is closer to that of the half-remembered 1939 Garson Kanin film The Great Man Votes starring the sodden John Barrymore and even closer to the hanging-chad suspense of the 2000 presidential election. Both cynics snarkfest and civics lesson the ingratiating political satire from Joshua Michael Stern and Jason Richman isnt concerned merely with whether the blue-collar single dad will make the Land of Enchantment tip blue-state or red. It has more important things on its mind. Partisan politics is the satirical target voter apathy the serious one. Which makes Costner the ideal candidate to play the boozy bozo from Texico N.M. who doesnt even know whos on the ballot. Using both his comic and dramatic chops Costner guzzles the material with a looped sincerity. Its his best performance in years. He is ably abetted by the unsmiling Madeline Carroll (no relation to the late British screen legend Madeleine Carroll) as Buds 12-year-old Molly as bright and worried as Bud is dim and oblivious. Molly extracts her fathers promise to vote and when he fails to show up sets in motion the films Rube Goldberg plot. As in many single parent/child films Molly is the reliable one. Her undependable father is chronically late to his job in an egg factory where many are losing work to lower-wage workers from Mexico. If Bud loses his job child services will take away Molly whose estranged mother (Mare Winningham) is out of the picture. Who has time to listen to the candidates? Buds situation casts clouds over the films sunny comedy sharpening the proceedings and Costners performance as the one voter who counts. Both the incumbent Republican president (Kelsey Grammer) and his strategist (Stanley Tucci) and the Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper) and his strategist (Nathan Lane) tell Bud what they think he wants to hear. (In a film that is sometimes flabby the ads where the candidates reverse their positions are trim.) At first Bud the hungry nobody at an all-you-can-eat media buffet devours the attention. But then comes the indigestion the charges that Americas destiny is in the hands of a doofus. (The put-down is a little stronger than that; too bad this PG-13 film is chock-full of profanity. But for the four-letter words its unusually family-friendly.) As the candidates pander to Bud I recalled a line from Bulworth the one where the disillusioned white senator raps the truth to his black constituents ""One man one vote now is that really real? The name of our game is lets make a deal."" In many ways Costners Swing Vote is a companion piece and a rejoinder to Warren Beattys satire. Swing Vote is messy and its targets are relatively safe. But its aim is true. And Costners performance hits the bulls-eye. Swing Vote  (out of four stars) Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. With Kevin Costner Dennis Hopper Nathan Lane Kelsey Grammer Stanley Tucci George Lopez and Madeline Carroll. Distributed by Touchstone Pictures. Running time 1 hour 59 mins.

News by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Ben Glass) Posted August 8 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT The covert intelligence embedded in the boobish political comedy Swing Vote states that we the people are stupid drunk apathetic or all of the above. But on the face of it the Capra-esque civics lesson conveyed in this pandering fantasy is that every citizens vote is crucial to the American electoral process. Not only that but by properly appreciating the precious gift of participatory democracy (as encouraged by a wise liberal Hollywood) even the sorriest dumb-ass can shape up overnight into an informed thoughtful activist someone deserving of change we can believe in. Through fictional preposterous happenstance inspired by the real-life preposterous happenstance in Florida that decided the 2000 presidential election the outcome of the presidential race in Swing Votes alternative America rests on the ballot about to be cast by one citizen a clueless shlub named Bud (Kevin Costner). Bud a direct descendant in temperament and blood-alcohol level of the elbow benders Costner played in Tin Cup and The Upside of Anger is a screwup and factory worker in a small New Mexico town. Often he doesnt wait until his shift is over to begin his real job of boozing and passing out. Bud is also the divorced father of a preternaturally mature 12-year-old daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll a pint-size Ellen Page in training); the girl cooks cleans rouses her father from his stupor each morning in the cluttered trailer home they share and excels in school by writing essays about the importance of civic participation etc. So while both the incumbent Republican president (Kelsey Grammer smoothly embodying a kind of distant relative of our actual Republican president) and the Democratic challenger (Dennis Hopper in a sly bit of casting) go about pandering to their target voter Bud treats his extraordinary circumstances with all the doltish entitlement of a game-show contestant. Costner (whos also a producer) plays to his middle-aged strengths in a role that exaggerates male weaknesses. A beer guzzler in a truckers cap Bud has accepted pickled self-absorption as a daily condition and Costner throws himself into a display of know-nothingness with an endearing ease that only comes to a movie star who in all seriousness once played a man with gills. But the movies queasy garble of soft-core satire and rote idealism as well as its uninspired reworking of old ruts in political comedy becomes wearing. (Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane are equally broad playing win-at-all-costs Republican and Democratic campaign managers respectively.) Its difficult to shake the sense that director Joshua Michael Stern (Neverwas) who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jason Richman (the upcoming Bangkok Dangerous) is laughing -- not with the Buds and the strategizing politicos of the world but at them. In Sterns attempt to have it both ways his satiric targets prove at once both easy and inconsistent. Journalists are portrayed as spineless when theyre not being duplicitous or heartlessly competitive; small-town America is the province of hicks except when it suits the art direction to celebrate quaint custom to sentimental advantage. And even as Bud slouches toward responsibility and cleans up his act as a father this redemption must come at the expense of presenting Mollys troubled mother (played in a brief passionate no-joke turn by Mare Winningham) as an unnurturing wreck. All the while well-known pop cultural celebrities journalists and pundits mingle freely as themselves. This blurring of boundaries between entertainment and politics is nothing new -- how many times have we watched Larry King and James Carville play ""King"" and ""Carville""? But the head count of real personages tickled by the opportunity to be treated (and remunerated) as contributors to commercial fakery is dispiriting. Aaron Brown Tucker Carlson Arianna Huffington Bill Maher and Chris Matthews buy into the circus as do Willie Nelson and race-car driver Richard Petty. By the time Bud sincerely apprehends his citizen responsibilities (with an assist from Molly and her hard work as her fathers keeper) Swing Vote has swung irrevocably toward condescension.

Hey whatever works. But Costners better in Swing Vote than he has been in ages playing a non-achieving self-absorbed loser in whose hands thanks to a rather far-fetched accident rests the presidential election. Director Joshua Michael Stern who co-wrote the screenplay is at times confused about what the movie should be and it predictably melts into a big puddle of feel-good political goo by the end. But during long stretches Swing Vote is an entertaining if lightweight political satire which also takes a few choice swipes at media coverage. A father-daughter drama is mixed in aided considerably by the charms of newcomer Madeline Carroll as Costners 12-year-old daughter long-suffering yet wise and intelligent - the obvious grown-up in the family. That part of the film veers into a bizarre wrong turn that thankfully doesnt last long. Its much more effective in scenes such as the one in which a panicked Costner thinking that election officials are there to take his daughter away whispers desperately that they cant ""Shes my only good thing."" Costner plays Ernest ""Bud"" Johnson a loser who drinks his nights away in the small town of Texico N.M. arriving late for work as an egg inspector on the days he shows up at all. His daughter Molly (Carroll) is an outstanding student despite what appears to be nearly criminal neglect. Her career goal - to be a veterinarian or chairwoman of the Federal Reserve - establishes her as the precocious sort of kid found almost exclusively in movies of this sort. She wants Bud to vote partly for a class project and partly because she believes its a citizens duty. Naturally he blows it off and while shes sneaking past the snoozing monitor and casting a vote in his name the power briefly goes out invalidating the ballot. Yet New Mexico law allows for Bud to cast his vote again. Meanwhile the election has come down to New Mexicos electoral votes which will be decided you guessed it by Buds ballot. The next thing you know President Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) a Republican and Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) are descending upon Texico aides and handlers in tow promising the moon to Bud for his vote. The hungry media camp outside his trailer waiting for . . . something. Anything. Unfortunately Bud is so ridiculously out of touch that he would actually have to get a little more involved to even qualify as apathetic. His lack of knowledge of just about anything but beer and fishing comes to light through reports by local television reporter Kate Madison (Paula Patton) among others. His unwitting misrepresentation of his position on various issues - if he has any position at all - leads to bizarre political contortions such as Republican Boone suddenly supporting gay marriage and Democrat Greenleaf opposing abortion (both flip-flops shown in funny commercials). Bud enjoys the attention but Mollys onto the game. Fed up she decides at one point to run away and visit her mother a drugged-out Mare Winningham. Its a depressing twisted turn for the film that establishes nothing. We already know Mollys unhappy. Why beat us over the head with tragedy? You dont need to have seen many movies to guess whether Bud gets his act together in time to cast his vote or to make a fall-on-his-sword speech beseeching the candidates to be worthy of the office they seek. Grammer is good as a seemingly shallow president with a conscience hidden down deep. Hopper is strangely muted and a muted Hopper is hardly Hopper at all. But Costner and Carroll sail right along. Swing Vote is predictable satire light but in an election season that already seems to have gone on forever - and its not even Labor Day - its a refreshing bit of wish fulfillment a nice break. And for the first time in a long time Costners performance gets our vote. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Swing Vote | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; swing-vote ) Swing Vote (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the past it has been difficult to get the public interested in political films. This is especially true of younger viewers who are not old enough to participate in the voting process. 2008 may be different however with the ""rock star"" candidacy of Barack Obama resulting in high interest in the Presidential race and unprecedented ratings for news channels and programs when they highlight election issues. It remains to be seen however whether the national interest in real politics will translate into an appreciation of the fictional politics presented in Swing Vote. Swing Vote marries mild satire with Capra-esque melodrama in a formula that works surprisingly well. The film also avoids preaching and for a movie about politics is careful not to take one side or the other. The movie is neither anti-Democrat nor anti-Republican. While one could argue that parts of the movie sound a little like a high school civics lesson those segments are small. Certainly if Swing Vote has a message its that ""every vote counts"" but it also has quite a bit to say about what both parties will do to get that vote. The set-up is contrived but it does what it needs to do to get the main thrust of the story underway. Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner) is a single father living in a trailer in a small New Mexico town. He devotes his days to working at an egg packing plant and spends his evenings at the local watering hole. He has sole custody of a daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) but thats mainly because her mother is an even less fit parent than he is. Molly who is bright and civic-minded demands that her father participate in the Presidential election between Republican incumbent Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) and Democrat challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper). Instead of meeting Molly at the polling place however a drunk Bud collapses in the front seat of his truck. Molly taking advantage of lax security sneaks in to vote in her fathers stead but a malfunction of the voting apparatus causes the vote not to be counted. This might not ordinarily be a big deal but the election turns out to be razor-thin with the winner of New Mexicos five electoral votes going to the White House and Buds single vote will determine which way New Mexico leans. When his identity is leaked to the press Bud ends up at the center of a maelstrom of publicity and becomes the target of media campaigns by both Boone and Greenleaf. First and foremost this is the story of how one apolitical man traverses the long road from apathy to caring. The catalyst for this is the love he bears for his daughter and his eventual desire not to let her down (after he does so glaringly in the films most moving scene where she defends him in front of her classmates with tears streaming down her face). The human element of the movie - the relationship between Bud and Molly - is handled better than any of the political material. It can be hard to care on an emotional level about lofty ideals like ""love of country"" or ""the importance of one vote"" but its easier to relate to the interaction between a father and daughter. The filmmakers deserve credit for making both candidates likeable men who are motivated not by greed or a lust for power but by a genuine vision of what the country can be. Swing Vote demonizes neither Democrats nor Republicans but it shows how in the heat of the campaign the ""win at all costs"" mantra takes over. The rationale is simple In order to implement their policies they have to be in office and in order to get into office they have to win the election. So lying or falsifying a position in order to attract votes is a reasonable tactic because it serves the greater good. This position is embraced by the Democrat campaign manager (Nathan Lane) and his Republican counterpart (Stanley Tucci) although it causes both candidates qualms of conscience. The movie does an effective job satirizing the kind of media feeding frenzy that would result from this situation as hoards descend upon a man who is as unqualified to do interviews as he is to hand-pick the next President. Swing Vote strives for a level of verisimilitude as well with well-known faces like Chris Matthews and Larry King making appearances. And theres some funny material such as a sequence in which the Democrats begin advocating pro-life and anti-immigration stances while the Republicans become pro-environment anti-big business. Whatever it takesa| Theres also a subplot about a local reporter Kate Madison (Paula Patton) who sees this story as her meal ticket to a national career. Shes the one who first breaks the story and uses a bond she forms with Molly to potentially further her aims. In the end however she becomes more than just another opportunist trying to find the best way to use Buds fifteen minutes as a means of self-promotion. (However there is thankfully no obligatory romance between Kate and Bud.) Kevin Costner is at home as the irascible Bud who at times is more of an anti-hero than a hero. He is frequently outshone by young Madeline Carroll an actress with a thin resume who is 2008s find of the year. She steals scenes from Costner at will and makes Paula Patton fade into the background. Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper are have the requisite charisma and heft to play the candidates; its refreshing to see men running for president who arent portrayed as sleazebags or ignoramuses. Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane present suitably predatory facades although even they arent villains in the truest sense of the word. Swing Vote ends on a note that emphasizes to audiences that the movie isnt about which candidate wins but about the election process and the man who must make the decision. The film takes a simple if somewhat hard-to-accept premise and uses it as a springboard for a motion picture that turns out to be both smart and mature. Yes there are some ""Hollywood"" moments to be found but director Joshua Michael Stern has the courage to take the story in some unexpected directions. Swing Vote is more subtle and insightful than the dumbed-down comedy the marketing campaign would have us believe it to be.

With an eye on the box office coffers and a finger on the nations nervous pulse this romp with a conscience directed by Joshua Michael Stern who co-wrote the edgy screenplay (with Jason Richman) features the new scruffy self-deprecating and slightly graying Mr. Costner dispensing oodles of paunchy charm as the unlikeliest American voter who ever turned cynical indifference into civic pride and a nation upside down. He is really engaging as a polecat from Texico N.M. named Ernest ""Bud"" Johnson a divorced single father who is such a lazy loser he cant even hold down a no-brainer job at the local egg-packing plant. Bud is quite a challenge to his patriotic daughter Molly (newcomer Madeline Carroll a genuine challenger to Little Miss Sunshines Abigail Breslin) who picks up his empty beer bottles and spends an inordinate amount of time trying to get him out of bed. Its Election Day and Bud refuses to vote fretting that it might mean jury duty. Precocious Molly sneaks into the polling place just before it closes and casts her indolent dads vote for him forgetting to pull the lever. The result is that with only five electoral votes New Mexico turns out to be the swing state and Buds irregular ballot is the deciding vote that will throw the election. What follows is the equivalent of a sudden landslide for Ralph Nader. Before he can recast his vote properly every political power in Washington descends on Texico to influence the one man who will choose the next president opening a floodgate for an all-star cast of scenery-chewing comics (Nathan Lane Stanley Tucci George Lopez Willie Nelson) and a circus of gibberish-dispensing media pundits (Chris Matthews Aaron Brown Tucker Carlson Tony Blankley James Carville Larry King Bill Maher Campbell Brown--even Mary Hart for chrissake) to invade Buds mobile trailer competing for more interviews than the press corps trailing Obama in Iraq. Shrieks the manager of the local TV station when they arrive by bus helicopter and even Air Force One to put Texico on the national news ""This is bigger than O. J."" In the 10 days the Registrar of Voters gives Bud to recast his ballot every fruitcake in Washington tries to influence his decision and everything from Planned Parenthood to Outback Steakhouse wants a piece of the action. Both the Republican incumbent (Kelsey Grammer) and his Democratic left-wing rival (Dennis Hopper) appeal to Bud on every issue from immigration to global warming doing and saying whatever it takes to get elected and Bud becomes the composite market demographic that all the campaign strategists of Obama Clinton and McCain have been groveling for all year. Mr. Costner is hilarious as he struts forth from his perch at the local bowling alley to awkwardly declare his views on everything from the environment to gay marriage. Funny animated appealing in an aw-shucks sort of way the star milks maximum impact from a unique body language that is refreshingly knock-kneed and bow-legged at the same time. It all leads up to a televised presidential debate in which Bud gets to ask questions of both candidates and you get the horrible feeling youve seen and heard it all before on CNN. This is numbingly preposterous of course until you realize every joke is based on the crazy-quilt Cuisinart weve made of the U.S. Constitution and the humor comes painfully close to election-year reality. Finally perennial talking head Arianna Huffington faces the camera and says loftily to the brain-dead American public ""Something tells me Franklin and Jefferson are looking down and smiling."" Moaning in pain and disbelief is more like it. Does this election hurt? Only when we laugh. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Dennis Hopper Kelsey Grammer Kevin Costner Madeline Carroll movie Nathan Lane On the Town Stanley Tucci Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/citizen-costner,200,swingvote28,swingvote,observer

Graced with a gently cynical spirit and more brains than its average-Joe protagonist ""Swing Vote"" applies a pleasing Frank Capra-esque glaze to the fanciful story of a blue-collar American whose vote ends up being the only one that counts. Result may not be the sharpest slice of political theater imaginable but pics comic smarts and affecting daddy-daughter drama provide a sturdy platform for its heartfelt advocacy of informed voting and responsible citizenship. Broad commercial potential and impeccable election-season timing aside Disneys oddly misleading ad campaign wont help this ingratiating old-fashioned decidedly nonpartisan entertainment earn the B.O. ballots it deserves. From its opening shots of Americas heartland handsomely photographed by Shane Hurlbut and accompanied by the downright patriotic strains of John Debneys score ""Swing Vote"" feels like a throwback to a more innocent era (well that or a Stater Bros. commercial). Fortunately scribe-helmer Joshua Michael Stern (""Neverwas"") and co-writer Jason Richman have supplied their cheerily implausible premise with almost enough real-world interest -- issues touched upon include the environment abortion and gay marriage but not terrorism -- to mirror our more troubled times. An idealistic intelligent 12-year-old Molly (Madeline Carroll) is used to being disappointed by her irresponsible heavy-drinking single father Bud (Kevin Costner). On the morning of the presidential election Molly urges her dad not to forget to vote promising to meet him later at the polling place in their tiny hometown of Texico N.M. Naturally Bud misses their meeting and Molly impulsively decides to cast his vote for him. Through a series of events that dont seem all that hard to swallow given recent real-life polling mishaps the machine registers that ""Bud"" voted but not whom he voted for. And when the insanely tight race ends up coming down to New Mexicos five electoral votes Buds lowly ballot -- which he is allowed to recast in 10 days -- is fated to determine the next commander in chief. Given that this loopy premise could have been taken in any number of directions Richman and Stern have done an admirable job of exploring the many possibilities within the simplified context of a family film -- albeit one with enough salty language and grown-up discourse to warrant a PG-13 rating. Pic spreads its satirical wings as voracious reporters and political-interest groups descend on Bud and Mollys trailer home while the anxious candidates -- Republican incumbent Andrew Boone (Kelsey Grammer) and Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) -- arrive in Texico to personally woo the undecided voter. Amid the winings and dinings and mountains of swag the script earns its biggest laughs with a series of hilariously barbed Bud-skewed campaign ads that illustrate how readily some politicos will abandon their party beliefs to win an election. Generous fake coverage by the likes of Larry King Tucker Carlson and Mary Hart (among the many celebrities pundits and personalities making cameos here) adds to the in-joke verisimilitude. As Molly grows increasingly disillusioned with politics and disappointed that her dad is ""a dumbass"" (in the words of Bill Maher) the pic taking its cue from such Capra classics as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"" paves the way for Buds redemption -- and by extension the mobilization of the voting audience. While its a letdown that ""Swing Vote"" turns out to have no more substantial political ideas than either of its vanilla candidates its hard not to be stirred by how earnestly the film implores viewers to educate themselves and exercise their rights or by how boldly it casts its hero as a stand-in for unsophisticated apathetic schmoes everywhere. Playing a guy whos irascible unshaven perpetually hung over and prone to swearing in his daughters presence Costner wins over the viewer paradoxically with his utter indifference to whether the viewer likes him or not. Thesps vanity-free turn strikes engaging sparks with the disarmingly self-possessed Carroll whos cute as a button but almost too precocious for this world. While the presidential candidates are interestingly cast against type (Hopper who gleefully parodied George W. Bush in George Romeros ""Land of the Dead"" just seems more GOP than the debonair Grammer) their campaign strategists though played with cutthroat wit by Nathan Lane and Stanley Tucci arent given much to do. Paula Patton is appealing as an ambitious TV reporter with a typically boisterous George Lopez as her boss. Filmed near Albuquerque N.M. the expertly mounted production evokes an effortless small-town feel balanced by occasional glimpses of the Oval Office or Air Force One. Crowded country-western soundtrack includes two songs by Costners band Modern West.
