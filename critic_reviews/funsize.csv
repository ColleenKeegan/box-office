Direct from Pretty in Pink comes the peppy single-parented outsider unaware of her own allure - only here shes named Wren and is played with dead-eyed android charmlessness by TV star Victoria Justice (even her name sounds like a fembot). Taking the part of Anthony Michael Hall in The Breakfast Club is Thomas Mann as hapless but loveable dork Roosevelt while the minor-league racism of Sixteen Candles is effortlessly evoked by Osric Chau as bespectacled Asian boob-grabber Peng. For the full house the part of Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone - reimagined as a mute eight-year-old but essentially the same smart-alecky bane-of-the-adult-world - is taken by Jackson Nicoll as Albert the little brother whose disappearance kicks off the plot.True theres a handful of memorable one-liners and the everything-in-the-pot randomness of the script means that it never quite becomes boring. But this is a dogs breakfast of a film lurching from simpering teen-romcom sentiment to off-colour paedophile gags to sub-Juno hipster cultural references to a lecture on the woes of single motherhood without breaking stride. Oh and that 90-minute running time is padded out at the start with a music video for irksome popster Carly Rae Jepsen. So if youre not a 12-year-old girl be sure to arrive five minutes late.

(It was partly produced by Nickelodeon and this has reportedly caused some concern given that its a PG-13 film in which a giant mechanical chicken humps a car full of teens.) Directed by Gossip Girls Josh Schwartz and written by The Colbert Reports Max Werner the film sometimes seems to assume prior knowledge on our part when introducing characters and situations. It has a certain no-nonsense briskness that suggests it knows its a teen movie and doesnt want to waste time with the usual horseshit of telling us whos who and what their relationships are. Imagine that bit of mental jujitsu for a second a movie that uses its very conventionality as an asset. Set in Cleveland Fun Size focuses on precocious beautiful Wren (Victoria Justice star of the Nick show Victorious) whose Halloween plans to attend hunky jock Aaron Rileys party are hijacked when her party-girl mother (Chelsea Handler) takes off for a shindig of her own leaving Wren in charge of her oddball delinquent brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll). So instead of heading to a popular dreamboats bacchanal and upping their social standing with their sexy costumes Wren and her friend April (Jane Levy) have to be dorks and go trick-or-treating with the younguns. Things get out of hand however when Albert disappears and the girls have to enlist the help of likable nerds Roosevelt (Project Xs Thomas Mann) and Peng (Osric Chao) to try and find him. This is utterly disposable stuff but it does have its moments. Director Schwartz has a lot of fun with the surreal color and pop of Halloween; this is a man who has studied his Meet Me in St. Louis. And Justice is a terrific performer with a concentrated committed energy. You get the sense that both character and actress care about finding the little boy. (How refreshing to see someone in one of these teen movies who actually seems like she enjoys being there.) Along the way we get some genuinely decent surprisingly elaborate gags playing off the social anxiety of the average American kid At one point Wren and her friends find themselves stuck in a beat-up car in teen-heavy Halloween traffic as their broken radio blasts the decidedly uncool inspirational ballad ""You Raise Me Up.""  (""Oh no Here comes the uplifting chorus"" one of them shrieks.) Somewhere along the way some studio executive probably referenced Fun Size as a ""female Superbad"" and the film at times plays not unlike a kid-friendly X-chromosome variation of the Michael Cera-Jonah Hill classic. But therein lies the difference and maybe the problem. Superbad was fueled by the nasty borderline-sociopathic desires of the average American teenage boy; take those away and what youre left with are a lot of disparate gags that raise erstwhile chuckles but ultimately feel somewhat aimless. You could swear that Fun Size wants to go there -- it wants to be raunchier and more unhinged and given its pedigree we know it probably can. But for the sake of its intended audience it pulls back. Thats probably the responsible thing to do. Still its hard not to think that theres a darker funnier movie in there waiting to get out. In the meantime well always have the humping chicken.

Treated like off-brand candy corn by Paramount (who waits until October 26 to dump a Halloween movie into theaters?) ""Fun Size"" will tickle audiences who venture out to see it and might even become a surprise October cult perennial. Victoria Justice (Nickelodeons ""Victorious"") stars as Wren a high-school nerd (already were straining credulity) who gets a shot at popularity when BMOC dreamboat Aaron Riley (Thomas McDonell ""Prom"") invites her and her sassy pal April (Jane Levy ""Suburgatory"") to his swellegant Halloween party. Their plans are disrupted when Wrens mom Joy (Chelsea Handler) makes Wren take care of her younger brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) for the night. Wrens father died the previous year which has impacted everyone in the family Wren wants to leave Cleveland after high school and attend his alma mater NYU; Albert has pretty much stopped speaking; and Joy has been dating the 27-year-old Keevin (Josh Pence). Naturally the prank-loving Albert manages to ditch his keepers sending Wren and April all over town to find him with the help of debate nerds Roosevelt (Thomas Mann ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"") and Peng (Osric Chau). Meanwhile Joy finds herself at a Halloween party where shes closer to the age of the hosts parents than to the other guests. Hijinks as they say ensue. Screenwriter Max Werner and director Josh Schwartz (the guy behind ""The O.C."" ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Chuck"") clearly have several well-worn copies of ""Adventures in Babysitting"" between them but they keep the gags coming at a brisk pace. (When April realizes that Roosevelt refers to his ""moms"" because he has two lesbian mothers (played by Ana Gasteyer and Kerri Kenney) she exclaims ""I thought he was just talking like Lil Wayne"") The creators are aided substantially by a talented ensemble of comic actors including Garfunkel amp; Oates Riki Lindhome and ""SNL"" vet Abby Elliott. Its worth pointing out that young Nicoll gives good deadpan but its the films treatment of his character that may be a turn-off to some parents. Yes this movie hits screens with the Nickelodeon seal of approval but 8-year-old Albert gets into more than one strangers car in a plot development that makes this movie possibly unsuitable for pre-tweens. That particular element wont be a problem for older viewers but where ""Fun Size"" does go awry is in trying to wedge melancholy into the wackiness. Its not out of the question to make the death of Wren and Alberts father a plot point but the movie veers deep into the weeds of their sadness and it throws the comedy off balance far longer than it should. Still its hard not to admire a comedy that dresses its characters up as Aaron Burr or geneticist E.B. Lewis for Halloween much less offers an extended public mortification gag revolving around Josh Groban. Like those mysterious peanut-butter flavored blobs they wrap in orange and black wax paper youll probably forget ""Fun Size"" by November 1 but come next October you may find yourself hankering for another taste.

TWITTER The feature debut of ""O.C."" creator Josh Schwartz navigates high-school high jinks and romance without pushing the taste envelope or succumbing to schmaltz. Nickelodeon gets its raunch on ever so mildly in Fun Size the kids-fare labels first PG-13 theatrical release. The Halloween-themed feature veers into teen-targeted outrageousness but mainly occupies the land of family-friendly fare with an open-minded perspective on family configurations. In his big-screen directing debut Josh Schwartz (wunderkind creator of The O.C. and co-creator of Chuck and Gossip Girl) doesnt disdain fart jokes sex references or boob-centric moments but the movie is by and large smarter than the gross-out tactics that pass for hilarity in many mainstream adult comedies. If it falls short of My So-Called Life or John Hughes movies two obvious touchstones Fun Size finds its sweet-but-not-sappy balance. Though it might underwhelm viewers of several generations it doesnt insult them. In an opening weekend thats pegged for soft box-office returns overall the wide release is eyeing relatively bite-size business. Victoria Justice who toplines the Nick series Victorious plays Cleveland high school senior Wren a long-legged lovely whose book smarts supposedly make her a helpless nerd. Its the bland role at the center of the storys night of zaniness; the color belongs to those around her beginning with little brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) the pudgy and creative troublemaker whose Halloween-night disappearance is the ostensible engine driving the comedy. Eight-year-old Albert who heads off on his own adventure early in the trick-or-treating hasnt spoken in about a year the implication being that hes in a kind of withdrawal after the death of his father. That piece of background information is invoked when it comes in handy just as the search for Albert is a matter of urgency only when theres a lull in the teen romance and high jinks. However fast or slow she conducts her search Wren gets eager assistance from fellow serious student Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) the guy who appreciates her while she longs for the more amorphous dreamboat Aaron (Thomas McDonell). Latters personal drive-by invitation to his big-event Halloween party is directed at Wren but shes less excited about it than her best friend the charmingly wise-ass April (Jane Levy of Suburgatory) a precocious girl whos not about to let her ""sexy kitty"" costume go to waste. Neither is Peng (Osric Chau) the tastefully horny dork rocking an Aaron Burr powdered wig. Theres nothing in Max Werners screenplay that any self-respecting tween wouldnt get without pushing the taste envelope but the funny-sweet material also extends to adults and not just in its references to Pink Floyd and the Beastie Boys. Wren and Alberts mother is sensitively -- yes sensitively -- played by Chelsea Handler. Shes a widow whose affair with a 26-year-old stud gets a reality check at his friends costume party. And Ana Gasteyer and Kerri Kenney-Silver are spot-on as Roosevelts earthy overachieving moms. Thomas Middleditch is perfectly goofy as the compassionate not-quite-adult convenience store clerk who connects with Albert when the Spidey-costumed boy stops in for a beverage that would be illegal in New York City. An uncredited Johnny Knoxville shows up seemingly from another movie in the role of a ridiculous villain. Schwartzs direction can be ungainly and he doesnt always find the right tone but mainly he navigates the storys affirmations while avoiding schmaltz. The movie has a flat look and the Cleveland locations lend it little in the way of character instead conveying the kind of scrubbed generic suburbia that could have been played by Vancouver or Los Angeles. Without taking the film out of its middle-class milieu costume designer Eric Daman makes the most of the license-to-go-wild Halloween setup.

She has some quasi-humorous moments but her trademark snark only appears in muted flashes.Fun Size ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) aims for Home Alone-style craziness but just comes off as queasy. Though its billed as a teen comedy its hard to imagine at whom this film is truly aimed. It has none of the edgy humor of the most successful teen comedies. Yet its definitely not for little kids.Bucketsfull of crass defecation jokes and fat gags bump up against mildly satirical observations and sappy sweetness. Tone shifts are jarring during this night of Halloween mayhem. Scenes in which a little costumed boy is taken hostage and locked up by a creepy stranger are played for laughs but a kidnapped kid hardly seems like a joking matter.MORE Latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY Movies The story centers on Wren (Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice) a beautiful girl whom were supposed to believe is an unpopular nerd because her idea of a cool Halloween costume is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A high school senior in Cleveland Wren cant wait to get away from her oddball family and go off to NYU. But despite Wrens low social standing at school it turns out the hunky heartthrob all the girls dream of has a crush on her and issues a coveted invitation to his Halloween party.But at the last minute Wren is left in charge of her strange and uncommunicative 8-year-old brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) so her mom can go off with her 26-year-old boy toy to a Halloween bash. As Wren and her BFF April (Jane Levy) take Albert trick-or-treating the boy vanishes into a sea of Halloween revelers. Most of the movie centers on Wren searching for her little brother while he goes on a series of misadventures that are never remotely credible clever or comical. Meanwhile Wren connects with a school pal Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) whose lesbian moms are a wanly funny caricature as they jointly weave a giant tapestry of Barack Obamas smiling face. They insist on speaking ancient Greek to their son just before he takes their Volvo on a mission to help Wren. Of course the requisite car crash ensues in a drawn-out and unfunny manner involving a giant chicken statue.Of course no real harm comes to Albert given the sugar-coated world in which this inane comedy resides.

Photo Photo courtesy of Manhattan College Fun Size"" deals with high schoolers partying on Halloween but what about it has anything to do with teens? Is it the poop jokes involving the 8-year-old little brother? The references to E.O. Wilson and Aaron Burr and Ruth Bader Ginsburg? My best guess is its the casting of Chelsea Handler who was born in 1975. Proving she possesses as little charm on the big screen as on TV Handler plays the mom of Wren (Victoria Justice) a Cleveland girl who gets stuck baby-sitting her silent strange little sibling (Jackson Nicoll) so the mom can go party with her hot new 26-year-old boyfriend. I suppose were meant to think of Mrs. Robinson or at least ""American Pie"" but the relationship mainly reminded me of the one between Harold and Maude. Wren and her pals get in cars drive around experience mild pranks back into a chicken restaurant and run afoul of an aging tough guy (an uncredited Johnny Knoxville) who holds the little brother hostage. In the party scene everybody downs one shot -- woot -- and a flirtatious couple wake up next to each other completely clothed. The tweener feel of most of the sitcom-level jokes (the movie carries the Nickelodeon label) is bizarrely mismatched with the ages of the stars ""Fun Size"" presents the broiling hormones of youth at room temperature. The movie has it in mind to produce some of the tender aches of ""Sixteen Candles"" but the comedy scenes are so wretched it merely seems odd when for instance Handler gives a lengthy speech about the sorrows of being a single mom. Molly Ringwald-like Wren must choose between two guys the nerdy Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) and the Porsche-driving Aaron (Thomas McDonell) but both are so dull its hard to care. So feeble is the movie that even the wacky redheaded best friend (Jane Levy) isnt funny. As Wren the brunette Justice has a serene beauty not unlike Minka Kellys but she cant sell a joke and her dorky comic rap scene (about Wilson the naturalist) is painful to endure. The one thing she is good at is looking sad on a visit to her dads grave but I credit the director with that aspect. It must have been easy to create the proper mood by waiting until the cameras rolled and shouting out ""Hey kid bad news for your career We just found out this movie is actually going to be released.""

Starring Thomas Mann Victoria Justice Johnny Knoxville Chelsea Handler Thomas McDonell Riki Lindhome Ana Gasteyer Kerri Kenney Jane Levy Holmes Osborne Director Josh Schwartz Running time 130 Release Opened Oct 26 2012  Editorial Review The trick here Theres no treatBy Jen ChaneyFriday October 26 2012""Fun Size"" is a 90-minute theatrical release from Nickelodeon Productions that if anything should have aired as a half-hour Nickelodeon special. Instead here it comes into multiplexes five days before Oct. 31 to try and steal some box-office cash from bored teens or parents who would rather take their kids to a crummy Halloween comedy than spend the weekend carving jack-o-lanterns. Moms dads do what you have to do. But know this Submerging ones hands in gooshy pumpkin guts is a pleasure compared with sitting through this often crass romp about a teenage girl (Victoria Justice) who loses her little brother (Jackson Nicoll) during a trick-or-treating mishap while their mom (Chelsea Handler) hangs out with her boyfriend. Unless of course you are a huge fan of the genre ""Movies in Which Dudes Wearing Togas Pass Gas Into Chelsea Handlers Cellphone."" If thats the case sincerest apologies. This movie is your ""Godfather Part II."" If you really must know Wren (Justice) -- the sort of improbably gorgeous and geeky young woman who exists only in movies male fantasies and movies greenlighted by men who have hot nerd-girl fantasies -- gets invited to a Halloween party by dreamy classmate Aaron Riley (Thomas McDonell). Aaron is a combo platter of Jake Ryan from ""Sixteen Candles"" Jordan Catalano from ""My So-Called Life"" and a young Johnny Depp the last evoked by his Halloween obsession with dressing as Capt. Jack Sparrow. So clearly Wren and her best friend April (Jane Levy of ABCs ""Suburgatory"") just have to go. But theres a problem Wrens mother tells Wren to take Albert her non-speaking Tasmanian Devil of a little brother trick-or-treating so that mom and her boyfriend can hit a party of their own. (Dont judge Moms husband the father of Wren and Albert died recently. Shes only robbing cradles and dressing up like Britney Spears out of profound grief.) Wren begrudgingly does her sisterly duty but of course loses track of Albert who wanders off and naturally gets caught up in a quest for vengeance involving toilet paper and a convenience store clerk named Fuzzy. In the process of trying to find her brother and still make Aarons bash Wren also must come to terms with the fact that shes really in love with her nerdy friend Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) the only other person who gets her jokes about biologist E.O. Wilson. Anyone whos ever seen ""Adventures in Babysitting"" or has a passing understanding of the term ""shenanigans ensue"" can figure out where things go from here. There are a few moments in ""Fun Size"" where the sitcom-style humor works. Theres a bit involving a broken volume setting on a car radio and Josh Grobans ""You Raise Me Up"" that is mildly amusing. Washington audiences also may titter over a gag about a Sexy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Halloween costume which lets be honest probably exists in a Party City somewhere. And a twist at the end involving of all things the Beastie Boys may please those who are well-versed in the rap trios ""Licensed to Ill"" era assuming any of them are aware this movie exists. But too often Josh Schwartz -- the creator of such television shows as ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl"" and who makes his feature-directing debut here -- strikes juvenile and misguided notes. The scenes involving Roosevelts moms -- a couple played by Ana Gasteyer and Kerri Kenney who as lesbians naturally must dress like hippies and weave tapestries of Barack Obama on their loom -- are borderline offensive. And theres just enough scatological vulgarity foul language and sexual innuendo to make this a questionable choice for most elementary schoolers. In short if you pay money to see ""Fun Size"" its possible youll feel like suing the studio for false advertising since the word ""fun"" doesnt quite describe this cinematic experience. Just keep appealing that case until it gets to the Supreme Court. I have a feeling theres a certain female justice who upon hearing about this movies contents will feel extremely sympathetic to your plight.Contains crude and suggestive material partying and language.

"Fun Size is a decent treat Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsReview Fun Size is a decent treatFun Size starring Victoria Justice and Jane Levy is a Halloween holiday not horror movie from Josh Schwartz (Gossip Girl). It has its small pleasures.October 25 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Victoria Justice from left Chelsea Handler and Thomas Mann star in ""Fun... (Jaimie Trueblood MCT )Halloween usually brings horror movies but the actual holiday experience for most people has more to do with costumes and candy than serial killers and demons. With that in mind the new film ""Fun Size"" looks to play the part of the non-horror Halloween movie. Transiently entertaining with intermittent sparks itll do until something better comes along.The film marks the feature directing debut of Josh Schwartz the force behind such of-their-moment teen TV as ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl."" As any given episode of those shows could seem overstuffed with a seasons worth of plot it makes sense Schwartzs first film would be a youthful one-big-night adventure.Its much less debauched than the recent ""Project X"" but the films niceness might be its undoing a the storytelling lacks sharpness and focus despite a screenplay credited to Max Werner a writer on ""The Colbert Report.""Set in Cleveland the story follows high schooler Wren (Victoria Justice) as she nervously plans for college while still grappling with the emotional aftermath of her fathers death. Her mother (Chelsea Handler) saddles Wren with looking after her oddball younger brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) on Halloween night.This puts a crimp in the plan her friend April (Jane Levy) had for them to go to an exclusive cool-kids party. When Albert goes missing while trick-or-treating their girls night out takes a left turn.""Fun Size"" is at its least convincing when it tries for real emotions. In many ways the true heart of the film is the character of the young and almost entirely silent Albert whose off-kilter sweetness captures the tone the rest of the film seems to be aiming for.Schwartz along with cinematographer Yaron Orbach works hard not to shoot the film in the flat TV-influenced way that might best be described as Contemporary Studio Competence yet the camera often moves in ways that feel unmotivated and unnecessary.Schwartzs visual choices never coalesce into anything that might resemble a style or vision.Still ""Fun Size"" lives up to the candy correlation of its title. Its pleasurable enough in the moment but the buzz fades quickly.mark.olsenlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHoldover Argo beats four newcomers on slow moviegoing...October 28 2012Silent Hill sequel likely to lead lackluster weekend at...October 25 2012Fall Sneaks listSeptember 2 2012Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-fun-size-review-20121026,0,1898203.story",200,funsize8,funsize,latimes

Credit Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures Theres an effervescent tempo to ""Fun Size"" a gleeful ""After Hours"" for All Hallows Eve but for tweens and teenagers and set in Cleveland. Victoria Justice (Nickelodeons ""Victorious"") is Wren a high school student intent on New York University if she can only survive her eccentric mom Joy (a deft Chelsea Handler) who dates a guy too young for her and Wrens prankish little brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll a devilish pantomime) who hasnt spoken since Dad died.

Character accessories include firecrackers toilet paper and for Wrens ""Wizard of Oz"" costume glittering ruby-red Converse high-tops. Movie merits include a good cast a tidy script and jokes just provocative enough.""Fun Size"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some humor possibly too ribald for children under 13 but probably fine for the mall on a Friday night.

Vicoria Justice plays Wren whose plans to attend a huge Halloween party go awrey when her little brother wanders off in ""Fun Size."" Photo Paramount Pictures Fun Size review Amusing but forgettable 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Fun Size Comedy. Starring Victoria Justice Jane Levy and Chelsea Handler. Directed by Josh Schwartz. (PG-13. 90 minutes.) Its amazing that young people can even get auto insurance in the cinematic world of teen comedies. From ""Sixteen Candles"" to ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" the mortality rate of a parent or siblings prized car has to be about 85 percent. There are no safe driving bonuses in ""Fun Size"" a film that covers the high school party comedy checklist well but doesnt make its own mark on the genre. Well written but weakly executed its hard to imagine anyone is going to cherish the film if they even remember it in three months time. ""Fun Size"" is the directorial debut of Josh Schwartz who developed the teen television dramas ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl."" He didnt write the script but the film reflects his ability to capture young people authentically while simultaneously translating for older generations. His fingerprints are all over the narrative. Example In the Schwartz universe all so-called nerds are exactly one accessory (usually a pair of dorky glasses or a jacket) from looking like a model. He also executes the John Hughes trick of making parents seem alien but still likable. In about four minutes of screen time Ana Gasteyer as a lesbian mom reaffirms that shes among the most underrated ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members of all time. The focus in ""Fun Size"" is on teen science whiz Wren (Victoria Justice) who has captured the attention of her high schools alpha male. Fellow geek Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) completes the love triangle. On the way to the big party Wrens prank-loving 8-year-old brother gets lost trick-or-treating. The last two-thirds of the movie is a combination of ""Problem Child"" and ""The Fugitive"" if both were reimagined as a 1980s Molly Ringwald vehicle. The story lacks momentum with a particularly useless subplot involving a convenience store clerk. Hes one of several disturbing adults who choose to recruit the second-grader as a criminal accomplice or mascot - ignoring all child safety seat laws - instead of notifying police about his whereabouts. That would be easier to stomach in a movie with more focus but ""Fun Size"" seems trapped in a limbo between a hyperkinetic comedy for kids and something more outlaw for teens. PG-13 may have been the lucrative move but it feels as if theres an internal struggle going on between PG and R. Screenwriter Max Werner a veteran of ""The Colbert Report"" shows he can write a good script under any circumstance. Individual moments shine such as Wrens hero worship of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a witty scene where Wrens mom (Chelsea Handler) bonds with the parents of her too-young boyfriends best friend. And then theres the destruction of Roosevelts Volvo borrowed from his mothers which is violated in a particularly entertaining way. On the teen comedy scale it falls somewhere between the fate of Joel Goodsons dads Porsche in ""Risky Business"" and Charles Jeffersons car in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""

"Movie review Tween Halloween comedy Fun Size offers few treats - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Tween Halloween comedy Fun Size offers few treats Share Tweet Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 10.25.12 | 410 PM So youve got tween sitcom princess Victoria Justice in your movie. Youve got trailers that give off an ""Adventures in Babysitting"" vibe complete with (OMG so annoying) an Underoos-clad kid as Justices Halloween mischief-making little brother. You air those trailers on synergistically connected Nickelodeon sandwiched between promos for Justices ""Victorious"" and commercials for the Dora amp; Me Dollhouse. You cutely title the whole enterprise ""Fun Size."" And then? Well naturally you drop a fried chicken joints giant mascot statue on top of your characters teenmobile and let the big bird start humping away. While its story line is straightforward enough this PG-13 debut feature from ""Gossip Girl"" co-creator Josh Schwartz is all over the map in the details it throws at us and the level of immaturity it aims for. Justice plays Wren a dorky but clearly fabulous high school senior who gets a very pointed Halloween party invite from the class hunk only to learn that shes got to take her odd-duck brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) trick-or-treating. Seems that Mom (Chelsea Handler go figure) has gone a little wacky since Dad died -- back story thats alternately semi-poignant and ignored -- and plans on partying with her studmuffin boyfriend. Wren does what she must but when she gets separated from Albert after just a few stops her night really gets a shakeup. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The movie skips between Wrens search and nonverbal Alberts misadventures hanging with a dweeby convenience store clerk (Thomas Middleditch twitchily amusing). Wren worries when its narratively convenient but more of the time just kicks around with the uncool guy who not-so-secretly deserves her (Thomas Mann) her vampy BFF (Jane Levy ""Suburgatory"") and the gangs horny fourth wheel (Osric Chau). Whatevs -- you know theyll catch up with the kid eventually. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Justice and her gaggle are actually pretty likable but Schwartz does them no favors by expecting them to carry the movies inconsistent tone. John Hughes seems to be the idea but one minute were sidetracking into kiddie potty humor and the next were veering toward Nickelodeon-ized ""American Pie."" There are shout-outs to the Beastie Boys and Lil Wayne jokes about depilatory applications and Ruth Bader Ginsburg nervous ""comic"" banter about being mistaken for a pedophile and fart gags. Yep just like a Halloween miniatures assortment something for everyone -- or no one as the case may be. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Fun Size Director Josh Schwartz Genre Comedy Running Time 90 minutes Not rated With Victoria Justice Johnny Knoxville Chelsea Handler Watch Clips Kind And Employed Kind And Employed Credit Paramount Our Strategy Our Strategy Credit Paramount The fun to be had in Fun Size a tween comedy featuring Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon TV series Victorious is neither gigantic nor minuscule; its just about fun size which is probably enough. And if you think that movies aimed at young adults are automatically less sophisticated than those made for alleged grown-ups bear in mind that Fun Size is the only comedy in recent memory to feature a Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke. You wont find any of those in the Hangover movies bag of tricks. Justice plays Wren a teenager stuck in boring old Cleveland and dying to get out Shes counting the days until she can head off to New York University the alma mater of her late father whose absence has left a sizable hole in her familys life. Her mother played by Chelsea Handler is rebelling against her own grief by dating a 26-year-old guy by the name of Keevin which as Wren points out is hardly a name at all. And her weirdo 8-year-old brother a pudgy little spud named Albert (Jackson Nicoll) has yet to speak a word though he takes devilish delight in cutting strategically placed holes in his sisters sweaters. Albert drives Wren nuts so shes none too pleased when Mom insists she take the little bugger out trick-or-treating -- shed been planning to attend the party thrown by the coolest kid in school who appears to have a crush on her. She and her best friend a Titian-haired firecracker named April (Jane Levy of TVs Suburgatory) have been busy planning their costumes and April -- who has a sexy kitten costume up her sleeve -- has already taken great pains to persuade Wren not to dress up as the more-or-less unsexy Justice Ginsburg which was her original plan. What follows is a rambunctious mildly raunchy adventure through the streets of Cleveland on a night filled with ghosts goblins and all sorts of teenage embarrassment. Wren loses Albert -- hes dressed in a pint-sized Spider-Man costume with sinister-looking breathing holes around the nose -- and enlists the help of Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) the nerdy kid who genuinely likes her to track him down. The obstacles and unwitting enablers in their path include a slacker convenience-store clerk (Thomas Middleditch) who could be the psychic twin of Scooby Doos Shaggy; an ultrasensitive lesbian mother duo played by Anna Gasteyer and Kerri Kenney; and last but not least a crazed Johnny Knoxville in a blond wig. Somewhere in there a geeky Asian kid dressed as Aaron Burr (Osric Chau) shoots a piece of chicken out of a bullys hand. With a genuine period-specific firearm. i When she loses her little brother in a sea of trick-or-treaters Wren (Victoria Justice) finds him with help from her friend April (Jane Levy). Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount hide caption toggle caption Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount When she loses her little brother in a sea of trick-or-treaters Wren (Victoria Justice) finds him with help from her friend April (Jane Levy). Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount First-time director Josh Schwartz who created TVs The O.C. and Chuck cant always keep the movies mechanical parts moving gracefully -- the film lurches and stumbles too much to achieve true Dada loopiness. But Fun Size is so good-natured and so determined not to be totally stupid that it never outwears its welcome. (The script is by Max Werner who has written for The Colbert Report.) Justice with her winning lip-gloss smile is ridiculously attractive but shes also something of a blank. Fun Size is really all about its second bananas and Schwartz puts them to good use Levys April is a leopard-girl sexpot in training and her timing is both precise and confidently relaxed -- shes a kitten with a whip. And who knows what to make of young Jackson Nicoll who makes his entrance sitting on the toilet and wearing only a pair of underpants? The kid is too weird to be believed possibly too weird even to be cute; he looks a little like a miniaturized William Demarest. But by the time his Albert commits as one character puts it an act of ""tiny terrorism"" he has come close to stealing the movie. Hes too much hes not enough -- and somehow in the end hes just right.

By DAVID MARTINDALE Special Contributor Published 25 October 2012 0210 PM Updated 25 October 2012 0210 PM A bright future in movies awaits Victoria Justice.She clearly has all the tools to become a popular leading lady one day in romantic comedies.But Fun Size isnt the film thats going to propel this teen Nickelodeon sitcom favorite to the next level of stardom.The movie a Sixteen Candles/Home Alone wannabe is slickly crafted and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. Young moviegoers attending an advance screening were particularly entertained.That said its not a teen film that decades from now will endure to define a generation. Like a ""fun size"" chocolate bar its just empty calories. Its a momentary pleasure instantly forgotten.The story Justices character Wren is kind of a nerd kind of an outsider but she has been invited to THE Halloween party by THE dreamboat boy who finally noticed what a babe she is. Wren and her wisecracking friend April (Suburgatorys Jane Levy) are dying to go.First though Wren must accompany her troublemaking brother while he goes trick-or-treating. When he ditches her Wren gathers her friends (one the misfit Roosevelt is played by Thomas Mann who grew up in Dallas) and she desperately scours the city before her mother (Chelsea Handler who has a Halloween misadventure of her own) finds out.A night of comic mishaps ensues all around (including most memorably a crudely funny sight gag involving a car and a giant mechanized chicken).Its also worth noting that Justice isnt the only star whose career merits following. Jackson Nicoll who plays Albert Wrens kid brother is a pint-sized comedy powerhouse. Dont make the mistake of leaving once the final credits begin or youll miss some of his best laugh-out-loud moments.David Martindale is an Arlington freelance writer.FUN SIZE(C+) Directed by Josh Schwartz.

Area theaters. While there have been a bounty of live-action family films that take place over Thanksgiving and Christmas very few try to represent realistically that most American of holidays Halloween. The comedy ""Fun Size"" captures the trashiness and confusion of being swarmed not just by by greedy kids on sugar highs but also hard-partying adults living out fantasies on a night known for overindulgence and bad behavior. Director Josh Schwartz (TVs ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl"") gets an innocent innocuous performance from lovely Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice as high schooler Wren dressed up as Dorothy and having to miss a party as she searches Cleveland for her missing little brother. The nerdy but beautiful teen with a crush on the school stud is John Hughes paint-by-numbers but here everyones a bit of a freak -- including Wrens mute brother Albert and his adult best friend Fuzzy. Among the other grownups Chelsea Handler brings a pathos as Wren and Alberts mother going through a funny-sad nervous breakdown. By the end of this romp ""Fun Size"" actually accomplished something charming sentimentality without normality.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Josh Schwartz is the man behind the primetime teen soap-operatics of The O.C. and Gossip Girl but his big-screen directorial debut takes place in the milder territory of the Nickelodeon Movies empire. Led by Victoria Justice who hasnt yet escaped from the kiddie networks stable of wholesome photogenic stars Fun Size is a laborious comedy about a Halloween night in Cleveland that feels too grown up in half of its storylines to suit younger audiences and too juvenile or nonsensical in the rest of its gags to please anyone else. Justice plays a teenager whose family is crazy--she knows everyone thinks their family is crazy but hers totally really is okay? Her 8-year-old brother (Jackson Nicoll) has been acting out and not speaking ever since their dad passed away the year before and their mother (Chelsea Handler) has been channeling her grief into dating a twentysomething. Justice and her popularity-obsessed bestie (Suburgatorys Jane Levy) get invited to a party being thrown by the schools cool kid but before they can head over theyre saddled with taking care of Nicoll who immediately runs away. Cue an evening of minor misbehavior in which the endearingly geeky guy (Thomas Mann) who has a crush on Justice and his pal (Osric Chau) get enlisted to help find the missing boy. Justice is a pretty personality-free screen presence while the more interesting cast members like Levy and Handler are stuck in shrill unsympathetic roles. The film goes through a lot of trouble to arrange gags in which an automated restaurant mascot appears to be humping a car or where characters drive through downtown unable to turn off the Josh Groban ballad blaring from their speakers--limp jokes made worse by how clunkily theyre set up and how far ahead theyre broadcast. But the biggest off-note is how the film calls on its bereavement subtext for both filler material and as a plot device. Out incredibly late with your kid brother while your parent has no idea where the two of you are? Why not sneak into the cemetery on the way home anyway so one of the sad soundtrack offerings can be whipped out? The final reveal that (spoiler) Nicoll has been keeping quiet to prank his mother rather than because of trauma makes for a weirdly nasty punchline to this garbled feature.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) Jaimie Trueblood This film image released by Paramount Pictures shows from left Josh Pence as Keevin Chelsea Handler as Joy and James Pumphrey as Brueder in a scene from ""Fun Size."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) A pivotal night in a teenagers life has been the subject of film comedies from ""American Graffiti"" to ""Superbad."" Often the occasion is prom or graduation day. In ""Fun Size"" the big night is Halloween. Befitting the title theres little nutritional value but theres a bit of sweetness inside the throwaway wrapper.In the spirit of 80s flicks like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" the protagonist who is taken for a wild ride is female. Cleveland high school student Wren (Victoria Justice) is smart enough to get into a good college but her widowed mother (Chelsea Handler) is too busy canoodling with a young hunk to sign the application form. On Halloween night Wren has been invited to a big party by dreamboat Aaron (Thomas McDonell) but the flighty mom leaves Wren in charge of mischievous little brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) who hasnt spoken a word since their father died.Wrens friend April (Jane Levy) dressed like a cat insists that they go prowling so with Wren dressed like Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Albert dressed like Spider-Man the trio goes to a haunted house. But soon Albert disappears and the girls have to enlist the nearest classmate with a car Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) a nerd who has a crush on Wren. Meanwhile 5-year-old Albert has a series of misadventures involving a lovelorn convenience store clerk (Thomas Middleditch) and a joyriding cage fighter (Johnny Knoxville) that could be downright creepy in a different movie. Compared to most teen comedies these days ""Fun Size"" is almost touchingly tame. Screenwriter Max Werner honed his smarts on ""The Colbert Report"" and debut director Josh Schwartz created the TV shows ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl."" Schwartz cant navigate slapstick like Chris Columbus but his perspective on teen relationships is in the same neighborhood as John Hughes albeit on the side of the tracks where they hand out candy corn. Adding a genuinely emotional punchline is the trick that makes ""Fun Size"" a small treat.

As the great late-20th-century philosophers Calvin and Hobbes once observed a good compromise leaves everyone unsatisfied. Convincing proof of that axiom can be found in the Halloween-set teen comedy ""Fun Size"" a hydra-headed attempt to dirty up the Nickelodeon brand while simultaneously scrubbing raunchy high-school hookup tropes into family-friendly shape; the ungainly end result makes about as much sense as Kidz Bop rerecording Odd Future. B.O. returns ought to be rather fun-sized which as any trick-or-treater can tell you isnt nearly as good as it sounds. The first PG-13 U.S. effort from Nickelodeon Movies as well as the feature directing debut of ""The OC"" and ""Gossip Girl"" mastermind Josh Schwartz ""Fun Size"" leans much more toward the formers slap-happy hyperreality than the latters literate soap sensibilities. Starring Nick net vet Victoria Justice as NYU-bound high schooler Wren it unfolds on a single eventful Halloween night. Wren as she tells us in brisk v.o. recently lost her father which has left the entire family askew. Her mom (Chelsea Handler) has taken up with a twentysomething boyfriend and dresses as ""... Baby One More Time""-era Britney Spears for the holiday. Her 7-year-old brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) has ceased speaking entirely and launched a campaign of elaborate pranks. At the urging of her delightfully bitchy best friend (Jane Levy) Wren plans to attend a Halloween party thrown by her schools resident ""god stud (and) legend"" Aaron Riley (Thomas McDonnell) but is roped into babysitting her brother at the last minute. While theyre out trick-or-treating Albert disappears forcing the two girls to hook up with Wrens wallflower secret admirer Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) and his nerdy horndog friend (Osric Chau) to find the kid. Increasingly tiresome misadventures ensue. Meanwhile the mute Albert teams up with a weirdo convenience-store clerk (Thomas Middleditch) to wreak vengeance on his ex goes dancing with a flock of anime-attired club girls and eventually runs afoul of a drunk-driving mulleted MMA fighter (Johnny Knoxville). The oddness of springing laughs by having a prepubescent boy climb into cars and hit up bars is undeniable and it actually seems worse when the script acknowledges it with some recurring stranger-danger jokes. And therein lies ""Fun Sizes"" central fatal paradox While its nods toward partying sexuality and pedophilia may be tame by R-rated standards they feel disproportionately uncomfortable in context. Since the pic imports the goofy giddy Saturday-cartoon-like vibe of an average Nick sitcom observing these characters curse and feel each other up is a bit like watching Carly and Sam suddenly try to score some ecstasy in the Groovy Smoothie parking lot. Of course questionable propriety would be a moot point if the film were consistently funny but its hit-to-miss ratio is dire. Working from a Black List script by Max Werner Schwartz displays strangely few of the winning idiosyncrasies that characterized his TV work. Gags that might have worked with even a cursory bit of setup are given none abrupt tonal shifts knock the film off its axis and a late stab at an ""OC""-style dramatic montage set to swooning indie rock feels almost like a Schwartz parody. Justice is an appealing and competent onscreen presence though she does still slip into that that distinctive overly expressive enunciation typical of recovering child stars. Mann makes for a slightly more masculine yet simultaneously nerdier version of Michael Cera while Levy steals the show as Wrens just-this-side-of-villainous best frenemy. Adult performers Handler and Knoxville seem unsure that theres anything much do with their roles and hesitant to even really try. Tech credits are functional and unobjectionable though ""Fun Size"" is quite visually flat for a bigscreen film. Music-supervision maven Alexandra Patsavas provides a nicely kinetic modern soundtrack.

But its the perfect setting for the brand of teen comedies that made John Hughes and Chris Columbus famous. Thats clearly the idea behind Fun Size which tells the story of a smart and responsible high-school senior (Nickelodeons Victoria Justice) whose All Hallows Eve turns into a disastrous adventure in babysitting. She wants to go to the cool dress-up party -- her idea of a great costume is Ruth Bader Ginsberg -- with her shallow bff (Jane Levy). But when her pathetic widowed mother (Chelsea Handler) pawns her devilish little brother on her so she can party like a teenager herself chaos and coincidences ensue. She loses the kid at a neighborhood haunted house and has to track him down him before mom gets home. Youd hope that Gossip Girl creator Josh Schwartz directing for the first time would have a better feel for such matter but Fun Size blatantly and lazily traces mediocre versions of the genre. (Who wants to be a poor poor-mans version of Cant Hardly Wait?) There is no attempt to reinvent and what might have been a half-decent homage is undermined by numbing comic failure. At least Levy delivers her lines with some snap and even though she could play the snarky best friend in her sleep she still has fun with it which is greatly appreciated. Handler on the other hand looks literally pained and fans of the talented comedian will wonder why shes already taking thankless mom roles after films like Bridesmaids proved a market for brassy female-driven comedies. This movie has no courage and little brains and is salvaged if at all only by its heart. There remains a huge market for a great Halloween teen comedy but Fun Size is the disappointing apple that your crazy-haired neighbor gives you instead of candy. Feel free to dump this one in the bushes.

Both are easily marketable for their hot (mess) fashion-plate stars wide-eyed luxury fetishism soapy season arcs and savvy self-reference but both are also at heart deeply old-fashioned in the primacy they put on the family. Teens and grown-ups alike (parents rich with flaws and desires are always treated as people too) drift away from the home and into sometimes unsavory situations in order to learn lessons that reaffirm their priorities and those of the shows Again and again gatherings of multiple generations around the breakfast table are held up as the modern utopian ideal.Fun Size which Schwartz directed and produced from a screenplay by Max Werner lacks both the glossy finish of his prime-time serials--the setting is unglamorous suburban Cleveland; the dress code is bargain-store Halloween chic--and the razor-sharpness of the dialogue. (The script does include a wide range of casual cultural references from The Mikado to Lil Wayne.) But the fundamental Schwartz touch applies In the guise of a narrowly targeted tween flick he has delivered a smart and emotionally satisfying slice of wish fulfillment tracing how a threatened family finds harmony.Played by recovering Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice whose coltish stature and wide-featured beauty recalls a graphic novel rendition of Winnie Cooper Wren is a senior with her sights set on skipping town for NYU the alma mater of her beloved recently deceased dad whose Def Jam track jacket has become Wrens security blanket. The loss of the family patriarch has thrown Wrens widowed mom Joy (Chelsea Handler) and butterball little brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) into a kind of temporary insanity; the latter has become a mute prankster while the former is dating a 26-year-old. Wren is invited to a Halloween bash by the schools ""god/stud/legend"" but Joy has evening plans with her boy toy forcing the teen to patrol her gluttonous little brothers night of trick or treating. When Wren loses Albert in a haunted house Roosevelt (Thomas Mann) a debate captain with a long-harbored crush agrees to chauffeur the search party. Cruising bruising first kisses and life lessons follow.Film Details Fun Size RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time90 More Info Trailer Schwartz has never directed before for the big screen or small and here hes tasked with the challenge of splitting the demographic difference between eight and 18-year-olds. His sight gags fail (a naked child on a toilet) as often as they succeed. (A sequence in which Albert dominates a disco floor has LOLs for the whole family.) The influence of John Hughes movies is felt everywhere from the one-night-in-the-suburbs structure to the films depiction of nerds as ""unlikely"" studs and like its inspirations Fun Size revolves around what is in essence an allegorical battle for the familys soul Will they get suckered by the temptation to be shallow or stand proud as the imperfect but lovable freaks that they are? The presiding spirit is that of the Beastie Boys song that plays at a crucial moment ""Fight for Your Right to Party"" a raunchy yet innocent celebration of ultimately harmless rebellion and a throwback to a previous generation that still holds up.
