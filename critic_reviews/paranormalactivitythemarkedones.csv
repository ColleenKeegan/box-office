After a month its still near the top of box-office reports. [Editors note Disney owns Grantland.] Setting aside news of this weeks polar vortex its not hard to understand why. It has two princesses (one of whom becomes a literal ice queen) a jolly snowman and songs two of which have wit; ""Let It Go"" already appears to have become some kind of self-acceptance anthem. You hear this song and feel the piano bars being erected in its name. The movie keeps the Scandinavian climes and injects feminism into the original 1845 Hans Christian Andersen story (basically the damsel was a boy) turning it into a tale of two complicated and estranged sisters whose voices belong to Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel. Jennifer Lee wrote and codirected the adaptation and its fun watching her flirt with all the princess-movie cliches about sweetness and nastiness and instant romance only to tweak or upend them. Theres also a story you want to follow and see through. Frozen reminds you how many animated films rely more on inside jokes. Its modern without being hip earnest with being sappy. The voice acting is remarkable especially Bells. Its as if the animators are following the talky musicality of her line readings. And some of the images are great a gray roiling sea swallows a ship; some inventively undone hair; and a real appreciation of the idea that no two snowflakes look the same. The medias been speculating that the movies a hit in part because it has been marketed to boys. Thats what made Tangled also by Disney a hit in 2010. This might be true. The sister Menzel plays has wintry superpowers -- shes exiled from her kingdom after she freezes it. And the main male characters -- voiced by Jonathan Groff and Santino Fontana -- arent drawn as hunky or hot but as nimble slabs of big chins and noses. But Im not sure boys care that much. They just want a fun movie. I got a little bored before the climax but they didnt. Even so Lee makes sure the politics and metaphors such as they are arent hard for a boy to miss. This is rescue fantasy but the sisters are doing it for themselves. Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones directed by Christopher Landon It used to be fun to watch a horror movie with a mostly black and Latino audience. You could sit there and both mock the stupidity of the characters and still jump whenever jumping was called for. These movies werent set in your neighborhood and for the most part these young nitwits werent your friends. You were free to say to the screen ""Let Freddy"" -- or Jason or one of those ghost-face Scream killers -- ""come to my house and see what happens."" Well the fifth installment of the Paranormal Activity series (The Marked Ones) has come to the hood and what happens is more or less the same as whats happened previously. The movies set in a Southern California housing complex whose residents are mostly blue-collar Chicanos. It would seem that 18-year-old Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) has been marked for the same demonic takeover that has infected new homeowners horny teens and fraying marriages before him. The same found-footage conceit comes courtesy of the camcorder Jesse and his best friend Hector (Jorge Diaz) manage to hold perfectly even when say Hector is running for his life. But theres no getting past the nonsense formality of taking that camera everywhere. In installment four as a laptop camera it made a little sense. Here it makes everyone seem like a fool. These movies fail every test of their own internal logic. They hide behind the found-footage device. Still its smart and not too cynical to take whatever supernatural darkness these movies are building toward to places where a not-insignificant portion of the audience lives. Young Latinos go to horror movies too. The Marked Ones actually goes out of its way to achieve authenticity. When Hector and his friend Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) turn to gangbangers for help and they arrive to the scene with their cache of automatic weapons a scary movie has turned irreversibly into Scary Movie 6.

Set in California its the tale of high-schoolers Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) whose postgraduation summer of drinking toking and filming everything in sight is rudely interrupted by spooky goings-on in the apartment downstairs. Its not long before Jesse begins exhibiting strange behavior forcing Hector to conclude that his friend has been ""marked"" by the local witch. As ever with this series the shocks are cheap but effective and the shaky-cam aesthetic adds an unsettling layer of realism (if youre willing to overlook the innate ridiculousness of the film-everything concept). But the plot is a confusing derivative mishmash of half-baked supernatural cliches and the total absence of characterization makes it hard to care what happens.

The Devil only knows. And as the Satanic forces of Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones communicate via a Simon Says game we can?t illuminate you any further. On the other hand we can say that in this fifth entry of the found footage horror series Andrew Jacobs plays a recent high school graduate named Jesse who develops superpowers following the death of his witch neighbor and Jorge Diaz plays his concerned camera-toting buddy. The leads are appealing but the best scares will be familiar to anyone who has seen the previous films -- or for that matter the trailer.

""Do you think Im handsome?"" he asks laughing. A beep signals Yes. More seriously ""Are you my guardian angel?"" Another beep Yes. Then ""Are you good?"" Silence. Not good -- for Jesse or any of his friends. Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones the latest installment of the found-footage horror franchise that began in 2009 takes a detour off Californias Highway One from the nice white people getting haunted in suburban Los Angeles and lands in heavily Hispanic Oxnard. After four PAs on consecutive Halloweens the new movie is not exactly a sequel -- PA 5 is due this coming October -- but more a grafting of the familiar fright mechanisms onto the more robust L.A. Latino culture. This gives the series which seemed to jump the shark or the shock with the last episode a jolt of energy. Jokier and more sexually charged than its predecessors with some of the dialogue in Spanish this is Paranormal Activity Univision-style. Mind you one sound is understood in any language a scream. (READ The Paranormal Activity phenomenon) After a month of films whose December release dates announced their intentions as Academy Award candidates the first weekend in January traditionally offers moviegoers a respite from cinematic worthiness. B-minus exorcism epics like Season of the Witch (2011) and The Devil Inside (2012) or the zillionth remake of a horror classic -- last years Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D -- provide reminders that the business of Hollywood is business and one of the best ways to make quick money is with horror for the teens. The PA series whose first four films have earned 720 million at the worldwide box office on a ridiculously frugal total budget of about 13 million was a natural for a January release. PATMO provides the familiar cheap thrills but with a salsa tang. The first PA film in which writer-director Oren Peli suavely updated the Blair Witch Project template of found-footage horror introduced the creepy shadows into the new home of Micah Stoat and Katie Featherston (the actors using their own names). The second installment set like the first in 2006 dramatized a similar ghostly influence on Katies sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden). The third episode flashed back to Katies and Kristis youth in 1986 to show the source of their possession. PA4 finally moved the chronology forward to 2011 and showed a new family getting spooked by Katie and her odd son Robbie. PATMO takes place in June 2012 but the method is the same Jesses pal Hector (Jorge Diaz) has to record everything with his video camera even when someone he cares for is getting assaulted by the undead and two free hands would be a Big Help. (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Haunted House movies) The earlier films portrayed young married couples or mothers or even kids trying to defend their homes against demons who slip under the bedsheets or into the souls of the unwary. PATMO focuses on the teens Jesse and Hector whose exposure to the dark side is a natural extension of their goofing off as boys often do the summer after high-school graduation. They set off firecrackers just outside their apartment; why wouldnt they walk into dangerous places at night without turning the lights on? ""Lets check this shit out man"" is the motto they live and may die by. And unlike the naive stabs at resistance of people in the first four movies when Jesse and Hector feel imperiled they call on the leader of the neighborhood gang; he and his enforcer enter unhallowed ground toting automatic weapons. Writer-director Christopher Landon who also wrote the second third and fourth chapters is the son of Michael Landon; the Paranormal series is Christophers own Little House on the Scary. Here though he gets out of the house and into the barrio. Jesse and Hector are hassled by two dudes who feel the first wrath of the spirit that has seized Jesse. The boys crash a party and connect with a couple of pretty girls (including the sinfully foxy Catherine Toribio) who will later wish theyd stayed home that night. In a bodega Jesses gorgeous sister Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) chats up a friendly classmate (Julian Works) unfurling Jesses cosmic ire. Like the teen played by Dane DeHaan in the found-footage flick Chronicle Jesse has acquired minor magical powers but this gift is really a curse -- a mark of the invasive demon. (READ Corlisss review of Chronicle) The PATMO trailer teases one of the movies milder gross-out tricks Jesse slowly pulling a long black thread out of left eye socket -- string theory made visible in cringe-worthy fashion. Another innovation is a chihuahua levitating against its will. But most of the thrills have been long embedded in PA films a glimpse of a ghost shape a door (here a trap door) slamming shut and climactically the convening of the coven and the outbreak of sensationally jittery camerawork. PATMO also certifies its sibling (or cousin?) link with the franchise by bringing old friends back for cameo appearances. Oh look theres Ari (Molly Ephraim) from PA2 Katie and Micah is that you? These indie actors who get hardly any film work outside the series may not have the marquee value of the guest stars who show up at the end of Anchorman 2 but they are no less welcome. You can expect them back in the official PA5 -- because the cool thing about these undead is that you cant kill them off.

(Paramount Pictures) By Michael OSullivan January 3 2014 ""Paranormal Activity"" fans hoping for a continuation of -- or perhaps a bit of closure to -- the supernatural saga that has stretched out over four films since the 2007 original insinuated itself into their nightmares may be disappointed by ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones."" As the subtitle of the new unnumbered film indicates the fifth chapter in the series isnt so much a sequel as a spinoff. This sharp left turn takes the films mythology in strange and not entirely satisfying new directions including a crazy time-travel element. Targeted to a Latino audience ""The Marked Ones"" centers on two teenage friends Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) who stumble upon a world of dark invisible forces when they break into the apartment of a creepy neighbor (Gloria Sandoval) after she is inexplicably murdered by their seemingly straight-arrow classmate (Carlos Pratts). Unlike the first four films in which normal people are terrorized by a paranormal force the new film shows Jesse -- whos been ""marked"" with what looks like an animal bite -- suddenly developing supernatural powers as did the kids in ""Chronicle"" (2012). One day he wakes up and he can levitate do amazing tricks on his skateboard and hurl bullies through the air as if hes Thor from ""The Avengers."" The drawback is that he also finds grotesque foot-long black hairs growing where they shouldnt like in his eye socket. Adolescence can be so hard especially when youre possessed. In addition to that nasty bite mark -- a tip of the hat to the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" films -- many of the core elements of the earlier movies are retained here including the increasingly annoying found-footage gimmick. Following the shtick of the series in which people use their video cameras iPhones and laptops to capture hauntings ""The Marked Ones"" purports to have been shot entirely by Hector on a sporty little camcorder he got as a high-school graduation gift. There are other nods to previous ""Paranormal Activity"" films. Ali (Molly Ephraim) the teenage daughter from the second film makes a fleeting cameo here as does the infamous box of videotapes featuring childhood footage of the main protagonists in the series sisters Katie (Katie Featherston) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) whose lifelong experience with a poltergeist-like demon is at the heart of the ""Paranormal Activity"" universe. A glance at the films cast list also reveals a guest appearance by Katie herself. How and in what context she shows up however I cant say. Its not because I dont want to spoil the fun since her appearance is anything but fun. By the time her scene arrives the movie has thoroughly painted itself into a narrative corner. I shudder to think what contortions the writer of a ""Paranormal Activity 6"" might have to go through to get the story in gear after writer-director Christopher Landon (who worked on the screenplays for the last three films) has taken it to ""Back to the Future"" territory. There are some fun touches. The evil entity attempting to gain control over Jesse communicates through an old Simon electronic toy instead of a Ouija board as in the original film. Its a bit of horror-film nonsense but its more silly than spooky. As for scares ""The Marked Ones"" pulls out all the stops. Over time of course the series had already ratcheted up the fright factor gradually eroding original writer-director Oren Pelis admirable restraint for an ever-increasing level of explicitness. Im not saying that the first four films werent frightening. Its remarkable how durable the ""Paranormal Activity"" formula proved to be even though each film is a retread of the previous one. How much night-vision footage of people sleeping can any one viewer watch? Thankfully ""The Marked Ones"" leaves that behind. In its place it brings in dead-eyed children a Santeria-style dungeon altar a witch-hunting gangbanger with a shotgun (Richard Cabral) and a portal to an alternate dimension. It doesnt of course resolve a ton of mysteries left hanging by the previous films. Who for example was that creepy Robbie kid in the last movie? It does however raise several interesting new questions. Chief among them Has the ""Paranormal Activity"" camcorder finally run out of juice? Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones  1/2. R.

Credit Paramount Pictures The ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise aims straight at its Latino fan base with the fifth installment of the series ""The Marked Ones"" and the changes -- goodbye white suburbia; hello gritty diversity -- recharge the batteries somewhat. But theres no escaping that the found-footage phenomenon has gone from fresh and original to just plain annoying.Here it is a teenager named Hector (Jorge Diaz) who is most often wielding the video camera which apparently came with a permanently charged battery. He and his pal Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) along with the pretty Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) are curious about the noises coming from a neighbors apartment and soon they find themselves peering in on a world of witchcraft.Jesse becomes more than a mere voyeur thanks to a mark on his arm that identifies him as having strange powers among them the ability to inflate an air mattress really quickly. Another of the films droll touches is that an old Simon electronic game -- that circle whose quadrants light up -- becomes a sort of Ouija board for the teenagers using its blinking lights to answer the questions they ask it.The ""Paranormal Activity"" movies tend to rely on the occasional memorable special effect rather than brainy dialogue and this one has a few including one involving a gravity-defying dog. It also works in a cameo by Katie Featherston a fixture in all the previous films. Have to keep the through-line going somehow.These touches though cant overcome the general weariness of the whole genre. Yeah the found-footage thing was cool once maybe twice. But even the teenagers this movie is aimed at have now seen the dim lighting the choppy storytelling and the nausea-inducing jitteriness again and again. As Jesse says at one point in this film in reference to his powers ""I felt like I was special or something. Not anymore.""""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Nudity and lots of scare-induced cursing.

B. Landon. The film releases in the US on Jan. 3 2014. Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In suburban Southern California three Latino teenagers discover a witch in their midst. Rated R (nudity language gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE Five films in this horror franchise gets fresh energy from its likeable cast of young Latinos but the familiar storyline is wearing thin. CAST Andrew Jacobs Jorge Diaz Gabrielle Walsh LENGTH 124 After launching the mockumentary horror franchise ""Paranormal Activity"" in 2007 Paramount Pictures began noticing that Latinos were buying roughly a third of all tickets. That was interesting especially since all four movies featured Caucasian casts (aside from the occasional terrified maid). Given that Latinos are Americas most avid moviegoers -- they see more movies per year than any other demographic -- what would happen if Paramount made a Latino-oriented episode of its successful series? Its an experiment called ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones."" Set in the Hispanic-American community of Oxnard Calif. it brings Santeria religion and mariachi music to a franchise that has heretofore taken place in the generic McMansions of white suburbs like San Diego and Henderson Nevada. Paramounts definition of this film as a spin-off not an official sequel may smack slightly of ghettoization but ""The Marked Ones"" is the rare marketing ploy that feels both calculated and refreshingly welcome. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Like the previous fourth film which focused on a pair of likeable tech-savvy teens ""The Marked Ones"" bubbles with energy thanks to its appealing young cast. Andrew Jacobs plays Jesse a recent high-school graduate living with his grandmother. His best friends are pretty Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) and goofy Hector (Jorge Diaz) whose new T-shirt bears the cheeky slogan ""I Just Look Illegal."" Together theyre drawn into a mystery involving a cranky neighbor a creepy journal and a strange bite mark on Jesses arm. Some of the Hispanic details feel overplayed (that bag of Maseca corn flour was surely placed there by a focus group) but others like Jesses humble apartment complex and Hectors limited Spanish have an air of authenticity. Theyre likely due to writer-director Christopher B. Landon who captured the rhythms of teenage life so nicely in his script for the 2007 thriller ""Disturbia."" Where ""The Marked Ones"" fails though is in its overall narrative a nearly identical clone of the past couple of films and in its inability to convincingly explain its found-footage conceit. (Hector never drops that video camera even when pursued by screaming demons.) The Latino cast gives the movie a fresh modern feel but the underlying formula is becoming unacceptably stale. 235 MoviesParanormal Activity The Marked Ones trailer PLOT In suburban Southern California three Latino teenagers discover a witch in their midst. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (nudity language gruesome imagery) CAST Andrew Jacobs Jorge Diaz Gabrielle Walsh LENGTH 124 BOTTOM LINE Five films in this horror franchise gets fresh energy from its likeable cast of young Latinos but the familiar storyline is wearing thin.

Director Christopher Landon (124). R Language nudity violence. Area theaters. Shaky handheld visuals faces illuminated by infrared light and young folks screaming ""what the f-is that?"" Ah it must be time for another ""Paranormal Activity"" film. This one comes with a subtitle - ""The Marked Ones"" - and a new location - an apartment complex in a Hispanic neighborhood in East Los Angeles instead of the franchises usual banal suburbia setting. But the concept is the same and just as tired as it was when the second third and fourth sequels to ""Paranormal Activitys"" 2009 first installment. All this one has going for it is a moderately charming lead actor in Andrew Jacobs  and a strange but nonetheless intriguing fleeting reference to the original film. Otherwise its the usual found-footage creepiness that crawls by for just under 90 minutes courtesy of writer-director Christopher B. Landon (son of the late Michael ""Little House on the Prairie"" Landon whose 1950s flick ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" is a masterpiece compared to this film.) Jacobs is Jesse whos given a compact video camera for his high school graduation. With his new gift turned on all the time we see Jesse and his cousin Hector (Jorge Diaz) and at times their friend Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) look into the odd goings-on of a neighbor lady the kids say is a witch. Dangling the camera through an air vent to the apartment downstairs Jesse and Hector spot a strange ritual. Then after the old biddy dies they poke around her place and find pictures of Jesse from when he was a baby. Andrew Jacobss Jesse doesnt like what he sees in Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones. That goes double for our critic. (Photo credit Paramount Pictures) Jesses mom died in childbirth and his grandma who speaks no English knows nothing of the mystery. Yet when a classmate of Jesse and Hectors speaks about being possessed and then kills himself they link him to the witchcraft happening in their midst - and to the spooky marks Jesse suddenly finds on his arm. Those marks momentarily give Jesse super strength yet as revealed by his Ouija-like Simon game that beeps out ""Yes"" or ""No"" answers his luck is about to change. As is his temper. And his eyes. And sadly his relationship with his dog. ""The Marked Ones"" is being sold as a sort-of stand-alone ""Paranormal Activity"" thriller the same way the ""Wolverine"" films exist parallel to the ""X-Men"" movies. That makes the final ""revelation"" in ""Marked Ones"" a bit more interesting. For those who have followed these films through four previous outings the link may indicate a future merging of the storylines. The mediocre scares though will likely be the same. Jacobs too may pop up in subsequent non- ""Paranormal Activity"" movies a feat the original films star Katie Featherston couldnt accomplish. If he does become an escapee from this overcooked witchs coven-centered franchise itll be a supernatural feat indeed. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags entertainment news movies movie reviews the paranormal activity the marked ones christopher landon jorge diaz gabrielle walsh Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like The Blair Witch Project that most influential (and effective) of found-footage fright flicks the Paranormal Activity films tend to sharply divide genre fans. For every viewer happily creeped out by the franchises simple scare tactics--its video vision of things going bump and creak and moan in the dark--theres another moviegoer completely unfazed by such low-budget prankery. Odds are solid however that the believers and the skeptics will agree on Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones which bears only a passing unflattering resemblance to its four forebears. Not a sequel but a spinoff targeted specifically to Latino audiences this latest installment relocates the spooky proceedings to an apartment complex in Oxnard California where two teenagers fall victim to some of the same forces that terrorized the cursed family of the earlier movies. Yet the geographic and cultural deviation matters much less than the stylistic one; gone is the nocturnal surveillance footage and nightly hauntings that heretofore distinguished the series. Without them The Marked Ones plays like just another anonymous found-footage cheapie.If theres a model here its not Oren Pelis inventive 2006 original but the mock-doc superhero film Chronicle Director Christopher Landon who wrote all three of the Paranormal sequels borrows a spirit of adolescent tomfoolery--and a consumed-by-the-darkness narrative--from that found-footage highlight. Poking around in the abandoned apartment of a murdered neighbor high-school buddies Hector (Jorge Diaz) and Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) get in over their heads the latter eventually discovering a bite-like wound on his arm. Hes been singled out for demonic possession though the devil looking to get inside isnt so unreasonable that he wont perform a few supernatural parlor tricks to amuse his future host. Whereas the other Paranormal films rely on an escalation of terrors The Marked Ones is characterized by long stretches of mundanity occasionally interrupted by a cheap shock. Theres no nifty technological gimmick like the fan-cam of part three or the X-Box Kinect vision of part four. Mostly Landon relies on the limiting POV of the handheld camera repeating the same basic jump scare--panning away from an empty space then panning back to reveal the funhouse-attraction now filling it--over and over again.Viewed from the right angle The Marked Ones does have a faintly interesting subtext. The film foregrounds gang activity early and often enough so that its possible to see the possession plot as a metaphor for the life-destroying allure of gang culture. The neighbor is murdered by a possessed straight-arrow a class valedictorian whose older brother runs with a tough crowd. Furthermore Jesses descent into darkness is basically a transformation from good-natured knucklehead--loyal to his friends and family--to baseball-bat-wielding sociopath. Alas that angle is eventually compromised when the film (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) turns the local gangbangers into de facto heroes. What a shame as theres really nothing else distinguishing The Marked Ones from its junky January contemporaries; its a Paranormal Activity movie in name only. Considering that these films cost about as much to make as they do to see the series will probably live on. Heres hoping subsequent chapters feel a little less haunted by cliche.

Thats why it was a stroke of genius to set Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones in Oxnard California in a semi-urban Latino neighborhood a place where multiple generations of family often live under the same roof where your neighbors are so close you can hear them through the vents in your bedroom. In this setting one in which people literally live on top of one another and not a winding driveways worth of real estate away there really is something insidious about the presence of demons. Theyre equal-opportunity squatters squeezing themselves into even the smallest space. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But if The Marked Ones is mildly brilliant in the first half it stumbles witlessly into its own dumb pentagram in the second. This is the latest installment in the franchise that nobody claims to care about anymore but still somehow causes dollars to flow almost paranormally out of moviegoers pockets. Actually The Marked Ones has been conceived more as a spinoff of the series rather than a bona fide entry; its aimed largely at Latino moviegoers who apparently make up a large portion of the Paranormal Activity fan base.While its a drag that studios -- in this case Paramount -- think about putting anyone other than affluent white suburbanites onscreen only when there are dollars to be made the first half of The Marked Ones is lively enough and funny enough to work on its own merits. Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) are best pals who have just graduated from high school but who havent given a single thought to the future. Thats probably a good thing because Jesses cranky reclusive downstairs neighbor might be a witch and their days might be numbered. Life is short Why not do dumb stuff and record it on a borrowed video camera? Jesse sends Hector bumping down a wooden staircase in a plastic laundry basket preserving the event for posterity. The camera is right there when Jesse gets his grandma (the casually disarming Renee Victor) drunk on tequila shots. Hector also captures Jesse doing a wriggly dance with grandmas personable and perceptive Chihuahua.Film Details Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones RatingR GenreHorror Running Time84 min. More Info Trailer Meanwhile that witchy downstairs neighbor is murdered and when Jesse and Hector break into her apartment they find stuff like crude cow figurines and possible bonelike objects. Theres also a grungy crib and an array of not-terribly-shiny medical implements though none of that stops them from trying to turn the space into a love shack when they meet two local hotties at a party.How can you not like this pair of numbnuts? Jacobs and Diaz are so relaxed and affable in their buffoonery that its a bummer when the allegedly scary stuff starts happening. (A third pal Marisol played by Gabrielle Walsh is treated more like an afterthought.) The Marked Ones isnt as mannered and meta as the 2012s Paranormal Activity 4 which was notable -- and weirdly commendable -- for how adamantly un-scary it was focusing mostly on the iChat non-courtship between its two teenage principals. The Marked Ones isnt mannered at all though it is a little meta Written and directed by Christopher Landon The Marked Ones attempts to pull together some of the plot threads from previous Paranormal movies and weave them into an elaborate mythology. Its a bit of a stretch and the scares in The Marked Ones are both more graphic and less effective than the shadowy spook-outs of the other movies. For those who care about stuff like formalism The Marked Ones isnt so different from your typical found-footage romp a la V/H/S. In the other Paranormals its always clear where the camera is and why its there. In The Marked Ones youre just supposed to presume that someone or other is recording at all times whether or not theres any logical reason for it. And on the sliding scale of shaky-cam standards The Marked Ones is really shaky. Bring Dramamine or a barf bag.But really none of those factors alone would be enough to sink The Marked Ones if it were some combination of funny scary or funny-scary all the way through. The big problem is the pictures tone In the second half specifically The Marked Ones is nastier and more mean-spirited than any of the other Paranormals. Landon co-wrote three of the previous entries though this is his first time directing one and he doesnt seem to know or care about the kinds of questions audiences may want answers to. At one point we see Jesse torturing the Chihuahua; the camera lingers a little too sadistically before Landon cuts away. We dont see the outcome of the sequence and the dog is never heard from again -- I guess were not supposed to care what happens to him or for that matter to Jesses abuelita who apparently doesnt fare so well either. Landon works hard at loading the last half of The Marked Ones with scary stuff ticking off all the boxes. But the devil is in the details and he leaves too many of those hanging. In the end The Marked Ones isnt very paranormal at all. Really its just business as usual.

TWITTER Screenwriter Christopher Landon directs the fifth installment of Paramounts long-running franchise. Taking a new tack with the hugely successful and lucrative Paranormal Activity franchise the series filmmakers target a young Latino audience with the fifth installment which acts as a spinoff from the original films. Playful rather than cynical this fresh approach provides sufficient variation to bring back fans loyal to the established brand as well as engage a larger urban audience as well. Paranormal-scale returns seem unlikely but Paramount could still see a big weekend when The Marked Ones take is combined with box-office earnings from holdovers The Wolf of Wall Street and Anchorman 2. PHOTOS 15 Horror Movies That Offered the Most Bang for the Buck Recent Oxnard Calif. high school graduate Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and homeboy Hector (Jorge Diaz) plan to spend their summer goofing off and chasing girls but the sudden death of Jesses downstairs neighbor middle-aged recluse Anna (Gloria Sandoval) messes with their plans. Breaking through a window into Annas shuttered apartment after the authorities have sealed the front door the teens discover a collection of ritualistic art and a childrens nursery outfitted with ominous surgical equipment. Shortly after removing a journal full of occult writings and illustrations from Annas place Jesse finds a mark on his arm that looks like an animal bite and begins to experience strange physical sensations and a growing sense of strength and power but hes also losing track of events and unable to control his increasingly violent temper. Hector and Jesses sister Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) take their concerns about Jesses erratic behavior to his grandmother who quickly senses the young mans unease and consults a local healer but the prescribed ritual only enrages Jesse further. A series of clues leads Jesses friends to Ali (Molly Ephraim) who helps them connect recent events and warns that Jesse is in extreme danger from the supernatural forces that have possessed his body and psyche. PHOTOS Before They Were Stars A-Listers Who Survived Their Horror-Movie Past Adopting a looser approach to the found-footage conceit than in the previous Paranormal Activity films hes scripted Christopher Landon gets behind the camera on the current outing but stylistically he doesnt manage to noticeably enhance the technique or innovatively employ alternatives to the franchises overly familiar brand of shaky handheld cinematography. Landons screenplay displays a fresh often amusing perspective however and this lighter touch serves both the material and the intended audience well even without returning castmembers beyond a few brief appearances. At the same time the script succeeds by expanding the Paranormal Activity mythology with additional details and even a few surprising twists including a particularly sinister use of Milton Bradleys Simon electronic game. Jacobs and Diaz share an easy rapport throughout enhanced by their use of Latino slang and cultural references along with frequent humor in the early going. Minimal Spanish-language dialogue ensures that the film remains accessible to a broad audience. Further attempts to leverage specific demographic segments of the Paranormal fanbase might irreparably fragment the franchise but for now a sense of reinvigoration prevails.

It would be a wild exaggeration to suggest that ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" breathes new life into the increasingly fumes-fueled found-footage horror subgenre but it certainly represents a shot in the arm for this series after 2012s poorly regarded ""Paranormal Activity 4."" Functioning more as a mythology-expanding spinoff than a proper sequel this fifth installment (the first directed by longtime series writer Christopher Landon) smartly moves the setting away from airy suburbs to overcrowded working-class apartments and introduces a winning sense of humor that almost compensates for its relentless reliance on every terror trope in the book. A pleasantly disposable slice of off-season chiller product this Paramount release should easily win the weekends box-office race. At this point the conventions and limitations of the found-footage horror film are almost as well worn and cliched as those of horror pics at large ""Put down the camera stupid"" has now probably been shouted at just as many screens as ""Dont go down into the basement"" (Look for ""Tilt your viewfinder 20 degrees to the left"" to finally supplant ""Look out behind you"" within the present decade.) Appropriately the hapless heroes of ""The Marked Ones"" never put down the camera even as they venture into dark basements or struggle to start a stalled car or split up in the middle of a haunted mansion -- and its to the credit of the films primary cast that these bits of genre-appropriate stupidity generate more laughs than groans. Kicking off with a high-school graduation ""The Marked Ones"" centers on likably lunkheaded teenage buddies Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) as well as Jesses tag-along relative Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh). Set in gritty Oxnard Calif. the film boasts an almost entirely Latino cast of characters -- a welcome gesture toward a huge filmgoing demographic that rarely gets to see itself onscreen -- while smart casting and production design help capture the flavor of the environs with only moderate deployment of cultural stereotypes. Seemingly possessing no greater postgrad ambitions than milling around and attempting ""Jackass"" stunts with their omnipresent video camera Jesse and Hector harass Jesses abuela (Renee Victor) smoke pot play basketball occasionally run afoul of some local gangsters draw penises on one anothers faces and generally bust each others balls for a decent chunk of the film. Fortunately Jacobs and Diaz boast an easy ""Beavis and Butt-head""-esque chemistry throughout making for pleasant company as the audience waits for the inevitable horrors to befall them. The first complication comes from Jesses elderly downstairs neighbor Anna (Gloria Sandoval) whose reclusive behavior is strange enough for Hector to postulate that ""maybe the bitch is a bruja."" The two attempt to spy on her by lowering a camera down through a ventilation shaft where they witness Anna scrawling arcane symbols on the belly of a nude younger woman. Being teenage boys theyre far too intrigued by the boobs on display to fret over the obvious occult ritual taking place but when Anna is subsequently murdered they decide to attempt some amateur late-night sleuthing with predictably unpleasant results. While the film hardly plays it coy about where this is all heading it doesnt seem to be in a rush to get there and it springs a number of smart ideas along the way. Replacing the typical Ouija board with a haunted Simon game is sure to provoke howls of laughter from those in the appropriate age bracket and the idea that a victim of demonic possession would rush to YouTube to show off his gnarly new abilities -- and be promptly torn to shreds by comment-section trolls -- is sadly in keeping with the times. The haunted-house setpieces provide reliable doses of jolts even if one can see the scaffolding of each scare being built from miles away and director Landon has fun with some clever camera placement here and there. A very meta twist ending promises to either open up new narrative possibilities or else push the franchise deep into a self-referential rabbit hole when ""Paranormal Activity 5"" arrives later in the year.

Reply bbj says January 5 2014 at 123 pm I liked the movie it has both hilarious and pop-up scary scenes. If your hispanic and know spanish you will understand a lil bit better. The only thing bad is probably when the movie ends you will get dizzy and might throwup since there is alot movement from the camera. There is stuff that doesnt make sense towards the end but if u pay attention it almost adds up Reply Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says January 4 2014 at 124 am Reblogged this on HORROR BOOM and commented Were on the fence about this... theres not as much of a marketing push as usual (whether they call it a spin-off or not) but Uncle Creepy from Dread Central gave it a rave review (which you can read here). Its not getting very good reviews in general though and its coming out in January... arrrgh.

"Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones another sign that Blair Witch disease leads to stupidity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParanormal Activity The Marked Ones another sign that Blair Witch disease leads to stupidityThe real terror of spin-off series Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones is the thought that Blair Witch disease still rages unabated 15 years after the outbreak began.A scene from Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones.  (Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 3 2014Paranormal Activity The Marked OnesStarring Andrew Jacobs Jorge Diaz and Gabrielle Walsh. Written and directed by Christopher Landon. At major Toronto theatres. 84 minutes. 14AThe real terror of Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones is the horrifying thought that Blair Witch disease rages unabated 15 years after the outbreak began.The Sundance Film Festival in January 1999 sensationalized The Blair Witch Project and its documentary-style conceit of a ""found footage"" movie of recovered home video that slowly revealed its horrors.Article Continued BelowThe novelty has long been crushed like a Halloween pumpkin under a steamroller thanks to countless imitators who also corrupted what ""found footage"" actually means. The term is now indiscriminately applied to any movie that uses an excessive amount of hand-held camerawork bad sound and ragged editing.Hence Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones the first spin-off of a horror franchise that had simplicity going for it when writer/director Oren Pelis lo-fi poltergeist home haunting debuted in 2007. Peli now co-produces while series writer Christopher Landon moves into the directors chair. The Marked Ones introduces newcharacters a group of Latino teens who stumble into the witches coven revealed by the earlier films (and also a tell-all trailer). The opportunity should have been taken to jettison the found-footage idea which makes absolutely no sense in this context.Instead we get refried screams as best buds Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) get too curious about the crazy old woman who lives in the apartment below them in their California housing project.They go exploring with Hector toting that damned camera. All hell breaks loose on cue telegraphed well in advance and occasionally intersecting with the original Paranormal Activity franchise like two shopping carts colliding in a discount mart.By now this rapidly deflating franchise should be titled Paranormal Stupidity because the characters insist on doing all the wrong things.Who in their right minds would open the trap door to a darkened dungeon with strange noises emanating out of it and then just stick their heads in? These idiots would.And if you got an unexplained and oozing bite mark on your arm wouldnt you see a doctor about it maybe for a rabies shot? These knuckleheads wouldnt.The Marked Ones isnt very scary and its not very funny so really whats the point? Oh I forgot -- its to make a pile of money again.My fondest wish would be if theyd use some of that loot to find a cure for Blair Witch disease.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

But while evil lurks nearby bloody gruesomeness is kept to a minimum in this fresher than expected sequel.This photo released by Paramount Pictures shows a scene from the horror thriller film ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" written and directed by Christopher. B. Landon.(Photo Paramount Pictures AP)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of 4Stars Andrew Jacobs Jorge Diaz Gloria Sandoval Renee Victor Carlos Pratt Gabrielle WalshRated R; Runtime 1 hour 26 minutes; opens today nationwideParanormal Activity was becoming the inert norm. Tales of demonic possession and spooky covens had grown predictable in this series of low-budget shaky-cam sequels.This fifth installment however injects new life into the tired franchise. Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones ( out of four; rated R; opens today nationwide) is a marked improvement over its predecessors having changed the locale and characters from privileged white suburbanites to a mostly Latino cast in a working-class urban setting. Its a welcome update qualifying as the best in the series since the first film captivated and unnerved audiences in 2007.Best buddies Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz) have just graduated from high school. Both have a likable Everyman quality and evident chemistry. The film relies more heavily on interpersonal connections between Jesses friends and family than on recorded chronicling of things that go bump in the night which formed the cornerstone of the previous films.But as with its predecessors darkened corners spooky corridors and desolate rooms are integral to a mounting sense of terror.The plot centers on Jesse and Hectors morbid fascination with Anna (Gloria Sandoval) a creepy middle-aged neighbor of Jesses and the strange goings-on inside her apartment. Hector totes around a new digital video camera and stumbles on Anna performing an occult ritual.In the first couple of films common household items took on a sinister cast. Here Jesses pet Chihuahua his feisty grandmother (Renee Victor) and a retro electronic game play key roles.This fifth film written and directed by Christopher Landon has convoluted sequences and moments that stretch credulity.But it also has more fresh humor viable scares and character development than the past few sequels. Its easy to become invested in the welfare of this charismatic cast and to feel trepidation when they encounter hazards.Jesse is stricken with mysterious bite marks. In short order he exhibits super-human strength and bouts of nasty temper. Hes ""changing"" as predicted by class valedictorian Oscar (Carlos Pratts) who was similarly cursed.His friends stand by Jesse. His grandmother attempts to counteract the spell hes under with some unconventional remedies of her own.While the producers of the franchise are clearly courting the films sizable Latino fan base the calculated effort doesnt come off as pandering. Ethnic cliches and caricatures are avoided. Jesse and company are more fleshed-out characters than any since Katie and Micah of the first film and their exchanges feel strikingly natural.Jesses grandmother speaks only Spanish and no subtitles are provided for non-Spanish speakers. Jesse Hector and their friend Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) refer to the mysterious Anna who engages in black magic as a ""bruja"" (Spanish for witch) without bothering to translate. All this adds to a sense of authenticity but doesnt preclude general audiences from understanding the story and being duly spooked. Those who speak Spanish however will appreciate linguistic details and features of Latino culture depicted with more realism than in most mainstream American films.The series continues to rely on the found footage style with ubiquitous jumpy edits and murky shots to intensify the intended jittery effect.A scene involving tattooed gang-bangers taking on supernatural forces provides comic relief during mounting tension. References to earlier films build on the series established mythology and deepen its fright quotient.Horror movie fans will appreciate the nightmarish story arc and the unexpected conclusion in this fresh re-vamping. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/KnaYfJ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/03/paranormal-activity-the-marked-ones-review/4269739/,200,paranormalactivitythemarkedones16,paranormalactivitythemarkedones,usatoday

While its exciting to see a hit series take on an almost entirely Latino cast as just a matter of course the new zigs only barely balance out all the familiar zags. ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" the latest in a seemingly endless array of ""put the camera down and run fool"" fright flicks will certainly please fans who are happy to get more of the same with each successive film. But if like me youre suffering from ""Paranormal"" burnout the change of scenery wont feel like enough to make a difference. Recent high school grad Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) -- who has just bought his first hand-held camera go figure -- spends the summer hanging out with best pals Hector (Jorge Diaz) and Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh). All is not well however; the creepy lady downstairs considered by many to be a bruja is murdered by class valedictorian Oscar (Carlos Pratts) not long after Jesse lowers a camera through the vent and catches his neighbor painting a strange symbol on a naked womans stomach. Also read Paramount Promotes Equal Opportunity Possession in Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones Trailer (Video) Jesse and Hector (and the camera of course) later sneak into the ladys apartment and find all sorts of creepy books not to mention a cache of VHS tapes that will be familiar to anyone whos been following the series. Suddenly Jesse seems to have strange powers and his old Simon machine is answering yes/no questions like a Ouija board and the family dog is freaking out and Jesses abuelita heads to her local bodega santero for help in driving the evil out of her house. ""The Marked Ones"" makes a noble effort to shake up the franchise but it doesnt commit to anything that might prevent the sixth seventh and eighth chapters that are no doubt in various stages of production. Mexican mysticism might have made a more palatable opponent to the wicked witches than the bland bourgeois agnosticism of the previous chapters but the film winds up being not all that interested in pursuing the idea. Also read Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones Will Haunt The Hobbit at Box Office Instead we get a very predictable progression from ""check out my cool powers"" (any found-footage movie about a teenager suddenly endowed with magical abilities cant help but call ""Chronicle"" to mind) to screaming and bleeding and running. Writer-director Christopher Landon delivers a few good scares and not always where you expect them but where he really excels in the cast and their performances; their exchanges feel spontaneous and unforced vital for a found-footage movie and Landon (with the help of casting director Carla Hool) has assembled a charismatic and empathetic group of actors. (Particularly the scene-stealing Jorge Diaz who all but walks away with the movie.) Also read The Purge Why Doesnt Everyone Make 3M Movies That Open to 36M? ""Paranormal Activity"" fans will certainly appreciate the effort that Landon (who has written every installment since the second one) makes to ground the tale in series canon. And hes to be applauded for ethnically diversifying this studio cash cow since after all its the franchise itself thats the star and not any of the actors. But if youve already jumped off this bandwagon or have considered doing so after the last few movies theres not much in ""The Marked Ones"" that will compel you to follow the camera-operating protagonist down another dark hallway.

"Review Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones has fresh frights - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones has fresh frights Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones Paramount Pictures Jorge Diaz and Gabrielle Walsh star in ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones."" Jorge Diaz and Gabrielle Walsh star in ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones."" (Paramount Pictures) Mark Olsen The scariest thing about some horror movies might be when ""5"" appears at the end of the title -- little good has ever come from that.So its not surprising the team behind the ""Paranormal Activity"" films has gone an alternate route adding a non-numbered secondary title of ""The Marked Ones"" on the franchises fifth entry. The wildly successful series of low-budget films have trafficked in a sort of charged mundanity the movies found-footage aesthetic based on the essential angst of ""Whos there?"" and ""Whats that?"" in their shaky gaze toward darkened doorways and empty rooms.PHOTOS Movies dealing with possession The new film shifts from the suburban anxieties of the white middle class to a group of Latino teenagers in an apartment complex. The change is sharp giving the new film some much-needed freshness.The series has a large Latino fan base and in a way the audience has been the true auteur from the first film forward. Producer Jason Blum seemed to steer the series more than Oren Peli writer-director of the original and the result has been something oddly decentralized about the ""Paranormal"" films. Now it seems to make sense business-wise and creatively to tailor a film directly to the most ardent fans.""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" picks up with new characters -- teenagers played by Andrew Jacobs Jorge Diaz and Gabrielle Walsh -- who stumble onto an unsettling mystery when a reclusive woman in their apartment complex dies. They dig deeper and it turns out that some of them have been unknowingly involved in a sinister plot involving black magic mysticism and possession for years.PHOTOS A brief hitstory of found footage films Christopher Landon who has written for the earlier sequels directs for the first time in the series. His film doesnt have anywhere near the formal inventiveness of the third or fourth ""Paranormal"" films.
