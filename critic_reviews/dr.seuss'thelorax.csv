His wiry line drawings and bouncily absurd verse somehow resist being captured off the page and this rigidly synthetic effort from the Despicable Me team fares no better than The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat. Published in 1972 The Lorax is one of Seusss bleakest works. An environmentally conscious fable about the perils of non-sustainable industry its cast as a classical battle of wills between The Once-ler a greedy deforesting entrepreneur and The Lorax a mustachioed critter who acts as natures guardian. Writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul who previously failed to nail Seuss in Horton Hears a Who have retained the noble moral but added a litany of car chases pratfalls wacky grandmas and pint-sized villains to ensure twenty-first-century tykes arent bored getting to it. The Lorax himself may speak for the trees and hes voiced with some zest by Danny DeVito - but amid all this plasticky clutter he scarcely gets a word in edgeways. The result is about as factory-produced a film as its possible to make about the evils of commercialism while the bulbous Haribo-hued animation style reflects none of Seusss visual wit.

Early on my son (who was less than 2 years) watched with more focus than anything else. The visuals are great for little ones Whether or not they nailed The Drs cartoon style I see it as an appropriate adaptation for our time. It keeps attention and delivers the basic message well. My son now says ""oh no"" when the first and last trees fall.

To me this only compounds the offense. No author has suffered more at the hands of Hollywood in recent years than Theodore Geisel better known as Dr. Seuss. The man who brightened my childhood and my daughters with his clever verse fanciful drawings and vivid imagination has been pummeled by such overblown productions as How the Grinch Stole Christmas and (even worse)The Cat in the Hat. Now comes The Lorax a bright shiny 3-D animated film from the team that made its reputation with the unpretentious feature Despicable Me. The Lorax was Dr. Seuss most serious work as it conveyed an ecological message to youngsters and their parents. The message remains intact in this adaptation by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul but its almost smothered by extraneous story material and characters. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda have filled every scene with funny-looking (or sounding) characters sight gags and one-liners to provide constant distraction. This might work as a diversion for younger kids but there is no sign of the wit or wisdom of Dr. Seuss. The story about a boy who lives in a plastic city and goes in search of a genuine tree meanders far and wide. Thats because like other Seussian adaptations this one takes a slender book and arbitrarily expands it to feature length. When the DePatie-Freleng animation studio adapted The Lorax for television forty years ago it ran just under a half-hour which didnt require all that padding. The songs by screenwriter Paul and composer John Powell are odd and unmemorable except for the summing-up number ""Let it Grow"" which ends the picture. Theodore Geisel counted on the bond of trust he had built with his readers to offer a thoughtful and timely message. The people behind this forgettable film are merely trading on the authors deep reserve of goodwill.

I am a big Seuss fan and like the Lorax book and the Chuck Jones cartoon but this was way too preachy and frankly not as good as the original. I though the animation was good from a technical view point (the trees did look rather snuggly) but the plot pacing was not well done. Reply Ben Geiger May 22 2016 1259 am For the entire history of mankind most humans have lived in poverty with no freedom. In 200 years of capitalism the average person has gone from a 35 year life expectancy to a 75 year life expectancy enjoyed electricity average of 2 cars and 2 television sets elimination of most plegues etc. I appluad capitalists for a longer and higher quality life. Its a disgrace to teach our children that the heroes who have improved our lives are evil. Capitalism does not create problems it fixes them. In capitalism you make money by solving problems. That is why we have more trees in the U.S. now than before the industrial revolution. Reply Martin May 22 2016 1259 am The story was transparent and its political message was straigh from Obamas re-election campaign. Busness evil rich evil enviromental worship good. You know the paper industry plants more trees in a year than all the liberal put together. Why dont you tree huggers give up your houses and cars and COMPUTER and go live in caves. The producers of this are hypocrits and that is the worst part kill thousands of trees to make distribute and present this movie and make millions at it at the same time hmmm maybe it was actually produced by OHare industries. Reply Jacob Sackin May 22 2016 1259 am The saddest thing about all the bad reviews journalists are writing about The Lorax movie is that none of them seem to provide any alternate ideas for how the plot of the movie could have been better or for how the new story and old story could have been weaved together in a better pattern they just bash the fact that the movie has corporate movie elements like 3D roller coaster river rides and that it markets 70 products. The parable of people living in a plastic treeless world because of the onclers greed when he was a teenager out to prove himself is a great one for kids in 2012. The whole movie is just a fun creative buildup to how things got the way they were in the beginning of the Lorax book and an introduction to what could have been the next two pages of the The Lorax book had Dr. Suess chosen to end it by taking the book to its natural conclusion The last truffula seed is planted by the boy trees start to grow again and finally The Lorax and his friends come back. The movie also does a good job showing that those people behind the green faceless gloves are just normal people like you and me hungry to buy up the newest i-something that come onto the scene. Of course there could have been more gloppity glop and schluppity schlup showing the building of the factory and what the pollution was doing to the humming fish and their friends; it also would have been interesting to see if the people returned to their plastic world after planting all the truffula trees and if they dug up their plastic lawns and electronic flowers and changed their lives. But the movie intertwined the new narrative with snippets from the book flawlessly at times even some of the rhymes and it was great to finally see the Lorax and the old oncler finally hug and move on with their lives. It feels to me like journalists are eager to trash the movie version of the book simply to seem more like a die hard fan of the book like someone complaining about Dylan going electric in order to prove him or herself a folk music enthusiast. As for marketing 70 products marketing is the way to get your product out there good ones as well as bad and I think that Dr. Suess would have been happy for the number of people in the world who will now know about The Lorax is only going to keep biggering and biggering. And maybe one of those people will come up with the sequel to the Lorax movie and figure out how the people in thneedville can combine their new love for actual photosynthesizing trees with their dependance on plastic electronic crap. Reply Norm May 22 2016 1259 am Disconcerting discourteous disconnected discourse...wow...It is obvious todays writers just dont get it ..They dont understand the writing of a superior Author...Which speakes volumes of the chasm of the generational divide...Maybe they just dont have the discipline or morals to ""get"" it...Hopefully  one day they may read a book that shows them the beauty and influence of the language of Theodore Geisel..How about ""Green Eggs amp; Ham...""...Sam......I am... Reply Tony McCarson May 22 2016 1259 am ""Horton Hears a Who (2008)"" is a better movie adaption of Dr. Seuss than the movie versions of the Grinch (2000) the Cat in the Hat (2003) amp; the Lorax (2012). Reply CMurnane May 22 2016 1259 am We just finished seeing this film. I am sad that it had none of the whimsical magic that his stories did. Please do not go see it. It is not worth your money Reply gary meyer May 22 2016 1259 am At least we still have THE 5000 FINGERS OF DR. T Chuck Jones wonderful half hour films Ralph Bakshis surprisingly good THE BUTTER BATTLE BOOK the most unusual Russian short WELCOME and the delightful shorts made by George Pal and Warner Brothers (including the Snafu series) plus of course the UPA GERALD McBOING BOING series. But since his death it feels like aI meant no harm. I most truly did not. But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got.a But bigger is not necessarily better. Next we have a biopic with Johnny Depp playing Theodor Geisel. He did pretty well as J.M Barrie so lets hope it is interesting. Reply christine lavin May 22 2016 1259 am While he was alive Ted Geisel had strict quality control over his work and his characters. It is shameful what his heirs have allowed to happen to his work. I know his widow justifies it by saying ""I didnt want his work to be forgotten so I let them do this"" but his books WONT be forgotten. Hopefully films like this will be.

Universal Pictures/HONS/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Dr. Seuss 7 adaptations of his beloved stories Monitor Movie Guide The Lorax - The 3-D animated feature ""The Lorax"" is a reasonably entertaining rendition of the 1971 Dr. Seuss eco-cautionary fable that now seems all too prescient. Its about 13-year-old Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) who seeks out the legendary Truffula Tree far beyond the confines of his treeless prefabricated town of Thneedville where fresh air is sold in bottles.Along the way a lively comic gallery emerges including Teds Grammy Norma (Betty White) the orange sprite Lorax (Danny De Vito) and Thneedvilles reigning meanie Aloysius OHare (Rob Riggle). Director Chris Renaud and his team have fun with these dithery frenetic characters. The film is less special when it slows down and takes a breath of fresh air.

(The behavior of the man known as the Once-ler is the most flagrantly unrealistic element Industrialists who devastate large swaths of land dont stick around to experience the consequences. They move on to the next target and the next. They buy houses in Palm Beach. They bankroll libertarian think tanks.) But Dr. Seusss The Lorax [sic] isnt Seussian in spirit. Its shrill and campy and stuffed with superfluous characters. The first bit of Seussian verse we hear is when a character not in the book teenage Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) tells lovelorn 12-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) that once nearby their now paved-over town there were truffula trees and ""the touch of their tufts was much softer than silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk."" Ted says ""Wow what does that even mean?"" and Audrey says ""I know right?"" So not only dont you get much Seuss what you get is made fun of -- dragged down to earth. The badness of the picture is a shock. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda and writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul were behind the barnstormingly funny Despicable Me and the last and much better Seuss feature Horton Hears a Who (narrated by Charles Osgood) but this time they dont seem to trust their material. To be fair they have some reason. The book is an environmentalist classic a walloping argument against unchecked growth. But its nowhere near Seusss top tier It doesnt have that thrilling mixture of anarchism and elegance. Its agitprop with no surprises and a title character -- a mysterious creature who ""speaks for the trees"" -- that even Geisel seems to find a pain in the ass describing him as ""shortish. And oldish. And brownish. And mossy"" who speaks ""with a voice that [is] sharpish and bossy."" Fortunately the Lorax doesnt appear in the book very much and you dont actually have to hear his voice ... In the film however you get loud serenades in Danny DeVitos unmellifluous blend of New Jersey blare and Philly nasality. I dont blame DeVito Its not as if he were cast for his subtlety. Hes a good pushy sitcom actor with crack timing. But given his nonstop crass one-liners he comes to embody the spirit of the movie in ways I dont think the filmmakers intend. Ready for nonstop whack-a-mole sight gags featuring adorable bar-ba-loots (bears to you) and three warbling fish -- this years chipmunks? The Once-lers white trash relatives zeppelins or stick dufuses barrel into the truffula forest in an RV and proceed to hack and chop away. The screenwriters add a stock villain to the framing story a pint-size mogul who pollutes by design since unbreathable air drives up sales of his companys canned air. He and his goons chase after 12-year-old Ted when the boy ventures into the denuded wasteland to talk to the aged reclusive Once-ler -- not because the kid cares about the environment but to impress the teenage Audrey. I guess that makes him easier to relate to than if he were just you know curious about why there are no animals and the landscape looks like the moon. No Dr. Seusss The Lorax [sic] isnt as eyeball-searing as the live-action Mike Myers monstrosity The Cat in the Hat which even Geisels injudicious widow Audrey found repulsive compelling her to pull the plug on any future live-action Seuss adaptations. The diaphanous texture of the truffula blooms is lovely and theres a witty song ""How Bad Can I Be?"" in which the Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) rocks out with his electric guitar proclaiming his Capitalist Manifesto as the trees come down. The movie is more compelling in the last twenty minutes when the cute animals -- not to mention the Lorax -- take a hike. For a brief spell it has the books sense of loss its droopy melancholy. You can still discern the stark fable beneath the movies jokey tone but barely The devastation is nearly complete. The Lorax speaks for the trees -- but who will speak for The Lorax?

Comments (4) click to enlarge The Lorax 3D Rated PG  94 minutes  2012 Hypocrisy on an epic scale this computer-animated feature turns the Dr. Seuss classic about corporate greed into a multimillion-dollar toy commercial. The movie pays lip service to the books environmentalist message but its real agenda is creating another Shrek-style merchandising juggernaut. Instead of Seusss sweet nonsense we get smug pop-culture references and feeble one-liners; the songs which sound like extended radio jingles make the movie even more of a slog.

"The Lorax review Somebody call a doctor |       NJ.com comments The Lorax review Somebody call a doctor Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 02 2012 at 801 AM View/Post Comments Universal PicturesThe Lorax. This weeks new kid cartoon is called ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" and I guess thats a good thing. Because without the authors name in the title you might wonder where it came from. Its not that its a dreadful cartoon. It just feels like every other middling cartoon. (If you want to appreciate how good Pixar and Dreamworks can be sit through some animated movies they didnt make.) Of course the source material isnt that great to begin with. ""The Lorax"" came out the year after the first Earth Day and during Dr. Seuss preachiest period; whimsical charm definitely took a backseat to pointed lessons about recycling and reforestation. Well okay. If we absolutely have to have a message personally Id prefer the one-tiny-size-fits-all lesson of ""Horton Hears a Who."" But as a rule outside of the lunatic fringe I think we can all agree that trees are a good thing and pollution is a bad one. But theres not that much more to the original book than that message. And theres even less here. At least the real Dr. Seuss ""The Lorax"" had well Dr. Seuss and his wonderful art. But this ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" eschews his unique style in favor of less risky more generic characters. It looks like something youve seen before. In fact you have if you saw ""Despicable Me"" -- ""The Lorax"" is from the same team and it has the same rubbery pre-made look and hungry-for-merchandising feel. ""Despicable Me"" had a chorus of cute robots; this one has a trio of adorable fish. Theres also some lazy stereotyping with the vocal cast. Or is it just a coincidence that the heros pushy mother has a cliched New York Jewish accent that the villain sounds a bit like a Jersey tough guy or that one characters stupid relatives all hail from the Deep South? Universal Pictures The Lorax (Danny DeVito) stands with the Bar-ba-loots Swomee-Swans and Humming-Fish. True Dr. Seuss original story -- in a world without trees one boy searches for the last remaining seed -- remains. As does the Lorax a trippy kind of nature spirit -- who thankfully is voiced by Danny DeVito which at least anchors things in real comedy. Hes fun as is Betty White who gives voice to the heros grandma. But Zac Efron and Taylor Swift add nothing but names for the poster as the young hero and his secret crush. And a newly added villain -- a tiny capitalist with a Moe Howard haircut -- is simply a bore. It all ends -- as most cartoons seem to these days -- with a big chase. Thats well done at least as is the Lorax (the character thats truest to Seuss) and some of the backgrounds. A few forgettable songs are dropped in along the way and theres not too much narrative self-righteousness. Although that may have been preferable to the hypocrisy of the cartoon itself -- whose marketing includes cross-promotions with a brand of disposable diapers and a new SUV. Because really whats truer to Dr. Seuss message than landfills and smog? Ratings note The film contains brief mild language. Dr. Seuss The Lorax (PG) Universal (86 min.) Directed by Chris Renaud Kyle Balda. With the voices of Danny DeVito Taylor Swift Zac Efron. Now playing in New Jersey.

Translating a Dr. Seuss book to film is a challenge because his stories are so well known. Some films (""Horton Hears a Who"") are more successful than others (""The Cat in the Hat""). ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" falls somewhere in the middle.""The Lorax"" tells about a small creature who speaks for the trees and begs for them not to be chopped down. The 3-D film expands and reinforces the books pro-environment message but in doing so takes away some of the charm of the original.Young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in Thneedville a town where trees are battery-operated parking lots are revered and swimming water is laced with chemicals. Ted has a crush on Audrey (Taylor Swift) who confides that she longs to see a living tree. Teds grandmother (the unmistakable Betty White) tells him about the Once-ler who may be able to help. Ted ventures to the desolate world of the Once-ler (Ed Helms). In flashbacks the Once-ler explains how he is responsible for ruining the land. When he was a young man he cut down the bright-colored Truffula Trees to provide materials for his garment the Thneed. The mysterious mustachioed Lorax (Danny DeVito) pleads for the Once-ler to stop his destructive ways but he doesnt listen.Deforestation isnt the most movie-friendly villain so one has been added. The ruthless OHare (Rob Riggle) makes his fortune selling bottled fresh air. He wants to stop Teds quest to find a seed. After all oxygen-producing trees would threaten his business. With its crooked homes and complicated contraptions the film captures Seuss sensibility. But his signature hard black lines are gone giving this 3-D world a softer vibrant look. The clever opening song ""Thneedville"" (""In Thneedville the air is not so clean so we buy it fresh and it comes out this machine"") is the highlight of the handful of musical numbers. But while the movie is funnier than the book the drawback of this modernized version is that it loses the timeless quality of the story on the page.""Dr. Seuss The Lorax""Three stars (out of four)  Rating PG  Run time 126  Content Brief mild language Find theaters and showtimes for The Lorax Mar 1 2012 (...)

Photo Credit Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In an all-artifical city a young boy searches for a real tree. RATING 2.5 stars BOTTOM LINE A lively adaptation of Seuss ecological fable with terrific voice work from Helms and DeVito as philosophical foes. CAST Voices of Danny DeVito Ed Helms Zac Efron Taylor Swift LENGTH 126 There are two romances in the animated film ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" that were not in the 1971 book. The one between 12-year-old Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) and willowy high schooler Audrey (Taylor Swift) has been scripted in but the other blossoms between two original characters the nature-destroying Once-ler (Ed Helms) and his tree-hugging nemesis the Lorax (Danny DeVito). That relationship -- more a bromance technically -- works because the two actors put so much heart into their roles and also because of the compassion and complexity built into Seuss ecological fable. The Once-ler is not a corporate monster (though there is one in the film) but a bright-eyed pioneer reaping the bounties of a Seussian frontier. Chopping down fluffy Truffula trees and displacing cuddly Bar-ba-loot bears hes a villain but -- like the Grinch -- one worthy of salvation. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Likewise the Lorax is no gentle forest fairy but a mustachioed grouch who ""speaks for the trees"" in DeVitos distinctive New Jersey rasp. Though their outlooks differ the activist and the businessman become an endearing odd couple even bunking together in the Once-lers cabin (until it expands into a corporate HQ). When every last natural resource is consumed and the Lorax says goodbye its clear hell miss the Once-ler almost as much as the Bar-ba-loots. The added story of Ted and Audrey -- theyre trying to save the last living tree from the clutches of Mr. OHare (Rob Riggle) an antinature tycoon -- isnt quite as compelling and many of the movies jokes are beyond tired (disco music has not been funny for years). But those tufted Truffulas look great with swirly tops like the bouffant of a Supreme and the animation generally feels livelier than other Illumination Entertainment productions like ""Despicable Me."" Where ""The Lorax"" succeeds its by letting its Seussian spirit shine through. PLOT In an all-artifical city a young boy searches for a real tree.

The doctor is in for good or ill Family25 books to celebrate Dr. Seusss birthday Long before ""The Lorax"" the whimsical works of Theodor Seuss Geisel aka Dr. Seuss graced screens large and small. HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (CBS Dec. 18 1966). Animation director Chuck Jones (""Looney Tunes"") had worked with Geisel on animated training films during World War II. They reunited in 1966 when Jones was head of MGM Studios animation division and worked closely in adapting Seuss 1957 childrens book for a half-hour musical TV special. DR. SEUSS HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000). This live-action family film starring Jim Carrey as the Grinch got far less love than did the animated special. Nonetheless it earned more than 260 million in the United States and Canada alone and won the Oscar for best makeup. THE CAT IN THE HAT (2003). Almost universally reviled and not earning back its budget this Mike Myers vehicle adapting the best-known Dr. Seuss book was originally set to star Tim Allen as the top-hatted cat. He had the good sense to do ""The Santa Clause 2"" instead. HORTON HEARS A WHO (2008). This well-received CGI version of the 1954 book featured Carrey again as the voice of elephant Horton. Director Jimmy Hayward unfortunately went on to do the live-action ""Jonah Hex"" (2010).

Screen grab from the online trailer for the new animated feature ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" Movies Dr. Seuss The Lorax The official trailer He whispers his tale to a curious lad Of the trees he clear-cut (like I told you its sad).It begins with one chop then he sets up a shop To make Thneeds a strange product that sells without stop.And not once does he heed the quite desperate pleas Of the Lorax who speaks for the Truffula treesAnd the bears birds and fish that are driven away When the smog and the sludge make them too sick to stay.Like the old TV special from seventy-twoThe film has some songs - but theres more that is new.For a Hollywood feature mildly taking a stand Dr. Seusss main story just had to expand.So its puffed up with lots of extraneous stuff - Super fun for the kids but for grown-ups? Just fluff.(Already Lou Dobbs has made quite a kerfuffle Its liberal ""agenda"" the Fox host wants to muffleClaiming the film aims to brainwash our kids As they snorffle down popcorn and sodas with lids.)It opens in Thneedville where boss villain OHare (Who sounds like Rob Riggle but is short with weird hair)Keeps the townsfolk in check by selling them air But whats outside the town? They are all unaware.Until 12-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) goes on a spree And busts his way out just to find a real treeFor the girl of his dreams (Taylor Swift plays Audrey). The Once-ler hes told is the one man to see.And see him we do (very unlike the book). Ed Helms is the voice and hes got quite the lookLanky and lean and given to song As his much younger self (well before things go wrong).His story is told in not just one instalment But many - to keep us in total enthrallmentOf the Lorax with Danny DeVito the voice Which I must pause to say is a pretty good choice.The Dr. Seuss book and the old TV show Both hinge on one word which you probably know""Unless.""And what happens next? Well its anyones guess As to whether the boy will clean up the messBy planting the very last Truffula seed - Which is not quite the Hollywood ending we need.Will Ted be the hero or tragically sink? I wont be a spoiler but - what do you think?The LoraxDirected by Chris RenaudWritten by Ken DaurioStarring the voices of Danny DeVito Ed Helms Zac Efron Jenny Slate Rob Riggle and Betty WhiteClassification G2 stars Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story Dr. Seuss on the big screen The highs and lows Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Photo AP Ted voiced by Zac Efron left and Audrey voiced by Taylor Swift are shown in a scene from ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax."" (Universal) I am the critic I speak to displease ""The Lorax"" is awful like chronic disease. Theres no fun in ""The Lorax"" no joy in its theme; Its as boring as sales tax. Im ready to ream. Its knickers are twisted so high and so tight It could lead the days news on the Daily Kos site. The Lorax stands small as a hectoring runt. Even Al Gores ax was never so blunt As he ground it and frowned it right into the ground staging his raging and waxing profound like this Muppety scold -- this Sierra Club front. PHOTOS LORAX STAR TAYLOR SWIFT AND OTHER MUSICIANS IN MOVIES Our storys in Thneed-ville a plasticky place Where all things are phony and natures displaced. No tree is still present nor one blade of grass Compared to Las Vegas its even more crass. OHare is the bad guy industrialist scum But hes dull and unfunny not Grinchy -- humdrum. Zac Efron plays Ted a young sprout with a crush On Taylor Swifts Audrey the cause of his blush. For her he is questing to find one real tree In a land artificial -- how Charlie Brown-y. He encounters the Once-ler a puzzling chap Who hides behind shutters then opens his yap. Ed Helms does the voice of this tree-hating jerk Who once long ago the small Lorax did irk. The Once-ler began as a boy out to seek His fortune in business while his morals did leak. He raped the environment plundering hard Making the forest his own lumberyard. The Lorax an orange and furry wee thing Emerged from a stump and proceeded to zing The Once-ler for taking his forest away -- The latter agreeing his acts were outre. But the Once-ler loves mama and at her behest He changes his mind and puts cash before nests. Down goes each tree every Truffula trunk So their tufts can be made into scrofulous junk. Danny DeVitos the Loraxs voice And he says he must go now to balk at this choice. The Lorax ascends in a beam of clean light an ascension like J.C.s but 10 times as bright. Now back in the present the Thneed-Ville you know has just one more chance -- its a seed fit to sow. With OHare in pursuit our Ted scrambles to save a tree that could start a green hopeful new wave. Its sad -- in the climax the main action scenes are dull and lackluster like eating your greens. Teds run is just runny theres no fun here thats funny Just tired old gags on pollution and money. There are songs here its true but theyre musical rants As stale as the crust on your dads underpants. Youll forget them before this young March hits the ides; I have heard better tunes on Clay Aikens B-sides. This satire it dates back to 71 an age when the cool was remarkably un-. The plastics and vinyl were blooming their blooms Today its all Whole Foods and locavore shrooms. Four decades too late to be timely on time The whimsy lacks whim and the rhyme doesnt climb. Its all preaching and perching on messages dry. Bob Dylans poor knees are sixteen times as spry. We all know that trees are much better than sleaze But delight must be light and should please with its ease. When this storys harrumphing and pleading its plea Id prefer to get lectured by Barack O-B.

Starring Danny DeVito Zac Efron Ed Helms Taylor Swift Rob Riggle Betty White Director Chris Renaud Kyle Balda Running time 135 Release Opened Mar 2 2012  Editorial Review Its no prescription for funBy Michael OSullivanFriday Mar. 2 2012Like ""An Inconvenient Truth"" for the 12-and-under crowd ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" is a cautionary environmental tale with a thin veneer of entertainment on top. With its cotton-candy-colored palette of orange pink and purple truffula trees it looks like a bowl of fuzzy Froot Loops. But it goes down like an order of oatmeal. Sure its good for you. Its just not terribly good. Based on Seusss 1971 picture book - the darkest and most cynical of the author/illustrators oeuvre - this musical adaptation in eye-popping 3-D CGI  is undeniably less gloomy than the original. For starters the character of the Once-ler - the books narrator whose regret-tinged reminiscence sets Seusss story in motion and provides its singular focus - is no longer the protagonist. Played by Ed Helms the Once-ler now shares billing with a plucky kid named Ted (Zac Efron) a character vastly expanded from one in the book. Teds crush on a pretty neighbor Audrey (Taylor Swift) now frames the entire narrative turning it into an episode of a Nickelodeon sitcom. The movie jumps back and forth jauntily between Teds courtship of Audrey and flashbacks to the Once-lers misspent youth. Its still kind of a drag. The film opens in the polluted futuristic town of Thneedville where trees dont grow anymore and where the only fresh air comes in plastic jugs bottled by an evil business magnate named Aloysius OHare (Rob Riggle). He looks less like a Dr. Seuss character than Edna Mode from ""The Incredibles."" Because Audrey is a tree-hugger with a nostalgic pining for the greener pastures of the past Ted sets out to find her a real live tree. Acting on a tip from his grandmother (Betty White) who still remembers the once-plentiful truffula trees that used to grow around Thneedville Ted sets out in search of the Once-ler an embittered recluse who lives in a decrepit house on the outskirts of town and who is rumored to know where all the truffula trees went. He ought to know. Decades ago the Once-ler chopped them all down in order to manufacture sweater-like garments called thneeds that he knitted out of the trees silky fiber. But what formed the heart and soul of the Seuss story - a powerful if unsubtle fable of thoughtless deforestation - is now mere back story to Teds effort to get the girl and defeat the bad guy. In addition to the introduction of an unnecessary love interest the movie builds an entirely new villain out of OHare whose business is for obvious reasons threatened by trees which produce oxygen for free. In the hands of co-directors Chris Reynaud and Kyle Balda and co-writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul Seusss slender though eloquent fable has morphed into something unwieldy and manic. Its simultaneously silly and preachy and with precious room for little fun. Danny DeVitos Lorax - the mystical mustached critter who speaks ""for the trees"" and who struggles futilely to stop the Once-ler - is even more messianic here than in the book traveling back and forth between Earth and the clouds in a shaft of celestial light like a furry Jesus. Seusss book may have been a heavy-handed downer but at least its heart was in the right place. ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" is a movie that progressives can feel good about taking their kids to without actually having a good time. Contains brief mildly rude language.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Lorax Animation. Starring the voices of Danny DeVito Taylor Swift and Zac Efron. Directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A thneed is a useful doohickey fluffy stretchy shaped like a deformed sweater and able to morph into headgear or undergarment as the occasion demands. Its easy to see why the Once-ler a floppy-haired young man who arrives in town with a mule a guitar and a dream would abuse the environment in his quest to make and sell as many thneeds as possible. The Once-lers unchecked capitalistic impulses quickly turn a little piece of woodland paradise into the desolate outskirts of a crowded suburban nightmare. If only hed listened to the Lorax the mustachioed orange fur ball ""who speaks for the trees"" - in the scratchy exasperated tones of Danny DeVito. Few live actors are born to play animated roles but DeVito is a natural as the title character in ""The Lorax"" an animated 3-D refitting of Dr. Seuss that also features Zac Efron as Ted the heretofore nameless boy who coaxes the tale of the Thneedville from a conscience-stricken Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms).

Nothing about it feels dated but thats true of almost everything in the Seuss canon; his tilting worlds and furry-fingered creatures live far removed from anything planted in the here and now. Yet the original ""Lorax"" is something else a simple prescient eco-fable that only grows with relevance. Its timeless. The movie isnt. Written and directed by much of the same team that made ""Despicable Me"" ""The Lorax"" exploits few of the books loopy rhymes and loopier neo-Seussisms. Efforts to jazz things up with zooming scooters pad rather than add to the story and the film could easily ditch OHare a diabolical corporate weenie who hawks air. But you know what? The whole thing is harmless. Most of the padding is sunny and funny and cute from a trio of harmonizing fish to the spunky grandma voiced inevitably by Betty White. An appended romance between Ted and his crush (named Audrey after Geisels widow and voiced by Taylor Swift) exists mainly to give the boy a decent hormonal motive in his quest to find a tree. Its perfectly sweet.

"Dr. Seuss The Lorax strays too far Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-SeussMOVIE REVIEWS Lost among the fake treesDr. Seuss The Lorax is bigger brighter and more befuddled.March 02 2012|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC Movies always have monkeyed around with their source material -- a 1930 version of ""Moby Dick"" had Ahab kill the whale and return home to his girlfriend -- but its hard to remember one that actually apologized before the fact for what it was about to do.The new 3-D animated ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" begins with that fuzzy orange creature amiably voiced by Danny DeVito stepping out in front of a theater curtain to announce ""theres more to this story than whats on the page."" You have been warned.Although it keeps intact the ecological message of one of the original tree-hugger books first published in 1971 this movie version adds a whole lot of other stuff most of it not very good and not in keeping with the spirit of the Seuss original.This story of a world without trees and how a young boy might bring them back called out for the touch of Japans lyrical Hayao Miyazaki very much an ardent environmentalist himself but what it got instead was the team behind the ersatz and exhausting ""Despicable Me."" For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday March 03 2012 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 32 words Type of Material Correction ""The Lorax"" The review of ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" in the March 2 Calendar section said that the films main character Ted lives in a town called Sneedville. The town is Thneedville.Directed by Chris Renaud and written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio for Illumination Entertainments Chris Meledandri this version of ""The Lorax"" certainly creates a lively and colorful -- some would say too colorful -- visual landscape with special attention being paid to the dazzling cotton-candy-topped Truffula trees.But to expand Seuss slim volume to theatrical feature length a whole lot of plot and heaping handfuls of characters needed to be invented. Not only are these people unpleasant for the most part but the new aspects of the story are forced frenetic and so far from the gentle but pointed original that the films musical riff from the ""Mission Impossible"" theme does not sound out of place.Though he is present in a quiet nameless way in the book the boy Ted (named here for Theodor Geisel Seuss real name and voiced by Zac Efron) is portrayed as 12 going on 25 a miniature adult who uses breath freshener spray and has the wiseacre attitude of a Las Vegas lounge lizard.This irritating young man is infatuated with a high-school-age older woman named Audrey (singer Taylor Swift). Shes in turn taken with the notion of trees real trees. The town these two live in Sneedville has only the plastic variety which means that residents have to buy their air from the tiny but evil OHare (Rob Riggle) who keeps the entire city under constant surveillance.Desperate to impress Audrey Ted determines to find a tree but the only person who seems to have a clue about them is Teds grandmother Grammy Norma (the indefatigable Betty White).Go outside of town she tells him to where the Once-ler lives. He can tell you what you need to know.Once the Once-ler (Ed Helms) is tracked down amid a desolate godforsaken valley and begins to tell his story ""The Lorax"" sticks close to the original for as long as it can.Back when he was a youth the Once-ler relates in flashback how he came to this place when it was thick with Truffula trees and cheerful creatures like Bar-ba-loots and Humming-Fish. (As the minions were in ""Despicable Me"" these are the most entertaining beings in the film.)The Once-ler found the best material for his new invention the Thneed an all-purpose object everyone needs in the tufts of those trees.But once he cut one down a strange creature appeared from inside the stump with huge yellow eyebrows and a mustache like Yosemite Sam. ""I am the Lorax"" he said not one to waste a dramatic opportunity. ""I speak for the trees.""The Lorax might have been speaking but the Once-ler wasnt listening. He cut down trees without number invited his repulsive family to come work for him and soon became such a baron of industry he had a ""Too Big to Fail"" sign on his wall. Determined to do what was best for his company he wrecked the environment without a second thought. ""Who cares if a few trees are dying?"" he said. ""This is all so gratifying.""The Once-ler of course sings a different tune once all the trees are gone and his valley looks like the far side of the moon. This inspires Ted to try to do better which leads to a chase so loud and bouncy it threatens to wear us out.By the time a cheerful ""Let It Grow"" song tries to rescue the film at its close the original Lorax has left the building and is not coming back.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--The LoraxMPAA rating PG for brief mild languageRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDr. Seuss goes to WashingtonSeptember 27 2013Moneygall Ireland A village of Obama family-tree huggersMarch 13 2009From Pool Guy to the Halls of PowerNovember 6 2004Donald Bren Shows the Tree Huggers He Has a Heart TooDecember 2 2001MORE STORIES ABOUTSeussCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-lorax-20120302,0,5193528.story",200,dr.seuss'thelorax14,dr.seuss'thelorax,latimes

(Hey whatever happened to the word ""ecology"" anyway?) In an era when air could be brown and rivers could catch fire this kid-friendly brand of activism packed a real punch. ""The Lorax"" keeps that spirit alive representing hope not only for the future of the planet but also for big-screen adaptations of the works of Dr. Seuss which have recently included the appalling live-action versions of ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"" as well as a merely-OK animated ""Horton Hears a Who."" ""The Lorax"" is the big screens best treatment of Seuss since the wonderfully weird 1953 kid-flick ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T."" One of the challenges of turning childrens books into movies is that a 20- or 30-page story doesnt necessarily loan itself to a three-act structure. But ""The Lorax"" turns the original story into a flashback that takes up the middle part of the movie with new material bookending it. The film opens with the Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito) stepping out from behind a curtain to let us know that the story were about to see isnt exactly the same as the one we already know. In the town of Thneedville everything is made of plastic so the populace spends lots of money on packaged air from pint-sized magnate Mr. OHare (Rob Riggle). Young Ted (Zac Efron) has a crush on his slightly-older neighbor Audrey (Taylor Swift) and when she expresses a desire to see an actual tree Ted sets out to find one for her. (Dr. Seuss real name incidentally was Theodore Geisel and his widows name is Audrey.) Teds Grammy Norma (Betty White) tells him theres one person who might be able to show him a tree -- the reclusive Once-ler (Ed Helms) who lives far outside of the candy-colored confines of Thneedville. After he figures out how to get out of town (and he sees where all the local pollution actually goes) Ted makes his way out to see the Once-ler who reluctantly tells Ted the tale of what happened to all the trees. As a young man the Once-ler left home to make his fortune on his invention the Thneed. He arrived at a forest and befriended the local fauna but when he chopped down a truffula tree the magical Lorax appeared to speak for the trees and warn the Once-ler to leave the flora alone. Readers of the original know the sad tale of what happened next but this film version from the folks behind ""Despicable Me"" manage to include the tales sad and cautionary ending while also providing an upbeat climax that lets the audience leave on a high note that still drives home the message of responsibility and environmental awareness that Seuss put across back in 1971. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda and their team honor Seuss original designs -- those fuzzy-top trees and the comical bears and fish -- while inventively creating the artificial world of Thneedville where all the shrubbery is inflatable and it can be all four seasons simultaneously. While the film isnt a full-on musical the creators weave in a handful of catchy songs that nestle comfortably in the ear and push the plot forward a rare combo in most cartoons these days. The voice cast is just fine with Helms Once-ler traveling smoothly from protagonist to antagonist and back again. (A little of DeVitos hectoring Lorax goes a long way and the film wisely doles him out in small doses.) Conservative commentators like Lou Dobbs are absolutely right when they say that ""The Lorax"" preaches in favor of the environment and against corporatism and waste and the destruction of the atmosphere. Parents who find that to be a message thats somehow dangerous have every right not to go but those Grinches out of their terror of tree-hugging propaganda will miss a real treat.

It has a similar blend of humor bouncy silliness and sweetness.And it remains faithful to the spirit of Seuss. The pro-conservation anti-consumerist message of the book is heartily intact. And like the Seuss story the film never resorts to sermonizing.STORY The Lorax protects Dr. Seuss animated environmentMORE Lorax voice cast speaks for the trees in their lives The actors who lend their voices to the characters are an inspired choice particularly Danny DeVito as the Lorax and Rob Riggle as archvillain Mr. OHare. The latter is a diminutive helmet-haired dictator who controls the town of Thneedville by polluting it with his factories and then collecting huge sums selling fresh air to its citizenry. His motto ""The more smog in the sky the more people will buy.Disappointingly Seuss trademark lilting language and clever rhymes are only sporadically integrated into the story. The film does add pleasantly loopy if rather forgettable songs.About the movieDr. Seuss The Lorax out of fourStars Zac Efron Danny DeVitoEd Helms Betty White Taylor Swift Director Chris Renaud Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for brief mild language Running time 1 hour 35 minutes Opens today nationwideTwelve-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) lives in the town which has been given a colorful stylized plastic look that brings to mind Disneylands Toontown. Ted has a crush on the artistic Audrey (Taylor Swift) who paints murals filled with forest scenes. Her greatest wish is to see a real tree because their town is filled with only the artificial arboreal variety such as Oak-a-matics.To find an actual tree Teds Grammy Norma (Betty White) nudges him in the direction of the Once-ler (Ed Helms) and ultimately the Lorax the savvy wisecracking orange character who seeks to protect the natural world.Ted bravely ventures beyond Thneedville and his circuitous trip brings the 3-D elements of the film into exciting play.The Once-ler lives in remote isolation and spins a yarn of a paradise rich in colorful flora and adorable fauna rushing streams and groves of furry lollipop-style Truffula trees. In his youth eager to make something of himself the Once-ler transformed the Truffula trees tufted fluff into scarves called ""Thneeds"" that became a fad. With abandon he chopped down all the trees to fashion his products ignoring the appeals and warnings of the Lorax. Soon all that was left was a barren wasteland. This tales ecological message like that of the book is aimed directly at young audiences. And the writers wisely incorporate Seuss essential plea ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothings going to get better. Its not.""Anyone older than 10 can discern that herein lies a parable of green vs. greed. All ages are likely to find the cautionary tale entertaining as well as illuminating. Some might even find it galvanizing. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs. To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Sundays Academy Awards might have left the false impression that movie song-craft is dead. For bureaucratic reasons there were only two nominees neither of which was featured during the show. Both were from so-called family movies - ""Rio and ""The Muppets - and in different ways they were clever approaches to the musical number. ""The Lorax has a show-stopper thats just as good and in some ways better.The movie itself is a new faintly faithful version of Theodor ""Dr. Seuss Geisels 41-year-old ecological cautionary tale. Its been animated by the same company that made ""Despicable Me which is to say you dont know whether to watch ""The Lorax or lick it.The song is a rock number called ""How Bad Could I Be? and it would have been high on the pop charts any time between 1988 and 1998. It sounds like something Roger Daltrey might have written for Head Start. At just about the halfway point it arrives and deepens the movies tone. A pleasing tale about a boy (with Zac Efrons voice) who sneaks out of his entirely plastic town to fetch a real tree for the willow of a girl (Taylor Swift) he loves transforms into a darker nightmare of modern industrialization. The song is full of gospel accents warped voices hints of Darwinism and uses the word ""biggering.The singer is a character called the Once-ler. In flashbacks hes a sort of young Oakie whose invention - a multiuse garment called a Thneed - causes hysterical demand which causes the Once-ler (Ed Helms) to break his promise not to harm the forest he shares with cuddly bears goosey fowl and amphibious goldfish. The vision of dystopia this number conjures feels defiantly grim for a movie where the trees look as they do in the book like freshly spun cotton candy. Written by John Powell Cinco Paul and Kool Kojak it also brings out the books doomy undercurrent and has more layers and complexity than the movie around it. If I had a hard time sleeping I dont envy some parents.The other numbers are good too. They have wit and bite and at least once Auto-Tune. ""The Lorax has never been regarded as highly as The Cat in the Hat or ""Green Eggs and Ham and one assumes thats to do with Dr. Seusss concern for a cause other than reading. It was a parable that in becoming a film has been literalized and commercialized. I dont recall seeing the face of the Once-ler in the book. As a figure of industry he didnt need one really. He was everywhere. The Lorax  meanwhile was the keeper of the forest this little orange creature with tremendous flaxen facial hair - a little bit walrus a little bit wood nymph.For the film hes got Danny DeVitos voice and is rendered very much beside the point (even though hes starring in all the movies decidedly anti-Lorax tie-ins for everything from a Mazda SUV to disposable diapers). After explaining how the Once-ler won then lost his empire and is currently living out a curse the Lorax levied the movie turns into a chase adventure in which the boy whos now named Ted presumably after Geisel races to plant the last tree seed before hes stopped by the synthetic towns tiny mayor OHare (Rob Riggle) which must be a pun on the black pageboy that curtains his face. (The hair clippers could only be set on ""Korean dictator.) In other nonsense Teds grandmother (Betty White) gets to perform X-Games tricks.Cinco Paul wrote ""The Lorax with Ken Daurio (the directors are Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda; and the movies available inessentially in 3-D). Paul and Daurio also did 2008s just-serviceable ""Horton Hears a Who Their deviations from this book dont stray terribly far from its spirit. Despite some schmaltz and pandering this is a still a nifty feat of protest whose activism now comes mostly from songs. ""Let It Grow insists the climactic town-wide number. Whether theyre singing about the environment or the mayors hair you definitely want to do something to help. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

Then We Need to Talk About Kevin (B) Dr. Seuss died in 1991 saving him from the gaudy big-screen abominations of How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) and Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat (2003). These werent just bad movies; they were hyperkinetic nuisances antithetical to the wise economy of the good Doctor.Now after a passable Horton Hears a Who (2008) Dr. Seuss The Lorax gets a shot. If the results arent sublime theyre hardly embarrassing.Directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda two of the minds behind Despicable Me this animated environmentalist parable is too busy for its own good (gotta keep the little ones engaged) and a little overstuffed with story. But the design is witty and imaginative and the small grace notes are enough to keep an open-minded adult giggling.The Lorax also happens to have something on its mind If Fox News objected to the menace of The Muppets this bit of tree huggery might give someone a conniption.The story unfolds in the town of Thneedville filled by imitation shrubbery and bottled air (sadly no use of the Radiohead song ""Fake Plastic Trees""). A flashback shows how a misguided entrepreneur wiped out plant life years previous over the protests of a mustachioed forest guardian called the Lorax (Danny DeVito). Now pollution fills the air and a ruthless pint-size tycoon (voiced by Rob Riggle) lords over an artificial empire.What could possibly transform this dire state? Love of course. Young Ted (Zac Efron) has a thing for young Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey wants a tree. So Ted is determined to find one.Like Despicable Me The Lorax shows a fascination with gizmos elaborate mechanisms and twisty action sequences. We get a highflying granny (voiced of course by Betty White) and a trio of singing goldfish that made me smile with every appearance. Its all pleasant enough if a bit stretched at 94 minutes.The Lorax was first published in 1971 one year after the creation of Earth Day in the thick of the modern environmental movement. The movie arrives amid concerns over climate change. But Dr. Seuss was always attuned to social and political issues -- as a young political cartoonist he inveighed against fascism -- and he stayed engaged through his more famous work. In other words it was little surprise to find him speaking via the Lorax for the trees.DR. SEUSS THE LORAXB Directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda. Rated PG (brief mild language). 94 mins.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Did you ever get a package where the bubble wrap was 10 times the volume of the item inside? Thats what ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" is like. Oddly for a message film about conservation the bulk of the movie is inert filler. The simple charm that makes Seuss magical is crushed beneath the stuffing. This reboot is a far cry from 1972s fondly remembered TV movie ""The Lorax."" That version was a tight 24-minute charmer scripted by the good doctor Theodor Geisel himself. The first ""Lorax"" was clear compelling and quirky making its point about self-defeating greed and environmental stewardship with minimal fuss. It will supply your quota of silly rhymes nonsense phrases tree-huggery and visual pizazz without overstaying its welcome. But for Hollywood enough is rarely enough. ""Despicable Me"" co-directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda inflate this modest parable to 94 minutes with irrelevant sidebars about young love and Ringling Brothers action sequences bloating the story without advancing it. The action is set in Thneedville ""a city they say that was plastic and fake"" much like the surrounding film. The residents drive bulging SUVs and inflate plastic foliage in their front yards. In this candy-colored dystopia bottled fresh air is sold by the grasping tycoon OHare (Rob Riggle). Everyone accepts this unnatural existence until 12-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) vows to locate a real living tree to impress cute neighbor Audrey (Taylor Swift). The reclusive Once-ler (Ed Helms) agrees to help him but not right away. Whenever the narrative pace threatens to pick up the Once-ler flies into action delivering reams of needless back story. After punishing delays he confesses he clear-cut the forest to make ""thneeds"" ugly multipurpose shirt/sock/glove/hats that ""everyone needs."" Universal Pictures ""The Lorax"" Enter the Lorax (Danny DeVito) natures defender who argues that no one needs thneeds. Why golly thneeds are a lot like 3-D glasses sold at a stiff upcharge arent they? Viewers who want to honor Dr. Seuss warning about conserving resources can leave the car in the garage and show their children the original ""Lorax."" It is viewable on the Internet free of charge. So skip the new movie. Enjoy the old one and use your extra hour of freedom for some parent and child face-time instead. As the storys coda reminds us ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot / Nothing is going to get better ... / Its not.""

Dr. Seuss The Lorax Good Directors Chris Renaud Kyle Balda. Cast Zac Efron Taylor Swift Danny DeVito. Rating PG for brief mild language. This weeks new movie releases Animated movies And in a way it is. The movie and its fans should celebrate that. Certainly its preferable to being like Mr. OHare (voice of Rob Riggle) dancing and singing ""Let it die/let it die/let it shrivel up and die"" to the last tree seed in existence. The film directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda adds several characters to the original story -- and a few boffo song-and-dance numbers as well. It is true that the chopping down of a tree and then the destruction of a forest solely for greed is treated as a crime. But isnt it? This version of the story begins in Thneedville where everything is perfect as far as its residents know. Except for this There are no trees which means the air quality is poor. But Mr. OHare has figured out a way to sell clean air and has become a rich man in the process. Living in Thneedville is Ted (Zac Efron) a 12-year-old boy who has fallen head over heels for an older woman -- Audrey (Taylor Swift) a high-school girl. One day she shows him a mural shes painted filled with depictions of the extinct Truffula tree. If someone could find her a real tree she says shed probably marry him on the spot. Thats all the inspiration a 12-year-old boy needs to do just about anything. The trouble is there havent been any trees anywhere for years. So he asks his mom (Jenny Slate) and spunky grandmother (Betty White doing an animated version of her practically patented Betty White thing) for help. His moms no help but his grandmother tells him he has to find the Once-ler a possibly mythical creature supposedly living outside the high walls of Thneedville. So off Ted goes and he actually finds the Once-ler (Ed Helms really good) who tells him the story of what happened to the trees. Its a long tale and will take a few visits to tell (or maybe hes just lonely). But once Mr. OHare catches wind of Teds interest in real trees he sees a threat one he has to stamp out. All of this is a framing device for the story told in the book of how the Once-lers greed led to his chopping down Truffula trees to create the Thneed a sort of do-anything scarflike invention. This leads to a visit from the Lorax (Danny DeVito) who speaks for the trees (love that phrase) and warns the Once-ler of the effects his clear-cutting will have on nature. When the Once-ler chops down his first tree the Lorax and the animals living in the forest conduct a quasi-funeral. And somewhere a Fox News commentators head explodes. The Once-ler offers Ted a chance to bring the trees back a chance at which given his feelings for Audrey Ted jumps. But Mr. OHare has no intentions of letting that happen. Thus a series of chase scenes enhanced by some pretty terrific 3-D effects follows. There is no denying that the environmental message is heavy-handed -- one of the songs is called ""I Love Nature"" -- as is the depiction of the evils of overindustrialization. If you are worried that this will lead to your children growing up to be long-haired tree-huggers I dont know I suppose the possibility exists. But its more likely theyll simply walk away from a really fun movie singing along with ""Let It Grow"" and ""Thneedville"" and if they recycle their 3-D glasses on the way out of the theater whats the harm?

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday July 3 2012 1207 AM Title Dr. Seuss The Lorax Film Info With the voices of Zac Efron Taylor Swift Danny DeVito. 3-D animated eco-tale based on Dr. Seuss kids book. Directors Chris Renaud Kyle Balad (126). PG Mild scares and language. At area theaters. ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" a charmingly animated family film based on the beloved childrens book presents us with two beautiful fantasies. The first is the story itself in which the Lorax a forest imp who ""speaks for the trees"" helps a disconnected society learn to appreciate its fragile eco-system. The second fantasy lies in the potential a movie like this can make an impact on its audience and inspire children and adults alike to live a more meaningful less materialistic existence. As Dr. Seuss (aka Theodor Geisel) described it the story is both ""anti-pollution and anti-greed."" Have I mentioned yet that the studio has licensed the Lorax to promote dozens of corporate products -- including an SUV? Alas not even Dr. Seuss can change Hollywood which bears an uncomfortably ironic resemblance to this films fictional Thneedville ""A city they say that was plastic and fake and they liked it that way."" Our hero 12-year-old Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) doesnt care that his shiny town is entirely manufactured. But when his crush Audrey (Taylor Swift) wishes she could see just one living tree his grandma (Betty White) sends him to meet the Once-ler (Ed Helms). Now a miserable old hermit the Once-ler confesses his terrible tale Way back when Thneedville was filled with adorable animals flowing rivers and gorgeous Truffula trees protected by the Lorax (Danny DeVito). Determined to make a success of himself the Once-ler ignored the Loraxs pleas and cut down all the trees built smog-inducing factories and manufactured useless items called Thneeds. He made a fortune in other words and destroyed everything truly valuable in the process. RELATED FOX BUSINESS BASHES THE LORAXS MESSAGE In the sprightly spirit of 2008s ""Horton Hears a Who"" which this movie strongly resembles Geisels book serves as a rather loose inspiration for an expanded adventure. Though we lose too much of his voice the filmmakers who worked on ""Horton"" as well as ""Despicable Me"" deftly balance entertainment with education. While softening Geisels darker themes they still meld a valuable message into catchy songs bright images (nicely done in 3D) and funny characters. Even adults are likely to walk out wondering how our own society has strayed so far from any sensible path ... before hopping into their Lorax-approved Mazda and heading to IHOP for some Truffula Chip pancakes. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Dr. Seuss The Lorax - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Lorax gets the look right but Dr. Seuss books heart gets short shrift  Dr. Seuss The Lorax From the creators of Despicable Me and the imagination of Dr. Seuss comes the much anticipated feature Dr. Seuss The Lorax From the creators of Despicable Me and the imagination of Dr. Seuss comes the much anticipated feature Dr. Seuss The Lorax Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The new animated feature ""The Lorax""known in its entirety as ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" to keep it straight from ""John Grishams The Lorax"" does a few smaller things right but the bigger things not quite. Ive come to fear these movies. I love Seuss so much even his second-shelf works. Who doesnt feel protective of authors and illustrators they love? And not just because we were young when we made their acquaintance.As with ""Horton Hears a Who"" four years ago the production design and computer-generated animation in this new ""Lorax"" respect the basic lines of Theodor Seuss Geisels illustrations his voluptuously curvy universe of serious whimsy. Both the ""Horton"" and ""Lorax"" films work better certainly than the live-action Seuss pictures ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and the seriously not-good ""Cat in the Hat."" ""The Lorax"" is a little more like it. A little. But you couldnt accuse the film of practicing what it preaches careful stewardship of a precious resource.The message tends to get lost in all the clanging slapstick and ""WallE"" imagery. ""WallE"" had the courage of its convictions as well as beauty and artistry; ""The Lorax"" is just another OK feature-length animated edition (in 3-D if you choose to pay for it) of a Dr. Seuss book. The filmmakers headed by director Chris Renaud and screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul all of ""Despicable Me"" regard the 1971 Seuss books pro-environmentalist entreaties seriously in theory not so much in practice. Cooked-up elements include a corporate megalomaniac villain and a pair of nominally sympathetic young humans. The Lorax in ""The Lorax"" the guardian of the trees voiced dully by Danny DeVito is even more secondary than he was in the book.In this version of Thneedville no living thing grows Trees and shrubs are inflatable plastic the town is maintained with ""Truman Show""-like fakery and the apparent mayor of the town Mr. OHare (Rob Riggle) has made his millions selling bottled air. Young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) is eager to impress the teenage Audrey (Taylor Swift) so he seeks out the faraway Once-ler (Ed Helms) who holds the secret to what Audrey wants most a living tree a reminder of better greener days.Most of the picture as did the book unfolds as a flashback to the Once-lers rabid capitalistic youth when he harvested the precious Truffula tree for its velvety tufts and commercial prospects. Taking its cue from a single line in the original about the Once-lers family ""The Lorax"" brings in a venal hick crowd straight out of""Million Dollar Baby""to underscore the moral about greed being bad. The young Once-ler doesnt question his own business goals and cant see the forest of his misjudgments for all the trees hes leveling.A good deal of this comes from the original slim volume by Seuss. By the time the good doctor published his warning about despoiling our planet willy-nilly (cue the Fox News objections) his adopted home base La Jolla Calif. had become a swank coastal holdout to the schmutzy LA smog a two-hour drive north. Every book comes from somewhere; Seuss Im guessing came from his concern over the threatened devaluation of paradise Southern California style. The book unusually blunt and even humorless for Seuss has become a conflicted diversionary tactic on screen. Its makers were plainly nervous about selling the message. And so they gussy it up with lots of vehicular chase sequences and musical numbers of uneven quality and after a while you long for another trip to see the Once-ler just because hes a loner and you could use the break. ""The Lorax"" comes back around by the end to where it needs to be i.e. in Seuss corner. But theres a lyric about life in Thneedville painting the place as ""plastic and fake and they liked it that way"" And its too close to the movies truth for actual moviegoing comfort.mjphillipstribune.comThe Lorax -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG (for brief mild language)Running time 134Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Dr. Seuss The Lorax (movie) Entertainment Movies Ken Daurio Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who (movie) PG Rated Movies 10 best movies of 2011 Oscars 2012 red carpet pictures Dr. Seuss The Lorax Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0228-lorax-20120301,0,6747864.column",200,dr.seuss'thelorax24,dr.seuss'thelorax,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Whenever filmmakers set out to turn Dr. Seuss picture books into full-length features the same question always arises ""How do you expand a 10-minute read into a 90-minute movie?"" Unfortunately the answer is always the same filler and lots of it. Like Fox Animations 2008 Horton Hears A Who Illumination Entertainments musical feature The Lorax helmed by Despicable Me co-director Chris Renaud and feature first-timer Kyle Balda keeps that filler mild and simplistic. Neither adaptation reaches for the over-the-top crudities and garishness of the live-action The Cat In The Hat or How The Grinch Stole Christmas but the blandness of the new material in both cases just highlights how unnecessary it is to the story. In particular The Lorax packs all its crucial action into a few key scenes further exacerbating the feeling that the movie could easily be chopped down into a half-hour TV special much like the 1972 Seuss-scripted animated adaptation of the same book. The core idea is the same A shadowy hermit called The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) lives alone in a polluted barren landscape he created by selfishly exploiting the environment. When a boy comes to hear his history he explains how his greed ruined his world and what might still be done about it. The movie version largely focuses on that boy Ted (Zac Efron) who seeks out The Once-ler to impress his crush object Audrey (Taylor Swift). In the films best conceit Ted comes from a walled city nearby where the inhabitants oblivious to the wreckage outside love their battery-operated trees inflatable bushes and bottled fresh air and proclaim--in a joyous catchy opening number--that theyre perfectly happy not knowing where all the trash and runoff goes. But leaving the city puts Ted athwart bottled-air mogul Aloysius OHare (Rob Riggle) a dead ringer for a sex-changed Edna Mode from The Incredibles. Meanwhile half the film exists in a flashback to The Once-lers past when he was a chipper youngn blithely cutting down trees and facing off with the eponymous tree-spokesman the Lorax (Danny DeVito). Teds conflict with OHare mostly provides an excuse for plenty of first-person console-videogame-style POV chase sequences a redoubling of the original books messages about the dangers of untrammeled greed and some comedy involving Teds grandma (Betty White). But its all featherweight noodling compared to the evocative part of the story the Once-lers moral clash with the Lorax and his transformation from a good-natured go-getter to a ruthless profitmonger. Unfortunately the film lingers at great length on goofery involving the Lorax and his animal pals then crams the moral turnaround and the worlds destruction into a quick musical number. In Seuss book the Lorax has a frustrated pathos and the story focuses on his pleas on natures behalf as its destroyed around him; here hes a neutered punchline in a series of height gags. The films design is beautiful from the softer-than-silk truffula trees to Teds gaudy plastic hometown. The handful of songs are catchy and the whole film feels pleasantly airy. But this is a dark story with a heavy message and its been transformed into a harmless pretty confection. In defanging it for comic effect the filmmakers have done Seuss as much of a disrespectful disservice as if theyd laid on the fart gags.

The late Theodor Geisels uneven cinematic track record gets neither better nor worse with Universals bigscreen adaptation of ""The Lorax."" A bright bouncy candy-colored take on Dr. Seuss glum environmental fable this latest CG-animated effort from the writers of ""Horton Hears a Who"" has its share of eye-popping amusements but its wobbly pacing and routine kidpic elements make for an experience that feels not just tiresome and rudderless but antithetical to the Seuss spirit. Still targeted family audiences are likely to respond favorably spelling returns in line with ""Horton"" as well as the filmmakers even bigger recent hit ""Despicable Me."" Its release timed to coincide with what would have been Geisels 108th birthday ""The Lorax"" also happens to be arriving smack in the middle of election season fittingly enough for a story whose despairing message about mans impact on the environment stirred controversy even upon the books 1971 publication. Certainly the film has scored no shortage of green-friendly merchandising tie-ins (look for Lorax-approved laundry detergent at a store near you) though as far as artistry goes the result is closer to ""FernGully The Last Rainforest"" on the eco-friendly toon scale than to Hayao Miyazaki or ""Wall-E."" Just as the classic half-hour TV specials of ""The Cat in the Hat"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" rendered the live-action feature versions of those beloved Seuss properties wholly unnecessary so the excellent 1972 short-toon version of ""The Lorax"" feels like a model of elegant form and wry wit next to this overlong effort. The story -- Geisels personal favorite according to his widow Audrey -- is essentially the same In a gray desolate wasteland a reclusive figure known as the Once-ler (voiced here by Ed Helms) bemoans the fact that years ago as a young and ambitious entrepreneur he chopped down all the regions beautiful Truffula Trees to the chagrin of the portly mustachioed nature guardian called the Lorax (Danny DeVito in fine form). In order to stretch this parable to the requisite feature length scribes Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio have created an extended framing device set in the nearby town of Thneedville a gleaming postcard-perfect dystopia where nothing organic grows everything is made of plastic and a nasty Napoleonic tyrant (Rob Riggle) controls the fresh-air supply. Determined to find a real live tree as a present for a girl(Taylor Swift) he likes plucky young Ted (Zac Efron) sneaks out of town and pays a visit to the Once-ler now permanently locked away in his ramshackle abode. Though hostile at first the Once-ler proceeds to tell Ted his story in flashback how he razed the forest in order to knit thousands of scarf-like products called Thneeds and how the Lorax who speaks for the trees tried in vain to appeal to his reason and conscience. As directed by Chris Renaud (who guided ""Despicable Me"" from Paul and Daurios script) and co-helmer Kyle Balda the film offers a visually rich elaboration of Seuss hand-drawn world. Before the Once-lers arrival the Loraxs domain is an Edenic paradise all rolling green hills and crystal-clear lakes populated by cute critters such as the aptly named Humming-Fish and the bearlike Bar-ba-loots which perform roughly the same sight-gag functions here that the Minions did in ""Despicable Me."" These endangered environs are rendered in lush enough fashion to add some oomph to the unmistakably didactic kid-empowering thrust of the story. (""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothings going to get better. Its not."") Yet the key to Seuss tales as with all good fables is not only their cleverness but their surpassing elegance and simplicity qualities that this busy over-cluttered contraption of a movie seems entirely uninterested in replicating. On the contrary nearly every scripting decision seems intended to squeeze ""The Lorax"" into the uninspired-gabfest mold of so much contempo studio animation governed by the sort of second-rate wisecrackery and literal-minded story logic that have no place in Seuss universe. The book wittily limited the readers view of the Once-ler to his arms and hands emphasizing his insatiable greed; the film not only presents him as a tall strapping young man but gives him a super-annoying dysfunctional family the better to explain his hangups and generate sympathy. Wacky supporting characters abound from Riggles loud-mouthed bad guy to a wisecracking granny on skis whos in the movie for no other reason than to give Betty White a typically adorable thesping opportunity. The 3D element lends a particularly luscious tactile quality to the Truffula Trees whose orange pink and purple blossoms resemble nothing so much as gigantic cotton-candy bursts; otherwise the finely tuned visuals gain little from the stereoscopic treatment. Songs by composer John Powell and co-scribe Paul are genial and loopy enough to give the film something of a Seussical sensibility.

For its Blade Runner--like smogscapes alone this retelling of the nightmare (well-anchored by Ed Helmss ""Once-ler"" a likably ambitious young man with a guitar) comes close to recommendable. Down go the Truffula trees out pops Danny DeVitos pissed-off woodland spirit and suddenly youre watching a cautionary tale that no number of ancillary Lorax toys is going to dispel. (Geisel himself was aware of the irony of his popular book requiring forests to publish.)Unfortunately a new problem rears its head It seems no young audience member can be trusted to enjoy a thoughtful story without a heroic borderline-obnoxious surrogate (here hes voiced by Zac Efron) zooming around on a scooter bonking villainous heads and saving the day. Blame the trend on Home Alone but few modern-day directors are impervious to it not even Martin Scorsese and the non-Mlis parts of Hugo. The point of The Lorax isnt to see that preserved Truffula seed planted and Taylor Swifts lust object smooched. Its to inspire audiences to act out of fear. And we havent earned this happy ending.

Daily Edition Login to download The Lorax Film Review 1000 AM PST 2/29/2012 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment Green trumps greed in this pleasant spirited take on the Seussian save-the-planet fable. TWITTER The 3D adaptation of Dr. Seuss classic tale stars Danny DeVito Zac Efron and Taylor Swift. Respectfully sticking to the adaptation template set by 2008s Horton Hears a Who the creative team behind Despicable Me has turned Theodor Geisels 1971 cautionary eco-tale Dr. Seuss The Lorax into the most satisfyingly Seussian big-screen effort to date. Armed with a splendid voice cast and a gorgeously rendered 3D-CG landscape the film entertains while delivering its pro-environmental anti-greed message wrapped in a bright package of primary colors that truly pop. PHOTOS Award Season Roundtable Series -- Animation Universal Pictures should see no shortage of green when the Illumination Entertainment production opens March 2 packing an all-ages appeal that should sustain it well into spring break. Zac Efron brings a youthful wholesomeness to the role of Ted the idealistic 12-year-old whose ecological consciousness springs to life courtesy of his crush on his slightly older and more enlightened neighbor Audrey (agreeably voiced by Taylor Swift). (The character names served as a sweet shout-out by Ted Geisel to his wife Audrey CEO of Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Lorax executive producer.) Determined to win her affection Ted sets his sights beyond the plastic walls of the pre-fabricated town of Thneedville in search of the legendary Truffula Tree with a little guidance from his spirited Grammy Norma (terrific as usual Betty White). His trek takes him to the foreboding isolated home of The Once-ler (Ed Helms) a recluse who ultimately shares his tale of Thneed-fed greed having stripped the entire Truffula Valley of its candy-colored vegetation despite the attempted intervention of the trees guardian an orange sprite with a yellow Rip Taylor stache called The Lorax (an ideal Danny DeVito). Having previously blended the irreverent and the touching to rewarding effect in Despicable Me director Chris Renaud and writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (the pair previously got their Seuss on with Horton Hears a Who) prove to be the right team for the job at hand. It all zips along pleasantly elevated by those vividly pastoral visuals and that on-the-money voice cast which also includes Rob Riggle as the villainous Aloysius OHare a pint-sized heavy who has made his fortune selling bottled fresh air to the people of Thneedville with his factories further polluting the atmosphere in the process. Speaking of fresh while the Dr. Seuss book was certainly ahead of its time the film occasionally feels less so. While the OHare character is somewhat reminiscent of Edna Mode in Pixars The Incredibles Thneedvilles visual and thematic cues are similarly evocative of the twin worlds of WALL-E. Meanwhile the original songs contributed by Paul and score composer John Powell are obviously going for a rock musical vibe but dont quite hit the desired chord. Thats especially true of the ironic closing title number ""Let It Grow"" (Celebrate the World) performed by Ester Dean which given the films organic message might have opted for a less-auto-tuned more unplugged rendition.

"Lorax The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lorax-the ) Lorax The (United States 2012) February 29 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues."" Considering the brevity of the average Dr. Seuss book its no surprise that many of his best-known stories have been satisfactorily adapted into half-hour TV specials. Expanding them into feature length movies (whether live-action or animated) requires a lot of stretching and padding. The Lorax while generally faithful to the content and intent of Dr. Seuss original work has required significant embellishment to bring it to the screen. Action scenes have been added to keep the interest of short viewers with shorter attention spans extraneous subplots have been added to increase the already brief running length and the ending has changed to offer more optimism. The result is solidly entertaining - not quite as good as Horton Hears a Who or How the Grinch Stole Christmas - but unquestionably better than The Cat in the Hat. I now await Green Eggs and Ham and the Further Adventures of Sam I Am. The Lorax follows the structure of the book by having the majority of the story related in flashback. It also retains the strong anti-business pro-environment themes which have created controversy over the years. The movie opens in the city of Thneedville where 12-year old Ted (voice of Zac Efron) decides that the best way to win the heart of his crush Audrey (Taylor Swift) is to find a way to fulfill her greatest desire. Aside from the people Thneedville is entirely artificial with plastic plants and fake grass. The air is so polluted that people purchase containers of fresh air to breathe. Audrey wants nothing more than to see a Truffula tree - the extinct plant species that once populated the land in and around Thneedville. To learn what happened to the trees and discover how one might be found Ted must leave the safety of the city and venture into the bleak countryside beyond in search of The Once-ler (Ed Helms). From this mysterious being Ted learns the story of how The Once-lers greed led to the destruction of the Truffula forest and why The Lorax (Danny DeVito) the gruff being who ""speaks for the trees"" decided to depart. Teds trips outside the city are noticed by Mr. OHare (Rob Riggle) the tycoon who sells fresh air and whose business depends on a tree-less environment. OHare makes it clear to Ted that visits to The Once-ler will not be tolerated - warnings that Ted ignores. Perhaps because animated features have been in a recent slump The Lorax feels like cut above. The Dr. Seuss moniker is a recognized trademark and indicator of quality so it should do well at the box office. The 3-D version offers little beside a few token instances of things being thrown in the audiences direction to justify the additional cost. Adults and children alike will derive equal enjoyment from the 2-D iteration. Likewise IMAX is an overkill. The Lorax is cheery and colorful and boasts some impressive computer-generated artwork but theres nothing to identify it as an ideal candidate for a big screen with a bigger sound system. The Lorax looks and feels like the offspring of old-school Dr. Seuss and newfangled technology. Some of the dialogue - even that not taken from the book - rhymes. The Truffula trees with their colorful silky tops and The Lorax with his orange color and big mustache resemble the illustrations in the book as brought to life by computer-assisted animators. Straight lines are few and far between. The songs while not especially memorable (its doubtful anyone will be humming them on the way home in the car) are Suessified. It comes as no surprise to learn that Dr. Seuss widow Audrey is an executive producer. The Lorax transfers the books strong environmental themes showing how the systematic destruction of the environment and consumption of limited natural resources can have desultory impacts on the quality of life. The anti-big business bias of the story is enhanced on screen with the Mr. OHare subplot. Although the concept of ""clean air"" being bought and sold may seem absurd the same thing might have been said about water 40 years ago. As one character remarks ""If you put it in a plastic bottle people will buy it."" Some of this material will go over the heads of younger viewers; the river-bed rapids ride and various other ""action"" scenes are aimed at them. And the points about conservation will reach audience members young and old. The ensemble casts voice acting has a pleasantly anonymous quality to it - even Danny DeVitos familiar pipes dont stand out. DeVitos ""loveable grouch"" is the precise quality needed for The Lorax. Although Taylor Swift has one of the most recognizable voices in music today she does little (if any) singing and theres nothing in her spoken interpretation of Audrey that calls undue attention. (The part was written into the movie; Audrey does not appear in the book.) The Lorax is at its weakest when it strays from the book and the need to embellish is at times so strong that the storyline meanders. The scenes with Mr. OHare seemed tacked-on and unnecessary (which they are). The character is neither sufficiently amusing nor menacing enough to warrant the amount of screen time accorded to his plots and antics. On the whole however fans of the book will more than likely be pleased with this extended interpretation. Children should enjoy the experience while the adults accompanying them wont wish they were elsewhere.
