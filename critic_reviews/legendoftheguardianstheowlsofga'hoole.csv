E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Guard is little more than a salt-and-pepper cop yarn transposed to the middle of nowhere Ireland. It has a wickedly smart script that keeps you on your toes though and it has from Brendan Gleeson a star performance of cruelly funny mastery. The movie is more pure profane enjoyment than a body should have in the dog days of August and when its over it evaporates leaving only the acrid smoke of its dialogue and the memory of Gleeson reducing lesser mortals to cinders.He plays Connemara police sergeant Gerry Boyle more or less the whole department until hes stuck with an earnest young recruit named Aidan (Rory Keenan) early in the going. Were up in Gaelic country so the cop cars and uniforms say GARDA and very little surprises the local constabulary. ""The Guard opens with a horrific car crash that barely disturbs Boyles afternoon nap and pretty soon hes up to his thick neck in a complicated plot involving drug smugglers corrupt detectives a comely Croatian widow and two happy hookers dressed as police ladies.And Don Cheadle as Wendell Everett an American FBI agent on the trail of the smugglers. No there isnt any reason for him to be here other than as an increasingly amused foil to the hero. The Irish cops know that a fellow like Boyle smarter than any three of them put together but generally his own worst enemy is best marginalized. Wendell by contrast is fascinated. ""I cant tell if youre really [expletive] dumb or really [expletive] smart he marvels after Gerry has informed him that the only place in America he has visited is Disney World - by himself.""The Guard is built from the bones of all those great old Raymond Chandler crime novels that got turned into great old Humphrey Bogart movies A lone honest man taking on the tarnished wheels of justice etc. etc. The skin on those bones comes from Tarantino sometimes too obviously. When the three smugglers - an engagingly lethal crew played by Liam Cunningham David Wilmot and Mark Strong - start arguing over their favorite philosophers during a getaway you know someone has seen ""Pulp Fiction a few dozen too many times.That fallen archness extends to the soundtrack choices impeccably retro in their own right (Chet Baker ""Ode to Billie Joe some original spaghetti-western stylings by the US rock group Calexico) but a tad oppressive in their cumulative hipness. If you stand far enough back from ""The Guard you can easily see all the pieces bolting the thing together.The man doing the bolting is John Michael McDonagh whose better-known brother executive producer Martin McDonagh has written plays (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore ""The Pillowman) and written and directed one feature film (2008s ""In Bruges) that taken together have positioned him as one of the sharper saviors of Irish letters. ""In Bruges also starred Gleeson but had a friskier sense of invention and a much broader emotional range. ""The Guard in comparison is thinner stuff although shot with an eye for rich unexpected colors by Larry Smith.So why does the movie send you out happier than you have any right to be? Why am I gladly grading it on the curve? For the character of Gerry Boyle for the way he speaks and for Gleesons unholy inhabiting of the role. Although hed never admit it the Sergeant is well-read maybe even an intellectual and hes good to his dying mum (Fionnula Flanagan; Gleeson towers over her like Kong over Fay Wray). He also has his pleasures both carnal and pharmaceutical and he doesnt much care who knows it. If the Bad Lieutenant converted to Buddhism he might look a little like this.Gerry also knows that whatever the people in charge do the results will be infinitely worse. Whether that exhausted pessimism is part of the Irish national character or part of the Irish national stereotype is immaterial; Gleeson turns it into an oddly liberating lifestyle choice freeing the cop to act as he pleases even morally. Is ""The Guard really [expletive] dumb or really [expletive] smart? Youll be having too good a time to care.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr.

County Galway is his beat and his partner is Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) a by-the-book G-man matriculated from the finest American universities and sent to Ireland to bust some big-time drug traffickers. Gleeson has made a career blending seamlessly into ensembles as well as tackling standout supporting parts in movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""Gangs of New York."" He can play working-class or sophisticate with equal dexterity but hes never more convincing than when hes in his home country of Ireland as in John Boormans superb ""The General"" or here in ""The Guard."" Gleeson makes Boyle both lovable and repellent. Always up for a good time on either side of the law he knows human nature and the difference between transgression and malevolence. Does that make him a bad cop? Hes practically a saint compared to the rest of the force each of them paid to look the other way. Cheadles Agent Everett just wants to wrap up the case and go home to his family. He remains blithely unfazed no matter how much Boyle needles him with racist jokes and general boorishness. First time writer-director John Michael McDonagh conjures two vivid and distinct characters each of them adroitly complementing the other. Cheadle plays it smart and steady but always a bit irritable whereas Gleeson is smart and sloppy with a comical bent. They are a misshapen pair in style and countenance but theyre stuck with one another when they discover theyre the only ones left who havent been bribed. McDonagh is the brother of Martin McDonagh whose directorial debut ""In Bruges"" starred Gleeson as a reluctant hit man. And while Martin has gained international acclaim as a filmmaker and as one of this generations leading playwrights brother John shows promise but is not yet on the same plain. The brothers exhibit similar writing styles and a fondness for the same kinds of characters and locations but Johns uneasy grasp of the medium shows in the films perfunctory editing as well as its under-lit grainy photography. Sedentary framing and sluggish pacing hampers the climactic shootout but the movies unpredictable story line and vivid characters easily carry the day making such amateur errors forgivable. Even with its flaws ""The Guard"" marks a killer directorial debut for McDonagh. Entertaining funny profane and unpredictable his movie reminds us that some crime fighters dont need a cape -- just a pint of ale and a pair of brass balls. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Based on novels by Kathryn Lasky Legend of the Guardians adopts a standard fantasy-quest structure - bookish kid leaves home battles baddies learns lessons - the only difference being that in this case everyone is an owl.Jim Sturgess is the voice of Soren the heroic young barn owl kidnapped by evil queen Helen Mirren and her marauding band of pseudo-Nazi night-hunters the Pure Ones. But its not long before Soren flies the coop assembling a motley band of helpers and heading across the ocean in search of GaHoole home of the mythical Guardians. Theres too much story for 97 minutes leaving much of the film feeling rushed and confusing. The script is overfamiliar and predictable stuffed with daftly  named supporting characters (the villain is called Metalbeak). And it doesnt help that some aspects of this owl-oriented world feel slightly ridiculous. How do they make armour with those talons let alone put it on?But Legend of the Guardians has its moments thanks to the PG rating the film provides little opportunity for Snyder to indulge his tiresome liking for bonecrunching violence while allowing him room to exercise his knack for action there are a handful of soaring immersive and at times beautiful fight-and-flight sequences which utilise 3D in the best imaginable way.

Twiight an owl voiced by Anthony LaPaglia in a scene from Legend of the Guardians. Movie review Legend of the Guardians Great fare for kids and adults Add to ... Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 24 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Ga Hoole features characters named Ezylryb and Gylfie - who live in the Kingdom of GaHoole when not stretching their wings across the Sea of Hoolamer. Reading this anyone who finds the geography lessons necessitated by fantasy an unnecessary chore will likely flee to Another Page. Dont. The new 3-D animated film from filmmaker Zach Snyder ( Watchman 300) is a splendid adventure sure to thrill children and fantasy buffs while leaving everyone else passably entertained. Legend of the Guardians opens with an owl surfing a fierce wind. The computer animation is vivid; the depiction of the sleek soaring barn owl intricately detailed. So far so good. Then we get into the owls tree house (in the Forest Kingdom of Tyto) and family time Dad telling a bedtime story to three moon-faced owlets while mom fusses about. Oh Lord fantasy agnostics will shudder - two hours of owls talking in BBC accents. Dont worry. A minute or so later two owls - Soren and Kludd - fall from high up in the Great GaHoole Tree. A snarling wolf approaches about to strike. But the young owls are snatched away by recruiters from the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls. The rescuers are meaner than the wolf however - vicious birds who speak with garish Cockney accents as if theyre auditioning for a Guy Ritchie movie. St. Aggies is a factory for raising a fascist air force it turns out. Helen Mirrens purring seductress Nyra runs the place. She wants to conquer and rule the owl kingdom. Kludd is a ready disciple while brother Soren our hero dreams of joining the Guardians of Ga Hoole and saving the day defeating the self-proclaimed Pure Ones. What ensues is top-notch Saturday-matinee-for-kids fare. Nothing too complicated good versus evil brother against brother lots of fighting and stunts galore. And please pass the popcorn. There are some sharp funny bits. Geoffrey Rush gives voice to the aging Guardian hero Ezylryb a battered but game screech owl as if hes Winston Churchill rallying Britain against the Nazi menace. And to reach the Guardians Soren (Jim Sturgess star of Across the Universe) hooks up with a great grey owl Twilight (Anthony LaPaglia) who fancies himself a poet hero and bashes out unshapely folk songs on a lute. Still its the 3-D stunts that make Legend of the Guardians a stirring entertainment. The good stuff kids will replay in their heads afterwards includes a harrowing flight through frozen rain and a climactic battle a violently swirling aerial ballet that will have wee ones ducking into their parents laps for cover. So if you feed your kids sticky candy its probably best not to wear good trousers. More good news (and speaking of movie matinees of yore) Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole is preceded by a Warner Bros. 3-D cartoon starring Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. The short is called Fur of Flying. Save your kids a lifetime of frustration and tell them right off there is no point cheering for the dog.

""Killer Talons"" is more like it; parents will find footwork of a more lacerating (if largely bloodless) sort.The story is a battle between good owls (the Guardians) who live in GaHoole -- an arboreal paradise that would be familiar to the Navi of ""Avatar"" and the Ewoks of ""Return of the Jedi"" -- and the bad (the Pure Ones) who dwell in a barren wasteland. A good owl Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) is kidnapped and sees his brother Kludd (Ryan Kwanten) lured to the evil side. Soren escapes to alert his flock and soon winged warriors are donning helmets and metal claws and swooping vengefully in slow-motion conflagration.Mr. Snyder an old hand at green-screen effects now has an entirely digital canvas to play with and every feather sunset and 3-D perspective (it is in both 3-D and normal formats) is rendered in impeccable detail. The voice talent much of it Australian (Sam Neill Hugo Weaving Abbie Cornish) is also top-notch. If only the premise werent so familiar and the female characterizations so tiresomely backward (Helen Mirren is an imperious harpy while Sorens friend Gylfie played by Emily Barclay is wide-eyed fragile and helpless).

""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for violent but gore-free nipping and clawing.

BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Sep 23 2010 (...) Warner Bros. Pictures Eglantine voiced by ADRIENNE deFARIA and Soren voiced by JIM STURGESS in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS THE OWLS OF GAHOOLE a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures In mythology and movies owls are considered wise. In real life theyre nearsighted bird brains that prey on little creatures in the dark. So is ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Gahoole"" is a violent adventure pretending to be a harmless kiddie cartoon.The fantasy book series by Kathryn Lasky has been adapted for the big screen by an unlikely director Zach Snyder whose previous movies were the fanboy favorites ""Watchmen"" and ""300."" Snyder seems to have forged this movie with the same bloody hammer. The computer animation is richly detailed and the 3-D effects in the flight scenes are sensational; but the technology is enlisted for a repellent allegory about warring clans of birds.Raised on heroic fables but still too young to fly sibling barn owls Soren and Kludd (voices of Jim Sturgess and Ryan Kwanten) are kidnapped to the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls. There a powerful owl named Nyra (Helen Mirren) extols the superiority of purebreds. The purest recruits are brainwashed to be warriors while the rest are confined to menial labor such as scouring pre-digested mouse carcasses for flecks of metal to make into weapons. Soren leans to fly from an old rebel named Grimble (Hugo Weaving) and together they escape across a stormy sea to GaHoole the aviary of the fabled brave-hearted Guardians. When the vengeful purebreds launch their razor-clawed assault on the Guardians its brother versus brother - with Sorens adorable baby sister caught in the feathery fray.""Legend of the Guardians"" incorporates countless elements of heart-tugging heroic sagas yet not only is it hard to tell the owls apart or to remember their ridiculous names the compacted subplots from three different books are too dense to follow.After the frightened kids run screeching from the theater adults may wonder what this vicious flick was trying to teach us. But as a guardian of unhatched spirits I say Hoo-hoo-hoo cares? Showtimes for Legend of the Guardians Sep 24 2010 (...)

(Disney) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 24 2010 400 AM Title Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole Why shouldnt family films boast the same sort of pomp as adult adventures? As the director of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" Zack Snyder certainly knows how to stage spectacles. And in ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole"" he proves he can child-size an epic without losing its intensity.A sort of all-avian ""Chronicles of Narnia"" ""Legend"" is adapted from several books in Kathryn Laskys ""Guardians of GaHoole"" series. Our hero is Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) a young barn owl who loves to hear stories of the struggle between two factions of flyers the evil Pure Ones and the brave Guardians. One night while out spreading their wings he and his brother Kludd (Ryan Kwanten) are stolen by the Pure Ones who are plotting a takeover of the owl world. Soren manages to escape and warn the Guardians but Kludd is seduced by the false promises of the Pure queen (Helen Mirren).When the inevitable battle arrives only one brother can emerge victorious.The script is merely serviceable and too reminiscent of similar fantasy tales. But kids will instantly relate to the gentle Soren while watching wide-eyed as he faces each challenge. (The dark final clash may prove too violent for the youngest viewers.) And everyone will be impressed by the lovely 3-D animation which highlights each ruffling feather on the beautiful birds. Its no small testament that youre likely to forget youre wearing those plastic glasses altogether.

Starring Emily Barclay Abbie Cornish Ryan Kwanten Anthony LaPaglia Miriam Margolyes Helen Mirren Sam Neill Geoffrey Rush Jim Sturgess Hugo Weaving Director Zack Snyder Running time 130 Release Opened Sep 24 2010  Editorial Review This film just doesnt flyBy Dan KoisFriday September 24 2010""Through our gizzards the voices of the ages whisper to us and tell us whats right"" intones a dignified owl early in ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole"" in the sepulchral inflections of Hugo Weaving. How you respond to this bit of feathery hokum will determine how youll feel about ""Legend of the Guardians"" which combines very old-fashioned storytelling with an of-the-moment 3-D ticket price. Does its majesty send a shiver up your spine? Or does the very idea of an animated owl delivering this line induce -- pardon me -- hoots of laughter? Directed by Zack Snyder the animated ""Legend of the Guardians"" tells a familiar story of two owlet brothers whose destinies come into conflict. Owlnapped by a clan of evil owls called the Pure Ones the brothers are pulled into a plot to enslave all of owlkind. Kludd (voiced by Ryan Kwanten) eagerly signs on as a soldier in the Pure Ones army while Soren (Jim Sturgess) escapes to seek out the Guardians of GaHoole a legendary flock of warrior owls who protect owlkind from owl evil. In summary talking owls. And the owls do look quite pretty downy feathers wide eyes and all. (Dont look too closely at their beaks while they talk though or you may be consumed with curiosity about how an animal with no lips can speak.) Theres a lot more hoo-hah about owl eugenics and owl pellets and owl navigation and ""trusting your gizzard."" The first three books of Kathryn Laskys series have been crammed into this films screenplay which might explain why major plot elements are glossed over such as the mysterious ""flecks"" of some unknown metal whose very existence imperils all owldom. In the films climactic battle sequence the big bad owl declares ""The Guardians are helpless against the power of the flecks."" As villainous catchphrases go its no ""Kneel before Zod."" The bad owls name is Metal Beak. He has a metal beak you see. His actual beak was ripped off in battle by one of the Guardians years ago. (But how can he talk? Shouldnt he at least make clanking sounds when he speaks with his metal beak? Reader I dont know.) Metal Beak is voiced with great relish by Australian actor Joel Edgerton so good earlier this year in ""The Square""; in fact the supporting cast is a whos who of excellent Aussie acting talent all of them having a merry old time pretending to be owls. In addition to Weaving theres Geoffrey Rush as a storytelling owl Anthony LaPaglia as a singing owl Sam Neill as a warrior owl and Abbie Cornish as a love-interest-whose-role-seems-to-have-been-drastically-cut-for-space owl. Helen Mirren though not Australian plays Metal Beaks consort who is an owl. Children with a particular affection for epic tales no matter how derivative or cacophonous will probably enjoy ""Legend of the Guardians."" The grown-ups who accompany them though unable to rotate their heads 180 degrees will yawn through John Orloff and Emil Sterns dull dialogue and occasionally find their interest sparked by the films lovely 3-D vistas. And the action? Its especially hard to determine whos fighting whom in ""Legends"" because well because they are a bunch of owls. Snyder doesnt help intercutting moments of balletic slow-motion with messy incoherent action choreography. Its a technique filmgoers will recognize from Snyders previous movies ""Watchmen"" and ""300"" -- the only difference being that thanks to ""GaHooles"" PG rating the bone-crunching battles result in artful sprays of feathers not blood.Contains scenes of scary owl action.

Who-who knew GaHoole could be a hit? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWho-who knew GaHoole could be a hit?Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole may be the seasons most dramatically compelling and most visually sumptuous animated feature.Eglantine is one of the brave owlettes in Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole  (HANDOUT)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarThu. Sept. 23 2010 Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole (out of 4) Featuring the voices of Jim Sturgess and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Zack Snyder. 100 minutes. At major theatres. PG Which of these seems like the worse idea -- hiring the blood-and-guts-loving director of 300 to make a kid-friendly 3-D animated movie or creating what is essentially a condensed version of The Lord of the Rings with a cast of talking owls? Of course they both sound like very bad ideas. And yet despite the odds Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole may be the seasons most dramatically compelling and most visually sumptuous animated feature. Who could have predicted that? Adapted from several novels in Kathryn Laskys Guardians of GaHoole fantasy series the movie teams 300 and Watchmen director Zack Snyder with Animal Logic the Australian animation company behind the 2006 hit Happy Feet. Unsurprisingly given Snyders involvement Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole has a darker disposition than its more rambunctious predecessor. British actor Jim Sturgess (21 Across the Universe) voices the lead part of Soren a feathery youngster who is obsessed with the stories of the legendary warriors who once defended the peace in this owl-centric universe. Sorens own mettle is tested after he and his older brother Kludd (True Bloods Ryan Kwanten) are kidnapped and enslaved by a group of sinister owls. Metalbeak (Joel Edgerton) and his white-feathered mate Nyra (Helen Mirren) are building an army for purposes unknown. All that stands in their way is Soren and his allies some of whom may be less legendary than hes been led to believe. An ornithological variation on Tolkiens epic Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole gives Snyder and his animators many opportunities to orchestrate scenes of aerial owl-on-owl violence. Besides finding the action too intense younger viewers may also have some trouble grasping the films underlying themes about the dangers of fascism and militarism. Indeed the movies sensibility can be decidedly adult even subversive -- what with her strident talk and elitist rhetoric the character of Nyra answers any curiosity about what Ayn Rand might have been like if she could turn her head 180 degrees. Though the dialogue is often rote the largely Australian cast who contributed their vocal talents -- a roster that also includes Geoffrey Rush Sam Neill and the ubiquitous Hugo Weaving -- invest the piece with all the necessary verve and vigour. More impressive is the gorgeous and intricate visual design. The startling amount of detail in the environments and the bravura of the action sequences demonstrate just how much digital animation techniques have advanced in the four short years since Happy Feet. Talking owls may never replace Frodo and Aragorn in some viewers affections but Snyders movie still has the sweep and swagger of the best fantasy flicks.

"Movie review Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-GuardiansMovie review Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHooleWhen owls fight for world domination the battles are fierce and even might be too strong for the kiddies.September 24 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole"" is essentially the kids version of ""Braveheart"" with owls a a dark and dense tale filled with noble warriors mighty clashes and feathers flying (rather than kilts whew a relief). Though there is less blood in GaHoole and nothing disemboweled there are many raging battles and when the fighting fowls strap on those metal talons a| lets just say its strong stuff for the young set this 3-D animated film has in its sights. On paper it would seem the perfect match of story and storyteller with director Zack Snyder pouring all that hes learned about ancient legends and fantasy worlds from his action and ab-packed ""300"" into this sometimes soaring drama. The magnificent arcing swoops and spins of the owls achieved by the animation team (the folks behind ""Happy Feet"" as the ads trumpet loudly) make such good use of the 3-D technology you can almost feel the pure freedom and joy of flight. But theres a confusion that you can sense as well with the film pulled between its light and dark sides just as the owls struggle with forces of good and evil. That hesitation keeps ""Guardians"" from reaching the deep emotionally rich center that confers greatness in the animation world. (You cant help but hope Pixar doesnt hold the patent on heartfelt high notes though at times it seems the case.) Adapted by John Orloff and Emil Stern from the first three in the childrens 15-book series ""Guardians of GaHoole"" by Kathryn Lasky our central characters are Soren ( Jim Sturgess) and Kludd ( Ryan Kwanten) brothers at increasingly lethal Cain and Abel odds though you have to wonder if the names their parents gave them sealed that destiny. They are barn owls commoners within the owl community with their heart-shaped faces a a mask of white feathers tipped by dark brown a so beautiful its hard to believe that evil could be lurking though of course it is. The central tension of the film is set up when Soren and Kludd are kidnapped after falling from the nest when they attempt to fly while the parents are out picking up some mice for dinner. A morality tale through and through this particular fall from grace is only the first in a series with real consequences meted out in ways that may frighten little ones. It turns out that young owl abductions are on the rise with evil marauders called the Pure Ones trying to build a slave army of moon-blinked owl chicks (apparently a hazard of the species a look at the light too long and risk a white-eyed zombie-like future.) The Pure Ones have world domination in mind with a scarred and bitter general a sooty owl named Metal Beak ( Joel Edgerton) and a snow white sorceress named Nyra ( Helen Mirren) stirring up a bad brew. (The list of characters is long topped by Geoffrey Rushs Ezylryb with the comic relief pair of Digger [ David Wenham] and Twilight [ Anthony LaPaglia] the best of the bunch.) With the stage set young Soren begins that important quest to find the mythic protectors of all things good the Guardians the warrior owls of GaHoole he learned about at his fathers knee. And there is his even tougher journey from innocent owlet into an adult who trusts his gizzard which we learn is how one takes the measure of an owl. The animation itself is startlingly beautiful as is the ancient owl world it imagines. The battles are complex and in true Snyder tradition heavy on the action. The flying sequences are breathtaking though like plane trips they go on too long. There is some strange laser action caused by piling up ""flecks"" (or some such thing) which are shiny bits plucked out of the nasty pellets of innards owls routinely cough up. The look is cool a like highly concentrated blue lightning strikes a but out of place in this otherwise low-tech world. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIts Gekko vs. owls at box officeSeptember 24 2010Who will see Legend of the Guardians?September 22 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTGuardiansPixarEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-legend-20100924,0,2444427.story",200,legendoftheguardianstheowlsofga'hoole11,legendoftheguardianstheowlsofga'hoole,latimes

The swooping warfare is like airborne ballet.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted September 24 2010Gladiatorial owls? Talk about ruffling feathers.Based on thenovels by Kathryn Lasky Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole is an eye-popping animated 3-D combat film where the winged adversaries wear armor on beaks breasts and talons.In the film directed by Zach Snyder maker of the stylized martial mash-up 300 the owls are gorgeously rendered. (Every feather is distinct how do animators write an algorithm for that?) The swooping talon-on-talon contests are like airborne ballet.The movie is beautiful but for one unfamiliar with the source material confusing. I needed an owl scorecard.In this allegory of good and evil - think Harry Potter with wings - three owlet siblings are kidnapped by Tyto (barn owls) ""the pure ones."" They plan to indoctrinate the owlets and send them into battle against the ""Guardians"" knights of the owl kingdom.Soren (voice of Jim Sturgess) an owlet who has grown up on the legends of the Guardians isnt sure the Guardians actually exist. But he is suspicious of his Nazi-like captors and escapes their forest bunker. Sorens jealous weaker brother Kludd (Ryan Kwanten) is easily brainwashed (in owl lingo ""moon-blinked"") and stays with ""the pure ones."" Perhaps because their snowy-feathered queen is persuasively voiced by Helen Mirren.When Soren takes flight he encounters charming GaHoole-igans Owl-warriors sing whimsical songs of epic battle a boastful echidna claims to have foretold everything that has happened and will happen.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Its always slightly amazing when we remember that George Miller director of ""Babe Pig in the City and ""Happy Feet is the same George Miller who cranked out multiple installments of ""Mad Max mayhem.Now Zack Snyder director of ""300 ""Watchmen and 2004s ""Dawn of the Dead aims for a similar sort of go-figure duality with ""Legend of the Guardians a 3-D animated warrior-owls fantasy. The result is sometimes charming and always visually astonishing (Snyder even teamed with the same Australian digital-effects house behind ""Happy Feet) but were never very far from reminders that this is a kids movie made by well the guy who did ""300.The film is adapted from the ""Guardians of GaHoole young-adult book series by Cambridge author Kathryn Lasky and features Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe) as the voice of Soren an owlet who dreams of adventure -- if only he can learn to fly. When Soren gives it a try along with his contrarian older brother Kludd (Ryan Kwanten one of numerous Aussies in the cast) they tumble from their hollow defenseless. Theyre promptly snatched up by the Pure Ones a master race of owls led by Nyra (Helen Mirren) and the sinister Metal Beak (Joel Edgerton).Kludd is made a soldier while Soren is sent to slave in the groups ""pelletorium picking through bird-gunk in search of an enigmatic darkly prized metal. (Shades of the similarly too-intense kiddie mines from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.) Once Soren finally works through his flying issues and escapes his course his clear He and some new friends must seek out the distant Guardians heroic birds of legend and bring them back to save all of owldom.Sorens quest proves again and again that ""How to Train Your Dragon wasnt necessarily the final word on the whole gloriousness-of-flight theme. Snyder and his animators send their downy photo-real birds swooping breathtakingly through one tableau after the next -- golden skies snow squalls a monsoon a raging forest fire. One visual of a creepy hench-bat entering from stage left will have you swearing the thing just flew past your shoulder.At the same time the movie gets awfully wrapped up in signature Snyder battle shots with razor-clawed combatants sailing toward each other in slo-mo then smashing together at hyper-speed. A Guardians talons slash and we cut to the image of an Orc-like Pure Ones helmet rotating through empty space. ""Cool some kids will say; others may be freaked. The effect finally is to neglect rather than nurture a story with potential.Sorens moment of truth feels cribbed from ""Star Wars right down to a disembodied mentor telling him to ""trust his gizzard (read ""Use the Force). Whats the Pure Ones metal-sifting all about? What will Soren and Kludd say to each other when they finally confront their brotherly split? Ultimately Snyders frenetic tale doesnt seem to give a hoot.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet From the concepts and the commercials Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of GaHoole may not sound like a project from Zack Snyder director of Watchmen 300 and 2004s Dawn Of The Dead remake. Its a CGI childrens fantasy that pits good talking owls against evil ones taken from Kathryn Laskys popular book series and it lacks the gore and grimness of Snyders past work. But within seconds of its opening a feather drifts off an owls wing spins in midair in ultra slow motion then slams into full speed again. Its instantly clear that while Snyder the gorehound isnt at the wheel Snyder the slick stylist is with his usual exclamation-point-loaded visual signatures. While that cant compensate for Legends weak story his pacing and cutting and the films superlative animation at least make it a dynamic experience. Unfortunately the story rarely rises above cookie-cutter kids-fantasy tropes Its a standard heros-journey story one that substitutes colorful characters for actual incident. The protagonist a barn owl named Soren (Jim Sturgess) runs afoul of a tyrannical owl society devoted to collecting a magical MacGuffin with dubious plot powers. He escapes with a tiny elf owl (Emily Barclay) befriends wacky owls voiced by David Wenham and Anthony LaPaglia and seeks help from a legendary collective of owl heroes. Meanwhile Sorens brother falls under the wing of evil owl queen Nyra (Helen Mirren). It all builds to the expected good-vs.-bad/brother-on-brother confrontations which Snyder directs with multitudinous slow-motion sparks-throwing clashes between owl armor and metal-sheathed claws. Much of what works in Legend can be credited to Animal Logic the studio behind 2006s Happy Feet; its animators have created a vivid world with deep gorgeous spaces that become stunning in 3-D and owls that would have made Walt Disney weep with their feather-perfect realism and natural movement. And to anyone young enough to have not already seen dozens of rote Chosen One Vs. Generic Evil fables Legend may well be as exciting as it is beautiful. But theres no nuance or subtlety to hook the adult audiences for whom ""Owls go from A to B"" is a framework not a complete story. And a cliche wrought in finely detailed feathers is still all too obviously a cliche.

Directed by Snyder and based on Kathryn Laskys children books Legend of the Guardians involves the coming-of-age of a unique young bird during an adventurous quest across foreign lands a classical heroic odyssey that boasts a spirit similar to that of The Secret of N.I.M.H. and is enhanced by such sumptuous 3-D CGI it would make Pixar blush. Championing the vital importance of storytelling this mythological fable centers on dreamer Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) who after escaping forced servitude to villainous deposed king Metal Beak (Joel Edgerton) endeavors to locate and then join in battle his legendary owl idols the Guardians of GaHoole. Issues of faith courage loyalty sacrifice and betrayal (the last perpetrated by Sorens brother) are all tackled by Snyder with understated maturity though a series of slightly repetitive aerial skirmishes cant quite match the inventiveness of Feets buoyant song-and-dance mash-ups. Regardless the films aesthetically stunning muscular action and celebration of the natural worlds fantastic majesty proves an ideal showcase for the 300 and Watchmen auteurs trademark stop-and-count-the-feathers slow-motion.

TWITTER Not many directors dare to tackle live-action and animated films though James Cameron edged toward the animated realm in sections of ""Avatar."" Now Zack Snyder director of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" has made his first 3D animated feature ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole."" This picture sometimes rivals ""Avatar"" in its spectacular landscapes and thrilling flying sequences but of course it wont come anywhere near those megagrosses and its too scary to be wholeheartedly embraced by children. However it should capture a nice audience for Warner Bros. and might even earn better reviews than some of Snyders live-action movies. The picture is based on the first three books in a 15-volume series by childrens author Kathryn Lasky who created the mythology of a young owl caught up in the battle between the noble Guardian owls and a more evil band ironically known as the Pure Ones. The script by John Orloff and Emil Stern isnt going to win any prizes for originality; you can spot the influence of many other movies including ""The Lion King."" Our hero Soren (Jim Sturgess) has a jealous brother tempted by the dark side as well as a few eccentric mentors. For young audiences in particular theres another problem that most animated films are clever enough to avoid. Because all the characters are owls with rather similar looks it takes a while to distinguish the large creature cast. ""Lion King"" included meerkats and hyenas as well as lions and ""Shrek"" had a donkey and cat to accompany the ogre. Its risky to tamper with this formula. Kids need clearer visual signals to get a handle on all the characters. On the plus side these characters are given voice by an impressive cast of mainly Australian actors -- much of the production was designed in Sydney -- including Abbie Cornish Sam Neill Hugo Weaving Joel Edgerton and David Wenham. Geoffrey Rush brings marvelous idiosyncratic vigor to the role of the grizzled leader of the Guardians. Brits like Sturgess round out the cast. Miriam Margolyes oozes maternal protectiveness as the owls pet snake and nanny and Helen Mirren -- the busiest actress on the planet with three more movies opening before years end -- lends a note of elegant silken menace to the chief villain of the piece. Ones only regret is that she doesnt have more to do but if this film succeeds shes clearly set to return in the sequel. The chief pleasures of the movie are visual The dark forests and imposing seascapes modeled on rugged terrain in Tasmania are richly seductive. The 3D camerawork is dynamic as we soar with the owls through woods and across the ocean to the Guardians island kingdom. The huge technical team has crafted images that often transcend traditional animation to look at once remarkably lifelike and suitably fantastical. The lush musical score by David Hirschfelder enhances the movies shifting moods of terror and exaltation.

Director Zack Snyder attempts to shoehorn his heavily art-directed mayhem into a kiddie-pic mold with predictably ill-fitting results in ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole."" Though visually stunning and blessed with immaculate 3D work film is fatally bogged down by tackling an essentially ridiculous premise (gladiator-attired owls fight genocide) with stony solemnity and by subsisting on a note of sustained menace and terror in what is ostensibly a childrens film. Box office returns should be robust though it seems unlikely that the film will spawn the hoped-for franchise. While Snyders most obvious gift is his knack for sumptuous visuals he also extols an admirable fidelity to the spirit of his source materials -- his refusal to acknowledge the barely-hidden camp elements of ""300"" for example was as essential to that films success as its balletic action. But in adapting Kathryn Laskys young adult novel series (the first three of which form the story here) the latter tendency is exactly what lets him down. Owls attired in gladiator helmets wielding swords while erectly intoning such lines as ""through our gizzards the voices of the angels speak to us"" could be great fun if imbued with the slightest dash of winking humor but Snyder approaches the premise with a documentarians grim seriousness. The film opens on adolescent barn owl brothers Soren (Jim Sturgess) and Kludd (Ryan Kwanten) bickering in their treetop home. Dreamy Soren is obsessed with telling elaborate tales of the mythical hero owls called Guardians of GaHoole especially to cutesy younger sibling Eglantine (Adrienne da Faria) while the more practical Kludd disapproves. This glimpse of quiet domesticity proves to be the films first and last down moment as Soren and Kludd are in quick succession knocked out of their home to the forrest floor below attacked by a Luciferian wild boar and kidnapped by a marauding pair of adult owls who transport them to a facility thats half Dickensian orphanage half concentration camp. Now imprisoned at the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls the terrified young avians are paraded before kapo Nyra (Helen Mirren) who imparts them with a speech extolling the racial purity of tyto barn owls recruiting the latter type as soldiers while enslaving the other species to a lifetime of sorting through heaps of owl pellets (shown in all their squeamishly cloacal glory) for stray metal flecks to power a fearsome electromagnetic weapon. Thrown in with the latter group for his insolence Soren and new companion Gylfie (Emily Barclay) manage to dodge a frightening hypnosis process then escape with the help of turncoat guard Grimble (Hugo Weaving). Eventually the two reach the legendary city of GaHoole where fabled warrior Ezylryb (Geoffrey Rush) trains Soren in the art of war. Meanwhile Kludd segues from simple stick-in-the-mud to genocidal villain with little explanation even voluntarily betraying his younger sister Eglantine to the cause. The strain of condensing three books into a single film becomes apparent quite often as important chunks of this mythology are introduced without warning or style and characters that were presumably reader-faves -- such as bumbling nomads Digger (David Wenham) and Twilight (Anthony Lapaglia) -- are just gracelessly dropped into the story then mostly ignored. But a far bigger problem is the films increasingly brutal violence and unrelenting tenor of terror. There are throat slashings impalements with flaming spikes and dramatic tumbles into lakes of fire and several characters seem to spend the entire film doing little but trembling and cowering in horror. While these incidents obviously lack the gooey visceral details with which Snyder would likely have imbued them in ""300"" they still feel wildly inappropriate for a film marketed to children. The owls are rendered with startlingly lifelike detail far surpassing anything that either Snyder or animators Animal Logic (""Happy Feet"") have accomplished in the past (a slow-motion sequence of Soren flying through a rainstorm is breathtaking). Although just as often this works to the films detriment Any non-ornithologists in the audience will likely find it impossible to distinguish certain characters on sight alone and some of the storys more whimsical elements (grizzled owl blacksmiths who forge iron helmets a matronly snake (Miriam Margolyes) who functions as Sorens nanny) appear all the more ridiculous for their photorealistic sheen. All other technical contributions are top-notch and the 3D work is stellar. Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHooleProductionA Warner Bros.
