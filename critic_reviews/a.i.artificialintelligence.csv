Artificial Intelligence Williams Goss 04/21/2011 Nearly ten years after its release its hard to conceive of A.I. Artificial Intelligence as a July 4th tentpole release. As a Steven Spielberg film filled with futuristic spectacle it makes a certain kind of sense but as a Stanley Kubrick passion project packed with big ideas about technology and mortality it boggles the mind. The final result of their union completed after Kubricks passing in 1999 remains an ambitious ungainly combination of the two filmmakers competing sensibilities. On a recent viewing Im still not quite sure what I think of the film but Im also unsure that it could ever be the film that either visionary would have wanted to make. Based on Brian Aldiss short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" and expanded upon by both Ian Curtis and Spielberg himself A.I. takes place in a future where melting ice caps have eradicated the coastlines as we know them forcing the government to control reproduction and society to embrace robots as an economical alternative to overpopulation. Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) proposes creating androids with a soul or something close to it to serve as surrogate offspring. Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances OConnor and Sam Robards) are reluctant to replace their ailing son with a facsimile but Henry believes that David (Haley Joel Osment) will help her move on and eventually she comes to love this alien thing as if it were her own son. That is until her own son begins to recover. When Martin (Jake Thomas) returns home he is spiteful towards David and his actions force a distraught Monica to abandon David in the woods. From there David journeys to find the Blue Fairy whom he believes can turn him into a real boy (a la Pinocchio) and thus return him to Monicas good graces. The first fifty minutes of A.I. are fairly confined as Monica struggles to find room in her heart for David and as David struggles to find room in the family to belong. When he first appears his hazy silhouette resembles that of the extraterrestrials in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and arguably the character behaves as if E.T. genuinely believed that he were Eliot instead of a visitor from another world. David is constantly shown in reflections and refractions rightfully treated by the camera as an unblinking outsider. (The fact that I find myself referring to David by gender-specific pronouns rather than simply ""it"" speaks well to the case Spielberg makes for this robots humanity.) Monicas emotional thaw comes a bit quickly and Martins manipulations are aggravatingly transparent but soon enough David finds himself abandoned a pariah partnered with another toy of which Martin grew tired Teddy (sagely voiced by Jack Angel) and then Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a sex-bot framed for murder. They run from the law and from humans resentful towards the creatures that have claimed their jobs and they head towards the flooded ends of the world in order to find the answers that David so desperately needs. The effects work by Industrial Light amp; Magic and Stan Winstons crew holds up splendidly although an unfortunate amount of grain in Janusz Kaminskis notoriously glowy-and-grainy cinematography has been preserved with this transfer. Unfortunately just as ""Mechas"" recover from damage by exchanging parts with other models the screenplay feels similarly assembled out of multiple pieces for the first hour its a confined domestic drama and considerable morality tale and after that its alternately a fleeting futuristic noir a persecution parable and an on-the-nose fairy tale adventure with an admirably bleak ending in its sights. And then even after that it keeps going farther and farther into the future bending over backwards to give a sentimental sheen to a fundamentally gloomy story. There are some lovely emotional moments in the films last minutes sold well by Osments thoroughly remarkable performance -- both he and Law are equally great throughout at conveying their respective modes of companionship -- but those moments only come after much explanation about an unlikely loophole itself harder to buy than who (or what) its coming from. Its part of a bold vision in a film chock full of them almost too many to flesh out; to whom they really belonged we may never know. In a better film it wouldnt have mattered and in 2000 years it wont. All of the original DVDs supplemental features have been ported over in standard definition with only two theatrical trailers having been actually upgraded to high-def for this Blu-ray release. The rest of the extras include a nine-part behind-the-scenes featurette -- minimally repetitive so far as these things go yet clocking in at nearly two hours -- and archives ranging from storyboard galleries to production design sketches and concept art. Given Spielbergs well-established aversion to recording audio commentaries these in-depth breakdowns will have to and likely will suffice. A.I. Artificial Intelligence is available on Blu-ray now.

Monica and Henry (OConnor and Robards) whose natural son is in a vegetative state afford him a wary welcome the mothers need overcoming her trepidation. Then when their own son makes a miraculous recovery sibling rivalry gets out of hand and Monica abandons the surrogate in the woods to fend for himself. A schizophrenic animal Kubrick and Spielbergs love child begins in cerebral sci-fi mode before switching abruptly into a heart-rending fairytale redolent of E.T. The Wizard of Oz and especially Pinocchio. Spielberg adopted the project and whatever Kubricks input may have been took sole screenplay credit for the first time since Close Encounters. The result is surprisingly clumsy and ill-integrated. Yet A.I. is ambitious personal and revealing. A film about childhood as opposed to a film for kids it has more than its share of beauty wonders and mysteries. The SFX are miraculous; Osment and OConnor scarcely less so. At heart its a terribly anguished expression of rejection loneliness and love. If only it knew when to stop.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Artificial Intelligence Almost Brilliant By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 29 2001 Jude Law background and Haley Joel Osment gaze at unfinished robots in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence."" (Warner Bros. and DreamWorks) I think ultimately Steven Spielbergs ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is one dead Pinocchio robot. But its alive and beeping before it keels over mid-movie. Which makes the reviewing equivalent of an autopsy very compelling.Lets roll back the sheet shall we?Theres a lot of history behind this movie some of which youve probably heard. The whole thing began more than 25 years ago with Stanley Kubrick reading Brian Aldisss haunting short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" then falling in love with the idea of a movie about artificial intelligence.Kubrick being Kubrick the movie was never made. The director who died in 1999 told Spielberg about the idea in the 1980s then involved him in the project. Spielberg took the baton willingly. The result is not too surprising a movie thats determined to honor the late filmmakers vision but which is after all directed by Steven Spielberg. ""A.I."" starts with the chilly precision of a Kubrick movie (the better half actually which also follows the Aldiss story) then wanders into Spielbergs big-top conceit a modernized Philip K. Dick-style version of ""Pinocchio.""Its heart is in the right place. But the intelligence behind the rest of the movie is well a little too artificial. Intriguing inspired flawed misbegotten and fascinating - all of these qualities apply to the movie at one point or another. In the movie set in the mid-21st century Henry (Sam Robards) and Monica Swinton (Frances OConnor) seek a substitute for Martin (Jake Thomas) their terminally ill son whos been cryogenically frozen until a cure is found.Cybertronics Manufacturing where Henry works has just the answer a brand-new lifelike robot called David (Haley Joel Osment). David hot off the Cybertronics production line is designed to respond as intelligently and sensitively as artificial tissue will allow. Hes programmed to need to love.But heres the rub When a willing parent activates his programming David will become emotionally attached to the parent for life.This renders the parent morally responsible for David and his needs for affirmation and love. Its the same invisible contract parents sign with human children except this robot never gets older. He stays young and adorable and needy forever. He doesnt need to sleep but hes good enough to lie there all night until Mom and Dad ""wake"" him up.Could David be the perfect child? After many misgivings Monica agrees to adopt him. After some adjusting David becomes part of the family with an automated similarly sophisticated companion called Teddy at his beck and call.But David learns the limitations of his family membership when Martin - now cured - returns. When David realizes he needs to be a real boy you can almost hear the drums roll Its time for ""Pinocchio.""Huh?Okay you think why not go with it? Its a provocative bold idea. And how often does someone with the stature of Spielberg try something bold? More power to him right? Besides up until then the movie has been working fine as a sort of science fiction fairy tale.This is where you decide whether it works or not. But if you do accept what happens youll also have to swallow a finale that pushes the envelope even more. We know the ""Pinocchio"" ending of course so theres no surprise there. But its as though Spielberg feels obligated to blend reality (or perhaps believability) with that fantasy transformation. Good fairies and Kubrick it seems dont mix well.But even if the concept gets knotted up in marionette strings there are things to appreciate. Osments performance is astonishing. Theres an incredible moment when David a newcomer at the Swinton dinner table discovers the power of laughter. His over-the-top guffaw is eerie and shocking as he experiments with this new emotion. His parents are taken aback at first. But when they see Davids innocent desire to share some humor they break into laughter.Its a delicate moment and it speaks to Spielbergs tremendous abilities as a director. And it reminds us how good he can be around the family table in such movies as ""Jaws"" and ""E.T.""As the mother who goes through a searing emotional odyssey OConnor also gives a lovely performance. But the hidden star the DArtagnan is Jude Law who appears midway through the movie as Gigolo Joe a robotic ladies man whose entire existence is built around a different form of love. His performance as a half-machine half-soul is balletic precise and memorable.Of course this is a movie that lives by its visual effects too. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who has shot six films for Spielberg including ""A.I."" and the upcoming ""Minority Report"" delivers outstandingly crisp but gritty images. And the list of great collaborators is long including special robotic effects master Stan Winston Production Designer Rick Carter and so on.But the ultimate maestro behind this production is Spielberg whose desire to realize Kubricks ideas - yet make his own work - eerily mirrors the dedication of David as he tries to be human. Its close mighty close but not quite right.""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" (PG-13 146 minutes) - Contains some sexual content and violent images. Area theaters.

The Strings Are Showing By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 29 2001 Jude Law background and Haley Joel Osment gaze at unfinished robots in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence."" (Warner Bros. and DreamWorks) Even without death rays and Martian fighting machines the classic science fiction movie that Steven Spielbergs ""A.I."" most suggests is ""The War of the Worlds.""The worlds belong to Spielberg himself and to his mentor inspiration and the original developer of ""A.I."" the great late Stanley Kubrick.The two men seem so similar extraordinary cinema geniuses driven perfectionist powerful autocratic.And they are so different.Spielberg is suburban sentimental a believer in happy endings family wholeness benevolent aliens that are just a projection of his optimistic worldview. Even if it contains killer sharks the universe ultimately makes sense; it can be known and understood.Kubrick came out of harsh New York German-Jewish intellectuality. Hes the chess master the pipe smoker without a sentimental lick to him caustic cynical cold and analytical. In one of his films he blew up the world as a joke The universe is a whirligig of gases and cosmic debris that always conspires to render human nobility and aspiration futile.So Spielberg sees the glass as half full; Kubrick saw the glass smashed and ground into your face.And that struggle fills ""A.I."" from start to finish. Kubrick bought the original short story and carefully nurtured and developed it. It is rumored that he enjoyed a secret collaboration with Spielberg; fax machines in closets were involved (how very Kubrick). When Kubrick died possibly to escape the reviews of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Spielberg took over the script rewrote it produced it and filled it with his own strengths and weaknesses.The result is fascinating if uneven and ultimately rather silly. Problems with the ending so common these days dog this visionary film as well.The original idea has a very specific 50s feel to it reflecting Kubrick. Its a movie about robots that hails from the days when robots seemed the ultimate expression of human genius complete with corollary notions that someday artificial life powered by artificial intelligence would fit seamlessly with and ultimately replace humanity. ""Blade Runner"" has already probed this issue seeking an answer to the sci-fi writers classic query Where does man end and machine begin?And heres the answer Who cares? It doesnt matter. Man and machine will never meld and to pretend that they will is to waste everyones time. Its so four decades ago.So ""A.I."" is a strangeness a technically brilliant 00s film full of annoyingly ancient 50s ideas. The movie is full of answers to questions that are seldom asked anymore. Thus its a film best not to think about or to pay careful attention to. Just enjoy Spielbergs masterful narrative voice as he pulls you through the odyssey of a science fiction Pinocchio who just wants to be a real boy.The film is set a few decades after 2001. Most of humanity is gone (the ozone hole got bigger and suntanned billions to death melting the ice caps and performing ultimate urban renewal on all the coastal cities). But life is pleasant in the small high-tech cloistered suburbs where elite survivors live. There alas the Swintons Monica and Henry (Frances OConnor and Sam Robards) are in mourning.Their son stricken with a fatal disease is cryogenically preserved awaiting a cure (another 50s idea). It turns out that Henry works for a high-tech outfit that is in the business of building robots - theyre called mechas - so perfect they seem all but human. The one human trait the programmers hadnt been able to hard-wire into their disks is love. But now under the guidance of Professor Hobby (William Hurt at his most professorial) theyve got a prototype of a love-capable mecha.And so David (Haley Joel Osment) comes to live at the Swintons where his adorable literalism makes him seem like a child raised in a lab. He bursts in on Monica sitting on the toilet because that big no-no hasnt been drummed into him. But soon enough Monica who has been fighting it falls into mothers love with him and he has replaced the frozen Martin.This is Kubricks suburbia not Spielbergs. The house never has the messy jumble of a real place which Spielberg has captured in films like ""E.T."" Its a severe Scandinavian-modern type of place; moreover the whole gestalt is Kubrickian from the stately camera movement to the classic (snaillike) sense of pace the early-in-their-career use of low-voltage actors (I dont even know who Frances OConnor is) and the careful Flaubertian detail work.But the emotional turmoil soon unleashed feels Spielbergian its from a turbulent childhood with a vanished father and a lot of confusion between siblings. Martin is awakened cured and returned home and suddenly the two boys are fighting for Monicas love acting out the whole family disintegrating under stress.And so Monica faces a shattering decision She must remove the non-child whom she loves as much as the real child from the family. But if she returns him to the company he will be deactivated which she interprets as execution. She takes him to the woods and lets him go.Thus David enters the real world which turns out to be a history of the future as told by movies of the past. Its part of the carnal London from ""A Clockwork Orange"" but also the post-apocalypse outback of George Millers ""Road Warrior"" films with an overlay of Ridley Scotts incredible evocation of L.A. in ""Blade Runner.""The issue of sexuality is another odd field in which Spielbergs and Kubricks sensibilities collide. Kubrick clearly reveled in the sexual; his masterpiece ""Dr. Strangelove"" is full of sexual double-entendre one of his early succes des scandales was ""Lolita"" and his last film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" barely escaped an NC-17 rating. By contrast Spielberg is Mr. Clean; I cannot think of a single scene in his films where sexuality is significantly addressed.But sexuality is a theme that runs through ""A.I."" for one of the intriguing aspects of the mechas was their deployment as sex partners. So Jude Law under slicked-back hair his handsome features exaggerated by aggressive makeup becomes Davids boon companion in their quest for knowledge. He is a sex professional named Gigolo Joe though his part in the film is roughly the equivalent to Jiminy Crickets. Spielberg who longs desperately to stay in PG-13 territory never embraces the sexuality implicit in Joe or even in Rouge City the town of mecha whores and porn goddesses to which Joe and David head.For a while the film becomes pure adventure story as Joe and David on the lam join a tribe of lost mechas who are being hunted by exploiters for carnival shows as a protest against the over-mecha-nization of the world and roam in search of a Blue Fairy that David believes will turn him human for he has stumbled upon a text of ""Pinocchio"" and thinks its a how-to book. Its great fun as an unlimited production budget allows the filmmakers to conjure all sorts of heretofore unseen sights including a mecha-hunting vehicle disguised as yes the moon.But ultimately the movies conclusion arrives bringing what is certain to become legendary befuddlement. I struggle here not to give anything away but the highly intelligent might want to back off now for they may divine what it is Im saying.It appears to me that Kubrick was intending to reiterate that sense of confused wonder and awe that he brought to the end of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" the profusion of images that carried the dark message that there were things in the universe that man could not know and that he would have no vocabulary to understand or remember. As Keir Dullea sought the source of the mysterious signals so does David seek reality and a chance to bond again with his beloved mother. In the first film this produced a seminal moment in film history Dullea on one of the moons of Jupiter sitting in a Louis XVI bedroom. That was Kubricks methodology for suggesting the human mind encountering something beyond its scope and recasting it in familiar images.And so it is with ""A.I."" when - I give you no other details purposely - the boy is liberated to full humanity. In fact he not only represents humanity he has become humanity. If hes not fully human now he can never be.But Spielberg couldnt let Kubricks evocation of this wonder go without grounding it in some knowable reality. Thus he invents agents who make the metaphorical transformation realistic and palpable - and silly. In a Spielberg movie you have to figure that somehow aliens will be involved they will be calming and benevolent not savage and predatory.The result is grand but somewhat trivial. The majesty of Kubricks cold universe has been dragged into the warmth of Spielbergs cuddly one. You want to believe in these two tellers of tales and you want to believe that they could solve their differences to tell one great tale between them but somehow those differences end up being the most memorable thing in the film.""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" (146 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo.

Artificial Intelligence. Publicity Photo Haley Joel Osment is a robot who wants to become a real boy and Jude Law is a gigolo robot in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Publicity Photo Artificial foolishness / ""A.I. starts out promising but ends up combining the worst of Kubrick Spielberg 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Science fiction. Starring Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is the work of two master filmmakers. It was the brainchild of the late Stanley Kubrick  who conceived and produced it. And it was written and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film represents the best of both directors -- at first. For a good 30 minutes it combines the austerity the crispness the intellectual rigor and the clean compositions of Kubrick with the humanity and bigheartedness of Spielberg. By the end however ""A.I."" exhibits all its creators bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless meandering slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg. Its a coupling from hell. Until now Spielberg had never made a boring movie. With this he breaks new ground. We can only guess that the imprimatur of Kubrick made Spielberg feel safe to be stultifying and self-indulgent. Spielberg has made great movies corny movies and silly movies -- and some that were all three -- but this is the first time he has ever forgotten his audience. Two words kindly aliens. Thats right this movie actually indulges in scenes of long-legged graceful kindly aliens. They dont take up a lot of screen time but they need to be mentioned; otherwise people may buy tickets to ""A.I."" unsuspecting. These aliens put their skinny fingers on a troubled boys shoulder. They tell him comforting things and speak with British accents. If this sounds good run dont walk to ""A.I."" Most of ""A.I."" is set closer in time in a somewhat distant but not unrecognizable future. People look and dress about the same as today but drive three-wheeled cars and spend their lives in houses with cold interiors that call to mind Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmans place in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Human- looking robots are everywhere relieving people of housework and sexual longings. But theyre like the tin man in ""The Wizard of Oz."" They dont have emotions or affections. William Hurt strong in his brief scenes as a scientific visionary introduces a breakthrough -- ""David"" a little-boy robot capable of love played by Haley Joel Osment. Frances OConnor and Sam Robards a grieving couple bring him into their home as a child substitute. The opening minutes are both heartfelt and creepy in the best way. David laughs at odd times and pesters his human mother Monica by being smirky and constantly underfoot. RICH AND STRANGE ""A.I."" is rich with possibility in its first half hour with the strangeness of a robots being part of a middle-class family raising all kinds of issues. If a person loves a robot is that pathetic or idiotic? If a person is mean to a robot is that immoral? And whats the social etiquette? Do kids have a right to treat a robot kid differently from an organic one? Things deepen further when in a fairly remarkable little scene Monica reads David a sequence of words. He is programmed that on the seventh word hell imprint Monica as his mother and love her forever and sure enough we see it happen. On the final word Osments face softens and hes suffused with love. Osment is either the best child actor in history or hes tied with Shirley Temple. But not long afterward ""A.I."" goes off the tracks. The domestic story is dropped and the film becomes a futuristic ""Pinocchio"" in which David roams a hostile landscape looking for a blue fairy to make him into a real boy. There are two built-in problems with that as a plotline 1) The audience knows his search is hopeless so the search has no suspense or drama; 2) Being hopeless this is essentially a nightmare story one of Pinocchio in purgatory. Yet its directed by Mr. Warmth. SLICK GIGOLO The result is a light heartwarming tone for a story more pessimistic than anything out of Kafka. Jude Law shows up midway as a slick gigolo robot as though Davids journey were a seriocomic odyssey calling for a Jar Jar Binks- type companion. Law may be agile and adept but the gigolo robot has no business in the movie and he could easily be cut without any effect on the story. The middle of ""A.I."" tries its audiences patience. Yet its nothing compared with what follows in the last section. Without going into detail the most vicious parodist of Spielberg could not devise anything more precious more shallow or more patently ridiculous. Its almost worth seeing just to see how bad it is. Almost. ""A.I."" may be an interesting failure but its a failure.

Artificial Intelligence"" is an often-disturbing film about an experimental robotic boy who yearns for human relationships. Though originally developed by legendary director Stanley Kubrick Spielberg inherited the project when Kubrick passed away in 1999. Like Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" its a sci-fi fable that examines the ruthlessness of technology and emotional detachment. Though many of the sets are reminiscent of the spaceships in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" thematically speaking the Spielberg picture that ""A.I."" most closely resembles is ""Schindlers List"" both movies are infused with the terror of facing down a society that views you as less than human. Set in a distant future in which the world is overrun by rising ocean levels over-population and starvation ""A.I."" follows the plight of David (Haley Joel Osment in an astoundingly subtle expressive performance) the first robot thats ever been programmed to love. Davids creator Professor Hobby (William Hurt) is aiming to build a device that can comfort couples who cant conceive children or arent allowed to by population-controlling laws.

Artificial Intelligence"" to be another warm and gooey ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982). Stanley Kubrick devotees will likewise be disappointed if theyre looking for the cool and calculating isolation of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (1968). The only truly satisfied customers may be fans of Haley Joel Osment this remarkable 13-year-old is absolutely amazing as David a robot or mecha that has been programmed to love humans. ""A.I."" is based on a short story called ""Super-Toys Last All Summer"" by science fiction author Brian Aldiss. The intriguing tale is about a robotic boy who tries to connect emotionally with his human mother. Kubrick purchased the rights 20 years ago and consulted with his friend and fellow cinematic genius Spielberg about the project for years. After Kubricks death in 1999 -- and following the legendary directors wishes -- Spielberg decided to write and direct the film himself. The film is set in the distant future. Global warming has caused Earths ice caps to melt and much of the planet is under water including New York City (making ""A.I."" a political statement as well as a movie). Society is technologically eons ahead of our present abilities and robots of all kinds now do much of the manual and routine labor. VIDEOS Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law star in A.I.

Artificial Intelligence (out of four) Stars Haley Joel Osment Jude Law Frances OConnor Director Steven Spielberg Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for some sexual content and violent images The intentionally sterile opening third of A.I. Artificial Intelligence the highly anticipated film from Steven Spielberg takes place mostly indoors and doesnt look or feel like anything the director has ever done before. The rest -- set outdoors and later underwater -- involves a homeward journey resembling E.T.s and robots that look mighty familiar. It has so many echoes of the filmmakers past successes that the movie threatens to veer into self-parody. Add 2 1/4 hours of methodical pacing and its no surprise that this puzzling film already is generating some of the most polarized reactions in the directors almost 30-year canon. The long-nurtured sci-fi fantasy that Spielberg took over from Stanley Kubrick is as strange disjointed and wondrous as youd expect from such an odd cinematic coupling. Read more Video A.I. Artificial Intelligence trailer Stories Review A.I. gives chilly touch to human emotions Spielberg completes Kubricks vision A.I. not for children The intricate plot behind A.I. Web mystery A.I. Teddy is cute cuddly but his growl is not Adapted from a Brian Aldiss short story and Spielbergs first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind it warns of robot technology in a futuristic society struggling with environmental chaos. A couple is given an artificial boy equipped with emotions to fill their void after their real-life son becomes ill. The mechanical David (Haley Joel Osment a wonder) fails to grasp human subtleties and household disruptions follow. These eventually force his distraught mother (Frances OConnor) to abandon the kid-copy in a marauder-filled forest where he becomes prey for robot bounty hunters. Her deed launches a unique screen odyssey (Oedipus meets Pinocchio) in which the 10-year-old seeks his way back home. He meets robot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who services human women in what looks like a red-light district theme park in the woods. The two are captured and taken to a ""Flesh Fair"" where robots are tortured. Next on their journey is Manhattan now submerged in the Atlantic. This is a lot of story for even a long movie and the middle section -- its rowdiness extremely welcome after a drawn-out though skillful setup -- seems underdeveloped. Yet the climax feels overdeveloped Its Spielberg-dreamy with robots that look like Encounters old aliens a Blue Fairy with Meryl Streeps voice and scenes for Davids teddy bear a walking talking sage. A.I. touches the emotions but only in individual scenes. What a thrill for example to see Laws body movements recall Jack Haleys Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz while delivering a performance just as great. And what a chill it is to see David nearly destroying himself by doing whats usually good for kids eating spinach. The overall story however isnt as touching. Both distant and sentimental its too cozy for Kubrick and too chilly for Spielberg who hasnt fashioned a movie this frustrating since 1987s Empire of the Sun. Like that film this is a movie to be knocked chewed and gummed but not dismissed. Its the first 2001 release Ive rushed to see twice. There havent been many this year and well be lucky if we get another one this summer.

Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Drama; Starring Haley Joel Osment Frances OConnor Brendan Gleeson William Hurt Ben Kingsley Jude Law Sam Robards Jake Thomas; Director Steven Spielberg; Author Brian Aldiss Steven Spielberg Ian Watson; Producer (group) Amblin Entertainment Stanley Kubrick Productions Warner Bros.; Release Date Wide 06/29/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 145; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Universal Warner Bros. Posted June 29 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT A.I. was a pet project never fulfilled by the late Stanley Kubrick who according to rabbinic legend explicated by Steven Spielberg was keen as far back as the 1980s on making a picture about a machine built boy programmed to feel real love and his effect on real humans faced with the unnerving implications of loving a machine back. (Kubricks inspiration ""Super Toys Last All Summer Long"" a science fiction short story by Brian Aldiss first published in Harpers Bazaar in 1969.) Actually Spielberg recounts the older man used to discuss the possibility of the younger man directing - ""a Stanley Kubrick production of a Steven Spielberg film"" - and prepared extensive storyboards. And so presumably its those archives and remembered ""phone a friend"" conversations that inform the content of the screenplay Spielberg eventually wrote himself. But its Spielberg all Spielberg who chose Haley Joel Osment to embody the proto roboboy David and to shape our sentimental response based on Osments famous default expression of sad gravity a phiz Dickens could love. And its Spielberg Hollywoods foremost shaper of baby boomer nostalgia who gives Osment lines of dialogue that are utterly Spielbergian in their distillation of ""boyhood in America"" rootlessness ""Mommy will you die?"" ""I want Mommy to love me more."" ""My brain is falling out."" (Re that last Who knew David was familiar with the work of Soupy Sales?) Its a tribute to Osments very real talent that he manages to ditch the saintliness forced on him in the execrable ""Pay It Forward"" and its clear that the young actor is not just playing a variation on the Very Special Boy role that made him a star in ""The Sixth Sense"" either Osment has a sophisticated understanding of the shifts between the circuitry of ""mecha"" (i.e. mechanical robot) and ""orga"" (i.e. organic human) responses. Its a tribute to Spielberg too that we can practically see the director biting a knuckle holding back from bursting into the visual equivalent of ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" In scenes at home with the new mother (Frances OConner) who David is imprinted to love the ambivalent father he calls ""Henry"" (Sam Robards) and the couples jealous biological son (Jake Thomas) the director and his brilliant longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski blur distort and fade the borders and palette of domesticity sacrificing the golden American innocence look and lighting Spielberg adores so much. Osments David is Spielbergs stand in. Kubricks rep on the other hand is the revved up ""love mecha"" Gigolo Joe played to hell by Jude Law with glittering hysteria and a sheen by turns clammy and sexy. While David yearns to pedal home to Mommy Joe knows with inhuman sureness that hes programmed for a cold vertiginous Mommyless world of violent Kubrickian sensation. Joe is the kind of amoral animatron of the future that inspired Kubrick to do some of his most fantastic work; hes a golem the anti-Spielberg. And hes the most ravishing invention in all the considerable inventiveness of ""A.I."" In scenes where Law and Osment work together everything dead on and weirdly off about this dense and challenging movie combusts an enactment of the clashing artistic instincts of two strongwilled filmmakers. ""They made us too smart too quick and too many"" Joe tells David as the brilliantine hard hustler and the lambs wool soft boy closely encounter a Flesh Fair (in which mechas are rounded up tortured and destroyed) tour the sex crazed Rouge City and hit rock bottom in an eerily gorgeous underwater Manhattan. There arent many at all like Spielberg and Kubrick directors willing to lasso dreams (thats Steven) and nightmares (thats Stanley) or die trying. ""A.I."" is a clash of the titans a jumble an oedipal drama a carny act. I want to see it again.

""A.I."" is the child of HAL and E.T. The fruit of the unique spectral artistic convergence of two cinematic titans Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick this deeply thoughtful and thoroughly fascinating film about a mechanical boy who yearns to be real contains strong traces of both directors sensibilities The intimate childhood connection and the gentleness of spirit often associated with the former the conceptual boldness and scientifically/philosophically oriented probing of the latter. What this synthesis has wrought unquestionably will be debated at length with reactions sure to be much closer to the incomprehension and uncertainty that normally surrounded Kubricks pictures upon initial release than to what Spielberg is accustomed to. In other words this is not ""E.T."" nor is it a kids film nor even necessarily a major mass-audience film although Spielbergs name high public anticipation and the child-oriented campaign will make it perform like one at least initially. What is beyond question is that Spielberg is a much more mature filmmaker than he was 20 years ago; the man he was when he made ""E.T."" simply would not have been capable of pulling off ""A.I."" In an era when many filmmakers make their most impressive films right off the bat and spend the rest of their careers slowly working their way downward this contrary trajectory is impressive in itself. For the first 50 minutes there is no reason to believe the story will ever leave ""E.T.""-land as the action scarcely moves beyond the confines of a comfortable suburban-style house occupied by upscale parents an adopted cybertronic boy and the latters robot Teddy bear. Much of the films astonishment then resides in the way it almost exponentially grows in impressiveness from one stage to the next. The transitions between acts may not be as jaw-dropping as they were in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but they are similar in the way they vastly increase the works scope stimulation and thematic reach. Second major section takes place in a gaudy exploitative nocturnal world of the near-future reminiscent of ""A Clockwork Orange"" while final section takes a giant ""2001""-like leap forward with the help of elements that draw distinctly upon ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" What all these associations mean in practical terms is that buffs and tradesters will argue endlessly over whether ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is more Spielberg or Kubrick what it would have been like if Kubrick had made it himself and whether the resulting picture benefited from the contributions of both men. What a general audience will confront is an unusually ambitious science fiction film that touches upon such matters as what it means to be a human being the definition of family and the notion of creation in both scientific and religious terms. Viewers predisposed against highfalutin films that take themselves seriously no doubt will turn off and ask what happened to the old Spielberg. But those gagging on the glut of cinematic junk food should welcome this brilliantly made visionary work thats bursting with provocative ideas. Set in an only slightly futuristic world rendered much reduced in land mass and population by melted ice caps opening scene posits a society in need of artificially created beings to perform necessary functions. A genius professor named Hobby (William Hurt) announces to colleagues his intention to build a child robot that can dream and have a subconscious and an emotional life. Twenty months later such a kid has been placed with Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances OConnor) a couple whose son Martin has been in deep freeze for five years pending a cure to his crippling disease. The first glimpse of David (Haley Joel Osment) presents the sandy-haired blue-eyed boy in explicitly angelic terms draping him in white garb worthy of his immaculate conception. Once David is ""imprinted"" with his familial bond he starts calling Monica ""Mommy"" and worrying about the fact that she will one day die. In an attempt to further the transferal of her feelings from her ""late"" son to David Monica gives him Martins Teddy (the ""supertoy"" of the 1969 Brian Aldiss short story that inspired the film) an intelligent computerized bear that for a while seems like a mobile and more companionable version of HAL in ""2001."" Suddenly however a healthy Martin (Jake Thomas) comes home and after competing for the affections of Teddy begins to treat David as his own supertoy. For his part having thoroughly ingested ""Pinocchio"" at bedtime (although as a ""mecha"" or mechanical being David neither sleeps nor eats) David begins to hope that he too can turn into a real boy. He stuffs spinach down his throat thoroughly messing up his circuitry and has an alarming episode with Martin that ends up at the bottom of a swimming pool. Monica is forced to the dreadful decision of dumping David with Teddy in tow like an unwanted pet in the middle of a distant forest. Disciplined and precise in style this first section has a claustrophobic even hermetic feel; the near-absence of exteriors is accentuated by house windows that are frosted or blasted with light from behind eliminating the sense of a world outside. Spielberg concentrates with intense focus on the gradual accrual of emotions themes and motifs having to do with the ties that bind and dont. With no indication of where the story might be headed a somewhat deliberate pace and method set in but it all remains intriguing enough to hold the interest and lay the foundation for what shortly becomes a very imposing structure. Part two shifts to a seedy urban world where a handsome guy named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) is literally the cock of the walk. This ""lover robot"" is a ""mecha"" designed exclusively for its users pleasure. ""Once youve had a lover robot youll never want a real man again"" Joe charmingly boasts to his latest client before he finds trouble and flees to the countryside where he along with David and many other mechas are rounded up by some terrifying ""Biker Hounds"" and carted off to a ghastly entertainment arena called Flesh Fair. A nightmarish stadium where the bloodthirsty crowd is treated to a spectacle combining the most unsavory aspects of gladiatorial combat the French Revolution a goth concert and a three-ring circus Flesh Fair boasts as its main event the execution of mechas by extremely imaginative means. Gruesome and scary enough to make ""A.I."" the source of bad dreams for children long sequence (shot in the giant Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach) summons up questions of the definition of humanity as well as positioning David as potentially representing the opportunity for a fresh start whatever that might mean for ""humanity"" in the broadest sense of the term. Trio of David Joe and Teddy manages an escape from Flesh Fair to a gaudy metropolis called Rouge City. There several of the narrative and thematic seeds earlier planted begin to grow. A sort of ""Blade Runner"" lite in general terms the urban environment here represents one of the most plausible visions of the urban future ever put onscreen as its neither too fanciful nor too dire just lacking in soul or good taste. Continuing in the ""Pinocchio"" vein a virtual ""wizard"" called Dr. Know informs the visitors that the Blue Fairy will be found at the End of the World which for David represents the place where he began life in the offices of Professor Hobby. What happens in the final act is best not detailed but its amazingly set in a New York recognizable only by the tops of familiar skyscrapers poking out of an ocean that has otherwise engulfed the city. It also possesses elements that unavoidably stir echoes of ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters"" in their expression of highly advanced life forms and the suggestion that human beings could represent just one stage in the evolutionary life cycle a stage that at a certain point was rendered obsolete. All this is heady enormously stimulating stuff the sort of thing one is no longer accustomed to confronting in mainstream Hollywood entertainment. One can speculate that it took the inspiration of Kubricks lofty thematic interests (as well as his ghost peering over his shoulder) to push Spielberg to be this ambitious in a sci-fi format but this issue is incidental to his having proved himself up to the task of taking on subjects of this magnitude and making them dramatically absorbing. Working from voluminous notes and a screen story written for Kubrick by Ian Watson based on the Aldiss story Spielberg takes screenplay credit here for the first time since ""Close Encounters."" Serviceable dialogue could have used a little more punch here and there but the only place the writing falls notably short is in the brief opening and especially closing narration which would have benefited from a more exalted and poetic touch. Although one develops a real empathy for David and the film becomes moving when it intends to there is no question that the atmosphere is colder and the approach more analytical than in previous Spielberg pictures. Brakes have been put on what might have been sentimentalized or emotionally milked situations. Stylistically it is all Spielbergs with his characteristic backlighting and quicksilver progressions in evidence courtesy of his ace collaborators cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn. One of the more surprising contributions comes from composer John Williams. There is still perhaps too much music but its feel -- light playful and serious by turns -- is quite unlike any of the scores hes previously written for Spielberg. Production designer Rick Carter has done a tremendous job creating a wide range of sets from the Swintons warmly inviting home to the visually vulgar future. Special visual effects and animation by Industrial Light amp; Magic with credit going most prominently to Michael Lantieri Dennis Muren and Scott Farrar as well as Stan Winstons robot character design and animatronics are top of the line and in the case of the submerged Manhattan hauntingly realized. Osment again proves himself a superb young actor not emoting in obvious fashion but strongly holding centerscreen for nearly 2-1/2 hours. Other perfs are serviceably low-key with Law doing a lively if limited turn as a peacock among robots and OConnor registering most of the storys most explicit emotions. Buried deep in the end credits is the fact that some big names -- Robin Williams (as Dr. Know) Ben Kingsley Meryl Streep and Chris Rock -- contributed the voices for some of the animatronic characters.
