This is a home-grown French actioner that wears its sincere desire to entertain on its flamboyantly tailored sleeve. A little Sergio Leone here a little ""Sleepy Hollow"" there a grand helping of late royal-era Gaul with its wigs and finery and uh martial arts-style confrontations galore are all deftly melded in ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" an attempt to elucidate the French urban legend of the so-called Beast of Gevaudan -- a giant invincible wolf-like creature that killed more than 100 people in the 1760s. Highbrow crix may gnash their teeth but this is a home-grown French actioner that wears its sincere desire to entertain on its flamboyantly tailored sleeve. One of the most expensive extravaganzas ever produced in France pic borrows from many genres but infuses the hybrid with a distinctive relentlessly flashy style thats sure to appeal to auds raised on computer games and tailored to delight the legions of nerds who support horror fantasy and sci-fi pics made by fellow aficionados. (Tyro helmer Christophe Gans founded the renegade film mag Starfix two decades ago at age 20.) Pic has been sold to many territories but in those still available distribs with a hankering to attract young auds to subtitled fare -- a task that may be substantially easier now that ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" has re-broken the long-frozen ice -- might be able to turn a profit with this elaborate and slickly made adventure. Pic will seem overly long and a tad repetitive to viewers who can get enough of ""Matrix""-style skirmishes and painstakingly overblown sound design but probably will feel just right to its target audience. All of the estimated 220 million franc (31 million) budget is definitely on screen. Inspired by the still-unexplained killing spree between 1764 and 1767 during Louis XVs reign pic is told in flashback by a nobleman about to fall into the hands of the great unwashed during the permutation of the French Revolution known as The Terror. Narrative odyssey throws in everything but the kitchen sink heaving bosoms witty banter hallucinogens political expediency religious zealots violent ambushes helpless maidens an impatient monarch and enticing loose women -- all sandwiched in-between very cool fights. The films major accomplishment is in creating and pretty much sustaining a brooding quasi-dangerous mood riddled with anachronistic pop touches that somehow fit. The tale feels serious -- even though its all over the map and about to fall off the edge. Chevalier Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) a naturalist has been dispatched from his duties in the kings gardens to track down the beast and sketch and stuff it for posterity. He is accompanied by Mani (former martial arts champ Mark Dacascos) a Canadian Indian who has little to say to humans but speaks fluent Nature. De Fronsac takes an immediate liking to Marianne de Morangias (Emilie Dequenne star of ""Rosetta"") the spirited daughter of Count de Morangias (Jean Yanne amusingly laconic) and his flitty wife (Edith Scob). De Fronsac gets the cold shoulder from Mariannes one-armed brother Jean-Francois (a snarling imperious Vincent Cassel) who lives to hunt fashioning his own silver bullets. The small town supports a suspiciously well-populated brothel where the dark mysterious Sylvia (Monica Bellucci) tells fortunes and blandishes her pricey possibly demonic favors on De Fronsac. Every so often the unseen beast pursues some fetching innocent and does a Cuisinart number on her with its colossal jaws. Lithe and effortlessly charismatic as the Canadian Indian Dacascos gets to strut his compelling stuff; as the hunter-naturalist the versatile Le Bihan is always fun to watch but doesnt burn up the screen in the same way as his intense sidekick. Dequennes charming and classy perf should silence any curmudgeons who still dont think she deserved (her half of) best actress honors at Cannes in 1999 while the shapely Bellucci lends over-the-top exoticism to the never remotely staid mix. The animatronics as well as the contributions from Jim Hensons Creature Shop dont top the fighting skeletons in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" but theres plenty of time to speculate about what the beast looks like before its finally fully revealed on screen. Gans delight in moving the camera is matched by impressive attention to costumes and accessories as well as pro touches like visible breath in winter-set scenes.

Like Charles Shyers The Affair of the Necklace this gorgeously bloody divinely flighty film from cult director Christophe Gans (Crying Freeman Necronomicon) builds on real events foreshadowing the comeuppance of the French aristocracy. Thats all Brotherhood has in common with Shyers tepid picture for here the metaphor for the decline and fall of a corrupt and decaying elite is not a royal bauble fallen into the wrong hands but that durable staple of Gothic horror a wild beast that preys on the innocent. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As legend has it the Beast of Gevaudan roamed a rural province during the reign of Louis XV dining out on the innards of women and children. With the peasants revolting at home over excesses at Versailles and his international reputation in tatters from bickering with the British over possession of American colonies Louis tried to regain street cred by parading a gussied-up garden-variety wolf through the streets of Paris as proof of his power to vanquish evil -- only to look like a fool as the actual Beast continued to polish off proles by the dozen. As the movie opens the king has dispatched eminent scientist Gregoire de Fronsac (played by eminent beefcake Samuel le Bihan) along with a muscle-bound Iroquois blood brother named Mani (Hawaiian martial-arts champion Mark Dacascos) to investigate. Unlike de Fronsac Mani -- taciturn half-naked dumbly heroic -- is a wholly invented character a vision of Native Americanhood scarcely more evolved than that offered in boys adventure comics of the 1940s and 50s yet updated into a kind of manga culture hero whose fight sequences are meant to thrill and arouse the young male demographic of the 21st century even as Gans articulates a critique of racism. Similarly the tasty local wench Marianne (Emilie Dequenne light-years away from her prize-winning performance as the frumpy young vagrant in the Dardennes brothers Rosetta) who catches de Fronsacs eye makes a calculated reach for the attention of their 21st-century dates. With his reverence for nature and penchant for dancing with wolves Mani is a Rousseauian figure the noble animus of de Fronsacs Enlightenment rationalist. Which means that neither man will go over big with the locals of Gevaudan who prove in more ways than one to be a far more feral and frightening lot than the Beast itself a perversely endearing critter out of the Jim Henson Creature Shop. Indeed Brotherhood has its goofy side -- its a sleek creepily atmospheric popcorn entertainment. Still Gans intellectual ambition flies higher than mere commercial instinct. True to genre Brotherhood suggests that the beasts we invoke are projections of our own corrupt lusts and fears. Gans toys cleverly with our expectations that the Beast will symbolize the coming revolution then veers off into terrors that couldnt be timelier if hed planned it that way as de Fronsac and Mani discover that the communitys spiritual-political bedrock lies in far muddier waters than any insurgent of the period could have anticipated. No travel-poster South of France this Gevaudan is a dark dank outpost drenched with rain and fogged by a sense of foreboding that erupts into outright horror whenever the Beast strikes. Giddily over the top it may be but Brotherhood of the Wolf offers a sobering reminder that extreme times bring extreme reactions and that we are far from the first -- nor no doubt will we be the last -- to feel the random sting of the righteous fanatic.BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF | Directed by CHRISTOPHE GANS | Adapted by STEPHANE CABEL and GANS from an original script by CABEL | Produced by SAMUEL HADIDA and RICHARD GRANDPIERRE | Released by Universal Focus At selected theaters Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 18 2002 1106 AM Werewolves of Paris Brotherhood of the Wolf is a French historical forensics blowout; The Shipping News stays at arms length; Monsters Ball knows not what it says. By David Edelstein Approached in the proper spirit the two-and-a-half-hour French historical martial-arts romance Grand Guignol forensics horror blowout Brotherhood of the Wolf (Universal Focus) is good for nasty chuckles and even a few hearty whoops You have to admire a movie that endeavors to moosh together every successful cross-cultural action picture ever made. Advertisement After a French Revolution-set prologue to establish its pedigree the movie promptly shifts into Jaws mode with a young blond lass bloodying herself on assorted rocks to escape what locals call ""la bete"" described as a giant woman-and-child-eating wolf. Its no use running though Whatever is producing that Dolbyized grrrrrrrr-raschhhh whips the poor girl around snaps her spine and yanks her off-screen to be further mauled. To help in the investigation King Louis XV dispatches dashing adventurer/taxidermist Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) and his ""blood-brother""/sidekick Mani (Mark Dacascos) a Native American with liquid brown eyes and a mean corkscrew-swivel-kick. The latter is a Mani of few words which is just as well since his French accent is worse even than mine The most outlandish thing in the movie isnt his kung-fu calisthenics but that the French dont break up in hysterics at his pronunciation. Even the characters must know how important he is for the American and Asian markets. They are not entirely credible our heroes. In a world of bigots and religious zealots Fronsac and Mani combine the most progressive aspects of science and New Age spirituality. Fronsac the cinemas first liberal rationalist pantheist forensic martial-arts swashbuckler suspects that the true demon is human and that the answer to the murders must lie with an unholy alliance between the fanatical aristocracy--at whose splendid chateaux he is a welcome guest--and the degenerate proles. Mani the lone survivor of an exterminated tribe has a mystical communion with animals and religious martyrs of yore (""People died here ... I can hear their cries""); between kickboxing bouts he tries to solve the mystery with the help of the regions wolves who clearly dont appreciate being vilified (and hunted down) for the crimes of some lupine poseur. Both men keep their guard up among the locals but neither can resist the pull of sundry nubile wenches Fronsac is torn between a kinky hot-tempered Italian courtesan (Monica Bellucci) and a chubby-cheeked throaty ingenue (Emilie Dequenne); Mani is waylaid by a puffy-lipped Angelina Jolie-ish peasant who likes to toss her black mane and stick her tongue down the throats of various Road Warrior refugees. The movie is a teeming mixture of The Curse of the Werewolf and Cry of the Banshee and Jaws and Sleepy Hollow and A Fistful of Dollars and Let Joy Reign Supreme and The Name of the Rose and Fists of Fury and Mad Max and Once Upon a Time in China II and The Last of theMohicans and The Hound of the Baskervilles and maybe a thousand other pictures that rumble around in the collective unconscious of schlock fiends. And I have no problem with that. In the right hands this could have been a recipe for the most rollicking exploitation picture ever made. The trouble is that the director Christophe Gans prefers his battle scenes heavily chopped-up Instead of fluid acrobatics we get hyperbolic montages of kicking feet somersaulting torsos and fists connecting with faces. Gans is also fond of tacky slow motion overamplified bone crunches and the kind of metallic whooshes that are more appropriate as an accompaniment to spinning disco balls. The film would have been helped by a shade more Ang Lee and a shade less Six Million DollarMan. That said the last hour of Brotherhood of the Wolf attains the kind of superconcentrated out-for-vengeance intensity that leaves you feeling kicked in the head--which isnt the worst thing you can say about this sort of flick. No Crouching Tiger swoons into oblivion just a flurry of righteous throat-slashings disembowelments and impalings. No wonder this was the biggest movie ever in France. Taste might have actually interfered with some of the best shots such as the one in which the camera prowls the naked expanse of Monica Bellucci and her mounds of pink-ivory flesh become--in an instant--the snow-covered hills and dales of the southern French countryside. It kinda makes you think this will be Frances biggest DVD as well. Advertisement One of the many things Ive learned as a film critic is that novels with sentences like The Magnum swung around fast and beside Frank the table exploded in a shower of poker chips as he felt his body twist and then launch itself over the ottoman firing one shot two the first bullet ripping through Murphys right hand while the second punctured his spleen and sent an ocher-tinted porridge splashing hard against the pale wall ... often make very entertaining movies while novels with sentences like His thoughts churned like the amorphous thing that ancient sailors drifting into arctic half-light called the Sea Lung; a heaving sludge of ice under fog where air blurred into water where liquid was solid where solids dissolved where the sky froze and light and dark muddled ... Advertisement tend to be rather arms-length experiences. The latter sentence is from Annie Proulxs lovely The Shipping News and that level of introspection isnt entirely representative She writes lots of evocative dialogue too. But her prose is even unhurried almost lapping in its rhythm and narrative comes second to mood. More fascinating than the passive protagonist Quoyle are the bits of Newfoundland mariners history the minutiae of the tides and North Atlantic currents the descriptions of various sailors knots and their relevance in the progression of the characters understanding of love. Its a book of suspended moments of hanging strands that finally coalesce as mysteriously (and amazingly) as the knots that dapple the pages. Anyway its January and time to review this years prestigious Miramax/Lasse Halstrom picture adapted inevitably from a critically acclaimed feminist/humanist best seller. As with The Cider House Rules (1999) and Chocolat (2000) The Shipping News opened at the very very end of December in two markets the better to enter the publics consciousness at the exact moment that Academy Award nominations are being harvested. (Miramax is really going balls-out for Oscars this year with four one-week-in-December releases and thats not counting the long long long platforming of its In the Bedroom which only went into wide release last week.) I liked Cider House I hated Chocolat and I half-like The Shipping News which doesnt really work but has a good cast and great craggy ocean-framed scenery. Its one of those escape-from-civilization sagas in which a despairing hero (Kevin Spacey) and his young daughter return to their ancestral Newfoundland home (its in the northern tip across from Labrador) in lieu of spiritual suicide and become awakened from the frigid sleep that has been their lives. Halstrom is an even-tempered storyteller--his strength is that he never lets anything bog down. But Proulxs is a boggy sort of tale and there are places where the narrative needs to catch its breath. A lot of the seminal events--near-drownings resurrections revelations of buried secrets--are well-done but Hallstrom doesnt linger purposefully enough in their aftermath. He hurries along as if toward some climactic explosion which of course never comes. As the credits rolled I saw an audience full of respectful shruggers. Its fun to see Cate Blanchett do a trashy-nympho turn as Quoyles first wife Petal and to get another glimpse of the likable Rhys Ifan (Hugh Grants cretinous flatmate in Notting Hill) as an inadvertent transplant (via boat wreck) to Newfoundland. I admired Julianne Moore for playing Wavey the new woman in Quoyles life in such an enigmatic locked-away manner--its true to the character. But the movie sinks or swims on its Quoyle and with Spacey Im afraid its dashed against the rocks. Even great actors have limitations and Spaceys is that he cant play a role that doesnt tap into his anger. Trying to be mild and dopey he lets his face go slack knocks out the lower register in his voice and mugs like crazy. He cant show the ways in which Quoyle is transformed because he never lives inside the man. His awakening is from his own hammy shtick. In ""The Movie Club"" two weeks ago I was brutally disrespectful toward Monsters Ball (Lions Gate Films) and that was a mistake. After the sweetening and self-censorship in so many films I should have recognized that the director Marc Forster risked much in making his protagonists (played by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry) so cruel and abusive toward their children and so groggy in their repentance. I should have admitted that I dont have a clue what the movie is saying and whether its ultimate romanticism is meant to be a) ironic; b) hopeful; or c) both at once. I suspect the answer is c but thats a tough combination to pull off in such a draggy-realist mode and with a lead actress whos so inept at portraying emotion. Monsters Ball is full of longueurs and monosyllables and deliberate misframing but the story is too garishly awful to qualify as a ""slice of life."" When a movie wrenches you with the deaths of children then leaves you with nothing to take home but your confusion it can make you thirsty for the blood of directors.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Brotherhood of the Wolf | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brotherhood-of-the-wolf ) Brotherhood of the Wolf (France 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli In this country French movies are mostly known for being artistic and airy (or to put it less kindly serious and stodgy). And while many French directors would probably agree that this is their aim (being artistic and airy not serious and stodgy) Christophe Gans has elected to defy the reputation of his countrys film industry by producing a motion picture that owes more to American and Asian cinema than it does to the traditions of Godard Truffaut and Rohmer. Any and all attempts to take this movie seriously will have the average movie-goer convulsed with laughter. Brotherhood of the Wolf never pretends to be something that it isnt. Oh there are costumes to be sure but thats just to facilitate the setting of the 18th century. Anyone who mistakes this for a costume drama is not aware of what kind of film they have ventured into. So what is Brotherhood of the Wolf? Its a period-piece action/adventure movie with elements of the following genres thrown in for good measure martial arts horror and mystery/intrigue. Plus the events represented herein are based on an actual historical event although to paraphrase a popular saying Gans never lets the facts get in the way of a good story. Most of what transpires here is pure fantasy and has little to do with the real ""Beast of Gevaudan"" which roamed the remote countryside in 1764 France killing several dozen women and children. In fact Brotherhood of the Wolf owes a greater debt to Jaws and werewolf movies than to the period-piece dramas that European studios have become expert at. When the story opens it is 1764 and GrA(c)goire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) and his faithful Iroquois companion Mani (Mark Dacascos) have arrived in Gevaudan to hunt down and kill the fearsome beast that has been terrorizing the district. Rumors about it abound but the common belief is that its a wolf-like demon. Fronsac a man of science disputes this. He believes that there is something more prosaic at work than the devil. Soon after arriving in Gevaudan Fronsac meets the twisted Jean-FranASSois de Morangias (Vincent Cassel) a bitterly sardonic young man who has lost one arm and his pretty sister Marianne (Emilie Dequenne) who falls for Fronsac. Other figures to cross Fronsacs path are Thomas dApcher (JA(c)rA(c)mie RA(c)nier) a young nobleman who joins the newcomers hunt; Sylvia (the divine Monica Bellucci the belle from Malena) a courtesan with a secret mission; and a clergyman Sardis (Jean-FranASSois StA(c)venin). With the exception of a couple isolated fights theres not much action during Brotherhood of the Wolfs first hour - most of what transpires is exposition or used to establish characters and relationships. Indeed we only catch half-glimpses of the Beast throughout the movies first half with Gans taking a page from Steven Spielbergs book by showing less to build tension. Once the action starts however it rarely lets up. We are treated to one martial arts showdown after another leaving one to wonder whether an ancestor of Jackie Chans roamed 18th century France dispensing fighting lessons. Brotherhood of the Wolf reminded me a little of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in intent if not in specifics. Apparently these similarities are what attracted the attention of Universal studios. Acknowledging the box office appeal of the 2000 feature they bought the U.S. Distribution rights and have decided to release the film under their own label (rather than that of their art house arm Univeral Focus). Today its a rare thing indeed for a subtitled movie to open in the United States under the auspices of a major Hollywood studio. Gans film has the look and feel of a high-end comic book (or to purists a ""graphic novel""). The production is steeped in style from the gorgeous widescreen cinematography to the slow motion bursts of action. We see individual droplets of water mud and blood cascade from their sources as battles erupt across the sodden fog-enshrouded terrain. Interiors are riots of color and fabric as if a decorator went wild in a frenzy of 18th century excess. And while the martial arts scenes lack the ballet-like choreography and wire-enabled flights of fancy featured in Crouching Tiger they are presented with a fluidity of motion and a degree of kinetic energy that standard fight sequences do not have. There are moments such as when Mani holds off a hoard of cultists or when three men take on the Beast made for ""oohs"" and ""aahs"". Brotherhood of the Wolf isnt exactly a ""guilty pleasure"" - there is more artistry involved in the production than is immediately obvious - but its strongest appeal will be to those who dont mind movies that stray beyond the accepted boundaries of what we call ""reality"". The movie has something in it to appeal to just about everyone - religious politics incestuous longing a little gratuitous sex and nudity savage fight scenes a dollop of romance and an impressive looking monster that is both more and less than it seems to be. In short Brotherhood of the Wolf is daring in its approach and successful in its result - assuming the result is to provide pure entertainment to the viewer.

"How Do You Say Dog in French? Wolf washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies How Do You Say Dog in French? Wolf Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 11 2002 I dont know about you but one thing I can never get enough of is watching guys in three-cornered hats kung-fu fight in the mud. And ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" a big-budget French thing is full of kung fu and three-cornered hats. Way cool right? No. Way uncool. So much for French haute cuisine du cinema. This ones a turkey as big as the Eiffel Tower but its bad in a particularly American way Its wildly overdone it throws in everything in an attempt to appeal to everyone its gargantuan and anti-logical pointlessly ornate and pointlessly violent. Plus it has French people in it Certainly the loopiest thing thats come along in many a fair year ""Wolf"" is a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions that ultimately results in nothing so much as a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions. Nothing in it really connects with anything else. It can only be described as an 18th-century French werewolf kung fu costume drama with Indians and Gypsies and Italian Western overtones. Oh Lord youre thinking another one of those. The story actually takes place in flashback; the frame around it set in 1790-something in the revolutionary ardor of Thermidor introduces us to a nobleman about to meet the incisive Mme. Guillotine and her cutting-edge wit to the thrills yelps and burps of an enthusiastic crowd of dirty faces. As he waits he recalls the most significant event of his time the gory affair of the wolf. That was way back in . . . yes I remember it now . . . 1765. Its a very wet 1765 and France is suffering a variety of plagues Bourbon kings high taxes shrinking peasant wench cleavage overambitious cinematographers endless rain and in a far southern province some kind of big bad wolf who eats more than pigs. In that sad damp Gallic cow-pie pasture two studs from Paris show up the first a seductive anthropologist-detective and the second a kung-fu-fighting Iroquois by way of the French and Indian Wars. They have been sent by the crown to investigate the mounting slaughter of women and children by the cunning beast which appears to be a cross between Rin Tin Tin and a Cuisinart. And they are played by exceedingly attractive men Samuel Le Bihan (Fronsac the Anthropologist) and Mark Dacascos (Mani the Iroquois) one fair one dark one yappy one silent. But both so pretty. In fact the movie is largely populated by people of exceeding handsomeness (Monica Bellucci leads this parade but Emilie Dequenne is another Vincent Cassel still another) while every nonspeaking Gypsy-peasant-wolfchow extra is a filthy warty toothless troglodyte with a face packed in grime slime and crud. The young director Christophe Gans suffers from an overabundance of nostalgie de la boue - he smears boue (mud) everywhere Fronsac and Mani work an amusing line Like the hero in Caleb Carrs ""The Alienist"" they apply logic and forensics to a series of crimes that have yet to be so analyzed. They interview people. They take measurements. They make drawings. They conjecture philosophically. Mani talks to trees (Indian remember?). This seems on the way to yielding interesting results until the movie swells beyond accountability and becomes completely ridiculous. Then it turns out that not only the Indian (played after all by the star of several martial-arts flicks) knows kung fu but by some weird logic so too does the anthropological forensic detective and the next thing you know hes spin-kicking and dragon-punching with the best of them. Yet the fighting which fills so much of the second very long half of ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"" isnt particularly impressive. Its a French imitation of American imitations of Hong Kong originals and nothing feels fresh or unusual beyond the ludicrousness of time and setting. Worse it doesnt feel authentic; photo tricks editing slo-mo and that sort of legerdemain suggest we are watching not athletes but movie fakes. At least in ""The Matrix"" Keanu learned basic martial-arts moves. Not so for Sammy Le Bien. The movie which culminates in the discovery of a debauched aristocratic cult - yes another one of those too - even manages to make the fabulous natural asset Monica Bellucci boring in an underused part as a courtesan/papist spy which figures somehow into a plot so byzantine only Frodo himself could figure it out. Its a very long night at the movies to see guys fight in funny hats. BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF (R 140 minutes) - contains violence gore and je ne sais quoi. at the Cineplex Odeon Wisconsin Avenue.

"Howlin Wolf washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Howlin Wolf Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 11 2002 ""BROTHERHOOD of the Wolf"" about an 18th-century monster that terrorizes a rural French region has its moments. In fact it has too many of them. At 2 hours and 20 minutes and with enough characters to take up a few floors at a big hotel it feels about an act too long. Director Christophe Ganss intention is to pump postmodern excitement into the traditional French costume drama. Inspired by real accounts of the Beast of Gevaudan that reportedly killed more than 100 people in the 18th century he turns ""Brotherhood"" into a powder-and-wig action flick. We get the message right away A French damsel walking alone through the hilly countryside is stalked by an unseen (and of course extremely noisy) animal. When the monster  and we never see what it is  grabs her shes tossed and mauled like a shark victim from ""Jaws."" Unfortunately Gans appears to have no threshold of pain when it comes to his eardrums. Im sure there have been movies more deafening than this Many war movies perhaps. Or anything produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. And theres probably some industrial training film somewhere called ""The Pneumatic Road Drill Know Your Tool."" But ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" is too loud to even cry uncle. In that opening scene its not the blood that gets to you. Its the sound of the damsels head being bashed against the rocks. Imagine Godzilla pounding a sack of coconuts repeatedly against a brick wall. Now crank up the volume. This assault on the eardrums continues as bullets thud into stick-mounted pumpkins (target practice time) swords cleave skulls flying bodies crash through wooden floors and high-kicking feet crack ribs. What? Martial arts? In the time of Louis Quinze? Thats right. Reports of the Beast and its victims prompt the king to dispatch Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) a Renaissance man to track this predator. Fronsac brings along Mani (Mark Dacascos) an Iroquois Mohawk he met in Canada who has become his blood brother. To the best of my recollection Fronsac does not use the phrase ""trusted Indian companion."" But then again I was blocking my ears. Mani is a whiz with the block chop and roundhouse kick. Hes also good with those slow-motion somersaults in the air. This is not very useful when it comes to fighting the reported Beast. But it comes in handy when all manner of bad guys  imagine Gallic 18th-century versions of Sergio Leone villains  come a-brawling. Many scenes are fun especially Dacascoss fight sequences which are choreographed by Philip Kwok. Danish cinematographer Dan Laustsen creates some beautiful (although often over-the-top) action sequences and editors Sebastien Prangere and David Wu really sharpen the action. But Gans and co-writer Stephane Cabel are not quite as dynamic about the narrative. We spend endless time visiting with all those characters including two love interests for Fronsac one for Mani and enough locals to launch a miniseries. As for the ultimate monster revelation  which I wont give away  I wouldnt say its especially worth waiting for. Not when you could be using the time to schedule that hearing test. BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF (R 140 minutes)  Contains nudity and intense violence. In French with subtitles. At Cineplex Odeon Wisconsin Avenue Cinemas.

USATODAY.com - Wolf bites off too much from American films Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/11/2002 - Updated 0739 AM ET Wolf bites off too much from American films By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Brotherhood of the Wolf (out of four) Stars Samuel Le Bihan Monica Bellucci Vincent Cassel Emilie Dequenne Mark Dacascos Director Christophe Gans Distributor Universal Focus Rating R for strong violence and gore and sexuality/nudity Dont be fooled by the 18th-century setting French dialogue and subtitles This action-packed blood-and-guts extravaganza is more Hollywood than most American films. Certainly French filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut have influenced American directors so its only fair that we return the favor. But we clearly got the better end of the deal in the cultural exchange. Brotherhood of the Wolf is an amalgamation of The Matrix Jurassic Park Titanic and Indiana Jones in a period piece. Villagers are being terrorized by a mysterious beast; the king sends for a renowned scientist to slay the creature. Its a movie for people who wouldnt be caught dead seeing a foreign-language costume drama (read teen and twentysomething males). Wolf has the hard bodies careening violence kick-butt martial arts and spooky thrills to satisfy the Fast and the Furious and Tomb Raider crowd but probably not enough substance to lure the crossover audience dazzled by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Stylishly shot and edited awash in fast-paced jump cuts and whooshing Matrix-style sound effects the eerie story and special effects get pulses racing. But for all its visual verve its gruesome graphic violence is overkill. If you dont enjoy watching bodies eviscerated and entrails exposed this is not your movie. Also animal lovers beware There is an unsettling scene of a pack of graceful wolves being hunted and shot down. Though at times an entertaining B-movie-style adventure saga complete with bodacious bordello babes and a host of unlikely villains Brotherhood is also occasionally tiresome and at 2 1/2 hours too long. Theres a jaw-droppingly useless scene that gives new meaning to smashing pumpkins. Speaking of rock groups the movies three male leads all look as if they might be more at home in spandex than breeches with their flowing locks toned pecs and swaggering attitudes. Samuel Le Bihan who plays Fronsac a naturalist sent to investigate the mysterious beast terrorizing a French village looks a bit like a less frenzied David Lee Roth. And teenage girls will likely drool over the loincloth-clad physique of Mani played by Mark Dacascos the Iroquois blood brother and sidekick of Fronsac. We dont want to give too much away but when finally glimpsed the beast (created by Jim Hensons creature shop) looks oddly familiar its loping moves reminiscent of rampaging creatures in American blockbusters. Foreign films have traditionally provided a refuge from Hollywoods excesses. But with this grisly popcorn movie were reminded of the heavy-handed contributions that some U.S. blockbusters are making to global culture. Must we import the rubbish we export?

PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS. Vincent Cassel (Jean Francois) stars in Brotherhood of the Wolf. Movie HANDOUT. THIS IS A HANDOUT IMAGE. PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS. Vincent Cassel (Jean Francois) stars in Brotherhood of the Wolf. Movie HANDOUT. Wolf bites off too many genres / French debacle shamelessly mixes gore love action 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF Horror /costume drama. Starring Samuel Le Bihan Vincent Cassel Mark Dacascos and Monica Bellucci. Directed by ChristopheCQ Gans. Written by Gans and Stephane Cabel. (R. 139 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Metreon.) Just when youd grown tired of asking ""Where are the gory overwrought costume dramas about marauding wolves?"" along comes ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" a French stinker that answers every wish -- and then some. Mixing romance social critique Gothic bloodfest and martial arts action this is a movie too ludicrous to be taken seriously but not entertaining enough to rate as camp. Drawing from the legend of the Beast of Gevaudan a menace that slaughtered more than 100 women and children in the 1760s ""Brotherhood"" (""Le Pacte des Loups"") opens when France and England are at war and King Louis XV is losing face because he cant capture a peasant-devouring wolf. A handsome womanizing naturalist (Samuel Le Bihan) comes forth to track the beast aided by the Iroquois sidekick (Mark Dacascos) he met in the New World. SHAMELESS GORE BAD ACTING Director Christophe Gans splices genres without shame and makes a grand effort at proving that the French can make big boneheaded mass-market action flicks too. Theres hammy acting dubious history hokey digital effects gratuitous sex (actually the best part) and violence made especially gruesome by the spew of bodily fluids and the sounds of bones crunching and flesh ripping. Theres a snooty one-armed count (Vincent Cassel) his nubile sister (Emilie Dequenne) who captures the naturalists eye and a vampirish courtesan played by the luscious Monica Bellucci (""Malena""). Nearly everyone has a secret -- including the beast. For the first hour of this cockamamie two-hour 20-minute endurance test the beast never appears. Gradually hes seen from oblique angles indicated by guttural off-camera rumblings and finally reflected in a victims eyeball. MONSTER A MAJOR DUD When he appears in full form -- as a remote-controlled multifunctional animatronic device from Jim Hensons Creature Shop -- hes a major dud. Picture a humpbacked dog wearing a porcupine suit cross-stitched with rubber bands. And a pink tongue. ""Brotherhood"" offers badly translated subtitles (the beast ""prays on peasants"" were told) and fight sequences that were staged by Hong Kong stunt coordinator Philip Kwok and feature kickboxing and other skills one doesnt associate with 18th century France. Dacascos is a remarkable athlete -- his body fat has to be in the minus column -- but his prowess is one more anachronistic absurdity. Advisory This movie contains nudity sexual situations and violence.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
