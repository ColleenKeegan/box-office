Equal parts L.A. love story ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" spoof on Greek gods and personal diary of actual events from 1988 to 1998 (when the pic was being lensed) Lawrence Bridges half-cracked half-inspired ""12"" is a dizzying slightly amateurish but unforgettable adventure about characters in search of themselves. Pic is being presented in as unorthodox a manner as its making Unspooling of completed work in workprint form happens in parking lots at various L.A. locales (revealed only at pics Web site) with viewers driving in and tuning their cars FM dial to a station temporarily pirated by presenters. Effect is of a new drive-in experience for only the most adventurous cinephiles. With trimming traditional fest appearances and vid shelf life in the art film racks are a good though not sure bet. Pic belongs to American tradition of art made by dogged outsiders from Simon Rodia to Harry Partch. First half is especially nonlinear owing more to Jean-Luc Godards ""Helas Pour Moi"" (also depicting the gods in contempo human form) than anything on the indie scene which was just coming into its own when Bridges a well-known TV ad helmer began project. Immortals Marie-Noel (Alison Elliott) and half-bro Filmore West (Tony Griffin) are Zeus illegitimate progeny ordered to find a play and act it well as the means of becoming fully mortal. Bro and sis have come upon Oscar Wildes ""Earnest"" as the play that will free them with Filmore as Jack and Marie-Noel as his niece Cecily. Role of Algernon is taken on by a rotund mortal named Allen (Allen Lulu) a struggling L.A. thesp. Like his literary doppelganger Filmore is known as ""Tony"" in the city and by his real name in the country an estate on one of the remote Channel Islands being invaded by the feds where Marie-Noel lives in boredom with her tutor-assistant (Lisa Stark). Despite (or perhaps because of) a decades shooting and more time in post pic refuses to fix on a tone shifting capriciously between the near-profound and the pointlessly silly. Former is best captured in grand vistas of human figures in island landscapes (Santa Cruz Santa Rosa and Catalina islands are beautifully chosen locales) which recall another Godard epic ""Le Mepris"" plus an extraordinary if rather ostentatious soundtrack of music ranging from Arvo Part to Bach to Mozart. Latter is typified by Filmores and Marie-Noels pesky family of gods including Zeus Athena Artemis Hera Aphrodite and Pan who often look and act like theyve walked out of a bad soap. The ""Earnest"" plot takes over in the second half with some scenes closely tracking Wildes text but not for too long. The Gwendolen to Filmores Jack is Earth-bound Julienne (Julienne Greer) dominated by her overbearing Aunt Debbie (Golde Starger) who is Lady Bracknell turned into an obnoxiously loud New York-accented mama. Amidst the arch comedy and cleverness are genuinely touching encounters between mortals and immortals finishing with wild finale as Filmore returns to L.A. amidst riots (captured as is the Northridge quake with originally shot non-stock footage). Griffin and Elliott provide a good grounding for the viewers attention as the deconstructed stream of images and story roll by but much of the fascination here is not in the highly uneven perfs but in pics raw enthusiasm for the film medium montage the juxtaposition of image and sound and the reimagining of Greek classicism in a SoCal setting. Characteristically print (screened via projected video) is extremely rough but with its own charming texture that grows on the eye and FM stereo sound is a genuine drive-in novelty. 12ProductionProduced directed written edited by Lawrence Bridges.

It certainly isnt the heist flick we expected; indeed were it not for the cast (especially Clooney so charismatic he neednt even open his mouth) Soderberghs sharp eye and the jovial chit-chat you might come away feeling short-changed. That said while it may lack its predecessors punch pace and precision its still unequivocally high-end entertainment.Its three years since Danny Ocean and his cohorts cruised into the Vegas casino of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and marched out with the contents of his vault. With the help of a grass smooth-talking Benedict eventually tracks them down and offers a one-way deal return the 160 million with interest or sparks fly. Short of a bob or two and none too welcome back in the US the gang sets up shop in Europe for another big one. Unforeseen events however conspire to upset the balance in the form of a Europol agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and a lone-dog French master-thief (Vincent Cassel) who lays down an attractive challenge... The beauty of the first film was that everything about the heist worked like clockwork and we left the cinema on a high. Here theres no single stand-out heist most of the plans go awry and the story fragments in several directions. Nonetheless a series of hilariously surreal digressions Clooney and cos blithe small-talk and an amusing reality scene with Bruce Willis offset any disappointment.

Anderson who captured the loyalty of a similarly disposed demographic with his 1996 debut crime caper Bottle Rocket came of artistic age with a bunch of other youngish filmmakers -- Spike Jonze Charlie Kaufman David O. Russell Alexander Payne and Sofia Coppola prominent among them -- whose movies seem to fly unmediated from their vaguely depressive compulsively associative heads onto the screen. If their adamant refusal of linear narrative psychological coherence and cinematic violence suggests a loose generational sensibility the loony idiosyncrasy with which they stare into their own neurosis and outward into a confounding world refutes all labeling. Collectively they are the freshest thing to hit American cinema in decades but individually their brand of crackpot subjectivity always teeters on the brink of impenetrability. The level of public bafflement and critical dissent over movies like Lost in Translation Adaptation and most recently I  Huckabees (all films I loved) suggests that sometimes its possible to dwell so far inside your own innovative mind that your brains fall out. Such is the case with Wes Andersons new film The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou an overstuffed creature with its head stuck so far up its ass that it left me scratching my own er head. Co-written with his friend Noah Baumbach who made the lively Kicking and Screaming and is currently adapting Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr. Fox with Anderson The Life Aquatic draws its inspiration from the directors long-standing obsession with the cult of French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau a notoriously swollen ego given to feuding with friends colleagues and family alike. In the movie Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou a washed-up oceanographer propelled by equally bloated proportions of self-regard and self-loathing who pulls together a crew of quarrelsome kooks on a boat to make an epic documentary that will chronicle his efforts to settle scores with a jaguar shark (whatever that is) that ate his longtime partner while upstaging a prosperous rival (Jeff Goldblum). When a gentlemanly young Kentucky pilot named Ned Plimpton played by Andersons longtime collaborator Owen Wilson shows up out of the blue claiming to be Steves long-lost illegitimate son Steve sees an opportunity to become the father he has always meant to be. Feuding families swelling paternal egos and oedipal messes run a thick fault line through Andersons work; he carries a cadre of actors with him from one film to the next remodeling them in variations on their earlier roles. In Rushmore Murray played a tycoon trying to redeem poor parenting of his own sons by befriending schoolboy Jason Schwartzman then competing with him for the affections of a pretty young teacher. And in The Royal Tenenbaums while Murray settled for playing husband/father-figure to Gwyneth Paltrow Gene Hackman took up the torch as the hopelessly incompetent patriarch of that family of angry and depressed geniuses. For all their meandering plot lines both those wonderfully weird movies managed to cohere around a recognizable structure and a cast small enough not to overwhelm Andersons underlying themes.

Sep. 13 600pm The Life Aquatic is a potentially great little cult picture shrieking in protest at being bumped up into a 50 million studio movie whose only real pleasure is its happy-color production design. A huge ensemble with little to do but act wacky doesnt help Willem Dafoe as Steves insecure engineer; Anjelica Huston in a variation of her maternal role in Tenenbaums as his brilliant wife; Cate Blanchett in a painfully fake British accent as a pregnant journalist (once again Murray competes for her favors with a son bona fide or otherwise); Bud Cort looking downright ancient as the bond-company stooge who ends up rooting for Steve; and Seu Jorge as a safety expert given to singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese which I suppose must have seemed funny on the drawing board. Crudely rendered fake fish created by the talented animator Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach) float pointlessly in the background. There are even lurches into action sequences which the director cant seem to control. (Anderson ruefully but accurately told The New York Times that in six-camera shots ""Youre supposed to have six cameras going and I dont know what to do with the other five."") In his other films it was a delight to tarry over Andersons fanciful yet truthful detail. In The Life Aquatic you have to fight your way through his digressive mess to find the story. Somewhere buried beneath all this ballast something is being said again about flawed middle-aged men falling from grace and redeeming themselves. This time Im damned if I know what that something is and I hope that next time around Anderson will return to his greatest creative asset -- a small budget.In the early phase of his career Steven Soderbergh might well have been dubbed the father of the Wes Anderson Spike Jonze et al. school of creative obfuscation. Ive no doubt that Soderbergh can and will again make inscrutably brainy pieces of varying distinction like Schizopolis Kafka and The Underneath. For now though hes the nearest thing we have to a gentleman director and I mean that as an ardent compliment. For sheer urbane elegance coupled with technical mastery and lush old-fashioned elan no one working for the studios today comes close to the versatile Soderbergh who has shown himself as fluent in the language of old-Hollywood romance (Out of Sight) as in the grainy nether regions of the international drug trade (Traffic) or the L.A. crime world (The Limey) or in the plebeian energies of populist agitprop (Erin Brockovich). In his remake of the Rat Pack crime caper Oceans Eleven Soderbergh seemed to reach a stylistic peak. And though its not unusual for him to take a break between big pictures and yield to a personal indulgence this time around hes clearly sticking with what works. If anything Oceans Twelve tops the suave formal daring of its predecessor and Ive no doubt that even in the crush of holiday movies it will work a similar box-office miracle. When last we saw Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) and his ragged crew of petty-crime experts they had penetrated the inaccessible vault of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and parted fastidious casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) from 160 million of his fortune not to mention his girlfriend Tess (Julia Roberts). Now they languish in miserable legitimacy from which in a puckish and very funny reversal of the opening scenes of Oceans Eleven theyre sprung when Benedict dispatches his thugs to round them up and demand they give him back his money. Following a series of increasingly impossible heists around Europe Daniel and his merry band find themselves pitted not only against high-tech security gizmos and the cops spearheaded by art-crime specialist Catherine Zeta-Jones but against the Continents premier playboy and thief the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) who never saw a Faberge egg he didnt like.Oceans Twelves many twists and turns are intricately fitted together and accessorized with nifty flashback and delirious pauses for nutty banter. The movie which has a crisply witty screenplay by George Nolfi pulls so many fast ones on both its characters and its audience that I can tell you little more about the story that wouldnt ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that the movie starts off flitting between several American states and ends up racing between several trendy European capitals that Roberts gets to impersonate a famous movie star that other Soderbergh pals show up for gallant cameos that Cherry Jones does something surprising for Matt Damons hilariously overambitious pickpocket and that Zeta-Jones gorgeous (despite a duck-bill hairdo) in black leather and red silks discovers that the line between crime and crimefighting is finer than shed thought. The heist scenes are as terrific as they are hilariously abortive. Oceans Twelve may be one of the most glamorous goofy and heartfelt films about failure ever made and as soon as I get out from under Oscar-qualifying weepies about incest child-molesting and paralysis Im going to run out and see it again just to cheer myself up.THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU | Directed by WES ANDERSON | Written by ANDERSON and NOAH BAUMBACH Produced by ANDERSON BARRY MENDEL and SCOTT RUDIN Released by Touchstone Pictures | At the GroveOCEANS TWELVE | Directed by STEVEN SODERBERGH | Written by GEORGE NOLFI | Produced by JERRY WEINTRAUB | Released by Warner Bros.

The deal that is with its audience. Those putting down money to watch a sequel to ""Oceans Eleven"" arent there because lets say they couldnt get into a Royal Shakespeare Company production of ""Hamlet"" next door. They havent come for art or even if they stopped to think about it a great movie. Theyve come to spend enjoyable face time with the stars. And to enjoy the Vegas-y spectacle of these celebrities lightly pretending (with winks nudges and other Movie Star tics) to be fictional characters. An inside job George Clooney from left Elliott Gould Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle in Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans Twelve"" a film thats less about a crime caper than star power and celebrity.

They want the pure pleasure of idle thinking. As in ""Whoa Julia and George smacking lips. How many other sets of lips total have they kissed altogether? What does the father of Julias twins think of her kissing Clooney? Do actors ever enjoy kissing each other? Do they joke about kissing just before the take? And do they whip out one of those Binaca blasters just like that soap-opera leading man did in ""Tootsie"" before subjecting Dustin Hoffmans drag character to a smackeroo?"" And so on and so on. The central premise -- everyone looking to make as much money as possible -- is something most of us can get behind with the possible exception of Ralph Nader. And the plots semi-silly twists and turns are simple excuses to produce various crowd-pleasing combinations including Clooney and Roberts; Pitt and Zeta-Jones (basically copycatting Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaways relationship at the heart of ""The Thomas Crown Affair""); and the Ocean team itself with all its in-house joshing and bantering. It seems the ruthless Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) has traced Danny Ocean (Clooney) and all those others who stole from his casino in 2001s ""Oceans Eleven."" He plans to kill them all unless they pay back the money (plus interest) they stole. Ocean and company figure they owe a grand total of 97 million. Time to steal big -- real big. Like abroad. Sound the theme from James Bond. The stars are doing Europe. As expected the team (which includes Damon Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) face complications Europol detective Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) is determined to bring every Oceanite to justice; and theres a French rival (Vincent Cassel) who takes issue with the notion that Danny Ocean might be the worlds best heist-master. Oceans wife Tess (Roberts) comes into the story late when things look very grim for the team. Without giving too much away Tesss uh uncanny resemblance to ""the real"" Julia Roberts becomes an integral part of a Plan B exit strategy. All this ultimately is directed toward the robbing of the worlds most valuable Faberge egg which is being exhibited in Rome. In this sprawling oglefest such things as ""narrative"" and ""story"" are remote little abstractions indeed. Director Steven Soderbergh (who also made ""Oceans Eleven"") uses the same reality-show looseness he brought to his ""K Street"" television series. And he pushes the celeb in-joking throughout. When Tess dresses up and pretends to be Julia Roberts shes spotted by a well-known celebrity who then proceeds to pepper her with questions which only the real Julia would know. Of course Tesss nervous reactions are very Julia Roberts. This movie is about the Whos not the What and Wherefores. And speaking of which this is a good opportunity to appreciate the amazing features of actor Cassel whose gaunt face prominent cheekbones and bright eyes (blue or green? I just recall their glint) suggest a sort of Egyptian tomb-dog intensity. He fits into this all-star collection of tricksters and rogues pretty perfectly.

"An Uneven Twelve washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies An Uneven Twelve Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 10 2004 The pilot light of ""Oceans Twelve"" is so low a whisper could blow it out leaving nothing on-screen except a series of outtakes bereft of coherence much less drama. By the end though the frail flickery thing thats up there more or less clings to life mostly on goodwill and the kindness of strangers. Its not really about heists and still less does it concern itself with ""Oceans Eleven"" its much better much more disciplined predecessor. It could be argued that its truer in ad hoc spirit to the old rat-pack flicks of hepcats Dino and Frank and Sammy and Joey than was ""Eleven"" but Im not sure thats a good thing. Its really about hanging out and how cool it is to be a movie star about the good fun that rich handsome famous people have. The problems begin with structure or rather the refusal of the film to invent one. The 2001 predecessor -- with George Brad Matt this generation of hepcats -- at least had the organizing principle of a single job to hold it together and a believable motive behind each major participant. It studied process and was built on cause and effect Lets rob a casino to get back at gangster creep Terry Benedict. We first do this then we do that we get closer and closer but we always have one goal and that goal keeps everything neatly lined up. Within that structure we can improvise brilliantly as the director Steven Soderbergh did playing nifty games with chronology working a dozen variations on the old now-you-see-it now-you-dont gag. ""Oceans Twelve"" seems to be a now-you-see-it now-you-still-see-it movie. No one has thought much about story at all; instead the movie reinvents itself about every 25 minutes finding a new minor plot obstacle to overcome and depositing the characters into boredom and lassitude until someone can come up with another plot obstacle. Quite late into it the movie is still introducing new characters in search of hairpin turns and unsupportable arbitrary revelations. Of the latter the daffiest is a bit where Danny Oceans wife Tess (Julia Roberts) pretends to be Julia Roberts as part of a scam even to the point where shes fooling the real Bruce Willis in a substantial unbilled appearance. But if Tess looks like Julia why doesnt Rusty (Brad Pitt) look like Brad Pitt and Danny Ocean (George Clooney) look like George Clooney with attendant consequences? That illogicality should faze nobody and Soderbergh means it only to express the loopy larky casualness of the enterprise; I mention it to evoke the general laziness of the film and point out that its rewards arent dramatic but mildly comical. The movie proceeds from the idea that the victim of the Bellagio casino heist of the first film Benedict (Andy Garcia) has found each of the 11 miscreants and rather than killing them as would be his wont instead insists that they pay him back. And rather than resist him as would be their wont they agree. You may not buy this -- I didnt -- but the breeziness with which Soderbergh pulls it off is completely charming and it makes you more receptive to the genial chaos that follows. Of course another problem is that 11 is a hard number to manage and 12 -- with the addition eventually of Catherine Zeta-Jones -- is even harder. There are too many characters and not enough story. So the minor players dont resonate at all; even the great character actor Don Cheadle is short-shrifted of screen time and low-rankers Casey Affleck and Scott Caan hardly register. That leaves the glamour boys -- Pitt Clooney Matt Damon -- to shamble through what remains of the several plots. The first involves heisting the worlds first stock certificate from the posh townhouse of an eccentric Amsterdam collector even though the guys know the deal will yield only about 2.5 million and they need over a hundred million and they need it in two weeks. We watch them fiddle with elaborate plans which all seem to founder on the problem that a window through which they need to shoot a crossbow bolt (to disconnect an alarm box) is inaccessible being too low. So they decide to raise the house and the movie cuts next to an elaborate underwater construction set where hydraulic jacks -- which must cost thousands and thousands of dollars and had to be special-ordered -- are magically in place to boost the building to the required height. All right thats a movie trick the presumption that high-end well-dressed ironic playboy thieves can put their hands on highly specialized extremely expensive equipment in a few hours any place in the world even when they dont speak the language. Its passable; you just wish theyd worked a little harder. The first complication is an Interpol cop played by Zeta-Jones. Shes the sort of cop you find only in movies of course beautiful sophisticated suave but secretly a master-thief groupie just waiting to be turned to the dark side by a pretty smile such as the one on Brad Pitts face. (Zeta-Jones as a newcomer to this franchise clearly doesnt get it Shes the only one who actually bothers to act.) Complication No. 2 arrives when the gang which came up short in the townhouse job realizes that an even more master master thief calling himself the Night Fox got there first and stole the document as a challenge. So the true topic of ""Oceans Twelve"" turns out to be a kind of burglars Olympics in which the Night Fox (played by Frenchman Vincent Cassel) working alone attempts to out-steal Ocean and his gang of thieves. Again much less compelling than one heist played for real. The final steal-off involves a scam meant to denude a Roman museum of a gloriously vulgar Faberge egg that looks like it was watched over by Horton in Dr. Seusss famous tree. This is the part in which Roberts appears as someone imitating Julia Roberts and even if shes a good sport it still feels ridiculous. It all ends on one of those infuriatingly sloppy notes where having dramatized narrative events WXYZ for us which we have taken on good faith it suddenly and arbitrarily delivers narrative events STUV which completely invalidate events WXYZ. Thats not cleverness its subterfuge. So what the movie is selling is the good fellowship among these A-list players. I suppose its like being invited to a party at producer Jerry Weintraubs Palm Springs mansion. Pitt and Clooney spend most of their time together and theyve developed a low-key Bob n Bing sense of timing; its enjoyable enough but hardly worth eight bucks. Meanwhile Damon splits off from them and is more or less in command of a smaller unit of second-raters including the briefly seen Elliott Gould the acrobatic Shaobo Qin Affleck and Caan and even briefer still Carl Reiner. Bernie Mac has almost nothing to do with any of this and theres yet another guy who has a few good lines but was unrecognizable to me. I think his name was Eddie Jemisen. He seems like a nice young man. The whole thing is a piffle of fluff or a fluff of piffle. About halfway through youll get an incredible hunger to see a movie. Oceans Twelve (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo and adult themes.

And that giddy pleasure is infectious You cant help but have fun watching it even as you recognize that its not as well-crafted as Soderberghs 2001 original ""Oceans Eleven"" (itself loosely based on the 1960 Rat Pack crime comedy) particularly in its screenplay. ""Twelve"" is all about playfulness and movie-star glamour -- and playing with movie-star glamour in a Julia Roberts subplot thats a hoot -- and those willing to join this gang of thieves will likely have as swell a time as they are. When last we saw these stylish con men led by that handsome devil George Clooney (whose white shirts here are as dazzlingly bright as fresh snow) they were coolly walking away from a Las Vegas heist of 160 million split 11 ways. Theyve gone their separate ways but now theyre brought together again Casino owner Terry Benedict (ever-smooth Andy Garcia) has tracked each of them down and wants his money back with interest. Now. Off the gang goes to Europe ostensibly because theyre too recognizable in the U.S. but really so that Soderbergh can have fun with cobblestone streets and lakeside Italian villas. High-profile robbery ensues -- of a priceless Faberge egg and of most of the scenes by Soderberghs gifted ensemble. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Oceans Twelve"" with George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Catherine Zeta-Jones Andy Garcia Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Julia Roberts. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by George Nolfi. 130 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language. Several theaters. The cluttered screenplay is credited to George Nolfi (who wrote the dreadful ""Timeline"") but much of the movie feels improvised with laid-back actors tossing off one-liners that work far more often than they dont. ""Twelve"" contains a couple of romances (between Clooney and Roberts and Brad Pitt and a purry Catherine Zeta-Jones) lots of nifty Bond-style gadgets elegant handheld camerawork (shot by Soderbergh himself under his cinematographer pseudonym Peter Andrews) and a picturesque tour of several European capital cities but really its about the pleasures of hanging out with the gang -- both the characters and the actors. (Though sadly a few of them get short shrift -- Bernie Mac in particular is barely in the movie; perhaps he was busy shooting something else.) Listen to them as they gather at the beginning of the film griping about the groups moniker. (Who agreed to be called Oceans Eleven? Arent they a collaborative team? Wasnt the idea to call it The Benedict Job?) All seem to be funnier this time around Scott Caan and Casey Afflecks bickering-brother shtick; Eddie Jemisons nerdy Livingston (who since the first heist has been saving money by living with his parents); Matt Damons striving boyish Linus. In a late scene as the gang has been scattered three of them try desperately to think of a course of action running down names of tried-and-true cons. ""What about Hell in a Handbasket?"" one suggests. No says Damon perfectly deadpan. ""We cant train a cat that quickly."" ""Oceans Twelve"" is full of throwaway humor and pretty faces; its a popcorn movie to be sure but its exactly what popcorn movies are supposed to be effortless pleasure. Watch Vincent Cassel as a legendary thief known as the Night Fox performing a weird rubber-limbed breakdance as a means of getting across a gallery pavilion laced with moving security laser beams. At the end as hes safely crossed the floor he does a nimble little leap clicking his heels together in triumph. Thats what Soderberghs doing here; light and loose. Hes capable of far more ambitious work and no doubt will achieve it; for now hes clicking his heels.

Starring George Clooney Brad Pitt Julia Roberts Matt Damon and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Looked at as just another movie ""Oceans Twelve"" presents a couple of serious impediments to viewing pleasure -- it goes on forever and its story is impenetrable. But looked at in another way as a party to which the audience is invited the film is something else again -- comfortable amusing friendly; an in-joke among pals and youre one of the pals. Though its a sequel to the caper comedy ""Oceans Eleven"" ""Oceans Twelve"" is more like a strange hybrid of the 1960s Rat Pack movies (in which the stars had fun and the audience got to hang out and watch) and director Steven Soderberghs impish absurdist art films (""Schizopolis"" ""Full Frontal""). At times the odd combination of styles works beautifully. At other times and for whole stretches ""Oceans Twelve"" is opaque and fairly alienating. The problem to be specific is not that ""Oceans Twelve"" doesnt make sense. Thats true but to complain about it would be like standing around at the party scowling because the dip has gone off even while George Clooney Brad Pitt Catherine Zeta-Jones Matt Damon and even Julia Roberts are having a blast. No the real problem is that Soderbergh has not found a way to make enough of the nonsense pleasurable. Or to put it another way the dip has not simply gone off; for five and sometimes 10 minutes at a time the dip is poison. Loved that opening though. Andy Garcia as casino owner Terry Benedict has located Oceans gang which robbed 161 million from him in the previous movie. Ocean (Clooney) is living in Connecticut. Rusty (Pitt) owns a hotel in Hollywood. Linus (Damon) is in Chicago. Terry intrudes on Frank (Bernie Mac) as hes getting a manicure and on Basher (Don Cheadle) as hes producing a record. Each character is caught in the act of being flamboyantly rich versions of themselves with Garcias entrance serving as a kind of punch line. He wears an ascot smokes a cigar and carries a cane the perfect embodiment of the man no one wants to see. That Terry should find them all at precisely the same time seems odd but theres probably an explanation embedded somewhere in George Nolfis script. In any case Terry gives them two weeks to return his money with interest -- or else. Instead of trying to escape the gang regroups in Rome with a plan to steal enough money to pay off Terry. Why Rome? Its photogenic and if a movie company has to go on location somewhere why not Rome? No one suffered for art while making ""Oceans Twelve."" The confusion begins once the gang is in Europe which happens very early on -- say 15 minutes in. The gang plans one heist but as preparation for another. Meanwhile an Interpol detective (Zeta-Jones) is on their trail at every turn. The movie is never joyless but the characters lives begin to seem that way and it seeps into the mood. The pleasures are entirely in the digressions which are silly and often delightful. In one the 43-year-old Clooney as Ocean asks his associates if he looks 50. They say yes and hes miffed. In another Linus (Matt Damon) a criminal novice tries to hold his own in an absurdly cryptic conversation with gangster Robbie Coltrane. Pretty vistas are plentiful the hills of Rome close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones. Its also nice to see Roberts in a lighter spirit spoofing herself in one extended sequence. But the fact that the movie has to entertain with digressions is an indication of more than looseness but rather a shoddiness. In ""Oceans Eleven "" the characters were loads of fun but the heist held interest as well. In ""Oceans Twelve"" nothing connected with the job is of any interest at all. The film introduces a Frenchman (Vincent Cassel) who considers himself the worlds greatest thief. He wants to test his skills against Oceans and so on. Like a lot in this confusing story that whole plotline takes up lots of time and should have been cut. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and adult language.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Brad Pitt George Clooney Julia Roberts or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? The miracle of ""Oceans Twelve"" isnt just that its a sequel every bit as good as the 2001 production. Its that producer Jerry Weintraub was able to get some of the biggest stars in the industry -- and Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh -- to clear their schedules for a 77-day shoot in Europe.Also according to reports there wasnt an out-of-control full-blown ego in sight. Now thats a miracle.""Oceans Twelve"" is a fun-filled mind-twisting romp featuring a cast that obviously had just as much fun making the film as the audience does watching it -- and that may explain why all the actors were available. (Not that theres anything wrong with making a few million dollars while on an action-packed European vacation of course.)The whole gang is back George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Julia Roberts Andy Garcia Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Casey Affleck Scott Caan Shaobo Qin Eddie Jemison Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould. Additions to the cast include Catherine Zeta-Jones Vincent Cassel Robbie Coltrane Cherry Jones and Eddie Izzard. Talk about an embarrassment of riches.This time around casino owner Terry Benedict (Garcia) has tracked down the boys who are now trying to go legit after successfully stealing 160 million from Benedicts Las Vegas hotel.The opening of the film is a fast-paced montage. One by one Benedict finds the gang members -- now scattered around the world -- and makes them an offer they cant refuse. They have two weeks to pay him back -- with interest -- or theyre gonna swim with the fishes.Mo moneyThis presents a bit of a problem. Danny Ocean (Clooney) now remarried to Tess (Roberts) is broke. Rusty Ryan (Pitt) now a West Hollywood hotel owner isnt doing much better financially. The rest of the boys still have various amounts of their ill-gotten gains but nobody has the full payment.Soon theyre all reunited in a desperate effort to come up with a scam rich enough to pay off their debt. Too hot to operate in the States they decide to head off to Europe to pull a new job. Brad Pitts character Rusty Ryan has a relationship with Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones).But things get real complicated real fast when they become embroiled in an ""Im better than you are"" competition with Europes most successful thief the Night Fox played by Cassel. Moreover the Night Fox is being pursued by Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) an investigator whos had a previous romantic run-in with Rusty.Thats the set-up and the rest of the film -- featuring a nicely crafted script by George Nolfi -- is an elaborate con within a con within a con offering one red herring after another which keeps you guessing until the final very satisfying conclusion.Soderbergh as usual makes the most of his outstanding cast and this time out hes got beautiful European locations as a lush canvas against which he can set his story. From Amsterdam to Paris to Monte Carlo and Lake Como to Rome and Sicily the locations in this film become additional characters and add a wonderful style to the whole production.OK so its far from deep. But ""Oceans Twelve"" is nevertheless the best ensemble film of the year. All the actors are incredibly generous to one another and they work together like the finely honed gears of a well-polished machine.Like a familyIts no wonder In addition to having been together in ""Oceans Eleven"" Clooney Roberts and Cheadle have each made four films with Soderbergh. Zeta-Jones worked with Soderbergh in ""Traffic"" and she starred with Clooney in ""Intolerable Cruelty."" The result almost has the feeling of a family reunion.Plus Clooney and Pitt have the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.Zeta-Jones may be many things but shy is not one of them. The sexually charged actress dominates the screen every time she takes a breath. Roberts also fine has a lot more to do this time around and her comedic talents are on full display.In Soderbergh the cast has one of the most gifted filmmakers in the world (hey Im willing to forget ""Solaris"" if you are). In addition to directing hes also his own cameraman and editor. This gives him a sense of freedom -- and perspective -- enjoyed by few others in the business.""Oceans Twelve"" may not be on anyones short list for an Academy Award but it is a splendid cinematic ride that will leave you feeling giddy and wishing for more.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

The rich steal from the rich and give back to the rich -- and a bunch of big movie stars have an obvious ball -- in ""Oceans Twelve."" Similar in its flippant insouciance to the good-times 2001 initial outing which knocked over 451 million worldwide this smooth inside job benefits from heightened bonhomie among the players fab Euro locations and a diminished obligation to stick to the heist genre boilerplate. Looks like good times all around at the B.O. for this Warner Bros. money machine. Securely returned to a commercial groove after his arty indulgences with ""Full Frontal"" and ""Solaris"" director Steven Soderbergh has fun with everything here -- first and foremost with his actors but also with narrative sleight of hand stylistic diversions and an in-jokiness that sometimes borders on the smug. Its the most high-end junk food imaginable completely unnourishing and forgettable afterward but delicious and all but impossible not to enjoy while its in front of you. No less amusing for being a plausible place to start kickoff has casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) down 160 million after his Bellaggio vaults were cleaned out three years earlier individually tracking down Oceans Eleven and informing them they have precisely two weeks to pay him back -- with interest -- or else. This personal and civilized approach to criminal debt collection -- as opposed to how Tony Soprano would pursue it -- sets the tone and sends the gang off on a mad scramble to come up with very big money on a deadline. Opening reel is packed with globe-hopping vignettes evoking the colleagues present circumstances. Once assembled a wittily underplayed scene has Danny (George Clooney) asking them all how much theyve got left from their individual hauls. Some have held onto most of their loot but Danny who lives quietly in Connecticut after having remarried Tess (Julia Roberts) and Rusty (Brad Pitt) whos invested in trendy Los Angeles hotels are both many millions in debt. Theyre also too hot to work in the States so they hightail it to Amsterdam to launch their scheme. Scenario by George Nolfi who refashioned his own pre-existing crime script to suit these characters starts getting tricky at this point but the long and short of it is that Oceans Eleven (it only becomes 12 in the final stretch) goes head-to-head in a wager with Europes top thief the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) to see who can win a race to pinch the heavily protected Faberge Coronation Egg from a Rome art museum. Much high-stakes gamesmanship ensues as the refined and snooty Night Fox seems to deal Danny and the boys a number of setbacks sidelining any number of them (including Danny) for lengthy periods. But this apparent vacuum is more than filled by Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a foxy Europol investigator whos chasing the Night Fox gets onto Oceans tail and happens to be a major ex-flame of Rustys. Given that this is a film about surface pleasures rather than the meaning of life Zeta-Jones practically steals the film by virtue of the fact that she looks hotter is more strikingly attired and has a cuter haircut than she ever has before onscreen (a red outfit she wears for Rustys delectation is momentarily heart-stopping). The way Isabel insinuates herself into the action and maybe or maybe not back into Rustys life is pretty clever and all through it Zeta-Jones proves she can play quite handily with the big boys. More than any picture since ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" ""Oceans Twelve"" summons up the old-time glamour of big American stars gallivanting around luscious European locations. As onscreen titles count down the days the boys have left to pick the egg they also tick off the settings with the help of a few flashbacks Paris the Monte Carlo casino the Night Foxs villa at Lake Como Rusty and Isabels favorite cafe by the Pantheon in Rome. With nothing dramatically at stake pic stays aloft due to its larky humorous riffs and sense of genuine fun that pulsates among the players even more than before. Theres Matt Damons Linus so eager to be accepted by Danny and Rusty becoming totally flummoxed when his buds and a contact (Robbie Coltrane) start speaking in riddles; Linus again getting upset when he thinks the gang intends to rob a handicapped man; the normally unflappable Rusty hung out to dry after Isabel steals his cell phone loaded with contact numbers; Danny becoming perturbed when everyone he asks thinks he looks 50; and a long climactic set piece in which Tess brought in at the last minute to help out must pose as her well-known look-alike Julia Roberts a job she finds exceedingly difficult especially when confronted with someone who knows ""Julia"" well (Bruce Willis in an extended cameo). As before the big stars get most of the screen time. Bernie Mac essentially vanishes early on and Casey Affleck Scott Caan and Eddie Jemison arent around much either. Damon shines Linus denseness up to the light for all to see while Don Cheadle as the Cockney Carl Reiner as the most respectable of the lot Elliott Gould as the most vulgar and Shaobo Qin as the man who can fit in a carry-on bag do almost precisely what they did the first time around. For their parts Clooney and Pitt embody the essence of the goofing Rat Pack spirit 21st-century style which is precisely what is asked. Aside from Willis a certain co-star of Roberts from ""Erin Brockovich"" makes a key unbilled appearance late in the game a move anticipated by an early admiring reference to ""Millers Crossing."" Soderbergh and his lenser alter ego Peter Andrews match the vitality of the cast and settings with lush widescreen visuals captured as if by an on-the-run photographer with a good eye. Milena Canoneros costumes are a dream and Philip Messinas production design elegantly complements the locales. But pic may get its biggest boost from David Holmes eclectic score which is boisterous and hot by turns as it dances a clever path through jazz big band and rock but always with a punch to the films energy level.

The heavy-hitting ensemble cast of George Clooney Julia Roberts Brad Pitt Matt Damon Don Cheadle Catherine Zeta-Jones Bernie Mac Andy Garcia and many more under the direction of Steven Soderbergh boasts a preternatural assurance that its going to get the job done. Pitt and Clooney take the Oceans 12 gang to Europe where theyll try to pay back the 160M they stole last go-round. Warner Bros. And as in Oceans Eleven the 2001 remake of a 1960 movie featuring the Rat Pack Clooney and company succeed. Sure Oceans Twelve is a slight confection and more than a little nonsensically convoluted. And just as the Yankees have their detractors who say they operate more on star power than as a coherent team some might find this blithe attitude a smidgen off-putting. Theres a self-congratulatory gag involving Roberts and Topher Grace has a hilarious moment mocking his nice-guy image. Despite these inside-baseball moments (even Roberts husband and publicist are referred to repeatedly) the film is enjoyable as a light and cheeky romp. The real-life camaraderie of Clooney Pitt Damon and the rest translates to the screen with charm and verve. About the movie Oceans Twelve    (out of four) Stars George Clooney Brad Pitt Julia Roberts Matt Damon Catherine Zeta-Jones Elliot Gould Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Directors Steven Soderbergh Distributor Warner Bros. Rated PG-13 for language Opens Friday nationwide As the film opens Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his team are being rounded up and threatened by casino owner Terry Benedict (Garcia) from whom they heisted 160 million the first time around. He wants his money back with interest or there will be most unpleasant consequences. Of course the guys dont have the cash on hand. So its off to Europe for a round of further capers. But theres a French master thief (Vincent Cassel) seeking to obfuscate Dannys boys and prove hes the worlds greatest criminal. So the race is on to see who can make off with a priceless Faberge egg while its on exhibit in Rome. Unlike in the first film everything seems to go wrong. This is in part because of Zeta-Jones who plays a detective who has a history with Rusty (Pitt) and a zeal to bring him and his cohorts to justice. Exuding heaps of postmodern cool -- these guys never even break a sweat --Oceans Twelve also gets comic mileage out of petty bickering among Dannys teammates. Also under Soderberghs direction which is smoothly clever and characteristically non-linear is a roster of respected players in small parts. Bruce Willis Albert Finney Robbie Coltrane and Eddie Izzard are but some of the recognizable names and faces recruited almost gratuitously for this sequel. At the rate things are going all of Hollywood will put in about a days work on Oceans Seventeen.

Posted December 8 2004 -- 1200 AM EST ""You know what your problem is?...Youve met too many people like you."" Thats Tess (Julia Roberts) three years ago in Oceans Eleven telling ex-husband Danny Ocean (George Clooney) why she has lost interest in his hectic postmodern-prankster brand of ring-a-ding-ding excitement and thievery and has chosen the dull security of a cosseted life with cold-blooded casino mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) instead. Of course by the end of Eleven Benedict has been coolly relieved of 160 million from his impregnable casino vaults by suave Danny and his all-guy team. Tess has fallen all over again for her exs twinkle and his resemblance to George Clooney. And the cast of Steven Soderberghs swingin remake of a junky 40-year-old Rat Pack heist comedy -- a starry band including Brad Pitt Bernie Mac Matt Damon Don Cheadle Casey Affleck Scott Caan Eddie Jemison Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner -- has hinted that theyre available for a return engagement if the perks are right. It turns out Tess problem with Danny is also the problem with Soderberghs Oceans Twelve The sequel is nothing but perks for too many people the director might now claim as Soderberghs Fifteen; the high-life travels through Europe include scenes shot in Lake Como Italy where Clooney owns a vacation villa. And echoing the laugh-up-its-sleeve air-quote tone that characterizes Oceans Twelves scammer-on-scammer heist twists (a formula of sharply diminishing returns in any configuration) the script grown out of George Nolfis screenplay Honor Among Thieves counts on art-imitating-life-imitating-art jokes about Hollywood to amuse an audience presumably thrilled that Bruce Willis would appear in a cameo playing...Bruce Willis From the cynical sequel-shaped premise that everything goes as wrong in Twelve for the Ocean organization as it went right in Eleven and that all characters are fair game for mocking by the actors playing them Soderbergh has made a film that suggests were fools to expect anything more from our entertainment. Is not the appearance of Julia Roberts enough to enchant? the movie smirks. No it is not not even if Roberts pregnancy during production becomes a joke on which the film trades with a wink. (""Shes a movie star Shes not the f--in pope"" one character played by a movie star reminds another about the actual actress.) Plot? If you insist The gang has divided up their loot and gone straight or at least straightish; Tess and Danny are married -- again. Benedict (with Garcia back in the Lord Fauntleroy wardrobe) has tracked the profit sharers down demanding repayment with interest -- or else. And so its showtime again to make back the dough already spent with two updates Dannys frontman Rusty (Pitt) now a distractable Los Angeles hotelier is involved with a dishy dame (Soderberghs Traffic alumna Catherine Zeta-Jones) who happens to be a wily Europol detective. And Danny is in competition with French supervillain Francois Toulour (Vincent Cassel) a playboy whos as big a star on the European master-thief circuit as Ocean is Stateside. With every plan seeming to go wrong (and the audience seeming to be treated as dupes) every already-broad character becomes even broader. And with every character now blobby as a circus clown the kind of well-chosen giggle that came from seeing a junior star like Topher Grace play an idiot version of himself learning poker from Rusty in Eleven is lost. Damons preppy apprentice is parodied as a full-grown screwup of limited capability as if fulfilling a South Park idea of a Matt Damon character. Goulds foppish real estate magnate is even more of a Jewish queen. A studiously stubbly anti-suave Danny watches Happy Days dubbed in Italian on a Roman hotel TV and comments ""That guy doin Potsie is good"" like a gullible slob. There are references to Millers Crossing to Lost in Translation to that most insider of gals Julia Roberts publicist. Were Twelve as tart and stylish as Eleven -- or as fresh in its sexy glamour as the chemistry was the first time around -- then it would be churlish to resent the satisfaction telegraphed in the after-hours tone of the performances. But all of the fun in Oceans Twelve takes place off screen as if behind a VIP-lounge velvet rope. (""It was like summer camp unbelievably fun and relaxing"" Roberts says in production notes about her work schedule sitting around Clooneys pool.) Whats on screen is lazy second-rate phoned-in -- a heist in which its the audience whose pockets have been picked.

"Oceans Twelve | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ocean-s-twelve ) Oceans Twelve (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Pleasantness and affability reign supreme in Steven Soderberghs sequel to the remake of Oceans Eleven. This time around even the bad guys dont seem so bad. Rumor has it that the atmosphere on the set of Oceans Twelve was so easy-going that it was more like summer camp than a movie shoot and much of the sense of fun comes across on screen. Everyone who survived the first film is back for the second including the entire complement of ""Oceans Eleven."" There are two high-profile newcomers. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Europol agent Isabel Lahiri an ex-flame of Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) who is the confidante of Danny Ocean (George Clooney). The theres Vincent Cassel who portrays ""The Night Fox"" a rival thief who believes that Oceans reputation is inflated - a fact he intends to prove by challenging his rival to a thieving competition. When the film opens Danny is retired and living in marital bliss with his wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Its their ""second third"" anniversary and Dannys life is about to go to hell. Someone has tipped off Casino honcho Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) about the location of Danny and his ten friends and they all receive an ultimatum pay back 160 million (plus interest) in two weeks or face the consequences. So its off to Europe for Oceans Eleven (theyre too notorious to be able to pull any heists stateside) where they have to steal enough money in 12 days to be able to fulfill their obligation to Benedict. Despite being overlong (does any caper comedy need to eat up more than two hours?) Oceans Twelve is enjoyable and will likely appeal to anyone who appreciated the 2001 film. Not only are the actors the same but the men behind the scenes including Soderbergh producer Jerry Weintraub and composer David Holmes have returned for another round. The screenplay by George Nolfi starts out a little slow but by the end of the first hour it has hit its stride with the movie building momentum. The complicated details of the final heist are entertaining to unravel and theres also a wonderfully wry bit of fourth wall-breaking fun that Soderbergh has at Julia Roberts expense. Some might consider this to be too cute but from my perspective its ballsy. With a cast of this size its expected that some of the performers will be featured far more than others. This time around Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner have the least screen time. The latter spends most of the time out of the game while the former cools his heels in prison for two-thirds of the film. While theres plenty of opportunity for Roberts Clooney and Matt Damon to say lines and interact the real ""star"" (if there can be said to be one) is Brad Pitt. Theres a fair amount of smoldering chemistry between Rusty and Isabel which is as much due to Zeta-Jones as to Pitt. Despite being new to this series Isabel has the fullest ""character moments"" of any of the bakers dozen. Although it functions adequately as a heist movie Oceans Twelve fairs better when seen through the lens of a comedy. The screenplay offers a lot of breezy dialogue and while it never gets overly silly its clear that were not meant to take any of the proceedings seriously. (The business with Julia Roberts makes that abundantly clear.) There is a ""surprise"" cameo at the end although astute viewers can figure out long before the moment of the ""big reveal"" whom Soderberghs veteran player is (Im not talking about Bruce Willis). And as must always be the case with any movie involving planned criminal activities there are plenty of twists including the expected final one. If theres a difference between Oceans Eleven and Oceans Twelve its the involvement of Mr. Murphy. In the first film not all that much went wrong. This time around however Murphys Law strikes with a vengeance. Danny and his friends get to learn first hand the truth in the saying ""The best laid plans of mice and men..."" In the end however it will come as no big surprise to learn that everything isnt as straightforward as it initially appears. Soderbergh peppers the print with occasional directorial flourishes (freeze-frames the use of colored filters etc.) but for the most part he presents the film ""straight."" And on those occasions when he shows off its neither prolonged nor extreme enough to become distracting. One could make an argument that the filmmaker isnt so much directing his actors as he is shepherding them through the movie-making process. Theres a sense that at least some of the dialogue was improvised. The final result speaks well for the process whatever it actually was. Oceans Twelve represents a lively way to spend a December evening.
