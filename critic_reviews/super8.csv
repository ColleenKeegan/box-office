Abrams latest holds your attention much of the time while youre watching but it leaves little impression once you walk out of the theater If I ever write a childhood movie Ill call it ""Kick the Can"" and itll be about that idyllic summer when I was 10 and with my five siblings and neighborhood kids played the titular game every evening after supper until it got dark and our moms began hollering for us to come home for bedtime. Not that I have the plot any further developed than that. Every writer and director has a memory film about childhood lurking somewhere. For Steven Spielberg it was ""E.T."" For Rob Reiner it was ""Stand by Me"" (based on a story by Stephen King). And for J.J. Abrams its ""Super 8"" which is co-produced by Spielberg and owes more than a nod to both ""E.T."" and ""Stand."" Key to these films is a fond nostalgia for childhood and a seemingly more innocent time. But in both of them something out of the normal intrudes upon the unspoiled days of childhood and the young characters must find resources within themselves to deal with it. Parents if they exist in these films are tangential figures either warmly benevolent or harried and weighed down by the complexities of adult life. Both ""E.T."" and ""Stand"" scored with audiences because they were able to convey the wonder of childhood when everything is still a new adventure and the closeness of young friendships. Each too gave us a glimpse of the men-to-be residing in their boyish heroes. Writer-director Abrams (""Star Trek"") taps into that sense of youthful wonder and adventure with ""Super 8."" His movie follows a group of adolescent friends -- four boys and a girl -- in a small Ohio town. At the behest of the aspiring youthful filmmaker in their group they set out to make a zombie short with a Super 8 film camera in 1979. The plan is to submit it as an entry in a competition sponsored by a Cleveland film festival. Also Read Super 8 Meet the Young Stars of J.J. Abrams Retro Movie While filming a night scene at a local train station the kids witness a horrific crash involving a freight train. Within minutes the accident scene is overrun by U.S. Air Force troops who promptly cordon off the area. Soon strange things start happening in town with car parts microwaves and people disappearing. And folks on-screen start glimpsing something -- we viewers just see it rustling the trees -- thats obviously horrifying. Yes ""Super 8"" is a monster movie. Theres a monster -- and the kids and everyone else in town needs to figure out just what kind it is why it has shown up and what it wants. To say more would spoil the movies supposed surprises. ""Super 8"" is accomplished commercial filmmaking. Abrams knows where to put a camera how to move a story along and how to add distinctive touches that make the material briefly seem fresh. Its a movie that holds your attention much of the time while youre watching but it leaves little impression once you walk out of the theater. The clearly autobiographical sections about the film -- crazy kids making a movie -- are the best parts. They have a veracity authenticity and spark that do much to lift the movie and add humor. (Stay through the credits because the groups zombie short plays in its entirety alongside the roll of names.) The monster stuff is less effective. Weve been here too many times before in recent decades and the scientific mumbo-jumbo and plot mechanics involving the adults -- one of the kids dad a deputy sheriff tries to get to the bottom of whats going on while an evil Air Force officer attempts a cover up -- have more than a whiff of recycled goods. As for the actual monster the movies slow reveal may just be a little too slow. But as would-be summer blockbusters go its a better movie than the thoroughly processed and predictable ""Thor"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" and ""The Hangover Part II."" But its no ""E.T."" or ""Stand by Me."" Then again if youre an impressionable 13 year old and see ""Super 8"" well in 20 or 30 years you may recall it as fondly as most of todays adults do those earlier movies. As with everything in life perspective is all about memory. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Super 8 has a solid pedigree - written and directed by Lost creator JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg - but in an 80s-referencing kids-v-aliens action smackdown itd lose badly to our very own Attack the Block.The links between the two films are notable both feature gangs of pop-culture-savvy teens who come up against an intergalactic menace and both pay direct homage to the post-Star Wars pre-CGI golden age of kid-friendly genre cinema. But where Joe Cornishs Brixton-set barnstormer used these influences as a springboard for a pacy socially conscious comedy-horror Abramss small-town sci-fi fantasy seems hamstrung by its directors desire to pay glowing tribute to his cinematic heroes.Super 8 opens strongly as a gang of youths led by recently bereaved SFX nut Joe (Joel Courtney) and bullish wannabe director Charles (Riley Griffiths) set out to make a DIY zombie movie for a local film festival and accidentally photograph a devastating train crash. Its not long before the army shows up people begin to disappear and Joe and his friends are caught in the middle of a military cover-up.Theres plenty to recommend here the train crash sequence is stunning a thunderous and nail-biting  display of special effects wizardry and directorial flair. The young actors are great too notably an icily imposing performance from Elle Fanning as the troubled object of Joes romantic desires. Abramss script sparkles in a handful of overlapping Spielbergian suburban dialogue scenes and its sprinkled with choice one-liners. But as the plot contrivances pile up Abrams finds it impossible to maintain either the quality or the tension. The humour descends from snappy believable banter to broad Goonies-style slapstick - kids shrieking and falling over - while the emotional scenes plummet from the wonderfully terse tight-lipped tragedy of the prologue to pure manipulative schmaltz. Worst of all the alien subplot is tiresome and derivative leading to a laughable sub-ET finale.It seems churlish to deride as unoriginal a film intended so clearly as homage but the likes of Attack the Block prove you can be both familiar and fresh. Super 8 doesnt even try content to let our nostalgic memories of better movies fill in the blank spaces in the script. The result is a diverting but rather pointless affair undermined by its obsessive and clinical commitment to recreating past glories. Bring on Attack the Block 2.

The problem with thisfilm is that it panders to  trendy left-wing politics  whereby  a teenage thug is transformed into a knight in shining armour  after taking on alien invaders.  These alien invaders reminded me of Dennis the Menaces dogGnasher  ( in The Beano )    . . . and its this comic book humour which is one of the more successful elements in the movie.What is less appealing is its simplistic take on inner city problems and its facile attempts to ingratiate itselfwith a teenage audience who will impressed by the scripts command of  urban verncular and street slang.That said the film has energy and pace and anyone who has been to a South London `sink` school willrecognise the characters especially the putative anti-hero Moses  who  begins the film as a unconscienablemugger and ends it as an alien-slaying hero.

Great acting from the kids and did you notice that the film definition is definitely NOT HD? Spielberg and co. seem to have made it deliberately ""grainy"" to capture the 1970s film. Yes before reading all these reviews I twigged that it was a remake of E.T. but so what? Lots of films are being re-made and are strikingly similar in plot characters and script. At least this one has sufficient differences from E.T. to make it enjoyable... and I am 53 years old.

JJ Abrams in his ""Super 8"" wanted to film this supposed desire that 8 year-olds have of making the movie by making a movie that he supposedly deliberately made like it was actually made by 8 year old but the problem is that majority of mainstream mainstream movies already look like they are made by 8 year old kids. The whole movie would be laughably bad as a pastiche of Spielberg clichA(c)s but because it is labeled as a ""tribute to mr. Spielberg"" its not buried by critics and audience. JJ Abrams is pulling the same thing Tarantino did with ""Inglorious Bastards"" that the whole point of the movie is to show that Tarantino is a movie fan. Well I guess in this JJ wanted to say that he is Spielberg fan. And for Spielberg its his shameless narcissistic self promotion.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89581/super-8.html,200,super81,super8,timeout

Abramss latest film is a heartfelt homage to early SpielbergIts been five years now since Paramount Pictures chairman Brad Grey first anointed writer/producer/director J.J. Abrams ""the next Steven Spielberg."" That honorific has subsequently become so commonplace that Abrams might be forgiven if hed put it on his business cards. But it always seemed to me a clear devaluation of the Spielbergian coin. Abramss accomplishments on the little screen (Felicity Alias Lost) and endeavors on the big one (Mi III Star Trek) are all well and good. But Spielberg? Honestly? Steven Spielberg himself however seems not to share this skepticism. At least thats the impression given by his decision to produce Abramss latest film Super 8. The movie is a touchingly self-conscious homage to early Spielberg to Jaws and Close Encounters and E.T. and if its not at the level of those films neither does it embarrass itself with the comparison. By turns hokey and suspenseful intimate and exhilarating it is a delightful reminder that summer cinema is not required by statute to be crass and loud and stupid. The movie takes place in 1979 a time when Spielberg was at the height of his pop powers (at least if one discounts 1941 released that year) and J.J. Abrams was in middle school. Not at all coincidentally the films protagonists are themselves middle-schoolers; moreover like Abrams who began shooting movies on a Super 8 camera when he was 8 years old they are budding amateur filmmakers Joe (Joel Courtney) the sensitive makeup artist and model-builder; Alice (Elle Fanning) the reluctant leading lady from the wrong side of the tracks; Charles (Riley Griffiths) the bossy rotund writer/director; and Cary (Ryan Lee) the heavily dental-braced fireworks fiend. Along with a few castmates the kids are shooting night scenes for a Z-grade zombie movie when they witness a devastating train derailment and the emergence of a mysterious predatory menace. Its not long before the sheriff in their fictional Ohio steel town disappears local dogs make a run for the county line and a secretive military battalion arrives to ""clean up"" the undisclosed threat. Like Cloverfield which Abrams produced and to which the movie bears many similarities (though not thankfully the vertiginous handheld camera) Super 8 is coy about the exact nature of the threat and in keeping with that spirit Ill stay mum as well. Its worth noting though that the particulars of the sci-fi narrative are easily the weakest element of the film. As Abrams demonstrated with Star Trek --which had a black hole where its plot should have been --hes more concerned with storytelling than with story. The further the central mystery unfolds the more you may wish you could fold it back up again. The movie is at its best in the taut early set pieces when danger lurks just outside the frame and in the likable interplay between its pubescent protagonists. Joe has lost his mother in an industrial accident and his deputy sheriff dad (Kyle Chandler of Friday Night Lights) shows considerably less aptitude for parenting than for police work. Alices mother left long ago and her father (Ron Eldard) is a bitter drunk. Absent mothers distant fathers--programmatic as the setup may be the tentative efforts by the two young leads (both very good incidentally) to find and nurture some glimmer of affection are handled by Abrams with tenderness and tact. There are clever uses too of the kids movie-within-a-movie as they employ the ""genuine"" horror flick unfolding in the town as a backdrop for their own fictional one. Like Spielberg Abrams has here captured or at least refracted the innocence and enthusiasm of childhood of moviegoing and of filmmaking itself. Super 8 is a love letter to an era--there are gags about pot and Walkmans; the soundtrack prominently features ""My Sharona"" and ELOs ""Dont Bring Me Down""--but more than that it is a love letter to a cinematic era before ""blockbuster"" became a synonym for ""franchise"" or ""tent pole."" If that werent enough the movie evokes a more recent nostalgia as well for the time so near and yet so far away when a summer action film could eschew the tiresome vaguely desperate enticement of a 3D release. Super 8 is clean and clear and mercifully flat and that modest act of bravery alone merits a visit to the multiplex.

What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

PG-13. 1 hour 52 minutes. At area theaters. Yes J.J. Abrams fantasy-adventure ""Super 8"" is a mash note to one of Hollywoods most successful storytellers Steven Spielberg both as director and producer. And Spielberg is a producer on this popcorn entertainment that hankers to be an insta-classic. Even so theres much to like in this story of a group of young movie-makers who stumble upon an event right out of well the movies. And when Abrams is cranking the TV whiz behind ""Lost"" (and more) reminds audiences that he continues to hone his talent for jest ache and the visceral. There are also some big-budget indulgences that frustrate -- and one bonus worth celebrating. (Hint Elle Fanning.) Lets take them in order. ""Super 8"" begins with promise if mournfully. It is 1979 and the Lillian Ohio steel mills impressive run as an accident-free workplace has come to an end. Now a young teenager sits alone on a swing outside his house after a funeral. Engaging newcomer Joel Courtney portrays sensitive Joe Lamb. Kyle Chandler plays dad Jack the town deputy and a wounded widower not sure how to communicate with his son. When summer comes a few months later Dads still flummoxed but Joe and friends Charles (Riley Griffiths) Cary (Ryan Lee) Preston (Zach Mills) and Martin (Gabriel Basso) have embarked on making a zombie flick. Rotund enthusiastic director Charles casts teen spitfire Alice Dainard (Fanning) as the concerned wife of a zombie-tracking gumshoe. (A star-crossed set-up has already been established early when Jack Lamb and Alices father Louis butt heads.) We know Alice is a spitfire when she arrives in her fathers rumbling muscle car. Soon she has everyone -- her bean-pole movie hubby the crew and yes us -- transfixed. During the filming of a pivotal scene a transport train crashes. Mystery freight is disgorged. An abandoned camera captures something. A schoolteacher plays a catalytic role in what follows -- also known as ""all Hell breaking loose."" So does the Army. Named for the camera that became a staple of home-recording for many American families ""Super 8"" is charming and celebratory as its nascent filmmakers undertake their genre flick. Each kid has a talent. Theres the firebug or explosive expert. Theres the actor and the camera-sound guy. Abrams sweetest kicker is making Joe the make-up artist not the director. Its a classy inside-the-industry tribute to ""below the line"" crafts folk who make so much of the movies magic happen. The dark circles beneath zombie-vacant eyes the dribble of blood at the corner of mouth -- thats Joes handiwork. What begins to chafe is the way ""Super 8"" devolves into a special effects- revved chase flick headed toward a too-familiar end. It runs into another problem not exactly Abrams -- one that portends good news in the long run for filmgoers. For the second time in a year Fanning proves to be the brightest quasar in a movie. In Sofia Coppolas ruminative drama ""Somewhere"" Fanning (Dakotas younger sis) portrays the daughter of a bored actor; he lives in a famed L.A. hotel. When she comes to stay with him his ennui (and the films) is lifted. When she departs something is lost to him but to audiences too. Now Fanning exerts the same effect When Alice isnt onscreen ""Super 8"" becomes less super.

Abrams underwhelms as alien takes its time to move the Super 8 story forward. By Peter Rainer Film critic June 10 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures from left Gabriel Basso Ryan Lee Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths are shown in a scene from Super 8. Francois Duhamel/Paramount/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? When Steven Spielberg made his classic sci-fi fantasias ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" he set in motion a series of unintended consequences mostly bad in the movie business. Filmmakers without his pop lyrical gifts were soon infesting our screens with pipsqueak futurism set in suburbia. For every ""Back to the Future"" there was a ""batteries not included"" (both of which incidentally Spielberg coproduced).If you thought all this stuff was finally behind you guess again. ""Super 8"" written and directed by the fantastically successful Spielberg protege J.J. Abrams and coproduced by Spielberg himself is a thunderously underwhelming sci-fi adventure about a bunch of middle-school classmates in 1979 whose super 8 zombie movie project gets derailed when their suburban town is invaded by an alien who takes altogether too long to make his/her/its appearance.There are some impressive flourishes including a monster-inspired train wreck which will have you clapping your ears shut if thats your idea of a good time. There is also some nifty comedy involving the making of the super 8 movie - the young actors including Elle Fanning Joel Courtney Riley Griffiths and Ryan Lee are a spirited bunch. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If Abrams had stuck with the kids and cut way back on all the sci-fi hoo-ha his film might have stood a fighting chance of being charming.

"Super 8 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; super-8 ) Super 8 (United States 2011) June 10 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Super 8 is an homage by its writer/director J.J. Abrams to its producer Steven Spielberg. Its also a love letter to all those with a passion for filmmaking that emerges at a young age. Super 8 is the kind of high-profile movie we so rarely see these days an original story (not a sequel spin-off re-boot or adaptation) in 2-D. The special effects are state-of-the-art (would anyone expect anything different from an Abrams/Spielberg collaboration?) but are not used gratuitously. Unlike many science fiction features this one puts the characters before the monsters and the big bangs. Abrams remembers the simple rule that a majority of his contemporaries have forgotten action and mayhem have meaning only when an audience cares about the people trapped within the maelstrom. Abrams brings an element of biography to Super 8 recalling the days when he like many future filmmakers inspired by the crop of visionary directors exploding onto the scene in the late 70s and early 80s borrowed his parents Super 8 camera and made a ""movie."" Setting the action in 1979 also allows for a dose of well-earned nostalgia when it comes to music clothing attitudes and technology. The Super 8 camera is of course an artifact of the past (todays kids use smart phones to get their cinematic feet wet) but one cherished by many. Without the Super 8 would there have been a Spielberg a Francis Ford Coppola or a George Lucas? Its impossible to watch Super 8 and not hearken back to two of Spielbergs best-known early productions Close Encounters and E.T. There are also elements of his ""darker"" efforts - Jaws Jurassic Park War of the Worlds - and nods to some of the titles Spielberg leant his name to in a production capacity - Poltergeist Gremlins The Goonies. As a director Abrams resume is too short for him to claim a distinctive ""voice"" (although there were hints of it in 2009s Star Trek buried under the weight of the mythology of an iconic universe) but it begins to emerge in Super 8. Its a little faster sharper and edgier than Spielbergs but not so different a Spielberg influence is out-of-place. Super 8 follows the misadventures of six young teenagers who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The project that brings them together is the filming of a clandestine zombie movie which requires them to sneak out of their houses at midnight and assemble next to a nearby train station. There they can make their Super 8 project without the interference of adults who just dont get it. They are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) the films makeup and special effects guru; Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) the main actress; Charles (Riley Griffiths) the director; Cary (Ryan Lee) the pyromaniac cameraman; Preston (Zach Mills) the lighting guy; and Martin (Gabriel Bosso) the main actor. Things are going well especially for Joe who finds himself getting along with Alice the object of a crush when disaster strikes. A train derails spectacularly throwing debris in all directions. Was the derailment an accident or a deliberate act of sabotage? Why does the military led by the grim-faced Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) swarm over the site almost immediately? And what is the creature glimpsed moving through the wreckage of the train? One obvious lesson learned by Abrams from Spielberg has its roots in Jaws when it comes to the monster less is more. To that end until it comes time for the ""big reveal"" the creature is glimpsed only briefly. Even during an attack on a bus (which recalls the T-Rex rampage in Jurassic Park) the camera avoids lingering on the monster. With Jaws this was a happy accident necessitated by the fact that the fake shark looked too silly to put on screen for long. With Super 8 and its refined special effects its a deliberate decision. The relationships among the kids represent the movies heart and soul. These six friends act toward one another in much the way real nerdy adolescents do. Theres the dominance of Charles the rivalry between Charles and Joe for Alices attention and the emergence of Joe as the unlikely hero. Home life also comes into it with Charles large bustling family being contrasted with the contentious relationships between Joe and his police officer dad Jack (Kyle Chandler) and Alice and her disreputable father Louis (Ron Eldard). As with so many movies focused on youthful protagonists however the adults are of secondary concern functioning more as plot devices than fully fleshed out individuals. The fresh-faced actors bring believability without baggage to the film. The one with the most experience is Elle Fanning who has emerged from her older sisters shadow with a series of strong performances - Super 8 will enhance her reputation. Joel Courtney shows more poise than one might reasonably expect from someone making his professional debut; hes the lead and theres never a reason to doubt his casting. Also notable is Ryan Lee whose off-kilter portrayal of Cary adds an element of comedic relief (not that Super 8 ever becomes dark enough that it needs it); hed be a good choice for a remake of The Lost Boys. In a way Super 8 offers to todays generation of movie-goers a hint of what it was like for those of my generation to go to a theater during the 70s and 80s and experience the latest product of Spielbergs imagination and skill. Over the years Spielberg has matured as a filmmaker but some of his best endeavors remain those when he was still experimenting as he perfected his craft. Perhaps thats where Abrams is today and by looking back to Spielberg he is establishing his own course forward. Super 8 is in many ways a perfect summer movie smart exciting heartfelt and suffused with nostalgia. Its a great thing to see a motion picture spectacle that does not require a temporary lobotomy for gratification. Super 8 (United States 2011) Director J.J.

By Dana Stevens After youve seen Super 8 check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Super 8 Super 8 (Paramount Pictures) a sci-fi thriller written and directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg consciously strives to evoke nostalgia for a certain 1970s childhood--not necessarily anyones real childhood (though viewers born during the Johnson administration may feel a shock of recognition) but one that we all recognize from the movies. The small town where this movie takes place--the fictitious steel town of Lillian Ohio--doesnt exactly resemble the tract-house suburbia of E.T. but both places exist on the same spiritual map. Theyre apparently ordinary settings in which mysterious frightening potentially wonderful things are happening just beyond the range of grown-up vision. Super 8 is at its best when it dwells in this secret childhood empire and at its worst when it juices up its essentially simple story with increasingly senseless action set pieces. The films prologue establishes the setup with impressive economy 14-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) has lost his mother in an industrial accident at the steel mill. Joes father (Kyle Chandler) the deputy sheriff of the town whos wrapped up in his own grief tries to pack his son off to camp for the summer but Joe refuses to go. He wants to help his friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) finish their Super-8 film project a zombie movie they plan to enter in a local contest. (Abrams himself first came to Spielbergs attention when he entered a similar contest at age 15.) Joe Charles and three of their friends are filming a scene at an empty train station one night when they witness a spectacular and inexplicable train derailment. Over the next few days weird things begin to happen in Lillian All the towns dogs flee in packs and microwaves and car engines disappear overnight. Soon armed military police swarm the town shutting down the deputy sheriffs inquiries with menacing non sequiturs. Advertisement During its middle section the film essentially runs on two tracks at once On track one the kids struggle to finish their film incorporating elements of the surrounding chaos for what movie-mad Charles terms their ""production value."" On track two the whatever-it-is unleashed by the train crash ravages the town eventually resulting in a military evacuation thats straight out of a George Romeromovie. Just about everything that happens on the kid track is phenomenal and just about everything that happens on the monster track brings diminishing returns. The mildly profane overlapping banter among the five young actors (who include Ryan Lee as Cary a brace-faced pyromaniac and Elle Fanning as Alice the pensive girl of Joes dreams) sounds so natural that it seems improvised at times. Joe and Charles scenes together are better-written and acted than any depiction of adult male friendship Ive seen on screen for a while The boys shifting power dynamic and long history with one another are established in the swiftest of strokes. And Joes crush on Alice is similarly well delineated--aided by the fact that both novice Joel Courtney and lifelong veteran Fanning are terrific actors. In an early scene that promises riches the movie never quite delivers Fanning is not just good but meta-good playing a role in the Super-8 film within a film she surprises the boys with a performance that gets both her fictional and real-life audiences a little verklempt. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Abrams script operates according to a predictable rhythm that may derive from his years working in television with a big barnstorming action sequence every half-hour on the half-hour. After each new variation on the same theme--basically a disposable tertiary character witnesses a horrible offscreen event--were more impatient to get back to the squabbling kids again. By the time we arrive at the climactic underground chase sequence the threat posed by the creature (who isnt seen clearly until very late in the film) seems like a distraction from the more pressing concerns of the children. The Spielberg movies this film lovingly plunders--most notably E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind--had classically structured narratives whose science-fiction elements felt organically related to the rest of the story. (Elliott and E.T. cared about each other as did in their way Richard Dreyfuss and the Close Encounters aliens.) By comparison Super 8s creature seems like a pure McGuffin a plot-advancing contrivance. But to say Super 8 is no E.T. may be to set the bar too high. This may not be a childrens classic that will last for generations but it will make for a rollicking afternoon at the multiplex for kids around Joes age. And their parents (who may like me be around J.J. Abrams age) will appreciate the affectionate at times obsessive attention to period detail Walter Cronkite on a wood-paneled TV a candy counter stocked with vintage gum brands a teenager bopping to Blondie on his newfangled Walkman. As a director Abrams has at least one lesson to learn from the film crew of middle-schoolers which he created Keep it simple. The Case their no-budget zombie flick that plays out in its entirety over the closing credits is so funny and sharply observed it makes the multi-million-dollar spectacle that came before look like amateur hour.

"Super 8 is a super-exciting summer escape - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Super 8 is a super-exciting summer escape By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Super 8 packs the emotional punch of vintage Steven Spielberg with the spectacular effects and sense of mystery at which writer/director J.J. Abrams excels. By Francois Duhamel Paramount Pictures A crash an explosion Kyle Chandler seeks clues to strange goings-on. EnlargeClose By Francois Duhamel Paramount Pictures A crash an explosion Kyle Chandler seeks clues to strange goings-on. Produced by Spielberg and reminiscent of E.T. Close Encounters of the Third Kind and even War of the Worlds it also has some of the coming-of-age quality of Rob Reiners Stand By Me. Yet it avoids feeling derivative featuring some of the most visually arresting explosive action scenes in any recent movie. This sci-fi thriller has an engrossing plot and a strong cast of fully drawn characters. Theres even a sweet youthful love story. In other words its a summer blockbuster firing on all cylinders. Though there is nostalgia involved -- the movie is set in 1979 -- the story bears the stamp of contemporary wonderment and the specter of 9/11 paranoia. The sleepy town of Lillian Ohio is shaken when a train crashes at its outskirts. At the same time a group of 14-year-olds is surreptitiously shooting a home movie by the tracks. A seemingly stalled pickup truck caused the crash kicking off a massive explosion with hurtling boxcars. The military quickly takes over and things turn sinister as pet dogs head for the hills townspeople vanish and major electronic appliances disappear. At the center of the tale is shy but brave Joe (Joel Courtney) whose mother died a few months before in an accident at a steel mill. His father (Friday Night Lights Kyle Chandler) is a sheriffs deputy who in his grief has grown disconnected from his young son. Meanwhile Joe has a quiet crush on classmate Alice (Elle Fanning) and is thrilled when she agrees to take part in a zombie movie made by his buddy Charles (Riley Griffiths). About the movie Super 8    1/2 out of fourStars Kyle Chandler Joel Courtney Elle Fanning Noah Emmerich Ron Eldard Director J.J. Abrams Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and some drug use Running time 1 hour 52 minutes Opens Friday nationwide They and a few others try to piece together the mystery surrounding the train crash and the towns flurry of suspicious events. As it turns out Charles camera documented much of the crash. The secret stays under wraps for more than half the movie. The extended derailment scene is astounding more fully dimensional than any 3-D fare. Yet some of the quieter scenes are the most indelible such as Joe and Alice watching home movies of Joes mom and Alices awkward efforts to talk to Joe about their parents. The young cast -- particularly newcomer Courtney and the impressive Fanning -- is mesmerizing. Youthful banter mixes with retro references (the dawn of the Walkman) augmented by music from such late 70s bands as ELO Blondie and The Knack. For those who grew up enchanted by E.T. Super 8 captures a similar sense of innocent exuberance and unabashed excitement. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Photo Francois Duhamel Paramount Pictures Super 8 review A+ for paean to B-movie sci-fi 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Super 8"" is a huge action movie but that realization sinks in only later. In the moment it all seems very human scale a movie about a set of specific characters in which enormous things just happen. No matter how enormous these things are - and some of the sights are remarkable including one of the best train crashes ever put on film - they never dwarf the people or our concerns about this family or these friends or this town. J.J. Abrams who wrote and directed tells us what he plans for us in the opening minutes. The year is 1979 and a group of pubescent boys is making a Super 8 zombie movie for a talent contest. The aspiring director tells his right-hand man that he is going to give his protagonist a wife so that the audience will care if he gets killed. Abrams like the boy director understands the rules of the game hes in and the result is a sci-fi monster movie that keeps its sense of fun and humanity. Its a valentine to a classically American genre - the B-movie - and a nostalgic look back on a more innocent time. This innocent time never existed - thats part of the fun. Abrams turned 13 in 1979 and he gets the details right the first Walkman news of Three Mile Island and ""My Sharona"" on the radio. But he also shrewdly morphs the late 1970s with the world of B-movie science fiction so that we see the town here as a throwback to the towns in those cheap 1950s movies in which the worst horrors can take place seemingly in isolation without anybody on the outside ever knowing about it or coming to the rescue. Related Stories Super 8 delivers epic fun So the kids are making a movie but at the same time were aware that a much bigger kid is making the movie were watching which is a deluxe and brilliantly realized version of the same kind of movie The kids accidentally stumble onto knowledge of a dark and threatening scientific experiment. And the military which has invaded the town supposedly to protect it cant be trusted. These are classic tropes and so theres a sense of being played with in the best possible cinematic way. The pacing is superb quick and agile without being frenzied and the special effects are jaw-dropping. Abrams gets excellent performances from his young cast not only from his leads - Elle Fanning as the pretty girl from the wrong side of the tracks and Joel Courtney as a sensitive boy who has lost his mother - but from the supporting players. For example Riley Griffiths tears ferociously into the role of the boy director as a kind of eighth-grade Orson Welles. There are also two wounded fathers well played Kyle Chandler plays the towns deputy for all hes worth and Ron Eldard looking like a slimmed-down Gerard Depardieu plays Fannings confused father. Between the lines ""Super 8"" harks back to old-fashioned sci-fi movies in a more sophisticated way in its suggestion that monsters dont come out of nowhere. In the 1950s the vision of suburban normality was so assertive that it contained its own shadow. And so the monsters and the blobs and the pod people of that era were like some inner scream taking physical form. Likewise in ""Super 8"" theres the sense that whatever the logical reason for the turmoil that takes place there is something spiritual at work that some essential harmony has been devastated within two disparate families and that only something epic can set it right. ""Super 8"" is epic enough for that task. Super 8 Sci-fi thriller. Starring Elle Fanning Amanda Michalka and Kyle Chandler. Directed by J.J. Abrams. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern June 10 2011 ""Super 8"" which was written and directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg takes place in a small Ohio town in the summer of 1979. Thats a pivotal period for movie history. Only a few years earlier Mr. Spielberg had changed the world with ""Jaws"" then enchanted it with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""; the peerless perfection of ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" would come three years later. This new film isnt perfect and may not be a world-changer but its certainly a world-pleaser. Watch a scene from the film ""Super 8."" Video courtesy of Paramount. The stars here are middle-schoolers seized by movie love and doing what Messrs. Spielberg and Abrams alike were doing at their age--making their own movies with a little camera (the 8 wasnt Super when the older of the two men was a kid and it didnt have sound) a sturdy tripod and Kodak cartridges. Since theyre currently shooting a zombie flick their equipment also includes a generous supply of fake blood. As anyone who has seen the ""Super 8"" trailer knows the teenage auteurs are shooting a night scene alongside a train track when a freight train comes roaring through suddenly derails and is wracked by stupendous explosions. The train wreck is modern in the sense of impressive digital imagery and bone-rattling sound but its also a classic genre device a mysterious event witnessed--and in this case filmed--by kids who soon find themselves pursued by menacing forces. (Military forces to be more specific without giving away too much of the plot; convoys roll and soldiers scowl just as they did in ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."") The bright idea at the center of ""Super 8"" is a counterpoint between a sci-fi adventure that unfolds on a grand scale and the evolution of the little Super 8 film within the film. (Shakespeare might have gone the same route with ""The Murder of Gonzago"" within ""Hamlet"" if hed had access to a camera.) Its as touching as it is hilarious to watch the junior Spielbergs and Kubricks explore their craft. Among them are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) a smart tender boy trying to cope with the death of his mother; Charles (Riley Griffiths) the chubby director who goes around framing scenes with his hands and chattering about production values; and Cary (Ryan Lee) a gleeful pyromaniac with a mouth full of braces. All of the kids talk at the same time in a preteen cacophony that almost amounts to an alien tongue Their grown-up director Mr. Abrams turns out to be as much of a whiz at handling youngsters and comedy as he was at resuscitating the ""Star Trek"" franchise a couple of summers ago. But theres an astonishing quietude in the kids midst. Its the presence of Elle Fannings Alice an exquisite girl on the verge of young womanhood who reluctantly agrees to play the main zombie. Alice doesnt know what a wonderful actress she is. The first time she runs her lines she invests the silly words with a depth of feeling that leaves her castmates stunned and ""Super 8"" briefly becomes a movie about the primal power of movie acting as well as a revelation of Ms. Fannings extraordinary gifts. For the most part though--and for most but not all of its nicely compact 112-minute running time--""Super 8"" serves as a showcase for the style of humane richly detailed and relatively unhurried filmmaking that made those Spielberg fantasies what they are for a way of building and layering drama that has largely been replaced by the quick-cut high-impact frenzy of contemporary summer offerings. (Theres an intricate irony here. One of the main inspirations for the blockbuster lust that drives todays studio production was Mr. Spielbergs own ""Jaws."") Before we learn that Joes mother died in a steel-mill accident were given the telling detail of a worker resetting the mills number-of-days-since-the-last-accident sign to one. Walter Cronkite is on TV talking about Three Mile Island; maybe something nuclear is going to happen. The camera calmly surveys peaceful landscapes that recall the ones swept by inexplicable phenomena in ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."" (Larry Fong did the excellent cinematography.) Then inexplicability strikes anew--electrical outages dogs fleeing town cars levitating violently auto parts and other hunks of steel vanishing as if sucked up by some invisible Iron Giant. (One metal object scavenged by the kids from the train wreck and looking a bit like a Rubiks Cube seems to have a secret life of its own.) Maybe frightened townspeople think its the start of a Soviet invasion. We dont know whats going on--though the notion of a monster does come to mind--and the movie is in no rush to tell us. Nor does Michael Giacchinos throbbing score tell us more than it should but it seldom tells us less. Most of the performances are first-rate. Not just lovely Alice or ardent Joe who adores her or Charles who speaks of his chubbiness with studied insouciance ""I havent leaned out yet."" The adults are interesting too particularly Joes father a resourceful sheriffs deputy played by Kyle Chandler and Alices father an apparent lout played by Ron Eldard. Gradually though and then not so gradually the pace accelerates the impacts grow the sound levels soar the editing rhythms quicken and ""Super 8"" becomes a thoroughly modern version of its earlier self. This isnt all bad The results are mixed in fascinating ways. Mr. Abrams is a formidable filmmaker in his own right--its hard to believe this is only his third feature film--and his upping of the intensity goes down well enough even though the louder and faster the film gets the more conventional it seems. The structural weaknesses of the script go down less well. Midway through the action the kids go looking for clues to whats going on and find them in absurd abundance in a middle-school biology lab--a trove of someone elses Super 8 film that answers their every question and ours but also sticks out as clumsy exposition. And the climax for all its graphic power feels like a shaky construction of used parts scavenged from Spielberg films especially an emotional moment involving a bracelet that youd be glad to accept as homage if it werent quite so shameless. In the end though ""Super 8"" stands on its own in its own retro-contempo style as a terrifically pleasing summer entertainment. And the pleasure continues beyond the end in a way that goes beyond afterglow. Stay for the final credits and you wont regret it. The Trip Watch a scene from the film ""The Trip."" Video courtesy of IFC Films. Ive always loved comics who do impressions so I was in seventh heaven bordering on eighth during ""The Trip"" an English ramble with a pretext directed by Michael Winterbottom in which Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden riff on celebrity voices while playing approximate versions of their real--their surreal--selves. The pretext is a newspaper assignment. The Observer has asked Steve the character (and Steve the actor for all I know) to review a number of upscale country restaurants in the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales. He sees it as a paid vacation with his girlfriend but she cant go so Rob takes her place on what becomes a marathon of self-indulgence--lots of scallops and truffle oil--during a voyage of self-discovery. The selves they discover differ significantly. Rob a family man is a happy comic no matter how oxymoronic that may seem. Steve an acerbic singleton sees himself adrift at the age of 43. Brooks babble and Steve does too going on compulsively about glaciation and rock formation. Rob actually looks at rocks and feels the passage of time in their presence. ENLARGE Rob Bryden and Steve Coogan in The Trip. IFC Films All of that gives the film a philosophical dimension while deadpan food-prep closeups give it a gastronomic dimension. ""The Trip"" is probably too long but I have to say ""probably"" because I would have been happy with an additional half-hour of Steve and Rob doing more impressions. Rob is like a robot spirit medium that defaults to Sean Connery although the two friends post other Bonds Pierce Brosnan Roger Moore. Woody Allen gets his due; so do Ian McKellen and Alec Guinness. The cream of the jests comes when Steve and Rob exchange impressions of Michael Caine. They dont imitate Michael Caine so much as they become him in vocal modes that include purring threatening and declaiming. They whisper sweet Michael Caines to each other doting on subtle deviations in timbre volume and pitch. All that and scallops too. --See clips from these films and read past reviews at WSJ.com/FilmReview. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Sugarland Express (1974) Just as everyone knows about ""Jaws"" everyone seems to know about ""Duel"" the TV movie that showed Steven Spielbergs promise as a feature director. Not so many remember his exuberant debut feature that involves an outlandish chase across Texas. Goldie Hawn is Lou Jean Poplin recently out of prison and William Atherton is her husband Clovis Poplin whos still locked up. Theyve just lost their infant son to foster parents and will do anything they can to recover him. The cast includes Ben Johnson and Louise Latham. The screenplay was written by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins. Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story (2005) In Michael Winterbottoms giddy riff on Laurence Sternes 18th-century comic novel ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy Gentleman"" Steve Coogan plays three roles the hero Tristram Shandy; Tristrams father Walter Shandy; and an actor named Steve Coogan who is as vain as he is inane--all he cares about is the size of his part. The movie is more concerned with movie-making than with the stuff of Sternes great book but its good for lots of laughs if you share its fondness for actors and for fatuous actors banter which I do. The Stunt Man (1980) This sensationally original film directed by Richard Rush stars Peter OToole as a megamaniacal director Eli Cross and Steve Railsback as Cameron a fugitive turned ad hoc stunt man. The structure is trompe loeil--whats reality whats illusion--and the dominant mood is paranoia Cameron thinks Eli is trying to kill him. The main attraction though is Mr. OTooles madly majestic performance. Lawrence B. Marcus wrote the script from the directors adaptation of a Paul Brodeur novel. Until now the film has been available on a not-so-hot DVD. This week it makes a welcome debut on Blu-ray. 44 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 09 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Theres a lovely quiet magic-of-the-movies moment in Super 8. It comes early when a bunch of fresh-faced kids - were in small-town Ohio circa the late seventies - are doing precisely what producer Steven Spielberg and director J.J. Abrams did when they were fresh-faced kids. The budding auteurs are shooting a monster flick with a Kodak 8-millimetre camera. The makeshift set is an abandoned train station at night and among the boys pretty Alice is the only girl. She gets her lines rehearses privately the camera rolls and thats when the wonder happens. Movies Super 8 The official trailer To the astonishment of everyone including us the girl has the power to instantly transform herself into someone else. Yes magic - Alice can truly act. Obviously so can Elle Fanning who plays her. Almost as good is newcomer Joel Courtney as little Joe the motherless child the young teen with a big crush on pretty Alice. In fact all the kids here are terrific significantly better than the actual movie that surrounds them. Although ostensibly fashioned by Abrams its really a summer-weight Spielberg yarn and kicks into gear when the night train passing through the abandoned station meets with a mishap. Cue the resounding crash and the clunky action - freight cars flying metal screeching Dolby-pounding mayhem. Seems it was a secret military transport carting something that the secretive military really didnt want to escape - something that judging from the colossal growls is out of this world. Not that we see it. Abrams does commendable work keeping the monster in the box offering up only shadowy glimpses until the time comes for its third-act unveiling. Of course in the interim the townsfolk must be subjected to the requisite quota of weird doings. Pretty soon engines are disappearing from cars microwaves from kitchens dogs from their leashes and eventually people from their front porches. Its enough to make Joes daddy the deputy sheriff mighty alarmed and more than a tad suspicious of the armed soldiers who their secret spilled are doing a bad job of containment. Meanwhile our plucky band of Super 8-ers are forging ahead like the diminutive Spielbergs they are - still making their own flick even while contending with the wonky developments of the one that has them in its clutches. There subplots emerge the slim kind designed as diversionary/stalling tactics before the final push of the climax. For example turns out that Alice the sweet gal from the wrong side of the tracks has a drunken dad at loggerheads with Joes deputy dad. So for a millisecond or two were left to wonder if teenie love can bloom amidst the feuding clans. Happily it gets an assist when a home movie pops up among the various other movies a domestic scene with Joes late mom giving him a hug and looking awfully sweet herself. Alice watches with her wannabe boyfriend and dont the two have a moment. But back to the lurching action. The towns power is out and fire is spreading and the kids are in the monsters subterranean lair and the time has arrived for the unveiling. Damn. With all that new-fangled CGI at his disposal Big J.J. comes up with nothing that Little Steven mightnt have concocted decades ago. Its just your standard-issue Thing - robotic tentacled massive yet hardly menacing. Definitely not cuddly though. Whereas that earlier E.T. hailed from the Planet Cute this unfortunate has deep genetic roots in the Planet Ugly. Yet cut the Thing a break. And anyone who doesnt think it has a beating heart or doubts that heart simply wants to ""go home"" should turn in their summer-weight Spielberg badge. You just havent been paying attention. The rest of us young and old will be relatively content enjoying the small pockets of charm tolerating vast expanses of the predictable and bearing witness to that lovely burst of movie magic. And to an even lovelier irony - its the child actors heroic indeed who rescue Super 8 from the blockbuster grip of its adult makers. Super 8 Directed and written by J.J. Abrams Starring Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney Classification PG Super 8 will be shown in sneak previews Thursday in selected theatres across the country.

Its more than an hour into this alien thriller before you finally get a good look at the alien. For pretty much the first half of the new movie from writer-director J.J. Abrams Super 8 isnt really even an alien thriller; its a sad-sweet tale of loss and coming-of-age set in the golden-gone days of the late 70s. Throughout Abrams Super 8 is an unbroken homage to his mentor and this movies producer Steven Spielberg.It opens with an effective bit of compressed storytelling. Through a whirl of images and moments we drop in on a small town where a young boy Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) has just lost his mom. Hes left with a dad the towns deputy (Kyle Chandler) who barely knows him. Joes real family is his small group of friends who look out for one another amid the constant banter of boasts and put-downs.This is the first of many Spielbergian elements to come as we quickly whiz into the next The boys are making a film led by bossy-pants director Charles (Riley Griffiths). In a cute inside-joke nod each of the boys represents a different Hollywood-moviemaking stereotype -- the director consumed by his vision the handsome but vacant leading man the pyromaniacal special-effects expert.Their drive to complete a zombie movie which Charles is determined to make his award-winning masterpiece leads them to add to the cast a beautiful young girl Alice (Elle Fanning). The bid to deepen the emotional impact of the story takes them to a rural train station late one night to shoot a pivotal scene.After the noisiest fireball-filled train derailment since The Fugitive Super 8 kicks into alien-thriller mode as the kids find themselves at the center of a mystery cover-up involving the Air Force portrayed here as an evil invading force. They are sort of storm troopers with Jeeps instead of spaceships led by stock bad guy Noah Emmerich and an unseen but scary alien.As Abrams moves back and forth among this movies different levels from gang-of-boys action to first-love tale to father-and-son struggles to military and secret-monster conspiracy there are effective scenes and thrilling moments. Yet Super 8 ends up feeling like a patchwork paean in which Abrams tries to pay tribute to and update all his favorite things about Spielbergs moviemaking genius.So we have kids scheming to overcome the shortsighted stubbornness of adults to solve a crisis and have an amazing adventure (The Goonies); people floundering about as an unseen predator closes in (Jaws); the innocence of youth triumphing over the anger and fear of adults (just about every movie Spielbergs ever made). And its impossible to overstate the parallels to Close Encounters and E.T. but theres no way to talk about all that without giving away plot points.Super 8 works and offers the occasional burst of powerful filmmaking such as in the way Abrams contrasts the bustling food-and-family-filled chaos of Joes best friends house with the empty dark silence of his own house after his mothers death. But those bursts just make the movies many cliche-filled lapses all the more obvious.Super 8B-Starring Joel Courtney Kyle Chandler Elle Fanning Noah Emmerich and Ron Eldard. Directed by J.J. Abrams.

Its director JJ Abrams salvages the best parts from Steven Spielberg blockbusters. Because Abrams likes his melancholy characters and lets them be awestruck and aw-shucks it works. More about Super 8 >> It takes place during the summer of 1979 the twilight of Americas industrial dominance. Virtually every scene mourns the obsolescence of the American-made as it simultaneously celebrates American ingenuity. Accordingly this likeable sci-fi mystery is set in an Ohio rust-belt town at roughly the time the Walkman displaced transistor radios and slightly before the Betacam superseded the home-movie camera. The film takes its title from the device used by six pubescents to shoot a zombie movie over their summer vacation. A menace stalks both the movie and movie-within-the-movie. Difference being that the one stalking the movie is for the most part heard rather than seen. One night way after bedtime as the young filmmakers stealthily shoot a scene at a nearby station a cargo train derails. The iron clang of a scrapheap magnet and the metal crunch of crumpled steel unnerve the young filmmakers. They include sad-eyed Joe Lamb (newcomer Joel Courtney) age 12 the model maker and makeup artist on the student film and sadder-eyed Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) 14 the slender blonde upon whom he has a crush. While the blood on the tracks is mostly from Joes prop bag some of it belongs to his science teacher Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) whose truck was sideswiped by the hurtling train. ""Do not speak of this"" he warns Joe who scavenges through the wreckage and pockets a mysterious white cube that resembles a life force imprisoned inside a Rice Krispies treat. The unforced performances of Courtney and Fanning are remarkable personifying the universal adolescent condition of wanting equally to stay in the cocoon of the bedroom and also to strike out on an adventure into the unknown. Because their characters are so finely drawn and deeply felt the movies mystery becomes almost superfluous. An uninterrupted sequence where Alice acts with exquisite seriousness while the Super 8 camera is running and goes goofy when the camera stops is very funny and very dear. The films major flaw is that Abrams plays the heartstrings with considerably more finesse than he does the adrenal glands. The worst that can be said about the film is that the characters are far more compelling than the mystery they solve. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For a stretch of the 1980s there wasnt enough Steven Spielberg to go around. While continuing to direct a movie every year or two Spielberg produced films that had the look and feel of Spielberg-by-proxy films filled with end-of-childhood adventures suburbs and small towns that doubled as unexpected sites of wonder or horror. In the best of them directors like Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis put their personal stamp on Spielbergian themes while creating popcorn-friendly films to rival their inspiration. Set in the streets magic-hour-blanketed hills and cluttered suburban homes of a small Ohio town as the 1970s edge into the 80s the J.J. Abrams-scripted-and-directed Super 8--which Spielberg produced--consciously and successfully looks back to an era of abundant Spielbergiana. Joel Courtney leads a cast of talented mostly unfamiliar kid actors as the middle-school-aged son of Kyle Chandler a sheriffs deputy who struggles with the demands of single parenthood after his wife dies in a steel-mill accident. Courtney copes by escaping into a world of models and monster magazines and fills his free hours making a zombie film with his movie-mad pal Riley Griffiths. Their film progresses nicely especially after the addition of Elle Fanning as their female lead even though Chandler blames her father (Ron Eldard) for his wifes death. Then filming surreptitiously at an abandoned train station one night they witness a train derailment that ushers in a series of mysterious happenings that might be explained by events they unwittingly captured on film. Saying more would spoil Super 8s carefully cultivated aura of surprise but suffice it to say that what follows wont be too surprising to those who have seen the films that lend Super 8 their DNA--Spielbergs and others. That makes Abrams film both welcomingly and frustratingly familiar and more the latter as it goes along. Abrams has a gift for capturing awe and dread--sometimes both at once--and a less-inspiring command of what to do with it. More troublingly the films emotional elements feel more tacked-on than deeply considered though the performances help rescue some thinly conceived relationships. (Fanning in particular deserves extra credit on this front.) That said of all the filmmakers who have tried to recapture the Spirit Of 82 nobody has succeeded as well as Abrams does here. Super 8 constructs a believably complicated small-town world fills it with the right period details (apart from an anachronism here and there) shoots it lushly gives it a Michael Giacchino score filled with John Williams-isms then tests its residents sense of order righteousness and willingness to stand up to authority with a chaotic element that could destroy them. Its pleasures are borrowed but durable. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review The Trip Next Movie Review Kidnapped Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

The ending is predictable and eye-rolling ridiculous. The movie is just a one time watch on dvd. Richard you like movies where kids swear like sailors. I dont. Marksaid on Tuesday June 28 2011 112012 PMMy first movie review. Casey Bahrsaid on Saturday June 25 2011 115527 PMIts hard to imagine that J.J. Abrams could have made this movie without Steven Spielburgs body of work. But the quality vision and competence Abrams brings as he brings his story to life on the screen is simply phenomenal. The tension doesnt let up for a second but he still keeps the story personal so it has meaning. Im surprised there wasnt more marketing for this film so more people will enjoy this exciting and entertaining work of art. Lettiesaid on Thursday June 23 2011 104852 PMWoah nelly how about them aplpes Cody Whitesaid on Wednesday June 15 2011 105037 AMNow weve seen this movie before in the late seventies through the early eighties. Super 8 is a interesting experience the first time but when youre out of the theater I was thinking of how I was not captured by the material. Im not saying Super 8 is no where as bad as some movies of today that explode with action and doesnt take much or dont take the time at all with the characters. J.J. Abrams does a great job with the jumps and the obvious scares that are about to appear on screen. But I think the best part aside from the monster that could be related to the monster of Cloverfield the acting from the children is the most memorable. The child actors were fabulous as these kids that want to make a movie but are caught in the blockade of the military and this mysterious monster roaming through the underground of the town these kids are determined directors. I wish directors today would care so much to get the film in the can. I believe Super 8 was fun scary exhilarating and most all captures those movies of the seventies that were brought to us by Steven Spielberg.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Francois Duhamel) If you were weaned on Spielbergian sci-fi such as ""E.T."" phone home and tell your kids that youre taking them on a trip in a time machine. ""Super 8"" produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by J.J. Abrams is such a disarming homage to the cinema of the Reagan era that even grouchy gremlins might feel like its morning in America. But be forewarned that if this movie is exposed to sunlight youll notice the puppet strings.On the checklist of heart-tugging tropes ""Super 8"" starts with a family tragedy. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is 14 and has just lost his mother in a steel-mill accident and his deputy dad (Kyle Chandler) wants him to spend the summer of 79 away from the bad vibes of their Ohio suburb.But Joe is committed to helping his pushy pal Charles (Riley Griffiths) finish a Super 8 movie about zombies. Joe is in charge of makeup and his close encounter with Alice (enchanting Elle Fanning) who plays the femme fatale in their production leaves him hooked on movies and mushy stuff. While the ""Goonies""-style crew is shooting a nighttime scene by the railroad tracks a runaway pickup causes a freight train to derail. Its an absurdly overblown sequence yet typical of Abrams schematic script and the kids are more worried about a missing bag of fireworks than the maimed bodies of crewmen.When they discover a bloodied survivor in the pickup its their science teacher (Glynn Turman) who warns them that their families will die if they reveal what they saw.So naturally the kids come back the next day to film some scenes around the wreckage even as the Army arrives to cordon off the area and retrieve the secret cargo. As house pets heavy machinery and hapless civilians vanish from the town the feds insist theres nothing to worry about. But with clues from their footage and help from the stoner dude at the photo lab (David Gallagher) the kids play detective while the dad confronts the conspirators and his own grief.Breathing new life into these old forms is a next-to-impossible mission but if the skeletons in your closet are made of celluloid ""Super 8"" will be more of a treat than a trick.

Comments click to enlarge Super 8 Video Rated PG-13  112 minutes  2011 Writer-director J.J. Abrams (who did the 2009 Star Trek reboot) overloads this sci-fi adventure with so many homages to his co-producer Steven Spielberg that it plays like the elder directors greatest hits minus his characteristic scares and sense of wonder. In a small Ohio burg during the summer of 1979 five middle-school boys and a female classmate collaborate on an amateur Super-8 zombie movie; while filming late one night at the towns railroad depot they witness a spectacular train derailment then find mysterious geometric cubes among the wreckage of a secret military shipment. Soon the community is plagued by power surges ominous noises behind rustling leaves and unexplained disappearances; when the escaped extraterrestrial insect finally appears it looks like something assembled from that old childrens game Cootie.

For answers catch Super 8 a retro monster mash with a childs heart a prodigys unstoppable imagination and FX dazzle to spare. Writer-director J.J. Abrams and producer Steven Spielberg have tapped their youthful celluloid dreams to craft the ultimate home movie a creature feature built to scare you silly and maybe save the world. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> It seems fitting that the director of the Star Trek prequel would unite with the master behind Close Encounters of the Third Kind and War of the Worlds. Abrams was only 15 when Spielberg two decades older and impressed by the kids Super 8 films hired him to organize the 8mm movies he himself made as a teen. In a sense they both come from outer space an obsession with sci-fi embedded in their DNA. Peter Travers reviews Super 8 in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" Set in an Ohio steel town in the summer of 1979 Super 8 blends the fun vibe of The Goonies (story by Spielberg) with the parallel-universe thrills of Abrams Lost and Fringe. The films teen misfits are bonded by hormones and a need to connect. Newcomer Joel Courtney is stellar as Joe Lamb 14 a boy reeling from the death of his mother and the emotional absence of his dad (Kyle Chandler) the deputy sheriff. Filmmaking provides a harbor for Joe. But hes not the driving force behind the Super 8 camera. That would be Charles (feisty Riley Griffiths) the perfectionist auteur of their zombie movie (loved the crude footage of nails driven into the skull of the undead). Joe handles the special effects. Martin (Gabriel Basso) Preston (Zach Mills) and braces-wearing Cary (expert scene-stealer Ryan Lee) pretend to follow the leader. The Ten Scariest Movie Scenes of the Last Decade From The Ring to Paramormal Activity New to this boys club is Alice (Elle Fanning) a dream girl Charles recruits for the female lead. His instincts for talent are spot-on. Alice a tomboy about to blossom has grown a backbone from coping with her dad (Ron Eldard) who hit the bottle after Alices mom split. Fanning so luminous in Sofia Coppolas Somewhere shines brighter here. No wonder Charles and Joe fall hard. Fanning delivers a shooting-star performance that takes you places you dont see coming. The ""Whaaat"" moments start with a fireball of a train wreck that explodes with sound and visual fury. Later well see the same scene as recorded by the primitive Super 8 camera. The contrast is illuminating. Can you spot a monster crawling out of the wreckage? The 12 Must-See Summer Movies -- Plus Five Unheralded Gems and Five More to Skip Abrams and Spielberg dont always bring out the best in each other. The cliched shot of children staring skyward in wonder should have died with 1991s Hook. And Abrams has a propensity for adding plot twists that go nowhere (hello Lost). Still Super 8 kicks in where it counts. Pulses will pound and palms will sweat. But nothing works without a human connection. The monster that ate Manhattan in Cloverfield which Abrams produced in 2008 lacked a soul. In Super 8 Abrams makes us care. This movie a true beauty will put a spell on you.

Abrams retro fantasy-adventure is uneven but often charming Joe Neumaier Thursday June 9 2011 1054 AM facebook Tweet email Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney star in Super 8 about a group of kids who accidentally film a mysterious train crash in their small Ohio town. (Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 9 2011 1054 AM Title Super 8 Young friends finds a monster in 1979 Ohio. With Joel Courtney Elle Fanning. Director J.J. Abrams. (152) PG-13. At area theaters. Writer-director J.J. Abrams stated model for ""Super 8"" his new retro fantasy-adventure is the late-70s/early-80s movies by Steven Spielberg. And in emotion and execution this uneven but often charming movie produced by Spielberg gets so many things right including its practiced naivete. Whats missing however is a crucial sense of connection to itself. ""Super 8"" knows what it wants to be but like the ketchup-blood zombie flick its young heroes are making with their Super 8 camera the movie skips some steps to achieve an effect. The result is an almost-great valentine to the genre milestones Gen X grew up with. That amateur movie (which we thankfully see in its entirety over the end credits) is being made by 14-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and four pals in their small Ohio town in summer 1979. Joe is hurting over the recent death of his mom at the local steel mill and cant connect to his dad (Kyle Chandler) the sheriffs deputy and a well-meaning guy unprepared for single parenthood. One night while the kids are shooting a scene at a railroad station - accompanied by Alice (Elle Fanning) Joes secret crush - a train crashes spectacularly almost right on top of them. After the dust clears dogs people and electronic devices disappear a cube-like thing Joe found at the wreckage moves on its own and the kids discover they filmed something escaping from a containment car. Which explains why the military is due on Main Street. Abrams fills ""Super 8"" with touchstones some obvious (""Close Encounters"" ""E.T."") others less so (the Twilight Zone"" episode ""Walking Distance"" gets a special shout-out). But while everything feels right - from all the kids spot-on performances especially Courtney and Fanning to Michael Giacchinos playful score to the shimmering era-specific lens flares that pop up in dark moments - there are holes in its execution. The creature for instance has only a cursory link to Joe or the movies inner life. Alices role feels perfunctory though Fanning is a revelation. The arc for the two fathers Joes decent one and Alices screw-up one (Ron Eldard) is incomplete and a subterranean chase lacks true Spielbergian ingenuity. If youre gonna do this after all do it all the way. Still for every lost chance there are genuine grace notes including a sneaky solemnity and the knowledge that a Schwinn Phantom Scrambler was best pedaled standing up. Then theres the monster. Looking for spoilers about his look origin and motivation? Therell be none here since as the would-be filmmakers in ""Super 8"" - including the one who grew up to make this movie - know innocence and wonder are priceless things. Theres only one summer to a customer. Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

He and his friends are shooting a scene at the train station and he isnt about to get another shot at having an honest-to-goodness train speed past and therefore lend instant credibility to this scrappy production. By all accounts J.J. Abrams was that tubby kid at some point. I doubt the man was ever that husky but Abrams grew up making Super 8 movies with his friends bonding over the craft of it all. In 1979 you couldnt exactly add in a passing train later or a crashing one for that matter. So when a train approaches Lillian Ohio under cover of darkness Charles (Riley Griffiths) gets excited and when that train derails all around him and his friends they get scared. Charles isnt our protagonist though; Joe (Joel Courtney) is. The son of a deputy and widower (Kyle Chandler) Joe takes more to monster makeup than Dads recommendation of summertime baseball camps where their figurative distance might be replaced -- or reinforced -- by a literal one and so he falls in with his friends insistent Charles pyro Cary (Ryan Lee) dork Martin (Gabriel Basso channeling Martin Starr) and dweeb Preston (Zach Mills channeling Eddie Deezen). New to the crew is Alice (Elle Fanning) shes perfect to Joe shes ideal for playing the newly-added wife of Martins detective and she can drive. Its handy to have a getaway driver even an underage one when a railroad disaster occurs in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. It makes it easier to evade authorities when they come looking for the culprit behind the crash and the cargo that may have escaped... The thing is J.J. Abrams adored the same Steven Spielberg classics that we all did and if youve seen E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park and Jaws then you have a rough idea of whats in store. Abrams is Charles all grown up still making films with his friends (which now happen to include Spielberg himself as producer) and with no shortage of production value in sight. As the writer-director does a pretty good impression of ""the Beard"" composer Michael Giacchino does a very good impression of John Williams while Larry Fongs handsome cinematography is only compromised by Abrams distracting fondness for lens flares (but its the way S.S. used to do it; this also explains the occasional split-focus shot). Naturally Joes dad knows Alices dad (Ron Eldard) for all the wrong reasons while that same sense of tragedy only brings the kids closer together. Courtneys a newcomer Fanning already a pro (and often a more natural screen presence than older sis Dakota); both are knock-outs here. The young ensemble as a whole exudes an earnest camaraderie in the face of aggressively applied slang and late-inning reveals. Even more the screenplay is laden with emotional shortcuts and obviously important plot points. In fact the inciting train crash is such a phony cacophony of close calls and ham-fisted exposition that by the time the second-half set pieces are doled out they all prove more exciting for their lack of both digital abandon and narrative burden. The sheer topsy-turvy imagery of a suburban war zone here and a school bus/prison transport/makeshift tomb there speaks loud enough on its own. The parallel investigations carried forth by father and son into the Air Forces sudden interest in little Lillian Ohio bring about a perfectly heated confrontation (the man who cant bring himself to cook dinner for his son becomes the sheriff who is powerless to help a scared population of 12000) and a cheeky sense of circumstantial role-playing (both Joe and Dad find themselves reluctantly suited up as soldiers) as something literally digs away at the foundations of their community. Part of the problem is in Abrams approaching his creature with Jaws-like tact playing hide-and-seek with it when early attacks occur. But in Jaws we already knew what a shark was and what it would eventually look like; it was Spielbergs Jurassic Park that made the monster(s) halfway in and thus gave suitable weight to the threat at hand. Abrams spends so long playing the tease that its sudden shift from elusive beast to misunderstood being feels like a last-minute misstep an emotional appeal for an established menace that doesnt tie itself as well into Joes personal arc as it would clearly like to. Abrams Cloverfield cohort Matt Reeves already did a damn fine job remaking E.T. last year with his Let Me In. However Abrams wanted to mimic more than just E.T. and the result is about as sturdy as that film was sure-handed. There is a lot to like about Super 8 but little thats new. Its comfort food whipped up well by a former fat kid; the recipe remains the same.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Super 8 has been written and directed by J.J. Abrams the wunderkind behind ""Lost ""Alias and the 2009 big-screen ""Star Trek but its DNA comes straight from the original boy genius himself. Set in 1979 the movies a honey-colored evocation of Steven Spielbergs most iconic period when the director looked at small-town America from the deck of a visiting spaceship. Its like finding a vintage Schwinn Stingray at a high-end bike store From the no-name cast of resourceful kids to the flawed good-hearted grown-ups to the extraterrestrial going bump in the night ""Super 8 is a fond and unexpected throwback to the days of ""E.T. and ""Close Encounters. You sense Spielberg agreed to produce the film just to make sure theyd get everything right.And they have for the most part. The new movie struggles at times to balance the innocence of its inspirations with the demolition-derby demands of the modern movie marketplace -- you almost feel Spielberg wrestling with Michael Bay for possession of Abramss soul -- but in the end the humor and the humanity outweigh the big-bang-boom. And the movies tip of the hat to the joys of making monster movies with your friends grounds it firmly in the personal.Yes boys and girls this is how you did it before cellphones and YouTube came along. You borrowed dads home-movie camera rounded up your pals and biked off to a vacant lot. There was always one bossy kid who ended up directing. In real life that was Spielberg himself but here its the husky imperious Charles (Riley Griffiths). The guy who liked to blow things up became your special-effects guru; Ryan Lee as Cary seems very much the second coming of Jackie Earle Haley.You had your leading man (Gabriel Basso as the self-serious Martin) and your extra (Zach Mills as the nerdy Preston). If you were lucky you had a girl (Elle Fanning as Alice from the wrong side of the tracks and much crushed upon by the others). And you had the one kid who did a little bit of everything and who is this movies hero -- both its Elliot and its Roy Neary. Joey Lamb (Joel Courtney) has just lost his mother and he doesnt know how to talk to his deputy sheriff dad (Kyle Chandler) but he knows the girl of his dreams when he sees her and he turns out to have a cool head in a crisis.This comes in handy. Sneaking out to film a nighttime scene for Charless Super 8mm zombie epic the Goonies -- I mean the heroes -- witness a train crash and the escape of something big and slithery into the woods. If this were really 1979 the crash would take up half a minute of screen time but the new rules of multiplex engagement mean we get about five solid minutes of thermonuclear explosion and falling shrapnel. Rather too miraculously no one is scratched -- not even Alices dads sweet yellow Buick Skylark.Whatever the critter is -- and Abrams plays hide-and-seek with it much as he did in ""Cloverfield -- its followed by the US Air Force and a nasty Colonel (Noah Emmerich) who ultimately quarantines the town and provides ""Super 8 with one-note villainy. The movie already has its hands full trying to juggle Joeys relationship with Alice his estrangement from his dad her estrangement from her dad (Ron Eldard) Charless attempts to keep his movie on track and the growing civic disorder as citizens and electrical appliances disappear in bursts of violent clamor.For all that the filmmaking scenes are the heart of the movie. Charles is beside himself now that he has actual soldiers and a demolished train to put in the background of his shots and the romance between Joey and Alice rises from their shared work ethic -- they may be kids but theyre also pros. Courtney is especially good as an ordinary boy forced to discover his extraordinariness and is it any coincidence that he bears a passing resemblance to Henry Thomas of ""E.T. (or that Chandler as his dad is a ringer for a young Robert Forster)? Certainly not -- ""Super 8 wears its calculation on its frayed double-knit sleeve.Theres a thin line though between honoring what came before you and replicating it and ""Super 8 occasionally wobbles over that line into predictability. Nor is Abrams quite sure what to make of his monster. Is it friend or foe? Can a movie split the difference and still hold on to our sympathies? Toward the end you feel the filmmaking cutting corners rushing past story points and shortchanging characters to get to the finale which itself lacks the pop immensity of a movie like ""Close Encounters even as it imitates it.

Abrams thriller is a layer cake of a movie that tops our expectations time and again.

As the title suggests its a valentine to filmmaking especially the family-oriented science-fiction variety. J.J. Abrams who directed the best entries in the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises delivers a phenomenal pop-art experience dazzling the senses while aiming straight for the heart. The production has been shrouded in secrecy and its surprises deserve to be protected. The plot with more twists than an aliens tentacle concerns intrigue in a provincial Ohio steel town circa 1979 that could be Nowheresville USA. That is until the night sky is set aflame with artillery fire and tanks thunder through the once-quiet streets. A dozen or so characters are based in the town and Abrams takes his time establishing them with domestic scenes of understated authenticity. At the center of things is 12-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) an only child whose mother recently died. His dad Jack (Kyle Chandler) is not the best-equipped father a sheriffs deputy struggling to care for a son he doesnt know very well. Classmate Charlie (Riley Griffiths) a budding filmmaker aims to pull Joe out of his funk by recruiting him into the zombie thriller hes shooting for an amateur film festival. The other preteen cast and crew include Cary (Ryan Lee) the funny runty pyromaniac special-effects guy; dim leading man Martin (Gabriel Basso) and his troublemaker co-star Alice (Elle Fanning). Shooting at a railroad station the kid filmmakers get more than they bargained for. A U.S. Air Force train cannonballing through town derails resulting in a bombastic pileup and the escape from one of the sealed steel-walled cars of ... something. Abrams keeps us in suspense about the fugitive; our first glimpse indistinctly reflected in a puddle is almost subliminal. This much can be revealed It is not happy. Without warning all the towns dogs have high-tailed it out of there and people are vanishing in attacks we cant quite see. The mystery about this entity powers the movie; almost every character has a crisis moment of trying to decide which response is appropriate. Its not just the kids who have to puzzle their way through their encounters. Most of the adults go agog too. Only Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) the military man assigned to contain the situation lacks that sense of awe. He goes about his job with the ramrod certitude of a man who believes he has anticipated every contingency. It is a disastrous case of overconfidence. SUPER 8  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG-13 for intense sci-fi action and violence language some drug use. The movie has a moral -- about the length to which were driven by our fear of the unknown -- and lessons to teach about letting go of the past. Some message films feel like pap but here it all goes down smoothly. Abrams puts nostalgia and suspense humor and spectacle mystery and sincere emotion in his blender and hits frappe. If I had to fault the film it wouldnt be with its preachy passages but with the train wreck which goes from over-the-top to overkill. Abrams is a sworn enemy of physics -- remember the implausible car-over-the-cliff opening of ""Star Trek""? -- but even for him this is a stretch. When one of the ragamuffin kids yells ""Thats impossible"" spectators will chuckle in agreement. What redeems the film in its awkward flashes is the sheer love of the craft that Abrams brings to the story. You can imagine him at the editing bay his producer Steven Spielberg by his side gushing ""Look at this cool action sequence Check out the framing in this shot Get a load of this performance"" All the kids in the film most of them first-timers are delightful. Fanning an eerily skilled actress portraying a playacting amateur is spectacular. There are scenes involving the kids zombie film where she will make your hair stand up. And when we finally see their rinky-dink production its the final tier on a layer cake of a movie that tops our expectations time and again. In this season of sequels is it too much to hope for a ""Super 9""?

Abramss love letter to the Steven Spielberg films of his youth feels calculated rather than organic. Starring Elle Fanning Kyle Chandler Director J.J. Abrams Running time 158 Release Opened Jun 9 2011  Editorial Review Paying reverence to SpielbergBy Ann HornadayThursday June 9 2011In ""Super 8"" J.J. Abramss ardent love letter to the Steven Spielberg films that inspired him as a kid a chubby would-be director named Charles (Riley Griffiths) keeps running around his small Ohio home town framing its cul-de-sacs and tract homes with his hands and calling for ""more production value.""Charles is shooting his own zombie movie -- on the Kodak home movie film stock that gives ""Super 8"" its name -- and he has commandeered his adolescent friends to work on his cast and crew already evincing the ambitious vision and bullheaded energy that define directors at their most gifted and tyrannical.Even at their most meta the scenes of Charless movie-within-a-movie turn out to be the best parts of ""Super 8"" which takes more than a few pages from such Spielberg-directed-or-produced classics as ""E.T."" ""The Goonies"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Set in 1979 this is a pop-culture nostalgia trip that feels as if its been beamed from a sweeter more innocent time when youngsters could tear around on bikes all night without texting home and when the height of technological innovation was a clunky cassette-playing Sony Walkman.""Kids walking around with their own stereos just what we need"" the town sheriff says at one point. ""Its a slippery slope my friend."" Thats about as winking as it gets in ""Super 8"" in which Abrams reverentially re-creates the spirit of early Spielberg to a spot-on fault.While Charles and his team are filming a nighttime scene at a train station they inadvertently record a horrific accident that ends up drawing the attention of the U.S. Air Force. Charless makeup/sound/special-effects guy Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is convinced that something is afoot between the mysterious military ops an electrical grid gone haywire and a epidemic of missing dogs. As he tries to get to the bottom of it he finds support in Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) the zombie movies leading lady whom he has long crushed on from afar.Joe and Alices relationship unfolds with wistful tender gentleness in ""Super 8"" which juxtaposes Joes tentative romantic forays with his far-thornier dealings with his recently widowed father Jack (Kyle Chandler). Ultimately it falls to Jack a square-jawed deputy sheriff to quell the rising hysteria as the town is invaded by a monster that in the best tradition of Spielberg (who produced his own homage here) remains unseen through most of the movie. Just what and who the monster is forms the central question of ""Super 8."" But despite Abramss best efforts to ratchet up the tension the mystery never takes compelling hold a weakness that becomes especially clear in the movies anti-climax of an ending. At that point the already thin story gets wrapped up so neatly that viewers will scarcely have time to process its plot holes. (What were those little white boxes for anyway?) Like the adolescent director ordering Joe and Alice around Abrams has taken note of what made Spielbergs movies work back in the day -- adventure wonder and high emotional stakes with an isolated young protagonist who overcomes adult cynicism to make empathic contact with an alien being. But all too often the plot feels calculated rather than organic the result of a time-tested formula rather than genuine innovation. (It doesnt help that Abrams has a tendency to move and twirl his camera inching up so close that the action is rendered dizzyingly incoherent.)The times when ""Super 8"" comes most to life are when Charles and his minions are shooting their zombie movie -- including some very funny scenes of guerrilla filmmaking as Charles quickly rewrites his script in order to leverage the ongoing military operation for his own backdrop. Bursting with verve humor and resourceful grit these are also the sequences when the otherworldly Fanning emerges not just as a fetching ingenue but as a true movie star. As she proves in her first big scene as Alice doing her first big scene it takes a terrific actress to play a terrific actress who doesnt know shes terrific. Just moments after Alice transfixes the boys with her line reading Abrams unleashes the kind of spectacular set piece of hurtling metal and exploding fireballs that Charles could stage only in his wildest dreams. A testament both to Abramss own roots as an amateur filmmaker and to how far hes come as a Hollywood player ""Super 8"" succeeds best as a valentine to first movies first loves and the enchantment that ensues when they intersect. Thats production value worthy of even Charless exacting standards.Contains intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence profanity and some drug use.

"Super 8 review Teens making a horror movie encounter an actual monster |       NJ.com comments Super 8 review Teens making a horror movie encounter an actual monster Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 09 2011 at 810 AM updated June 09 2011 at 1027 AM View/Post Comments Francois Duhamel/Courtesy Paramount Pictures/MCTKyle Chandler plays Jackson Lamb from left Joel Courtney plays Joe Lamb Elle Fanning plays Alice Dainard and Ron Eldard plays Louis Dainard in ""Super 8."" We called ourselves ""monster kids."" They called us weirdos. And in the 60s and 70s we were a geeky ghoulish tribe. We haunted newsstands for Castle of Frankenstein magazine. We built every creepy Aurora model. And on weekends armed with the family camera and 50 feet of Ektachrome we tried to make our own movies. The affectionate nostalgic and often thrilling ""Super 8"" is about a gang of kids just like us misfits all who set out during one eighth-grade 1979 summer to make a monster film. And end up filming a real monster. Director J.J. Abrams -- who amped up television with ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" and then segued into movies with ""Mission Impossible III"" and the ""Star Trek"" reboot -- has kept this film under wraps as long as possible. Its an anticipation-building gimmick hes tried before. But unlike the even more secretive ""Cloverfield"" which he produced this film doesnt disappoint. Its as full of rich characters as it is smart popcorn-movie scares. With its band of best friends in trouble it feels like a film you might have seen once on a double feature with ""Stand By Me"" or ""The Goonies."" And because style should always follow content it looks a bit like one of those movies too with careful compositions and clear editing (but much much better special effects). Movie Review Super 8 (PG-13) Paramount (112 min.) Directed by J.J. Abrams. With Joel Courtney Elle Fanning. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and frightening images. Stephen Whittys Review THREE AND A HALF STARS The story starts when the friends are trying to finish making their opus a zombie picture. Theyre out one night doing ""location shooting"" when a train crashes and something gets out. Or rather some Thing gets out. And the Army arrives in force just as citizens start disappearing. Abrams is playing a couple of high-stakes games here. His insistence on keeping the monster off-screen for as long as possible -- nearly 90 minutes in fact -- builds up perilously huge expectations. There are one or two too-cute moments (Steven Spielberg was a producer after all) and the mystery has a few twists that never quite straighten out. But the young actors are all very good particularly Joel Courtney as Joe our good-hearted but decidedly average eighth-grade hero. And Elle Fanning -- who already has the preternatural calm of the young Jodie Foster -- is superb as Alice the sole girl in the group. And while the script as weve come to expect from Abrams is excellent the visuals impress too -- like the cut from a factory sign to a suburban wake that suddenly tells us all we need to know. Or the clever framing at a gas station that always keeps the monster just out of sight. Yes Abrams is a little too fond of easy jokes about retro technology (and strangely besotted with lens flares). And I never quite bought that Alice would hang out with boys making a horror movie. If we could have gotten girls to hang out with us back then we wouldnt have been making horror movies. But those are small complaints about a big bold entertainment -- guaranteed to bring out the monster kid in all of us.

"Super 8 Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Super 8Call it an alien hybrid mash-up of E.T. meets Stand by Me. Too bad its not as good as either of those two classics. Time to phone home J.J. and Steven.June 09 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic From left Gabriel Basso Ryan Lee Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths in... (Francois Duhamel Paramount...)The poster for the new movie ""Super 8"" is dominated not by an image but by two equally prominent names writer-director J.J. Abrams and producer Steven Spielberg. Hybrids may be all the rage for cars but this melding of two cinematic sensibilities though effective at moments is finally not as exciting or involving as it wed like it to be. The story of what happens when half a dozen middle-school kids set out to make a student film in 1979 Ohio and end up enmeshed in something much bigger and scarier ""Super 8"" does not lack for potent elements. Its two lead teens have a fine on-screen chemistry and all the films big action sequences are faultlessly executed. But ""Super 8s"" elements do not jell into a satisfying whole. Though the directors have been personally close for decades a they first connected when Spielberg hired the then-15-year-old Abrams to restore his own 8mm films a their styles do not necessarily mesh. Its a dissonance thats prefigured when the logos of their production companies a Abrams cranky Bad Robot and Spielbergs lyrical Amblin a spiritually clash on-screen. Old-fashioned and genteelly entertaining even wholesome ""Super 8"" plays more like a family film than a kinetic work by Abrams best known on the big screen for such high energy items as ""Mission Impossible III"" and the latest ""Star Trek."" A longtime admirer of Spielberg Abrams has made something more in that directors style than his own an action that has diminished his own effectiveness without replicating what makes the best of Spielbergs films so successful. You only have to compare ""Super 8"" (unfairly perhaps but inevitably) to the Spielberg film it most resembles the impeccably entertaining ""E.T."" to see the ways the earlier movie felt fresh and inventive while the new one has the aura of stuff weve already seen. Very much like Rob Reiners ""Stand by Me"" ""Super 8"" lives and dies by having those six 14-year-old kids as a group protagonist. Like teenagers everywhere they provide both frustration and pleasure. The frustration unfortunately comes first as we meet the boys as an undifferentiated group gathered together at a wake for the mother of one of their number Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who has died in a steel mill accident in the blue collar town of Lillian Ohio. The puerile way these boys interact with each other is standard issue teen behavior more calculated than involving. Only the fact that theyre the core of a gang of kids we eventually see gathering at midnight to shoot a Super 8 short at the local train station gives them any interest at all. That films director Joes best friend Charles (an effective Riley Griffiths) intends his zombie thriller for the rarefied precincts of the Cleveland International Super 8 Film Festival. To up the films emotional quotient Charles asks attractive blond classmate Alice (Elle Fanning) to be in the movie not realizing that she is the girl of young Joes dreams. If the film has an unexpected strength it is the performances of both Fanning and Courtney as Alice and Joe kids who manage to be sweet and natural both together and apart. While Fanning is a known quantity after films such as Sofia Coppolas ""Somewhere"" Courtney does exceptional work for someone who has never acted professionally before. Most of ""Super 8"" however has other things on its mind starting with a truly spectacular train crash that happens right in front of that Super 8 camera because of director Charles never-ending quest for ""production value"" for his midnight short. Something unseen escapes from that train and before you know it all kinds of strange and mysterious happenings traumatize the town. Not the least of these is the arrival of a contingent of all-business Air Force troops led by the surly Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) whose brusque behavior irritates the towns deputy sheriff Jackson Lamb (""Friday Night Lights"" Kyle Chandler) who also happens to be Joes father. All of this is very professionally done though nothing if not overly familiar. It must have been satisfying for both individuals to relive their youthful 8mm moviemaking days and to create the kind of story they would have loved to have told back in the day but none of that necessarily creates value for an audience. The problem with ""Super 8"" is not how much there is to complain about but how little there is to be excited about. Given the abilities of those accomplished names on the poster that has got to be a disappointment. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Super 8 MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and some drug use Running time 1 hour 52 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie Review aThe City of Your Final DestinationaApril 23 2010Leads to Spielberg Offer  Student Film Starts a Hollywood...December 8 1985MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesNot_live_webSteven SpielbergEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-super-8-20110609,0,5770678.story?track=rss",200,super826,super8,latimes

Photo Francois Duhamel Put ""The Goonies"" ""E.T."" ""Close Encounters"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in that blender from ""Gremlins"" -- and transport the mixture back to 1979 in the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean -- and you get J.J. Abrams ""Super 8."" Its an enjoyable well-acted old-school geekfest pitting a group of middle-school students against an escaped monster from outer space. The fun starts with one of the few references to a film not involving Steven Spielberg who serves as a producer here. Our young undersupervised heroes are filming a cheesy zombie movie one night at a closed Ohio train station when they are nearly flattened by a train wreck straight out of Cecil B. DeMilles ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" MORE WATCH THE SPECTACULAR TRAIN CRASH SEQUENCE SUPER 8 -- SLOW LEAVING THE STATION? Actually this derailment easily tops that one and it unleashes a scary spider-like creature that Abrams wisely only shows in brief glimpses until well into the movie. (Lets just say Ridley Scotts 1979 ""Alien"" eventually comes to mind.) The creature was being transported by rail (for reasons never remotely explained) by the Air Force which forces the evacuation of the town while it searches for the escaped extraterrestrial. The kids science teacher (Glynn Turman) whose car was involved in the derailment warns them to tell nobody about what they saw (and recorded on film -- a reference to ""Blow Up"" and ""Blow Out""). Which at first is fine with the teens who are mostly just interested in finishing their little movie (the title refers to an archaic amateur film format) anyway. At least they are until the movies female lead -- middle-school cutie Elle Fanning whose dads convertible is miraculously left more or less unscratched by the accident -- gets abducted by the rampaging creature. Im not going to get into any more of the unsurprising plot except to mention black-and-white movies shot at Area 54. But it goes without saying that while the nominal setting may be the Rust Belt instead of Southern California the film is still recognizably set in the emotional confines of Spielbergland. Its told through the eyes of an excellent newcomer Joel Courtney whose characters mother has died in a steel-mill accident four months earlier. He has an uneasy relationship with his father (top-billed Kyle Chandler) a deputy sheriff who comes into conflict with the scary Air Force officer (Noah Emmerich) conducting the search. The filmmaking crew is headed by the husky and pushy Riley Griffiths (an apparent stand-in for Spielberg to Courtneys J.J. Abrams) who yells ""production value"" when he sees the oncoming freight train and rushes to get it into the background of his film. Griffiths had hoped to use the project to get acquainted with the character played by Fanning who gives a star-making performance as the spunky heroine. She is nicely abetted by Ron Eldard as her drunken single father who feels responsibility for the death of Courtneys mother. Abrams who directed the underrated ""Star Trek"" reboot does a great job with the family scenes as well as the nascent romance between Fanning and Courtney who handles makeup and special effects for the film-within-a-film. Metal-mouthed scene-stealer Ryan Lee who likes to blow things up is the groups future Michael Bay and Gabriel Basso is their awkward leading man. Besides Richard Donners Spielberg-produced ""The Goonies"" the scenes with the kids most directly recall Rob Reiners ""Stand by Me."" If your movie has to be derivative there are certainly worse models. If youre familiar with Spielbergs work though its nearly impossible to watch Abrams film without forgetting this is a conscious and occasionally self-conscious homage to the master. A scene with a power lineman immediately summoned up ""Close Encounters"" for me and the 9/11-style bulletin board with notices about missing dogs is straight out of ""War of the Worlds."" Which is not to say I didnt have a good time at the relatively straightforward (its no ""Lost"") and family-friendly ""Super 8"" (even with an utterly gratuitous F-bomb and a pot-smoking slacker). Part of the charm is the setting an analog world where the Sony Walkman is cutting-edge technology. Be sure to stick around during the credits when we see the kids hilarious zombie movie allegedly shot by the young actors themselves. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Crooked Arrows team casting lacrosse players in tri-stat...

Abrams; Author J.J. Abrams; Release Date Wide 06/10/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted June 15 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Loving Playful and spectacularly well made Super 8 is easily the best summer movie of the year -- of many years. And I make that declaration with full knowledge that the season has just begun. Its been eons since a movie has conjured up such intense specific feelings images memories and nostalgic fantasies about American summertime youth -- everyones American summertime youth regardless of current age nationality sex or climate. Its been ages since adolescent innocence fatherly authority and everyday awe were in movie vogue. This irresistible story of middle-school-age kids who set out to make a zombie flick accidentally witness a sensational train crash and become involved in a tale of extraterrestrial mystery straight out of an E.T.-era Steven Spielberg pic may leave viewers dumbstruck How have we survived for so long on such a meager high-cal low-nutrition diet of processed summertime superhero sequels? Super 8 is an antidote to that emotional-?vitamin deficiency. Its also a great specimen of original storytelling grounded in a sophisticated respect for storytellers who have come before. Writer-director J.J. Abrams has described his movie as a love letter to the kind of Super 8 monsters-and-chases stuff he made as a boy which were influenced by the Raiders/Close Encounters sagas of Steven Spielberg who himself made 8mm monsters-and-chases stuff as a boy. (Spielberg is a Super 8 producer.) The loop works beautifully. As with Spielbergs earlier culture-changing pop sagas the gigantic science-fiction mystery that drives the sci part of Abrams well-paced fi is awesome. (Why are secretive military troops so intent on taking charge of the wrecked train and its contents? What strange alien force is tearing out the towns power lines and ripping the engines from cars?) But the human characters involved are given equal weight. The cast -- both the kid pals making their zombie movie and the adults around them -- is the result of inspired blending. Among the younger players 15-year-old novice Joel Courtney holds the screen with his unteachably open-faced sweetness in the pivotal role of Joe a boy experiencing first grief (with Spielberg-esque inevitability his mother recently died) and first love (extraterrestrially talented Elle Fanning plays the one girl among the boys). Among the adults Friday Night Lights great Kyle Chandler is ideal as the towns deputy sheriff (hes Joes father and a grieving widower himself) while The Walking Deads Noah Emmerich slides expertly into the job of the sinister head of military operations who commandeers the town. Typical of such outstanding Abrams productions as Star Trek Cloverfield and TVs addictive megamystery Lost Super 8 wears its humor and knowledge lightly both in screenplay and in production values. There is as much time available in this lovely summer movie for a convenience-store dude to marvel at the invention of the Walkman (a personal stereo system); for a couple of boy buddies to fight over a girl; for various bodies to be snatched in the best monster-movie tradition; and for townsfolk to gather united in wonder at something astonishing happening in the sky. As a result we gather in wonder too aloft with pleasure. A Check into this and our other highly anticipated summer movies at GetGlue to earn EW Summer Movie stickers.

"Super 8 movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs J.J. Abrams phone homeDirector lovingly scene-checks his way through Spielberg canon in Super 8 -- 3 starsJune 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLeft to right Kyle Chandler plays Jackson Lamb Joel Courtney plays Joe Lamb Elle Fanning plays Alice Dainard and Ron Eldard plays Louis Dainard in ""Super 8.""Set in 1979 and the summer of ""Alien"" and ""Breaking Away"" ""Super 8"" evokes a time before smartphones and YouTube when making movies with your pals (inspired by the last five movies you saw at the two-screen theater out by the shopping center) took some effort risked serious social isolation and constituted a high rarefied calling.Its a good time this movie -- a critter picture conjoined with a coming-of-age picture. While its more obvious 70s and 80s influences (starting with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" and continuing on to the less vibrant realm of ""The Goonies"") pack the frame very tightly writer-director J.J. Abrams brings so much affection to the project the results reveal both the film geek he surely was as a Spielberg-lovin kid and the hard-charging populist he has become.With ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" on TV and the ""Star Trek"" reboot on film Abrams has proved himself a savvy combiner of existing genre elements. The same holds true for ""Super 8"" which is set in a hilly Ohio steel town (filmed in Weirton W.Va. where Michael Cimino filmed much of ""The Deer Hunter"") that manages to look cozy yet somehow ripe for trouble.The trouble begins straight off. Joe the young teenage son of a local police officer has lost his mother in a mill accident. The boys insecure overbearing friend Charles is making a zombie movie and has persuaded the elusive slightly older cute girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to join the shoot. One night out on the local train station platform the kids film a scene while behind them a vehicle drives onto the tracks just as an Air Force train bears down hard. One massive derailment later (caught on film Zapruder-like) the strange cargo confined to a particular boxcar has made its presence known.What is going on? The dogs are running away. Everybodys machine parts and appliances and car engines begin to vanish. Young Joe has an odd Rubiks Cube-like piece of metal from the crash site. Surely that provides a clue. The police chief played by Kyle Chandler with easy sincerity doesnt like Joe played by the excellent and soulful newcomer Joel Courtney wasting his time with ""kids who run around with cameras and monster makeup."" In the context of a movie-besotted movie like ""Super 8"" the cops lucky to survive another reel even after saying something like that.Abrams knits together the ordinary stories of the mill towns inhabitants in a way that feels dramatic without showing their contrivances too obviously. And his casting of Courtney and Fanning was fortuitous though Abrams banter for the supporting kids grows tiresome in that ""Goonies"" way.Without blowing too much Abrams runs into interesting matters of homage versus rip-off as ""Super 8"" progresses into the full-on ""Close Encounters""/""E.T."" part of its story. Will early 21st century teenagers and their nostalgic parents care about any of that? I doubt it. Like ""Cloverfield"" which was clever but offered less to care about in terms of the humans at stake ""Super 8"" plays hide-and-seek with its visiting adversary for as long as possible. Abrams knows how not to bore an audience; hes exceptionally pace-y (though he misjudges the derailment sequence slightly; its too overwhelmingly digital in its pile-on effects). Yet check out Spielbergs ""Close Encounters"" again sometime. Its remarkable how loosey-goosey and unformed parts of that wonderful film are and how it doesnt hammer you every second. Until its charming end credits ""Super 8"" never slows down for better or worse. But it works.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some drug use)Cast Kyle Chandler (Jackson Lamb); Elle Fanning (Alice Dainard); Joel Courtney (Joe Lamb); Gabriel Basso (Martin); Noah Emmerich (Nelec); Ron Eldard (Louis Dainard); Riley Griffiths (Charles); Ryan Lee (Cary); Zach Mills (Preston)Credits Written and directed by J.J.

Super 8 Good Director J.J. Abrams. Cast Elle Fanning Joel Courtney Kyle Chandler. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and some drug use. This weeks new movie releases Invasion of the alien movies They want to be entertained. They want to be thrilled. They want to be scared. They want to laugh. They want escape from the problems in their everyday lives. They want to be reminded of their youth connecting with a nostalgia that recalls what made them fall in love with movies in the first place. Interview Joel Courtney of Super 8 10 films with kids banding together Talk about a bargain ""Super 8"" writer and director J.J. Abrams love letter to Steven Spielbergs early films (Spielberg is a producer) delivers on all of those counts and probably a few I didnt think of. Its not a perfect film - the ending couldnt possibly live up to the build-up for instance - but it is just a tremendous amount of fun. The film takes place in 1979 in the small Ohio town of Lillian and starts with a tragedy. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney outstanding in his first role) 12 has just lost his mother to an accident at the local steel mill (grisly business if his friends post-funeral gossip is to be believed). This strains what is evidently an already distant relationship with his father the stoic Jackson (Kyle Chandler) a deputy sheriff. Months pass and that relationship grows no closer. But Joe is happy enough. He serves as the special-effects and makeup specialist on the Super-8 movie his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) is directing. Charles is portly pushy and completely committed to his film a zombie feature he wants to enter in a local festival. Somehow they convince Alice (Elle Fanning) a 14-year-old blonde and thus by default way out of their league to be in the movie. Plus shes willing to sneak out her fathers car at midnight and take them to a remote train station to shoot a crucial scene. When a train is heard in the distance Charles is elated sensing a chance for a little realism for his movie. They start filming but Joe notices a truck wildly careening onto the tracks at the last minute; a massive wreck - even by effects-heavy sci-fi action movie standards - ensues. All the kids survive as does the driver of the truck their science teacher who warns them to tell no one of what theyve seen or they and their parents will be killed. Within minutes the Army is swooping in. Joe and his friends get away but know there is more to this than a train wreck. In a great nod to how things used to be even with a rush order Charles film wont be developed for three days so they cant see what they might have captured right away. It turns out to be the key in understanding just what was on the train. About that not much more. Abrams reveals things slowly agonizingly brilliantly so you wont learn much more here. But something is obviously going on. Theres a great scene in which Joe posts a missing dog sign; as the camera pulls back we see hundreds of others. Soon people go missing too. The sheriff disappears leaving Jackson in charge but the military represented by Noah Emmerich as a duplicitous colonel is calling the shots and clearly trying to hide something. Just whats being hidden will become evident soon enough. But whats so good about ""Super 8"" is that the big reveal as it were is secondary to the story of the kids. Alice sneaking the car out behind her dads back is a bigger risk than it seems; her father (Ron Eldard) is trouble something Jackson knows. Alice and Joe despite their differences are alike in that theyre lonely. Whatever might be running around wreaking havoc is scary but not as scary as the uncertainty of a fractured home life. Its all about perspective. Chandler is his usual sturdy self but all of the kids are fantastic (including a hilarious Ryan Lee as a budding pyromaniac). Courtney and Fannings tender awkward chemistry is perfect; so too is Griffiths. Its not hard to imagine a lot of the young Abrams and Spielberg in Charles and his film fanaticism. Echoes of ""E.T."" and ""The Goonies"" abound but this is still Abrams film. The power of imagination at work here is moving playing out in the movie the kids are making but also in how they deal with the world and with crisis. They may not be able to score a seat at the cool-kids lunch table but they fare much better than anyone else when everything is being torn apart around them.

But Is That a Bad Thing? REVIEW | Yes JJ Abrams ""Super 8"" is Spielberg Porn. But Is That a Bad Thing? Eric Kohn Jun 8 2011 152 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Twenty years ago Francis Ford Coppola predicted a bright future for personal movies. ""One day some little fat girl in Ohio is going to be the new Mozart"" he said"" ""and make a beautiful film with her fathers little camcorder and for once this whole professionalism about movies will be destroyed forever and it will become an art form."" JJ Abrams has turned Coppolas forecast into plot if not practice ""Super 8"" is literally about a fat kid in Ohio making a movie. However it uses that grain of inspiration to create an enjoyable sci-fi nostalgia trip with the help of a familiar name Steven Spielberg Abrams executive producer and the de facto cinematic deity whose filmmaking bible defines the movies chief appeal. ""Super 8"" amounts to Spielbergian porn and unlike another critic I mean that as a compliment. From its mysterious otherworldly presence with unknown motives to the late 70s suburban kids whose vast imaginations are swept up in its path ""Super 8"" contains echoes of ""E.T."" ""Close Encounters"" ""Jurassic Park"" and even less essential entries in the Spielberg canon like ""War of the Worlds."" Abrams ably meets the challenge of aping Spielbergs command of classic film language Luxurious crane shots capture the vast empty landscape; methodical pacing competently draws out the suspense and the soundtrack boasts melodramatic crescendos straight from the John Williams playbook. The director even adheres to the cardinal rule of geekology which demands that you must never show the full body of the monster too soon. Something is loose in the sleepy town of Lillian Ohio but you have to stay until the end to see it for yourself. Creepy implications keep ""Super 8"" engaging but the cast makes it click. As Joe the prototypical adolescent outcast who loves model trains more than his social life Joel Courtney makes a memorable and subtle onscreen debut. The characters mother dies in a construction accident before the movie begins leaving him in an uneasy position with his mopey dad Lillians committed sheriff (Kyle Chandler). Joes best pal is the aforementioned aspiring director chubby goofball Charles (Riley Griffith) who wants to make a Romero-esque zombie movie for the local film festival. The two kids both harbor crushes on classmate Alice (Elle Fanning) although only Joe can relate to her single-parent household. At any rate Charles real love is his movie and hes worried about its prospects. ""Its not a story yet"" he moans watching amateur dailies filled with fake blood. Abrams responds to that typical complaint by loading ""Super 8"" with plenty of story to spare. When an unseen creature escapes from a train wreck hardened military men show up and put the town on lockdown. Dogs and humans abruptly vanish. Nobody seems to have a clue what to do when the entire populace is quarantined-except for those brave young adventurers. Collectively Joe Charles and their colorful friends come across like ""The Goonies"" by way of Encyclopedia Brown courting danger and evolving into unlikely heroes. It would make a great double bill with the upcoming British sci-fi adventure tale ""Attack the Block"" another kids-versus-aliens yarn. Viewed on its own terms however Abrams script is about the fantasy of movies coming to life. It imagines what might happen if Coppolas proverbial fat girl lived out her dream to its fullest extent. Spielberg whose child characters have idolized dinosaurs and aliens before meeting them face to face knows this formula in his sleep. ""Super 8"" displays the transition from Spielberg the man to Spielberg the noun. (As in Abrams has pulled a Spielberg.) But its far from perfect. The imitation of familiar tropes are sometimes too methodical to feel entirely genuine. In true Spielbergian fashion the events erupt into heavy sentimentalism with its penultimate scene softening the momentum. Why bother letting the music swell when understatement has already done the trick? No matter In the last minute before the credits roll Abrams rediscovers his groove with the sort of beautiful pop-art poetry that has dwindled in an era of blockbusters defined by speed and volume. Its a boldly earnest climax; another Spielbergian lesson well learned. As it happens ""Super 8"" is only one of two movies opening this weekend with blatant nods to ""Jurassic Park."" Andre Ovredals wonderfully fun ""The Troll Hunter"" is somewhat more significant. The Norwegian filmmakers fake documentary about a couple of film students trying to make a real documentary on clandestine trolls and finding themselves faced down by the deadliest of the bunch delivers a constant rush. Furthermore it introduces convincing special effects within distinctly low-budget means replete with a shaky-cam technique and improvised dialogue. Despite its intentionally unpolished moments ""The Troll Hunter"" contains a breathless chase scene that samples Spielbergs memorable T-Rex roar just as Abrams does at a key moment in ""Super 8."" Ovredals smaller-scale project comes closer to realizing the concept behind the fat girl making her movie. ""Super 8"" merely expresses the dream of that potential. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Many box office pundits are certain that ""Super 8"" will flop. A few others think Abrams and Spielberg have a secret hit on their hands. More likely distributor Paramount faces a middle ground between those two opinions The movie will open softly and do solid business based on generally positive word of mouth then enjoy a healthier life on DVD. criticWIRE grade B+ ""Super 8"" opens nationwide this Friday.

J.J.s company harbors themselves on something that even some of those old Spielberg films did not have...the multi-layred story archs. In E.T. We really never got to look close at Elliotts and Gertas relationship with their single parent mother it was never about her....Bad Robots work outside of their usual beautiful pop culture past culture and science referencing makes the fantastical part of the story more real because the characters and their relationships are driven and changed by it.This is something that Abrams and Co. have done along with the like of Ronald Moore (Battlestar Galactica re-imaged) that has been missing from epic advantures and science fiction stories for years....

Hoberman Super Fun Super Loud Super 8 Wednesday June 8 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Uh-oh.Francois Duhamel A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A big-bang demolition derby J.J. Abramss much-anticipated greatly enjoyable Super 8 seems bound for box-office glory. Opening three weeks before July 4th this Steven Spielberg-produced kid-centric 21st-century disaster flick could well hang on at theaters till the 10th anniversary of 9/11--an event that haunts Abramss surefire blockbuster nearly as much as it did his earlier production Cloverfield or his major influence the masters War of the Worlds.Set in a small rustbelt town during the summer of 79 Super 8 basically refracts--or re-refracts--a familiar 50s sci-fi trope even as Abrams riffs on the freshly minted sense of suburban wonderment that Spielberg brought to the material in the late 70 and early 80s. Newly motherless Joe Lamb (neophyte Joel Courtney) is making a Super 8 Night of the Living Dead with a bunch of fellow 14-year-olds. In a nice touch the most obnoxious is the director (Riley Griffiths another first-timer) while the star most convincingly is Elle Fanning a nice girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Joes puppy love is sealed by her playfully bestowed zombie kiss although Abrams may himself identify with the second most obnoxious goony an annoying little firebug who lives to blow things up (Ryan Lee).The kids are out late one night secretly filming by the town railroad when a pickup truck apparently stalls on the tracks precipitating a massive flaming-boxcar-hurling apocalyptic derailment of terror--not the first instance of total Ground Zero devastation this Ohio town will endure. Before long unseen whatzits are liquidating various characters stealing car engines cutting the electrical power and frightening the towns dog population into scampering out for neighboring counties.The U.S. Army even more sinister here than in Close Encounters or E.T. takes control leaving legitimate if overly uptight authority to Joes father (Kyle Chandler) a local deputy sheriff. (The movie has a fair amount of emotional backstory which mainly comes down to what makes a good dad.) ""This feels like a Russian invasion"" someone insists at a chaotic town meeting--and thats before the armys red-faced commander (Noah Emmerich) orders a mass evacuation. Soldiers are ubiquitous but as in Cloverfield Abrams rations out the whatzit appearances in fragmentary bits and pieces. The movie manages to keep its secret for nearly 90 minutes and although not hard to figure you wont have it spelled out by me.Drawing on George Romero as well as Spielberg (teenage 8mm filmmakers both) Super 8 is part travesty part homage. Abrams has something of Romeros skepticism and cheesiness. Hes less cloying than Spielberg and hardly concerned with superficial verisimilitude--although it is possible that the first Walkman in America showed up in an Ohio 7-Eleven. Abramss kid-clutter mise-en-scene is more extreme; his sense of humor is wilder. (The obligatory wall of scribbled messages is entirely devoted to missing pets.) Before the movie ends suburban heaven becomes a war zone of tanks and explosions while an instance of mind-melding rapport between the kids and the whatzit is near-hilarious in its deadpan sentimentality. And through it all the kids keep working on their project. In a sense that movie is Super 8 itself--the intensity vaporizes thought as the galloping pace tramples narrative logic into dust. (According to the press notes the actual Super 8 movie was shot and directed by Abramss teenage cast.)Named for an obsolete cinema technology Super 8 is involving enough to create its own reality. (Exiting the theater you may instinctively duck to avoid an SUV plunging out of the sky.) The movie begins by evoking a mom crushed to death in a steel-mill mishap and it never wanders very far from the spectacle of smashed metal and shattered glass. The whole thing feels like one long car crash--not meant as a put-down. Machines exist to pulverize or be pulverized. Without necessarily meaning to be Super 8 is an American tale dramatizing the long-ago crack-up of the nations industrial infrastructure.

Abrams modest Spielberg-era nostalgia trip invests a sweet family-friendly drama with big-budget thrills. A terrifying spider-like alien interrupts an amateur film crews attempts to shoot a shoestring zombie movie in ""Super 8"" investing a sweet family-friendly drama with big-budget thrills. Rare is the writer-director capable of creating such compelling horror-movie characters yet one suspects J.J. Abrams spirited teen ensemble would have sustained our interest even without the CG E.T. Sadly the helmer seems too smitten working with Steven Spielberg to recognize that his idol-turned-champion created the very paradigm that limits his passion project forcing this modest nostalgia trip to function as a blockbuster. What could have been a sleeper hit seems ill equipped to attract the broad summer audience its tentpole trappings demand. Opening with an elegant if somewhat by-the-book bit of character work ""Super 8"" establishes a star-crossed backstory for middle schoolers Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney cute in that ""Mikey likes it"" kind of way) and Alice Dainard (""Somewheres"" ever-remarkable Elle Fanning). His father is a newly widowed sheriffs deputy (Kyle Chandler); hers a drunken long-haired factory worker (Ron Eldard) indirectly responsible for the accident that killed Joes mother -- an incident wisely left unseen. Despite whatever bad blood exists between their parents Joe cant help being attracted to his pretty blonde classmate which would be fairly generic stuff if not for Abrams decision to set the romance against the production of a backyard monster movie. Joe isnt the director but merely the makeup artist leaving him to flirt with Alice while bossy best friend Charles (husky and equally charming newcomer Riley Griffiths) sets up the shot serving as a less flattering stand-in for the helmer. As a teenager Abrams was enterprising enough for his filmmaking exploits to catch Spielbergs eye which earned the young prodigy a gig restoring Spielbergs own 8mm homemovies. Three decades later Abrams seems to be fulfilling a childhood dream directing an elaborate homage to those early days under the Amblin banner. American directors are constantly paying tribute to the fertile ground that inspired their own careers (Woody Allen had ""Radio Days"" Joe Dante made ""Matinee"") but Abrams attempt is different in that he allows an ear-splitting server-straining CG train crash to derail his rose-colored reverie emerging with a relatively standard monster movie instead. Had ""Super 8"" opened in 1979 the year in which its set one might have easily mistaken the film for the work of Spielberg who had channeled his alien-invasion and suburban-family anxieties into ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" two years earlier. But even though Abrams leans heavily on many of his mentors stylistic signatures -- lingering on the faces of awestruck kids withholding the monster for as long as possible and transforming an all-American neighborhood through Klieg lights and crane shots to name but a few -- ""Super 8"" owes at least as much to another picture hitting theaters that summer Ridley Scotts ""Alien."" The latter debt feels more subconscious since Abrams doesnt reference Scotts dark acid-dripping scarefest nearly so openly and yet in both temperament and scale ""Super 8s"" alien-on-the-loose indubitably shares a fair amount of that classic H.R. Giger-designed creatures DNA. Still despite an inspired explanation for why the beast is so hostile (hint nurture not nature) Abrams alien seems like an afterthought in a story that is far more invested in its six young human characters. For one ""Super 8"" refrains from giving auds a good look at the giant otherworldly arachnid until so late in the game that it forces our attention on the junior ensemble who were selected carefully enough to hold their own onscreen (Gabriel Basso Zach Mills and metal-mouthed scene-stealer Ryan Lee round out the group). On one hand Abrams had crafted an endearing ""Son of Rambow""-style period piece bottling that childhood thrill of cinematic discovery like so many summer lightning bugs while at the same time he feels compelled to turn it into something bigger. After making mega-successful installments in the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises the Paramount golden boy has been granted the freedom to direct his first genuinely original feature so long as the project in question is capable of delivering the same boffo box office potential. ""Super 8"" is refreshing to the extent that it feels personal but ultimately exasperating for how much the project is compromised by unfair expectations --  partly the fault of a hush-hush fanboy-focused viral marketing campaign that misrepresents a film best suited for todays teenage filmmakers the vast majority of whom have never touched celluloid much less heard of Super 8 film stock. By virtue of his standing Abrams is able to assemble a top-shelf team of collaborators including vfx legend Dennis Muren (""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"") longtime composer Michael Giacchino and d.p. Larry Fong (""Sucker Punch"") though none has contributed his best work The monster is a disappointment Giacchinos score is forgettable and Fong gets distracting lens flares while trying to imitate Allen Daviaus style.

Abrams. TWITTER Geek kids in small town America uncover alien life in writer-director J.J. Abramsa sincere summer pic writes Todd McCarthy. Like an old airplane (or spacecraft) jerry-rigged from scrap pieces and made air-worthy again Super 8 has been patched together with 30-year-old spare parts to provide an enjoyable ride of its own. With writer-director J.J. Abrams capably manning the controls but with producer Steven Spielberg conspicuously on board as navigator to provide sage advice this science fiction adventure centered on film geek kids in smalltown 1979 America is something Spielberg can easily be imagined having made himself around the same time and is indeed unthinkable without him. Engaging on its own terms and sharply tuned in to the wavelength of pubescent boys and girls this Paramount release looks set for a profitable flight as a widely appealing general audience summer attraction. No one can say theres anything new here. The specific setting may be Rustbelt U.S.A. instead of a blandly anonymous western state community but the ingredients are pure Spielberg from the first 10-15 years of his career Fractured average American households often with one parent missing where kids must fend for themselves and are more aware of something big happening around them than are the distracted small-minded adults; a threatening alien interloper whose presence once made public will throw authorities and the populace into a panic and entire communities into flight; kids who can save the day by being open to their imaginations; nerds not brawny macho types as heroes; a monster whose fearsome power is made clear but whose physical characteristics are only gradually revealed; flawed parents whose eyes are finally opened to the virtues of their children; swooping crane shots and dollies-in for close-ups; nighttime scenes punctuated by bright lights shining at the camera and over-archingly an abiding love of sci-fi and monster lore as absorbed and in this case replicated by movie-crazy kids. This latter element adds one new element to the formula injecting into the mix a layer of Blow- Up and Blow Out that of an explosive incident accidentally caught on film that provides the key to a huge cover-up. The little band of Lillian Ohio middle school filmmakers is led by the chubby intensely driven Charles (Riley Griffiths) with Joe (Joel Courtney) as his makeup and special effects expert a crucial position given that theyre making a zombie movie to submit to a teen film festival. To their mutual delight and surprise the school blond beauty Alice (Elle Fanning) has agreed to co-star in their opus and her pale skin indisputably provides a receptive canvas for undead facial adornments. The pushy Charles comes from a large boisterous family but Joe and Alice have troubled homes; as a prologue informs Joes mother was recently killed in a factory accident a tragedy to which Joes cop father Jackson (Kyle Chandler) for some reason connects Alices drunken derelict father Louis (Ron Eldard). Slipping out at midnight for a clandestine shoot the trio and their filmmaking cohorts head for an outlying old train station to create a key scene with Alice and leading man Preston (Zach Mills). When he notices a train unexpectedly approaching the excitable Charles yells ""Production value"" and sets the camera to include it little knowing that a pickup truck will pull onto the tracks and be deliberately positioned to create a collision that will far exceed the spectacle of the train wreck in Cecil B. DeMilles The Greatest Show on Earth Abrams and Spielbergs acknowledged inspiration for the sequence. Unconvincingly the driver who caused the crash school science teacher Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) survives to warn the kids not to say anything to anyone about what they saw but they do pick up one odd little white cube from among crates of them being transported on the train. In a quaint touch that will be especially amusing to those old enough to remember the pre-video days of delayed gratification the kids must wait three days for their film to be developed. But when they finally see their footage they realize the camera remained running through the wreck and theres something vaguely visible moving around in the darkness that looks very creepy. ""That was mint"" as Charles repeatedly says in his own curious precursor to ""awesome"" and the battle lines are drawn. Air Force personnel led by the the ruthless Nelec (Noah Emmerich) immediately move in to exercise damage control and prevent the public from learning for example that the train was transporting unknown material from the legendary Area 51. When the sheriff vanishes after one of several instances of violent nocturnal disturbances Jackson takes charge of the local force and finds himself at increasing odds with the military. Enterprisingly the kids sneak into Dr. Woodwards office and find secret government footage revealing that an alien landed in the U.S. in 1958 the repercussions of which are just now being felt. Through all the big action of the final half including the towns forced evacuation further disruptions by the alien the kids continued efforts to film their movie and their ultimate escape from incarceration to try to save the day Abrams still finds time to delineate some of the characters emotional struggles notably between Joe and his cop dad who begins to realize his boy may not be completely out to lunch after all; between Alice and Louis whos revealed to be more a complex character than initially indicated and even between Charles and Joe about their competitive feelings for Alice the latter a nicely realistic touch of a sort not commonly found in Spielbergs own work. Despite these fractious relationships and an entirely unnecessary f-bomb lobbed in at one point Super 8 remains a somewhat softer more benign experience than the mostly harsher and harder sci-fi and fantasy fare produced today; its more attuned to the sensibilities of say 12-14-year-olds than to those of kids say 16 and up and only time will tell if this limits the audience somewhat. Its entirely a throwback to be sure but also a sincere evocation of emotions and aspirations many kids experience at that transitional stage and admirable in its devotion to the dawning of creative impulses and bubbling imaginations. Although the impressive Fannings presence carries with it some contemporary associations as well as passing thoughts of her older sister Dakotas role in Spielbergs War of the Worlds Super 8 has been cast in a solid but unglamorous manner befitting the common folk setting. Technically it looks almost identical to a Spielberg film from three decades ago. End credits are worth sticking around for as they reveal the final full version of the Super 8 movie the kids endured so many distractions to make.

By David Edelstein Published Jun 5 2011 ShareThis (Photo Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) The J. J. Abrams sci-fi thriller Super 8 is a Steven Spielberg homage/rip-off produced by Spielberg himself. It would be easy to dismiss as 100 percent ersatz if it didnt rekindle at least some of the old excitementand if the magic of Spielbergs older movies didnt filter through like light from a distant galaxy. The film is called Super 8 because the principal charactersfive pubescent Ohio boys of various shapes and a willowy blonde girlare in the midst of shooting a ragtag zombie movie (its the seventies prehome video) at an empty isolated railroad station when a pickup truck veers onto the tracks and derails an onrushing freight train. The injured driver a high-school science teacher tells them to run or theyll be killed. The Air Force shows up hunting for something that looks to be very big and lethal. Walter Cronkite is on the TV talking about Three Mile Island so it might involve nukes. Or it might not. As people and pets disappear and the grown-ups accomplish nothing the kid protagonists strike out to solve the mysteryshooting the occasional zombie scene to take advantage of the added production value of all the hubbub. The plot is a mishmash of various sci-fi and Spielberg tropes with a little bit o meta from the kids being filmmakers but Abrams who wrote the script has enough storytelling savvy to keep you guessing from scene to sceneso much so that it seems criminal even to reveal the nature of the mystery. As he did with his Star Trek remake Abrams grounds the film in family tragedy The young hero Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) has just lost his mom after an industrial accident; his deputy-sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) is a non-presence; and the girl he has a crush on Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) has a drunken single dad who had something to do with Joes mothers death. Absent mothers impotent or cruel fathers The world is one big dysfunctional family with the military (led by Noah Emmerich) the baddest-ass dad of all. Joe and Alice fall in love while racing around trying to do what their parents wouldnt or couldntwhich includes making contact with an entity that has its own authority issues. The adolescent protagonists repartee isnt especially idiosyncratic or penetrating but theres something compelling about how unformed these kids are You know they already look nothing like they did when the movie was shot. (Is it the result of seeing so many People anniversary spreads and episodes of Biography that we naturally envision them in their forties giving interviews about their new sobriety?) Courtney is likably non-actorish while Fanning has good concentration and that familiar Fanning-family freaky grown-up white face and blue eyes (here slightly reddened as if inflamed). If Abrams had given the chubby director kid (Riley Griffiths) some Spielbergian talent instead of (for easy laughs) Ed Woodish ineptitude Super 8 might have added up to something more. Abrams could have shown the connection between domestic upheaval and a childs burgeoning filmmaking talents. At least Abrams makes you feel his enthusiasm. He would have been a week short of his 9th birthday on June 20 1975 the opening day of Spielbergs Jawsthe day movies changed foreverand in the throes of puberty by the time of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. At 15 he and his friend Matt Reeves got the job of cutting together the Super 8 films Spielberg had made as a kid. Abrams has probably been fighting not to reproduce Spielbergs signature moves since the day he picked up a camera. Now with the blessing of the master he can plagiarize with alacrity. He can track in on his youthful subjects from below vividly bringing their emotions to the fore. He can shoot the horizon line and heavens to make us instantly aware of all the mysteries of the universe weve been forced to forget just to get on with our days. He can use a sudden silence to make us laugh out loud at the prospect of being jolted out of our seats.

A gas-station attendant his face blanched with fear sees it and screams; all we see is his body being jerked out of the frame. A telephone lineman on his crane hears it as a clattering clank of metal like a clumsy heist at Home Depot; soon hes gone. But the creepiest hint that a nasty creature lurks in Lillian comes when 12-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) posts a notice about his lost dog on a public bulletin board and the camera pulls back to reveal a hundred posters of missing pets. Who or what took the dogs out? J.J. Abrams writer and director of the scary artful new thriller Super 8 is a hoarder of secrets a master in the fine art of withholding information. Fans of Lost the TV series he co-created had to stick around six years for its mysteries to be revealed. ""J.J. makes the audience wait for it"" says Steven Spielberg a producer and abettor of Super 8. With a conjurers practiced blandness Abrams simply says ""I believe in anything that will engage the audience and make the story more effective."" But the man is no sadist. He more than anyone loves not knowing what comes next. As a boy he bought a mystery box at a Manhattan magic store; now 44 he still has the box and still hasnt opened it. Whats Inside the Boxcar? The mystery box in Super 8 is a boxcar on a freight train speeding through Lillian one night in 1979 as some kids are furtively shooting a Super-8 movie. Pudgy Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the director with the quick mind bossiness and vast reserves of movie lore that mark a budding auteur. Cary (Ryan Lee) puts his pyrotechnic and possibly pyromaniacal skills to use as special-effects wizard. Joe does makeup and constructs the models that Charles action film will crash. But like any nebbishy guys these kids are making movies to attract the ladies -- specifically their leading lady Alice (Elle Fanning) a 14-year-old blonde with an imperious star quality. As Joe powders her face for the shoot he gazes at her with naked adoration perspiration forming on his brow like evening dew. In the middle of their big take the train crashes into a car on the tracks spraying tons of debris their way and sending a platoon of military men fanning out across the scene. Only Joe has noticed that the car was driven onto the tracks seemingly in a suicide mission. In the car is the boys science teacher (Glynn Turman) injured and near death. ""They will kill you"" he mutters. ""Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die."" Do not speak of what? Of the thing that none of the kids saw -- the some thing that has escaped. In the other movies Abrams directed the third Mission Impossible and the retooled Star Trek he ornamented familiar mythologies. Super 8 his first feature as writer-director required that he build his own box -- and open it. ""Withholding things in a story is no good if you arent building to something substantial"" he says. ""It becomes foreplay without the main event and no one wants that."" Abrams adepts will recall a similar story of young people banding together to face a ravenous monster from Cloverfield the 2008 alien-invasion film he produced. But Super 8 has a gentler vibe it leavens the apocalyptic threat with the budding bonding of Joe and Alice. Joes beloved mother has recently died in a steel-mill accident. His father (Kyle Chandler from Friday Night Lights) Lillians deputy sheriff has his hands full trying to save the town. The lonely 12-year-old clinging to his mothers necklace as a talisman is aching for the sympathetic company of an older woman -- even two years older. Alice just crossed to the other side of the great puberty divide possesses a maturity that comes as much from abiding her angry father as it does from her natural poise. Shes lonely too. Their inchoate romance could prove therapeutic for both with Alice finding pure friendship and Joe learning to let go of morose childhood. All these kids Abrams says are ""on the precipice of something -- the end of a time. I wanted to catch kids at the very edge of full-blown raging puberty in their last moments of innocence.""
