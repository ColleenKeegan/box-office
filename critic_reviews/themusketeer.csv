"CNN.com - Review Musketeer not worth a shot - September 7 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Pointless re-imagining Review Musketeer not worth a shot By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- The new film ""The Musketeer"" could have been called ""Crouching Stupidity Hidden Plot."" This re-imaging of ""The Three Musketeers"" that classic tale by Alexandre Dumas is supposedly justified by the use of 17th-century swordplay combined with state-of-the-art Hong Kong-style action choreography by Xin-Xin Xiong. The last major film to be ""re-imagined"" was Tim Burtons recent debacle ""Planet Of The Apes"" and once again all that term means is a bad script slathered with over-the-top action sequences. Unfortunately again just like ""Apes"" ""The Musketeer"" will make millions during its opening weekend because of its kick-ass trailer and smart marketing which is aimed directly at adolescent males -- of all ages. Another aspect of the ""re-imaging"" of this old chestnut -- this is the eighth ""Musketeer film"" -- is that this time around when the pink-cheeked Musketeer wannabe D Artagnan (Justin Chambers) arrives in Paris he finds Aramis (Nick Moran) Athos (Gregor Kremp) and Porthos (Steve Speirs) dejected and abandoned by King Louis XIII (Daniel Mesguich). The Musketeers have been disbanded by Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea) with help from his evil one-eyed henchman Febre (Tim Roth) who has framed them for the murder of the Spanish ambassador.

This umpteenth retelling of the classic Alexandre Dumas adventure story is a handsome but ho-hum swashbuckler that springs to life only during a few spirited scenes of acrobatic swordplay -- which may explain why for the first time in recent memory -- maybe for the first time ever -- a major studio release is trumpeting its stunt coordinator more than its cast or director in coming-attraction trailers. Hong Kong action vet Xin-Xin Xiong choreographs enough stylized derring-do to generate interest among many of the mainstream ticket buyers who made ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" a crossover smash. Given that and the dearth of similar product in early fall marketplace ""The Musketeer"" is poised to grab a respectable share of domestic B.O. coin before galloping off to more fertile fields in international and homevid venues. Scripter Gene Quintano takes a revisionist approach to his extremely loose adaptation of Dumas much-filmed 1844 novel about 17th century heroics and establishes motivation for the dashing title character. A prologue intros the sociopathic baddie Febre (Tim Roth) as he is attempting to extort money from young DArtagnans parents. When hes rebuffed Febre kills the couple in front of their horrified child (Max Dolbey) who is knocked unconscious and left for dead. Flash-forward 14 years DArtagnan (played as an adult by Justin Chambers) and his grizzled mentor Planchet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi) journey from Gascogne to Paris; DArtagnan proves his mettle in the first of the pics Hong Kong-flavored fight sequences as he battles sword-wielding ruffians in a roadside tavern. Here and elsewhere however director-cinematographer Peter Hyams fails to adequately convey the fluidity of movement or properly frame the determinedly dazzling stunt work in the manner that is de rigueur for even routine Hong Kong chopsocky pics. DArtagnan wants to join the musketeers the elite guard of King Louis XIII (Daniel Mesguich). But once in Paris DArtagnan learns the musketeers have been decommissioned by Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea). Undaunted our hero forges friendships with musketeer aces Aramis (Nick Moran) Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) and Porthos (Steve Speirs) and joins in their efforts to free their captain (Michael Byrne) from an unjust imprisonment. DArtagnan meanwhile falls for Francesca (Mena Suvari) the beautiful daughter of a dressmaker and close confidant of the queen (Catherine Deneuve). Eventually DArtagnan sets out to avenge his parents and while hes at it save his king and country -- with of course a little help from the musketeers. Xiong coordinated stunts for Tsui Harks ""Time and Tide"" and ""Double Team"" but his chief inspiration for ""The Musketeer"" appears to have been Harks ""Once Upon a Time in China"" franchise (which employed Xiong as a supporting player). A climactic battle between DArtagnan and Febre in a room filled with ladders is straight out of the first ""China"" epic and other sequences have everything but a cameo by Jet Li to underscore what Xiong has borrowed from his source material. Trouble is the fight scenes are almost too impressive for the pics own good just about everything else in seems bland and generic. Any new version of the Dumas masterwork is hard-pressed to top Richard Lesters definitive two-part epic (""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers""). But Hyams version isnt even as lively or involving as the 1993 youth-skewing remake. Chambers is little more than an attractive cipher in the lead role. But then again he doesnt get much help from the charisma-free co-stars cast as musketeers. Don Ameche was better off with the Ritz Brothers as backup when he essayed DArtagnan for helmer Allan Dwan back in 1939. Among the supporting players Deneuve is notable primarily because its hard to recall the last time she was so unflatteringly lighted and photographed. Rea looks grim throughout as though he feared his obviously fake beard might slip at any moment. Suvari is an appealing screen presence which is all she needs to be here. Roth comes off best by cleverly stopping just short of going over the top with his bemused villainy. Hyams lensing of French locations is unlike his shooting of the fight scenes first-rate. Production designer Philip Harrison and costumers Raymond Hughes and Cynthia Dumont do much to augment the 17th century period flavor.

Starring Justin Chambers Tim Roth Mena Suvari Stephen Rea and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Peter Hyams. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a reason this movie is called ""The Musketeer"" and not ""The Three Musketeers"" and it is because its about a loner cowboy. Hes even got the hat. This latest version of Alexandre Dumas 19th century swashbuckler presents a dark view of a brooding DArtagnan (Justin Chambers) bent on vengeance. It is at odds with the movies would-be flamboyant gimmick Hong Kong-style ""flying"" action. This DArtagnan brings little spark of cocky self-awareness to his fighting prowess and the stunts seem inserted into the movie. Professional villain Tim Roth (without the ape mask) Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea are all aboard but only Catherine Deneuve as the spunky queen seems to be having any fun. A prologue that explains DArtagnans vengefulness gets the movie off on the wrong foot and its fair to begin wondering whether The Musketeer"" will survive the leaden start. It does but almost everybody involved seems to be just going through the motions. The movie lacks the one thing that the classic Three Musketeers story cant do without panache. The traditional story of the naive but rough-and-ready DArtagnan winning his spurs with the kings guard has been sidetracked and with it goes the esprit de corps that gives the story verve. Here the musketeers are a demoralized lot that DArtagnan must finally rouse to action as he pursues Cardinal Richelieus henchman Febre (Roth). The one time that the famous ""All for one one for all"" pledge is raised the shiver it brings is a reminder of whats missing. In its place Chambers (or his stunt double) pulls off some sword-fighting back flips twirls and acrobatics including crawling like a fly across the ceiling. ""You have an interesting fighting style"" says an aristocratic observer in the one instance where anyone even notices this swordsmans incredible -- to say the least -- ability. ""Where did you acquire it?"" Hong Kong obviously. Hong Kong stunt choreographer Xin-Xin Xiong (Tsui Harks ""Time and Tide"") has been recruited in an unapologetic effort to inject some ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" magic into the old swashbuckler format. Sometimes the magic works sometimes it doesnt. Director Peter Hyams who also serves as cinematographer has given the film a dark-toned atmosphere -- occasionally so much so that its hard to make out the action. The best sequence starts with DArtagnan atop a horse-drawn coach that swerves into a forest where he must dodge tree branches as well as opponents before leaping onto a horse fighting them off and returning to the top of the still-moving coach. Too often however the action is anticlimactic. A terrific setup involving swordsmen scaling a burnished castle turret on ropes and fighting while swaying in midair doesnt build; it just gets interrupted. On another occasion when the unarmed and disrobed DArtagnan is surprised by a pair of armed men nothing is made of the opportunity for a rousing two-against-one fight. The showdown with the evil Febre occurs in a barn filled with ladders on which the combatants leap and teeter which is a good if recycled stunt but also a good case of a stunt being done more for the sake of the choreographer than anyone else. Speaking of recycling heres Roth doing his villain routine again. Good as it was in ""Planet of the Apes"" its starting to get a little tired. On one occasion Roth actually licks his chops. American beauty Suvaris bathtub scene was so memorable in ""American Beauty"" that it calls for an encore here. She plays a young woman who is such an unlikely confidante of the queen that it requires a pause for explanation in the script by Gene Quintano (whose varied credits range from Hyams ""Sudden Death"" to ""Police Academys"" 3 and 4). A lot of things call for an explanation in the script and the characters are continually stopping to tell each other whats going on. Deneuve handles it all with a gleam in her eye. Shes clearly decided to have a good time and bring some pizzazz to the proceedings. She stops just short of winking at the audience. Advisory Explicit sexual remark.

"USATODAY.com - Musketeer swash has come unbuckled Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 09/06/2001 - Updated 0554 PM ET Musketeer swash has come unbuckled By Mike Clark USA TODAY The Musketeer (out of four) Stars Catherine Deneuve Mena Suvari Justin Chambers Tim Roth Stephen Rea Director Peter Hyams Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for violence and some sexual material No ones heart seems to be in The Musketeer an Alexandre Dumas swashbuckling redo in which the two top-billed actors are women. Douglas Fairbanks Sr. was the storys guiding force in 1921 but now its Catherine Deneuve and Mena Suvari. And neither comes to mind as an action hero. Of course the guiding force in this retread is supposed to be young DArtagnan. But the role has been entrusted to vacant Justin Chambers (The Wedding Planner) who isnt the sharpest blade. When Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea) tries to explain 17th century French politics to this longhaired hunk you can almost read the intellectual despair in the conniving churchmans face. If this is Dumas theres a ""b"" in the middle and an extra ""s"" at the end. Read more Video The Musketeer trailer Still Rea is enough of a pro to carry a few scenes -- as is Tim Roth as the cardinals out-of-control enforcer who kills young DArtagnans parents in the movies opening. Roth can play period-piece rogues (he even got an Oscar nomination for playing one in Rob Roy). Here he looks and acts even more sinister wearing a patch after the sudden orphan blinds him in the eye with a well-placed sword. It cant be fun fencing with crummy peripheral vision. Fourteen years later DAr tagnan is grown and his dads old Musketeer buddies have gotten boozy and lazy in Paris after being stripped of their commissions. King Louis XIII (Daniel Mesguich) is an ineffectual Richelieu patsy but his queen (Deneuve) has an adventuress streak. She even traipses (while in queen garb) through a sewer rumored to be inhabited by a crocodile. Now that would be a twist this movie needs. Suvari who began her reign as American Beautys cheerleading vixen exactly two years ago plays a chambermaid who has the queens ear. Once she and Chambers DArtagnan start running into each other -- usually in the buff or at least as much as is allowed for a PG-13 movie -- we know the two will get together. Suvari was more convincing with pom-poms but for a real casting kick check out Jeremy Clyde (of 60s pop duo Chad amp; Jeremy) as Lord Buckingam. Yesterdays gone for sure. Director Richard Lesters two wondrous romps from the 70s should have been the final screen word on Musketeering. But Disney made 1993s The Three Musketeers with Charlie Sheen Kiefer Sutherland and Chris ODonnell as the dueling do-gooders. At least Hollywood had a reason to try again.
