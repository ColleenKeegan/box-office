Its not the one in which Jerry OConnell as the proverbial goo guy who looks like a frat-house John Ritter picks up a librarian and watches her quick-change into a snarling dominatrix. No its the one in which a surgically removed cancerous testicle goes bounding like a Super Ball all over a hospital finally landing in a place that may inspire ""Ughs"" from the most hardened of bodily fluid comedy mavens. John Waters ralph your heart out. Written and directed by Greg Poirier a former writer of triple-X porn films Tomcats is a satire as well as an exploitation of the paranoia lurking within unbridled male lust. Its built around one of those only-in-the-movies contests in which a half-dozen guys compete to see who can stay unmarried the longest yet in its mingling of horniness and disgust Tomcats attains a convoluted cleverness. Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie shows unexpected charm as the girl everyone is after and theres one amazingly funny sequence in which OConnell imagines his ultimate flesh nightmare -- not sex but daddyhood which suddenly makes sex look very harmless indeed.

"USATODAY.com - Also opening Tomcats Tailor Amores Perros Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/30/2001 - Updated 0923 AM ET Also opening Tomcats Tailor Amores Perros By Mike Clark USA TODAY Tomcats (out of four) When testicular cancer is a plot component of a rowdily coarse comedy you know its filmmaker has thrown caution to some very ill winds. So its no surprise that writer/director Gregory Poirier tries to push the film beyond the American Pie/ Road Trip gross-out plateau The surgically removed sphere rolls down a hospital corridor bounces off walls like a handball and lands in cafeteria food. Like so much else here the scene is a tack-on that has little to do with the movies equally contrived central story. A financially strapped cartoonist (Jerry OConnell) plays matchmaker to his sexually Neanderthal-ish buddy (Jake Busey) and a long-ago acquaintance whos now a vice cop (Shannon Elizabeth). If they marry OConnell would be the last of his buddies to remain a bachelor and collect the huge financial kitty that he and his cronies have set up to reward the last man standing. This is 90 minutes of gags of the lowest order yet Poirier occasionally injects them with more energy than anything in Heartbreakers the comic poke-along that has somehow become the nations No. 1 movie. So give this feline-motifed farce credit for speed but not much else. Its a slightly better brand of discount litter. (R strong sexual content including dialogue) The Tailor of Panama Morally and ethically 007 is a 000 in John Boormans slight but smart movie of John le Carres novel. Adapted and executive-produced by the author himself it gives us a Pierce Brosnan we dont usually see. This is a bad boy who dispatches friends and lovers emotionally with the zeal Bond uses to dispatch baddies physically. For having an affair with the wrong woman British spy Andy (Brosnan) has been banished to Panama where some are still grousing about the 1999 return of the Canal. The schemer sizes up his embassy superiors as inferiors and goes looking for a wise local. His choice is Harry (Geoffrey Rush) a tailor to the powerful with a secret. Unbeknownst even to his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) the heavily-in-debt Harry learned his trade in the slammer -- serving time in place of a guilty uncle who later set him up in business. Initially reticent Harry starts getting used to the money he gets in exchange for information. Soon Harry is warning of ""foreign interests"" seeking to seize the waterway. Its a lie but the story has taken on a life of its own once a worried America starts throwing around money intended for an equally bogus underground supposedly fighting to maintain the status quo. In his fifth decade of filmmaking Brit Boorman can still paint in rich story details though its all seen through a world-weary European life view. Nothing is worn-out about the leads however. Brosnan and Rush are a smooth fit playing off each other like a snappy shirt and tie. (In select cities; R for strong sexuality language some violence) Amores Perros The gritty Oscar-nominated Traffic is a limo ride compared with the bloodletting in this years foreign-film nominee from Mexico. Its modern squalor didnt have a prayer against the timeless beauties of winner Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon yet director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus first theatrical feature is a grabber for just over 2 hours. Dogs figure in each of three semi-connected episodes both as pets and contenders in dogfights. This carnage is the means by which the first storys protagonist (Gael Garcia Bernal) hopes to improve his lot which includes living in the slums and lusting after the wife of his vile stickup-artist brother. Story No. 2 is more upscale though with a literally seedy foundation. As a gorgeous model (Goya Toledo) recovers from a disfiguring auto accident her own dog is trapped in a rat-infested space between her living room floor and the ceiling of the apartment below. In the third story a weary dog-loving former terrorist (Emilio Echevarria) is blackmailed into becoming a hired killer. The manner in which he turns the tables on his clueless client provides some humor the movie obviously needs. By filming at a dog-race clip and giving us at least one sympathetic character per chapter Inarritu keeps us involved in at-times tune-outable material. The movie also doesnt pussyfoot about its treatment of canines. It carries an unusually prominent on-screen disclaimer before the movie begins about the productions animal-safety efforts.

Starring Jerry OConnell Shannon Elizabeth Jake Busey. Directed and written by Gregory Poirier. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Relying on the tenet that anything gross is hilarious ""Tomcats"" milks setups involving bondage grannies surgically removed intimate organs and secretions of all sorts. Too bad it cant squeeze out laughs. The movie attempts to ride the gravy train of gross-out comedy but its no ""Theres Something About Mary."" Its not even ""Say It Isnt So."" ""Tomcats"" offers only tired jokes grimace-worthy physical comedy and bad bad acting. The stars seem to realize from the outset that theyre doomed and all the stages of grief -- denial the flop sweat of desperation and finally resignation -- mix together to cloud the screen. Pity Jerry OConnell (""Scream 2"" ""Mission to Mars"") who plays one of the randy fellas (the Tomcats) who wager as to who can stay single the longest. OConnell the only remotely appealing guy in the bunch mugs amiably and submits to all sorts of physical indelicacies. Perhaps this is his audition for the Farrelly brothers. Jake Busey is OConnells pal and romantic rival the most crass of the he- man woman chasers. Busey has dad Garys bully-boy toothiness but none of his roguish charm. And nobody really needed to see Busey the younger in a skimpy red thong. Shannon Elizabeth (""American Pie"" ""Scary Movie"") the object of the two guys affection comes off as a poor mans Elizabeth Berkley. Her flat line readings complement the perpetually blank look on her face. Shes a pro compared with Horatio Sanz though. The ""Saturday Night Live"" comedians mugging makes OConnell seem subtle and hes a beat off from everyone else -- and the others are not crack comic performers. Bad editing reveals that whole scenes are missing from ""Tomcats."" Nonetheless the movie manages to include visual references to other pictures - - idea theft from ""Scary Movie"" a far superior example of the gross-out genre. The homages to popcorn movies ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Mission Impossible 2"" are trite and OConnell mimicking Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" is blasphemous. . This film contains raw language nudity sexual situations gross-out humor violence. . -- Carla Meyer . - . HIMALAYA Drama. Starring Thinlen Lhondup and Gurgon Kyap. Directed by Eric Valli. (Not rated. 95 minutes. In Tibetan with English subtitles. At the Castro Theatre.) . A few years ago a documentary called ""The Saltmen of Tibet"" told the story of real-life bands of Tibetans who go on arduous treks. After months they return with their yaks loaded down with salt the precious commodity of their economy. ""Himalaya"" is a dramatic feature about the very same sort of people. It deals with the power struggle between a cranky old chief (Thinlen Lhondup) and an angry would-be chief (Gurgon Kyap). As expected the film is a great showcase for yak acting. The human actors are also impressive. They are first of all not actors. They are real-life salt people and the old chief is a real-life chief. That these Tibetans can be so relaxed and natural in front of a camera playing versions of themselves but not themselves speaks well of the whole culture. They are naturals at acting not because theyre good at lying but because they cant be phony. The vistas of course are striking. Director Eric Valli filmed in places that required a three-week journey by foot to get to. Most of us are not quite that interested but if its onscreen at the Castro its certainly worth a peek. The scene in which a caravan is stopped by the crumbling of a mountain ledge is dazzling. Of course the saltmen dont have a single problem that could not be rectified by a few paved roads and a truck but lets just keep that information to ourselves. . -- Mick LaSalle - . THE NIGHT LARRY KRAMER KISSED ME . Starring David Drake. Directed by Tim Kirkman. (Not rated. 79 minutes. At the Lumiere.) . David Drakes one-man show ""The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me"" is so elated to be a movie that the photography and editing emote more than Drake which is to say that there are two psychodramas up there on the screen where one would suffice. Drakes Obie-winning play is a vignette-studded yo-yo ride through the gay psyche as inspired by an adolescent encounter with Kramers play ""The Normal Heart."" Personal episodes are mated with Drakes suspicion that theres an insidious self-consciousness (albeit a funny one) thats crept into gay living. The performance was filmed by Tim Kirkman at the Theater Project in Baltimore and both he and Drake appear to be of the mind that the difference between live theater and live theater on film is the participation of a camera in bringing Drakes hyperactivity into focus for people in the cheap seats. Kirkman forces Drake to keep up with his frenetic pacing -- the show already had a built-in aerobic structure -- making him work harder than an Ikette to follow the flow. Regardless of how you feel about films of Spalding Gray shows for example the filmmaking is never allowed to upstage the language. And Spike Lee somehow managed to get out of changeling John Leguizamos way in ""Freak."" Conversely the camera in ""Larry Kramer"" usually seems to be chasing Drake. For the most part he looks more jailed than Susan Hayward in ""I Want to Live "" On second thought thats a circumstance that probably suits the material. But ""Larry Kramer"" doesnt wallow in camp. Heres Drake amusedly searching for signs of intelligent homosexual life as a kid ""Maybe they all live in the same housing development . . . and they meet at the same pool."" He goes on to re-enact the disturbing but true erotics of gym culture and have a Laurie Anderson-lite moment with the personals. This leads to the shakier preachy area that is the plays activism depleting the show of energy it doesnt get back until its killer epilogue set in 2017 where Drake a proud father and husband may as well be transmitting live from Mars. Its the moment where the film balances its belief in the true and its wariness of the plastic. The roving observations and confessions meanwhile are made of life the real kind. Its the form that feels naggingly airlessly synthetic. . This film contains frank sexual talk. . -- Wesley Morris . - . GAMERA 3 THE REVENGE OF IRIS Science fiction. Starring Ai Maeda. Directed by Shusuke Kaneko. (Not rated. 108 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. At the Red Vic.) . ""Why is Japan continually attacked by monsters?"" muses a member of the Monster-Damage Control Committee in ""Gamera 3 The Revenge of Iris."" Is it science run amok? Nature taking revenge on a soulless technology-dependent society? Or is it simply the fact that Tokyo is lined with deliciously crushable buildings? Made in 1999 ""Gamera 3"" which opened yesterday is the latest in a series reviving the gigantic rocket-powered turtle who starred in classic Japanese monster movies of the 60s and early 70s. Gamera who can fly and spin like a top is a good-hearted but misunderstood reptile. Thousands die while he battles bad-guy monsters and a lot of decent architecture gets wasted such as Kyotos enormous glass train station. But then Gamera will show his softer side mustering a compassionate look on his wrinkly face as he sticks around to see whether a girl he rescued can be revived. The ""X-Files""-like story centers on a teenage girl (Ai Maeda) who harbors a grudge against Gamera because she thinks hes responsible for her parents death. Bent on revenge she raises a nasty part-bird part-squid creature naming it Iris (after her flattened cat). Eventually she merges with it in a perversely beautiful scene. Among the extraneous characters in ""Gamera 3"" are a mysterious government operative a deranged video-game designer and an earnest ornithologist. They dont have much to do except look skyward and exclaim ""Gamera"" Thats OK because all we really care about is the ultimate slugfest between Gamera and Iris. The special effects are terrific although the monsters still look like guys in rubber suits. Fans of the genre wouldnt have it any other way. .

Tomcats Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tomcats-2001,200,tomcats8,tomcats,rogerebert

(Revolution Studios) Every few months the bar is raised - okay lowered - in the contest to see how far Hollywood will go to make you toss your cookies. At times it doesnt seem like movies can achieve any further debasement in the gross-out sweepstakes. And then along comes ""Tomcats."" There is a scene in this movie (and I use the term loosely) that makes the infamous zipper and ""hair gel"" scenes in ""Theres Something About Mary"" seem positively quaint. It involves an errant surgically removed testicle . . . an errant surgically removed cancerous testicle I might add. Now this plot device has been employed by first-time director Gregory Poirier (who also ""wrote"" the threadbare puerile script about a group of priapic twentysomething males) for no other reason than the payoff a sight gag so nauseating that laughter is out of the question. Its hard to chuckle when youre trying not to upchuck. Said scene involves the misplacement of said body part in a hospital cafeteria - and here Ill stop and insist that you imagine what follows. See right here Ive done a valuable public service. Ive just warned off the half of you with good sense and common decency while simultaneously making the other half with neither taste nor shame crazy with desire to see this latest entry in the Monday-morning water-cooler vulgara-thon. It would be one thing if the darned movie were funny too. Alas it is merely repugnant - to women naturally who are largely depicted as walking talking (okay scratch the talking part) sex organs and mammary glands but also to those men whose brains do not reside in their boxers. The story is this Michael (Jerry OConnell) has a 51000 gambling debt to mobster Carlos (a wisely uncredited Bill Maher). In order to come up with the money he has to marry off his womanizing buddy Kyle (Jake Busey) so that Michael can claim the pot in a kind of long-standing matrimonial tontine. Seven years earlier Michael Kyle and their circle of horny brain-dead pals created a fund that would go to the last remaining bachelor. Smartly invested its now worth a half-million dollars and Michael and Jerry are the only two single guys left. Aiding Michael in his scheme is Natalie (Shannon Elizabeth) an old girlfriend of Kyles seeking revenge on him for dumping her. Before long Michael starts falling for Natalie himself. How do we know hes falling in love? Because of the volume of genetic material he produces while fantasizing about her at a sperm bank. Oh yeah its that kind of movie. Go expecting the very worst. Just dont expect to laugh.""Tomcats"" (R 92 minutes) - Contains countless instances of obscenity sex nudity gun violence and gross-out humor of such wide variety that it beggars description.
