If either partner would be a suitable mate and the choice between them is difficult then theres a chance the audience wont like the decision that is ultimately made which will ruin the intended effect of the romantic comedy which is to be light and cheerful. The situation in Something Borrowed is very tricky indeed. Dex is already engaged to Darcy you see so leaving her for Rachel -- the protagonist the sympathetic main character -- must be completely 100 percent justified. There cannot be even a smidgen of doubt that Darcy is all wrong for Dex or else Dex will come off as a monstrous cad for eventually following his heart and Rachel will seem like a cruel home-wrecker. So whats the solution? Make Darcy the worst human being ever to walk the face of the Earth. Darcy is played by Kate Hudson who is finally pulling out all the stops in her decade-long campaign to make us loathe and despise her. Darcy is shallow vain self-absorbed reckless irresponsible and narcissistic. She never thinks any further than five minutes into the future except for when she practices crying so shell know how her mascara will hold up on the wedding day. Shes a drunk a mooch a show-off and a flake. She is pure id focused only of her own desires oblivious to how her actions affect those around her. I am not an expert but in clinical terms she may be a sociopath. Darcy is not the main character thank goodness. That would be Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) her best friend since childhood. Rachel is kind generous meek and good-hearted and has spent her life feeling inferior to the prettier more popular Darcy. Shes the one who introduced Darcy to Dex (Colin Egglesfield) back when she and Dex were study partners and platonic friends in law school. Rachel always had a crush on Dex but she didnt think someone as handsome and suave and perfect as he is would ever go for a frumpy gal like her -- she wore glasses in law school -- so she let Darcy take him. But now just two months before Darcy and Dexs wedding Rachel and Dex get a little drunk and have a little sex. (This happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie.) It is more than just a fling too They discover that they truly have feelings for each other and always have. Dexs love for Darcy is whatever it is -- the movie makes no attempt to show what he or anyone else might possibly see in her -- but his and Rachels love is true deep and mature. Theyre practically soul mates. They clearly belong together. But how could Rachel break up her best friends relationship? That is quite a pickle. Or at least it would be if real people were involved or if it were addressed with any degree of intelligence. I dont know what Emily Giffins novel is like but the screenplay (by Men in Trees and 90210 scribe Jennie Snyder) is paralyzingly simple-minded. Rachel and Dex sneak around behind Darcys back. This would normally be controversial behavior for a protagonist but since Darcy is such a rancid infuriating bimbo we never feel even a twinge of reproach for Rachel and Dexs duplicity. All we feel is frustration over both parties refusal to face the issue head on and make the only possible decision which of course is to dump Darcy and live happily ever after together. (Theres also the exasperation of scenes where Darcy says ""OK you two I know whats going on here"" and of course its a false alarm; she talking about something else something minor and trivial and we roll our eyes and grit our teeth.) The films central premise is that Rachel doesnt want to hurt her best friend. And thats exactly why the movie fails because we dont understand why Rachel likes Darcy in the first place. Theres not one instance in the entire film -- not one -- of Darcy doing anything to show us why Rachel is devoted to her. Even when Darcy throws Rachel a birthday party she hogs the spotlight for herself -- a fact that Rachel notices and comments on. So its not like Rachel isnt aware of what a terrible friend Darcy is. Shes aware. She just ... loves her anyway? Apparently? The one voice of reason is Ethan (John Krasinski) Rachels platonic best friend and her supposed confidante (though she hides the affair from him for a long time too). Ethan says what the audience is thinking -- Make up your mind already And make Dex make up his -- and ameliorates the pain somewhat. But then he is saddled with his own completely stupid subplot in which hes stalked by a desperate clingy psycho (Ashley Williams) with whom he had a one-night stand and he determines the only way to get rid of her is to tell her hes gay. And even THEN she wants to stand by him Because shes needy and crazy ha ha John Krasinski has a few amusing moments as Ethan and Steve Howey is fun as Dexs goofy best friend Marcus. But as Dex Colin Egglesfield trained on All My Children and Melrose Place is as blandly handsome and personality-free as youd expect someone trained on All My Children and Melrose Place to be. Hes outmatched by Ginnifer Goodwin whos immensely likable and smart and who we never believe for a second would have trouble meeting men or making friends. Directed by Luke Greenfield (The Girl Next Door) the film seems to think that we will find something entertaining about Darcy just because shes played by Kate Hudson. Its hard to imagine a worse miscalculation. The character is maddening and loathsome like a comedians parody of annoying party animals except that shes meant to be taken seriously. Why make us hate -- hate hate HATE -- a character to whom the protagonist is fiercely loyal? We cant relate to anyone here except maybe Ethan who wants out of this fiasco as soon as he hears about it. I certainly know that feeling.

Pictures release. Photo David Lee/? 2011 Alcon Film Fund LLC. All Rights Reserved By the end of the insufferable Hamptons fantasy Something Borrowed John Krasinskias Ethan is the only character you merely want to thwack as opposed to run over in Lizzy Grubmanas SUV and he delivers the movies two most apt lines The first aThe Hamptons is like a zombie movie directed by Ralph Laurena works because this film is as realistic as Zombieland and is directed with the smarts of a clothing rack. And the second line comes after an hour of Ginnifer Goodwins bland whiny lawyer Rachel wrestling with her desire for her old friend another bland whiny lawyer (Colin Egglesfelds Dex) who is marrying her best friend (Kate Hudson). Ethan cuts to the core of the problem declaring that Rachel is being ""stupid"" and Dex is ""a dick."" And that wrapped up the story more effectively than anything a moviegoer has to endure in the whole next hour. Inept and implausible in almost every way Something Borrowed is the smug rom-com answer to the Apatowian man-child comedy Instead of working-class geeks making gay jokes like 13-year-old doofuses we get spoiled twits who cuddle up under Strawberry Shortcake comforters and whine about how very hard it is to choose between all the delightful options laid out for them on a silver platter. As the dullard Dex parties in Nolita and slings back tequila shots at his beachfront Barbie dream house he harbors the deep secret that hed prefer to be a high-school teacher. Its never explained why but it feels like a character such as his would most likely be drawn to the off-duty summers. Look movies can and often should provide an escape from reality but when 9 percent of the country is unemployed it takes a certain type of clueless gall to make a film about how very existentially tough it is to choose whether or not to buy a Westchester mansion with 2 million of daddys dollars (a steal surely thanks to the housing crisis). Meanwhile Goodwins Rachel is an exasperatingly indecisive drip and Hudsons Darcy shrieks like she just jumped off the Sex and the City tour bus. The film vaguely hints at interesting possibilities but the characters get exactly what they want in the end. The finale is spectacularly bogus and the filmmakers know it. ""Its crazy how things work out sometimes"" says the ditzy Darcy. ""Crazy"" is one explanation; Ethans analysis was more accurate. If Something Borrowed entirely ignores economic reality the wedding comedy Jumping the Broom just makes class a silly excuse for easy and schmaltzy sitcom jokes. If you just love broad humor about things rich people like (opera bellinis caviar) and hate (collard greens bright colors poor people) there are plenty of these corny gags to go around when financial exec Jason (Laz Alonso) brings his uptown family to the luxurious Marthas Vineyard home of his gorgeous wealthy fiancee Sabrina (Paula Patton) for their wedding. Patton and Alonso make for a handsome but rigid unpersuasive couple and theyre not helped by a Crayola script. One minute Jason is begging Sabrina to speak to him in French as if hes Gomez Addams. The next hes attempting to deliver the kind of lines that would get him laughed out of even a corny bar. ""Youre like a pomegranate"" he says winning back an angry Sabrina. ""You have this hard protective shell ... but underneath youre real sweet and you have all this beauty on the inside."" Not only is this a godawful analogy but all we see of Sabrina is her protective shell Patton delivers her lines with such deliberate sameness that it sounds like shes trying to train her computers speech-to-text program. The old cliche goes that weddings should be a celebration of the happy couple but often end up being about the extended family. Thank goodness the cliche occasionally holds true in Jumping the Broom since the parents are played by much better actors. As Jasons working-class uncle and angry mother veterans Mike Epps and Loretta Devine wring laughs from old jokes. Angela Bassett as Sabrinas mother reminds you why its so depressing that Hollywood cant seem to create better roles for her. Broadway belter Bryan Stokes Mitchell is restrained in a slight part as her husband and like good respectful and loving parents the actors show up to the wedding do their parts and hit their marks. The comedy is as familiar as the ceremony at a cookie-cutter wedding factory Much feels old or borrowed; nothing feels new.

Maybe he should have been. Best. Worst. Indeed. In the wake of last weeks royal hookup comes ""Jumping the Broom"" and ""Something Borrowed"" two wedding comedies hoping their audiences will glean fresh wisdom from all the on- screen foolishness. (Next Friday ""Bridesmaids."") The better invite comes by way of ""Jumping the Broom"" starring Paula Patton and Laz Alonso as Sabrina and Jason a happy then increasingly less-so couple. A successful lawyer Sabrina makes a prayerful promise to foreswear booty calls and wait until her wedding night if God sends her a good man. Her ""Hello soul mate"" moment arrives when she runs into Jason a Wall Street analyst. When Sabrina is offered a promotion that would have her relocate Jason proposes. Their nuptials bring the Brooklyn Taylors face-to-face with the Watsons of Marthas Vineyard -- for the first time. Lesson No. 1 seems so no-brainer Dont wait until the wedding to meet the parents. Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine play mothers Claudine Watson and Pam Taylor. Ones got servants. The others a civil servant working for the Postal Service. Ones got a waterfront mansion and a husband shes sure is straying. (Tony winner Brian Stokes Mitchell plays Greg Watson.) The others a longtime widow with a short temper and a best friend named Shonda (Tasha Smith) who has her back but also tells her when shes wrong. Pam wants Sabrina and Jason to jump her heirloom broom. Claudine does not. ""Jumping the Broom"" combines tried-and-true oil-water class tensions with the challenges of modern romance and family then adds some African-American flavors. The title refers to the African- American slave ritual of jumping over a broom together to signify the start of a shared journey. It has gained prominence in contemporary heritage-minded wedding ceremonies. Taking a page from writer-director Tyler Perrys playbook ""Jumping the Broom"" mixes broad comedy with Christian homilies. The laughs here arent as raunchy or loud. Yes Pam has anger-management issues but shes no Madea. So theres no need to call the popo. ""Jumping the Broom"" is almost too crowded with characters. Getting close-ups Sabrinas footloose aunt; a status-minded single; a caterer who knows how to handle the heat; a young brother who wants to help a gal get her groove back; and a befuddled wedding planner who happens to be white. Its a movie that wants everybody to be at the reception if only to make it crazier. Even so as Jasons uncle Willie Earl Mike Epps comedic timing is especially rich. He plays the fool then jukes toward being the smartest guy in the room. On borrowed time In the muddled rom-com ""Something Borrowed"" a tossed-off confession fueled by drinks and a trip down memory lane leads a ""good girl"" to bed her best friends fiance. Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson are Rachel and Darcy dear friends since their Indiana childhood. They now live in New York City and have the sort of gigs that allow them summer weekends in the Hamptons. Rachels just turning 30 as the movie opens and has a fine if unsatisfying law career. We cant quite figure out what Darcy does (though she holds herself in highest regard). Nonreaders of Emily Giffins best- seller (adapted by Jennie Snyder Urman) will have to trust that the novel did a better job of handling the moral morass heroine Rachel finds herself in because the movie strains far too hard to make what Rachel and Dex (Colin Egglesfield) have done all right as if their guilty anguish -- and the movies saccharine score -- frees us to root for them. Yes one cant help feeling Rachel and Dex really should end up with each other. Not however because it would be oh-so-nice to have a happy ending -- but because these two passive souls deserve each other.

"Something Borrowed review With friends like these .. youve got the makings of a lousy romantic comedy |       NJ.com comments Something Borrowed review With friends like these .. youve got the makings of a lousy romantic comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 06 2011 at 814 AM View/Post Comments Warner Bros. Kate Hudson left and Ginnifer Goodwin play best friends in love with the same man in ""Something Borrowed.a"" Something Borrowed"" is something ... ew. Another Hollywood rom-com product that insults the very audience it aims for it stars Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson as life-long friends. Goodwin is Rachel the stereotyped smart serious brunette; Hudson is Darcy the cliched flirty dumb blond. Darcy is also about to get married -- to Rachels long-held secret crush. But Rachel doesnt mind. In fact shes busy helping her friend plan the wedding. After all she confesses ""I have dreamed about Darcy getting married almost my whole life."" Which is -- and theres no nice way to put this -- pathetic. Certainly there are teenagers who crush on their friends in a purely platonic hero-worshipping way. Movie Review Something Borrowed (PG-13) Warner Bros. (104 min.) Directed by Luke Greenfield. With Ginnifer Goodwin Kate Hudson Colin Egglesfield John Krasinski. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS Rachel is however a grown-up. And yet shes such a doormat she should have ""WELCOME"" embroidered on her blouses (and Darcys muddy stiletto prints on her heart). And who roots for a doormat? Even after her unrequited love suddenly starts being requited like crazy? The casting complicates things further. Kate Hudson was a bright little daisy when she popped up in ""Almost Famous"" 11 years ago but by now her thin smile looks like a self-satisfied smirk. She makes Darcy a heartless party-hearty tart which makes Rachels unceasing devotion to her all the more inexplicable. Goodwin presents a more pleasant character -- but still a problematic one because frankly shes too pretty. Thanks to Hollywoods tyranny of looks there are no plain actresses (plain actors of course exist in abundance). Which makes movies like this in which were expected to believe shes a total loser all the more bizarre. In one scene Goodwin even looks in wonder at a handsome interested young man and confesses ""I just didnt think someone like you could even like someone like me"" Because you know obviously shes about ready for the sideshow. Yes I know that beautiful people have self-esteem issues too. (Or so beautiful people love to tell you). But the less genetically blessed among us really dont want to hear it or see it in movies like this. Because you think Oy if nice Ginnifer Goodwin is nothing special than I must really be horrendous. The movie was prettily photographed in Manhattan and the Hamptons and it has a few good jokes most of which go to John Krasinski who plays Rachels best male friend Ethan and is the one amusing and almost normal character in the whole thing. Except he turns into a bit of a creep too. (The movie thinks its hysterical that one character follows him around adoringly just because he slept with her once.) And the fiance Rachel and Darcy both end up fighting over -- a Tom Cruise clone named Colin Egglesfield -- is such a jellyfish you dont want either woman to get him. Goodwin has a smart screen personality and Hudson would be terrific if she dropped the daffy sexpot act and went dark (she did her best work in years as the battered masochist in the bleak ""The Killer Inside Me""). But they need -- and we need -- better material. Because this ""Something Borrowed"" is no gift.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday May 6 2011 400 AM Title Something Borrowed With Ginnifer Goodwin Kate Hudson. A bridesmaid falls for the groom. Director Luke Greenfield (142). PG-13 Sexuality. At area theaters.Given that it lacks any connection to reality Luke Greenfields ""Something Borrowed"" could technically be considered escapist entertainment. But even if youve got a soft spot for silly rom-coms know that this one is as empty-headed as it gets. The trouble begins immediately when were asked to accept Ginnifer Goodwin and John Krasinski as Rachel and Ethan unattractive losers whove always wilted in the presence of their beautiful friend Darcy (Kate Hudson). Obscenely narcissistic Darcy is now about to marry Rachels crush Dex (Colin Egglesfield).Rather inconveniently Rachel and Dex fall in love during the engagement leading to a complicated pre-wedding affair. Meanwhile Darcy is busy hiding secrets of her own.In adapting Emily Giffins novel Greenfield and writer Jennie Snyder could have emphasized the human emotions that might inspire a tale of tangled hearts. Instead they take their title literally relying on countless cliches--except oddly the most important theres barely a wedding detail to be found.  As for the actors theyre as disposable as the script. Hudson has now surpassed Jennifer Aniston for poor taste in projects while Goodwin succeeds only at turning herself into a generic starlet. And she and the dull Egglesfield have none of the urgent chemistry required to explain their actions. Surely even a film that boasts of its laziness right up front should respect us enough to offset so much old with something new.

Movie review Something Borrowed Time to return those cliches Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 06 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 05 2011 225PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Something old The link between comedy and romance is ancient. In Shakespeares day a comedy was simply a play that ended with a wedding. Naturally the course of true love never did run smooth otherwise you wouldnt have a plot. Shakespeare favoured obstructive parents and mistaken identities. Hollywoods rom coms often add a psychological element She is too busy working to notice he loves her; he is too fearful of commitment to know what is good for him. Of course if you are going to film a rom com you need a fresh angle on the old story you need your ... Movies Something Borrowed The official trailer Something new The premise of Something Borrowed a romantic comedy based on the novel by Emily Giffin is that Rachel (a saccharine Ginnifer Goodwin) is a self-effacing young lawyer soon to play bridesmaid to her best friend the self-absorbed party girl Darcy (Kate Hudson). It was Rachel who introduced Darcy to her solid and sensitive fiance Dex (Colin Egglesfield) - the pair were study partners in law school. There they missed what is written all over a few flashbacks They are made for each other. When Rachel drunkenly confesses to Dex that she always had a crush on him he replies by taking her in his arms and an affair begins just weeks before the wedding. This is apparently okay because Rachel is a very nice person while Darcy is a controlling and narcissistic man-eater who will stop at no subterfuge to get what she wants. (Hudson is the only performer having any fun here.) And that stereotype is apparently okay because director Luke Greenfield includes a not-so-sly wink at it by showing the climactic scene from that notorious artifact of misogyny Fatal Attraction playing on Rachels TV. Acknowledging a problem however doesnt necessarily solve it. You have to be careful where you draw from when you trot out ... Something Borrowed The sisterhood is already grumbling about a movie that suggests women will happily choose a mate over friendship but actually its the stereotypes of good behaviour rather than bad that bring this rom com crashing down. While Dex is given some emphatically stated motivations for going ahead with the wedding - he is a creature of duty saddled with an authoritarian father and a depressive mother - there is no plausible reason for both his and Rachels reticence back in law school. Rachel is an Austen-ian heroine the bookish girl whose worth will eventually be recognized by the dashing hero. These plots greatly appeal to the bookish girls in the audience but are peopled by outdated ladies who lack control of their own destinies. Bridget Joness Diary which directly borrowed its story from Jane Austens novel Pride and Prejudice managed to update the tale but here we are just left to wonder how Rachel could possibly have been so dim so submissive and so chaste since the film lacks any hint of ... Something Blue Sex is discussed a lot in this movie; we hear Darcys orgasm; Rachel is being pursued by an offensive stud whose idea of courtship is telling her he was thinking of her while masturbating. But sex is never actually shown. On the two occasions when Rachel and Dex wind up in bed together they have sheets up to their necks. Apparently there are some things that nice girls still dont do.

So why does this movie try so desperately to justify it? Starring Kate Hudson Ginnfer Goodwin John Krasinski Colin Egglesfield Steve Howey Ashley Williams Sarah Baldwin Grace Capra Shirley Dluginski Jill Eikenberry Director Luke Greenfield Running time 143 Release Opened May 6 2011  Editorial Review Definitely not a lot to be desiredBy Stephanie MerryFriday May 6 2011This should go without saying but the novel-turned-movie ""Something Borrowed"" clinches it It is not okay to sleep with the fiance of ones best friend. Whats odd and ultimately icky is how enthusiastically the film attempts to justify doing so. The sporadically comedic romantic drama based on Emily Giffins best-selling chick-lit trifle focuses on Rachel White (Ginnifer Goodwin) a successful lawyer who offers herself up as the worlds doormat. Unattached and having just turned 30 Rachel is feeling forlorn which is compounded by the fact her best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson) is marrying Rachels law school crush. If Darcy has a redeeming quality its not readily evident. She is a shameless attention-seeker who takes advantage of Rachels amenability decorates her apartment with large-scale semi-nude photos of herself and concludes phone conversations with ""kiss-kiss-kiss."" Her favorite topic of conversation is her own beauty. After a few drinks Rachel tells Darcys fiance Dexter (Colin Egglesfield) who looks like a composite of Tom Cruise and a Ken doll about her longstanding infatuation. Before you know it the two are in bed and Rachel who has always been a model best friend is suddenly the Other Woman. From there the action shifts between New York and the Hamptons; things continue to intensify between Rachel and Dexter all while plans for the nuptials continue unabated. As the summer wears on Dexter becomes increasingly ambivalent about which woman to choose while Rachel seems to waver between remorse and heartbreak. Meanwhile there are happy couples everywhere Rachel looks and her good friend Ethan (John Krasinski) is giving her a hard time for being such a pushover.The screenwriters are no puppet masters and pulling a few heartstrings doesnt force the audience to wish for Rachel and Dexters happily ever after. The reason is simple logic If Darcy is so terrible why is Rachel her best friend and Dexter her fiance? Another obstacle that makes it impossible to invest in these characters is that Dexter turns out to be nothing but a weepy weakling. By the time his father makes him cry with a simple rebuke you may wonder where his initial attractiveness flitted off to.The movies 103 minutes would be wholly unbearable if it werent for Krasinski who is on the scene with his goofy bulbous nose and perfect comedic timing to partially redeem the almost unwatchable. He steals the show as he often does with the help of the scripts best lines. You might question his role choice if he werent such a much-needed source of laughs and voice of reason.But as Krasinskis scenes get fewer and farther between straightforward comedy yields to the unintentional variety. During a recent screening as Rachel and Dexter shared a post-coital moment of gazing into each others eyes snickers spread through the audience like a rollicking brush fire.A few laughs ultimately give way to the tiresome realization that these three less-than-likable personalities probably deserve one another. Its just a shame anyone has to watch them figure that out.Contains sexual situations crude language and the intimation of drug use.

Kate Hudson who hasnt been in a good movie since she was Oscar-nominated for ""Almost Famous"" gets top billing again in the so-so ""Something Borrowed."" Fortunately the chick flick is the first lead role for Ginnifer Goodwin one of the more interesting actresses working today whether in TV (""Big Love"") or in films (as the first Mrs. Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line""). Goodwin makes a meal of this thin gruel derived from a novel by Emily Giffin. Her subtle work makes you care about this young lawyer who finds herself drawn into an affair with the fiance of her about-to-be married BFF -- even if some of the other performances are problematic the script and direction are by-the-numbers at best and Goodwins hairstyles tend to be distractingly awful. As we see from way too many flashbacks Goodwins character has secretly been crushing on Hudsons fiance (the wooden Colin Egglesfield of ""Melrose Place"") since their days at law school. But she defers to Hudson her more sexually aggressive childhood pal -- at least until Goodwin and the fiance end up sharing a boozy cab ride home from Goodwins 30th birthday party. PHOTOS SOMETHING BORROWED FILMING IN NY Its awkward and mildly farcical when Egglesfield and Goodwin are awoken from her bed the next morning by frantic cellphone calls to both of them from Hudson. Things get even more complicated when Goodwin arrives with a platonic buddy (uber-dweeb John Krasinski of ""The Office"") for a summer share in the Hamptons with Hudson Egglesfield and the latters cartoonishly macho pal (Steve Howey of TVs ""Reba""). When Krasinski isnt dodging the attention of another aggressive female in the house by pretending to be gay hes sensitively figuring out whats going on between Egglesfield and Goodwin. He warns Goodwin (whom he has his own secret crush on) that the guy is after all about to be married to her best friend. The press notes describe Hudsons character as ""high-maintenance"" but her over-the-top performance pushes past the point of obnoxiousness. Its enough to make you wonder why a character as smart as Goodwins would put up with Hudson for 10 minutes let alone most of their lives. Its a testament to Goodwins skill as an actress that we almost buy this -- and the idea that her character would carry a torch for such a shallow weak pretty boy who will most likely turn out to be a serial philanderer if she wrests him away from Hudson. The script attributed to Jennie Snyder Urman tries to excuse this by arguing that hes only marrying Hudson to please his dying mother (Jill Eikenberry most of whose part seems to have ended up on the cutting-room floor). Personally I didnt buy it or the ending. Hopefully Goodwin will land a juicy dramatic role as a result of ""Something Borrowed."" Hudson should get a new acting coach -- and make sure the cinematographer of her next movie doesnt make the 32-year-old actress look like shes on the far side of 40. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next ON THE RUNWAY Read Next ON THE RUNWAY Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 47301 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22673 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 17923 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Borrowed Not much new in predictable Something Borrowed BY JODY MITORI  jmitoripost-dispatch.com  314-340-8240 May 6 2011 (...) HOEP John Krasinski and Ginnifer Goodwin in ""Something Borrowed"" (AP Photo/Warner Bros.) Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is smart. She has brown hair a law degree ugly shoes -- all movie shorthand for a brainy woman. But shes unfulfilled because shes pining for her best friends fiance Dex (Colin Egglesfield). Rachel and Dex were friends years ago in law school but blond beauty Darcy (Kate Hudson) moved in on her friends crush.Based on the popular book by Emily Giffin ""Something Borrowed"" is a predictable romantic comedy with cookie-cutter characters -- the nerdy professional with a mean-girl best friend both vying for a stoic lawyer who secretly wants to be a teacher. They live in a world where work doesnt have any real pressures weekends are made for the Hamptons and the only possible love interests are the five or six people in their circle of friends.In flashbacks we see how Rachel lost Dex to vain flirty Darcy. But on her 30th birthday Rachel discovers Dex has feelings for her too. With just weeks until Dex and Darcys wedding Rachel is stuck trying to pick between her own happiness and her best friends. The love triangle drags on too long and Rachel is such a doormat its tough to root for her. At the same time director Luke Greenfield doesnt show why anyone would be friends with self-centered Darcy much less marry her. But the cast is generally appealing Goodwin combines sweetness and naivete with an exaggerated dose of spunk Hudson adds moments of vulnerability to her unlikable character and Egglesfield has the looks of Tom Cruise in his ""Top Gun"" days without the charisma that made Cruise a star. Still he and Goodwin have enough chemistry to make it worth sticking around until the end.John Krasinski as Rachels pal Ethan is the brightest spot of the movie as the voice of reason. He delivers the best lines with the timing of a comic pro. ""Something Borrowed"" doesnt break any new ground but it is a decent way to spend a girls night out. Just dont expect it to be worth a long-term commitment.

Something Borrowed review Truth among the trite 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Something Borrowed Romantic comedy-drama. Starring Ginnifer Goodwin Kate Hudson and Colin Egglesfield. Directed by Luke Greenfield. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Something Borrowed"" a woman is secretly in love with the man who is about to marry her best friend. Not so original except there are things different about the handling of the subject that are either this movies claim to originality or just tin-eared presentation The best friend is a selfish idiot. The man she loves is a spineless weenie. And our appealing heroine never quite figures this out. Maybe the filmmakers never figured it out either. Supposedly Dex (Colin Egglesfield) realizes he really loves Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) even though he is engaged to Darcy (Kate Hudson). His course of action then would appear to be simple as the right choice should have been obvious. As played by Kate Hudson - who deserves credit for allowing herself to be so repellent - Darcy is an unfaithful selfish party girl good for a few laughs but about five minutes away from looking like an old drunk. She is also a resounding bore. Goodwin radiates probity and makes waiting almost look interesting and so for all the movies awkwardness it remains watchable. But shes waiting for something thats not worth waiting for not for her and not for us. Egglesfield is a handsome actor but hes playing a role so weak-willed that two-thirds into the film a packed screening audience started groaning when he appeared onscreen. Related Stories Something Borrowed To its credit the movie based on the novel by Emily Giffin does offer some truths either accidentally or through purposeful harsh handling by director Luke Greenfield (""The Girl Next Door"") Friendships can be co-dependent. People are often stupid. And when it comes to love people are often really stupid stay stupid and never find out just how stupid they really are. Its an odd message for a light romance but not exactly a lie. -- Advisory Sexual situations. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Something Borrowed You wont want it back - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Something Borrowed You wont want it back By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Why hasnt Kate Hudson learned to steer clear of the altar after 2009s dismal Bride Wars? By David Lee Warner Bros. Pictures One-sided friendship Kate Hudson left is the attention-grabbing bossy Darcy and Ginnifer Goodwin is quiet selfless Rachel. EnlargeClose By David Lee Warner Bros. Pictures One-sided friendship Kate Hudson left is the attention-grabbing bossy Darcy and Ginnifer Goodwin is quiet selfless Rachel. Her obnoxious bridezilla roles make no use of the gently ditzy comic talent she displayed more than a decade ago in Cameron Crowes Almost Famous. Though her romantic-comedy roles since then are largely forgettable her unbridled bridal passion is worse. Who wants to cringe through a chick flick in which half of a best-pal duo incessantly bullies and grabs the spotlight from the other? MORE Hudson Goodwin share a bond Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is annoyingly cowed by her childhood friend the maniacally bossy Darcy (Hudson). Their unequal bond is just one of many misfires. Also confounding is how Rachel could have missed signs that her friendship with law school buddy Dex (Colin Egglesfield) was poised to become something more. Sure some people are clueless or self-defeating but Rachel should have her head examined for so selflessly passing over the guy she cares about to hard-partying Darcy. And why would Rachel wait six years until just before Dex and Darcy are due to marry to acknowledge feelings for Dex? Nevermind that the wimpy Dex hardly seems worthy of the affections of one woman let alone two. Worse the more affable and attractive Ethan (John Krasinski) is ignored as though he were chopped liver. Yet he continues to hang around. The ensemble cast is quite the dysfunctional friendship circle. Something Borrowed  1/2 out of four Stars Kate Hudson Ginnifer Goodwin John Krasinski Colin Egglesfield Ashley Williams Steve Howey Director Luke Greenfield Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and some drug material Running time 1 hour 43 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Bonds are tested and feelings hurt but who really cares? The story takes predictable turns embraces cliches and dodges all humor. The drawn-out resolution leaves viewers feeling cheated. Everyone is in love with the wrong person. In a clever comedy of errors situations are righted or people get what they deserve -- and its done with imagination and grace. None of those elements are at play here. Audiences interested in marriage-minded Millennials would do better watching reruns of last weeks royal wedding. Even the rich titled and hat-wearing seem more relatable than the irritating folks in Something Borrowed. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Movie review Something Borrowed - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Something BorrowedA movie based on Emily Giffins popular novel aims to heat up the complexities of friendship and romance but comes out barely lukewarm.May 06 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Heres the central conundrum in the new romantic comedy ""Something Borrowed"" Does the pop-off-the-page pretty of Kate Hudsons Darcy give her automatic rights to hunky Dex (Colin Egglesfield)? Or does the less shiny but still pretty penny that is Ginnifer Goodwins good girl Rachel deserve a shot at the ring even if that rings already on her best friends finger? Before we get to the answer let me bring up the central problem in ""Something Borrowed"" a a Grand Central Station of problems. Despite the pretty overload and the smoldering blue-eyed handsome of Egglesfield the heart-pounding palm-sweating heavy-breathing chemical reactions that should be causing major blackouts in Manhattan where this story unfolds are nowhere to be found. Unless you count John Krasinskis crackling-with-chemistry Ethan which you should although apparently no one but new wife Emily Blunt and me seems to understand his magical powers. Krasinski is once again the best thing about a romantic comedy (last time it was as the future son-in-law who spied the tryst he shouldnt have in ""Its Complicated""). So put this in your suggestion box Hollywood Krasinski in the tradition of funny nice guy Tom Hanks is leading man material. ""Borrowed"" is directed by Luke Greenfield who continues his trend of making no sparks but pleasant enough romances. ""Something Borrowed"" has more polish and panache but less sweetness than his 2004 ""The Girl Next Door"" about a nerdy teen and his porn star neighbor (and Im not being sarcastic it was pleasant and sweet). Screenwriter Jennie Snyder Urman has stayed true to the bestselling novel by Emily Giffin which distinguished itself in the chick lit world with its nuance as in it had some. In Giffins book you dont owe your best friends everything and the lines between love loyalty and betrayal are not so clear-cut. Because everything that happens in ""Borrowed"" has a past the film does a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between then and now. That gets a little tiresome after a while because the scenes may change but the theme doesnt a Darcy is always center stage Rachel is smiling supportively nearby. The trigger point is the big 3-0 with Darcy giving Rachel a ""surprise"" bash. Theres too much drink a lost purse and a fateful taxi ride featuring Darcys significant others a Dex and Rachel fiancA(c) and friend a sparking a ""driver make that one stop not two"" fling. But as the song promised a theres got to be a morning after. So here are the headaches were left with Will great sex I mean true love lead Dex to cancel the wedding? Is Rachel really wrong since she really really loves Dex? Does Darcy deserve Dex anyway? These and other questions swirl through a summer of love that bounces between work in NYC and a share in the Hamptons which makes for a lot of ahem transit time. After years spent in the good girl trenches its nice to see Hudson put a little more bad into the act. The vacuous vixen role suits her nicely. Goodwin who created such depth in the wide-eyed innocence and steely ambition of Margene in HBOs late-great Mormon polygamy series ""Big Love"" is sweet plain and simple but not much else. Egglesfield who should be the hot potato between these two is more like a plate of cold fries. Though in fairness its hard when his primary role is wimp and jerk. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review One DayAugust 19 2011Movie review Waiting for ForeverFebruary 4 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentTrue LoveRachelCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-something-borrowed-20110506,0,101241.story?track=rss",200,somethingborrowed17,somethingborrowed,latimes

More about Something Borrowed >> So it is with Something Borrowed. To paraphrase one of its few laughs its a zombie movie directed by Vera Wang. Not literally. Luke Greenfield in fact directed this dull prenup romantic triangle. It stars Kate Hudson as Darcy smug bride-to-be and Ginnifer Goodwin as Rachel submissive maid of honor who belatedly realizes oops shes in love with Dex (Colin Egglesfield) the charmless groom. This eternity of glossily art-directed indecision is based on the popular novel by Emily Giffin and comes perilously close to being an unofficial sequel to Bride Wars. Like that film also starring Hudson as an alpha kitten clawing at anything that comes between her and her ball of yarn this one is less about the love between man and woman than about competitive girlfriending. Hudson seizes the role of unsympathetic golden girl with both sharply manicured hands. Her Darcy is exasperating exhausting and in stretches entertaining. You can see why the pushy blonde and pushover brunette are bosom buds Rachels deference confirms Darcys command. In the trickier role of Rachel Goodwin looks as though shes carrying 30 years of resentment in the crown of her very bad wig. Watching this enormously appealing actress progress from pushover to pushbacker should be satisfying. But even when she finally asks for what she wants Goodwins Rachel is terminally tentative a quality that may read better on the page than it plays on the screen where action is everything. Would that another actor than the charisma-challenged Egglesfield had played Dex. This is a generic smile not a guy who comes between best friends of 25 years. Much better is squirrelly John Krasinski as Ethan Rachels best male friend and cheerleader. He has genuine screen presence and more than one dimension. Thats more than can be said for a film that fails to dramatize its intriguing premise. Namely how do you make the Sophies Choice between your best friend and your soulmate?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Something Borrowed is carrion that Kate Hudson circles like a vulture. I dont know whether shes drunk stoned or simply out of her mind but if it werent so sad watching her pick away at this skimpy overlong romantic lie she might be entertaining. Either way she appears to be making the most of a miserable situation. The movie is based on a popular work of so-called chick lit by Emily Giffin that peddles the usual nightmares about female friendships that theyre all one man away from ruin.Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Dex (Colin Egglesfield) went to law school together. Theyre clearly attracted to each other. But when Rachels best friend Darcy (Hudson) asks him out Rachel lets her have him. Six years later the most improbable thing happens Rachel and Dex start an affair even though Darcy and Dex are getting married -- though to be fair they seem brought together less by love than alliteration. What could this preppy woodworked man see in one of Hudsons patented freaky frenemies? I suppose in asking Ive fallen into the trap of an entire wing of the publishing industry. The intended lesson of ""Something Borrowed is that a woman as basic as Rachel could win the heart of a man whose name rhymes with ""simplex.The movie fails to see that Rachel and Dex deserve each other because theyre mutually boring. ""I didnt think someone like you could like someone like me says she to he. Does she mean that special kind of love in which a species of plant is completely adored by a piece of office furniture? Goodwin here is like a 1940s or 1950s ingenue whos scared shes past her expiration date and hates herself for it. With ""Mona Lisa Smile ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton HBOs ""Big Love ""Hes Just Not That Into You and this new movie Goodwin has turned naivete self-pity and niceness into a dubious career strategy. But theres nothing sexy about altruism.Thats how Hudson steals this movie -- by not caring. What she does in ""Something Borrowed isnt coherent or even very good. But its something. Whether Darcy is saying she hates Rachels shoes piercing the stale air of propriety with questions about penis size or making you wonder whether shell just break down and murder everybody Hudsons entire performance is one enormous whatever.The filmmaking is as plain as its protagonist and as ""who cares? as its antagonist. Logy trips to the Hamptons with friends of Rachel and Darcy played by Steve Howey Ashley Williams and John Krasinski never produce as much farce as they should just a clogged soundtrack. Whenever Rachel remembers something the camera gets close to Goodwins face a montage belches up and were plunked inside a flashback to some dewy law-school moment between the former classmates. The director Luke Greenfield concocts a pulse-less preppy New York and for comedy tosses in clips of ""Fatal Attraction as if a remake were in the offing. At some point Krasinskis character whos like the gay friend the wacky neighbor the best gal pal and Ralph Bellamy (all with Karl Maldens nose) remarks that the Hamptons are ""like a zombie movie directed by Ralph Lauren. The rest of ""Something Borrowed is like a Ralph Lauren movie directed by a zombie.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sometimes when good people pursue their own happiness together the happiness of another person is collateral damage. This third person doesnt have to be a monster in order for the good people to remain good. This is what happens in the world of human adults--and in good drama for that matter--all the time People have to choose between betraying a friend and acting in their own self-interest or staying loyal and denying what the heart wants. Based on Emily Giffins novel Something Borrowed gets into this sticky situation and relentlessly cheats its way out of it cravenly fearing that the audience might not like its characters for making tough choices. And yes perhaps the audience will like its favored couple more but all the engineering that goes into making them sympathetic results in a film that feels agonizingly synthetic and alien. Playing to whats quickly becoming her type based on this and Hes Just Not That Into You Ginnifer Goodwin stars as a lonely insecure flibbertigibbet with a knack for getting herself into embarrassing situations. Kate Hudson plays her best friend since childhood but the two have grown into very different people Goodwin a shy steady humble professional and Hudson a bubbly narcissistic party girl. With Hudson months away from marrying Goodwins old law-school friend Colin Egglesfield Goodwin starts to regret not making a play for Egglesfield herself and discovers he feels likewise. So over a long summer with lots of tense group trips to Egglesfields beachside getaway in the Hamptons Goodwin and Egglesfield have an affair and fall in love but are hesitant to hurt Hudson by calling off the wedding. And yet Hudson makes it so easy by being a boozing preening self-serving party animal with no sensitivity to the people in her immediate orbit. Something Borrowed offers precisely one scene--a sleepover at Goodwins apartment--that allows Hudson to be human and makes sense of a friendship that probably should have faded many years earlier. But the rest of the film turns her into cartoon and surrounds the characters with more cartoonishness like having Goodwins equally lovelorn friend (John Krasinski) pretend that hes gay to rebuff a woman (Ashley Williams) who keeps throwing herself at him. Something Borrowed leaves the impression that Goodwin and Egglesfield belong together not because theyre compatible but because theyre of the same species.

David Lee Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield in ""Something Borrowed"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Lets hope that those craving matrimonial entertainment got their quota from last Fridays William and Kate Show. Otherwise they might fall prey to ""Something Borrowed"" an expectation-crushing offering that falls far short of rom-com industry best practices. I cant imagine an audience for this other than backers relatives or friends of the filmmakers and even they will find their mettle tested. Deeply dimpled Ginnifer Goodwin is a wallflower lawyer Kate Hudson is her domineering alpha-blonde best friend and Colin Egglesfield is apparently the only available man in New York City. He and Goodwin were study partners in law school and on their way to being something more when her smooth confident pal swooped in and snatched him like a hawk seizing a rabbit. Now the couple are about to marry while Goodwin smiles bravely from the sidelines with aching unrequited longing and holds back tears. The film is a two-hour pity party for her character as her hopes for Egglesfield to snap out of it and realize he loves her are raised and dashed. We learn quite late in the game that the handsome fellow is also high-society but hes such a wimpy passive calf-eyed nonentity that its hard to imagine either the dominatrix or the dishrag wanting him. Still Goodwin regards him with a love slaves beaming adulation and quavers ""I never thought someone like you could like someone like me."" Its one thing to root for a plucky underdog but its tough to maintain sympathy for a masochist. The film duly grinds through scene after rusty mechanical scene. Yes there is a sad walk in the rain. Yes the frenemies confirm their bond by performing a tightly choreographed oldies number. Yes there are caramelized New York vistas standard comic friends and over-insistent musical cues. In the scripts only laugh-out-loud line one character describes summer in the Hamptons as ""a zombie movie directed by Ralph Lauren."" With that throwaway joke this lifeless mindless enterprise critiques itself. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Girl meets boy and theyre clearly made for each other but something gets in the way. Hes the business tycoon putting her picturesque bookshop out of business say or maybe they just get off on the wrong foot because hes hiding his golden and/or wounded heart beneath a rakish facade. Something Borrowed Fair Director Luke Greenfield. Cast Ginnifer Goodwin Kate Hudson Colin Egglesfield. Rating PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and some drug material. This weeks new releases. Spotlight Kate Hudson Movies about weddings Chick flicks In ""Something Borrowed"" the problem for Rachel the unconvincingly nerdy lawyer played by Ginnifer Goodwin is that her hunky Mr. Right Dex (Colin Egglesfield) is already engaged - to her best friend. This is somewhat puzzling since the obviously perfect couple have been pining away for each other since their days as study buddies in law school and because gal pal Darcy (Kate Hudson) is a narcissistic party girl who seems destined to star in a future season of ""The Real Housewives of New York."" She and Rachel have been ""soulmates"" since childhood so maybe its believable that their mismatched friendship has survived through their 20s. But Dex is presented as a serious-minded conformist afraid to defy his traditionalist parents. The only reason he is attached to such an ill-suited mate is that otherwise there wouldnt be a movie. Based on the novel by Emily Giffin ""Something Borrowed"" is excruciatingly predictable. Dispensing with the usual romcom complications Dex and Rachel fall into bed within the first few scenes leaving the rest of the movie to be dragged out by hard-to-credit barriers such as Dexs tsk-tsking father and his sick mother who apparently is recovering from an unnamed malady only because she is overjoyed at the upcoming nuptials. There are some entertaining moments involving Rachels not-quite-gay guy friend Ethan (John Krasinski) especially a hilarious game of beach badminton played for ""a secret a point."" One plot twist even manages to make the audience think the story isnt going where everyone thought it was - for about 10 minutes anyway. But its not nearly enough to make up for the films fundamental flaw which is that its beautiful-people characters are the kind that exist only in the minds of Hollywood hacks. How many times must we be subjected to another gorgeous glamorous starlet impersonating a clumsy wallflower? Will anyone really believe in this GQ-perfect big man on campus who lacks the courage to ask her out on a date? And as for their friends these martini-swilling Hamptons-vacationing superficial hedonists are they really living the life we all envy? Please moviegoers please Say it aint so.

"Something Borrowed | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; something-borrowed ) Something Borrowed (United States 2011) May 05 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are moments - few and far between admittedly - when Something Borrowed briefly shines. Alas those isolated instances aside the movie is largely a waste of time. A tortured romantic comedy constructed on an uncertain foundation of artifice this adaptation of Emily Griffins novel routinely fails to escape the decaying orbit of familiar romantic comedy clichA(c)s. At the same time it gives the false impression of somehow being different than and superior to the less sophisticated members of the genre. A successful romantic comedy should offer breezy wish fulfillment as sweet and airy as cotton candy. Something Borrowed is overlong and at times tedious; the taste is gritty and lingers unpleasantly. Perhaps in the novel Something Borrowed manages to transcend the genre. Maybe the female friendship between Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy (Kate Hudson) carries equal weight to the tortured soul mate-ship between Rachel and Darcys groom-to-be Dex (Colin Egglesfield). One senses that if there was something substantive and believable between Rachel and Darcy there would be a genuine dilemma for the heroine in her choice give up Dex and keep her friendship with Darcy or pursue a romance with Dex and lose Darcy. As it is however Darcy is a one-dimensional harpy and even though Dex is a bland uninteresting coward there doesnt seem to be much of a downside to going after the guy. The backstory informs us that Rachel and Darcy have been bffs since a young age. Now as both women approach the beginning of their fourth decade on the planet things are changing. Darcy is marrying Dex who happens to be Rachels One True Love. Being the shy reticent woman she is Rachel never confessed her feelings to Dex during their years together in law school. If she had she would have learned that the feeling is mutual. Instead she introduced Dex to Darcy and the two became an item and are now headed for the altar. Belatedly Rachels romantic inclinations have become known to Dex and he is forced to choose between ending his engagement to Darcy and disappointing his parents or ""doing his duty."" He sleeps with Rachel presumably as a kind of test drive but continues to hem and haw about which woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. Meanwhile two other characters are in the picture - Ethan (John Krasinski) Rachels supposedly platonic male friend and Marcus (Steve Howey) Dexs randy buddy - turning the triangle into a pentagram. Something Borrowed is littered with weak and annoying characters making it difficult for the viewer to endure an entire scene without throwing up his/her hands in disgust. Rachel is in the words of one of her close friends ""pathetic."" She has no spine and its difficult to root for someone who bears a resemblance to an invertebrate. Dex is in many ways a good match for Rachel since he also lacks a backbone but hes also a skunk and a wimp carrying on a clandestine affair with Rachel while continuing to plan his wedding to Darcy. To keep the one-dimensionally self-absorbed Darcy from being sympathetic on any level the script has her cheat on Dex which eliminates any possible reason to think kindly of her. In fact the only character worth admiring and liking is Ethan and his role is marginalized. He gets screwed then written out. Despite being saddled with an annoying character Ginnifer Goodwin (probably best known as the youngest of the wives on Big Love) almost succeeds in humanizing her. Unfortunately every time Goodwin wins us to Rachels side the script has her do something irritating and the goodwill is lost. Goodwins co-star Kate Hudson impresses as a self-centered bitch and shes one-dimensional enough to be cartoonishly amusing at times. Colin Egglesfield whose primary background is in television looks pretty but doesnt bring much in the way of acting chops to the production. The standout is The Offices John Krasinski whose yeoman-like performance elevates every sequence in which he appears. This is the second scene-stealing opportunity for the actor who was also a standout in the better (and funnier) Its Complicated. The best scene in Something Borrowed - the volleyball game - is all Krasinski. Many viewers will leave the theater wishing the movie had been about Ethan. Hes the only one who isnt vain self-absorbed shallow impotent or two-faced. Director Luke Greenfield has done most of his work on television (although he helmed 2004s The Girl Next Door an 80s-style romantic comedy about a teenager falling for a porn star who moves in next door) and it shows in the simplicity of his shots. Visually the movie is dull and repetitive and its look mirrors its pacing and tone. Something Borrowed is at least 20 minutes too long and it begins to drag noticeably around the halfway point. Chronic indecisiveness might work for Hamlet but its inappropriate for a romantic comedy. Perhaps the worst sin however is the ending. Despite trying vainly to be upbeat it carries the unsatisfying stench of something unfinished. If there is a mission statement for any romantic comedy its that the fantasy must be fulfilled by the time the end credits roll. Here that might technically be the case but many viewers will leave the theater less-than-pleased with the halfhearted and oblique manner in which it is accomplished.

But the characters are either so ill-defined or unlikable its hard to care whether they get out of this tricky situation with their emotions and relationships intact.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom And thats odd and unfortunate because ""Something Borrowed"" stars the ordinarily adorable Ginnifer Goodwin as a New York attorney who finds herself in that predicament. Story Share your goofy bridesmaid dress photos Directed by Luke Greenfield (""The Girl Next Door"") and based on the novel by Emily Giffin ""Something Borrowed"" introduces us to Goodwins character Rachel on the night of her 30th birthday. Shes quietly freaking out about the passage of time because shes still hopelessly single the cliched trademark of so many chick-lit heroines. Meanwhile her closest pal since childhood the blonde party girl Darcy (Kate Hudson) is about to marry Dex (Colin Egglesfield) Rachels good friend from law school. Video Hudsons special Something Borrowed treat (on this page) Rachel introduced the two of them six years ago and encouraged them to get together even though she was secretly in love with Dex. (And Egglesfield a former soap opera star in his first major film role is traditionally handsome in a young-Tom-Cruise sort of way.) But after a few drinks at her surprise party she and Dex end up sleeping together -- and that inspires them to revisit feelings theyd both suppressed. Story From Corpse to Crashers Top 5 wedding movies Clearly theyre meant for each other but each feels a responsibility toward Darcy -- which makes no sense because Darcy only feels a responsibility toward herself. As Hudson describes her own character in the films production notes ""Darcy is all about Darcy."" And as Hudson plays her she is rampantly narcissistic; the script from Jennie Snyder Urman renders her in such one-dimensional fashion its hard to figure out what she does besides drink and shop. She may not even have a job. Quick facts Starring Kate Hudson Ginnifer Goodwin John Krasinski Colin Egglesfield Director Luke Greenfield Run time 1 hour 53 minutes MPAA rating PG-13 So its baffling that Rachel and Dex two intelligent ostensibly decent-hearted people have chosen to spend any time with her at all much less made her one of the most important people in their lives. Its also obvious that Dexs old-money parents would be happier with the sweet and proper Rachel rather than the flamboyant and obnoxious Darcy. And so the majority of ""Something Borrowed"" features Rachel and Dex hemming and hawing over how to handle their burgeoning relationship as the threat of the big day draws ever closer. Much of this takes place over dull weekends at Darcys Hamptons beach house with a cadre of supporting players. Video Kate Hudson to Matt Lauer Im engaged (on this page) John Krasinski co-stars as Rachel and Darcys childhood friend Ethan who mainly exists for cutaway reaction shots and sarcastic remarks (he does get a few amusing lines); Steve Howey plays Marcus a gleeful womanizer whom Darcy insists Rachel should hook up with which shows how little Darcy really knows or cares about Rachel; and Ashley Williams as the clingy Claire with whom Ethan had a one-night stand he regrets. He is so desperate to avoid her he pretends to be gay. Thats how horrible all these people are. Many melodramatic revelations come to light in the films third act then theyre just as quickly resolved. But dont feel daunted Youll probably have checked out mentally and emotionally long before any of this anyway. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Posted May 19 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Dont be fooled by Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) one third of the inane Gen-Y love triangle in Something Borrowed. She may dress like the accomplished attorney she is but shes fundamentally and forever a girlish doormat born to submit to the demands of her narcissistic sexually provocative best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson always game for playing a party girl). Darcy (note to Jane Austen Sue) is engaged to Dex (the Tom Cruise-faced Colin Egglesfield) a hot rich guy as passive as he is handsome. When he and Rachel met in law school neither would make a romantic move although the two simperers were obviously meant to be together. So Darcy snapped up Dex and is now planning her wedding. Life would be peachy if Dex and Rachel hadnt ? confessed their feelings on the night of her 30th birthday and ended up in bed. To quote Austen ""Oh no they dit-unt"" Now we have to suffer as this soul-sucking romantic comedy (based on the novel of the same name by Emily Giffin) rounds its inevitable bases Rachel agonizes about hurting Darcy Darcy bullies Rachel and Dex and ? Dex stands there holding Heineken bottles. (Theres a drinking game to be played each time the logo appears.) John Krasinski takes the role of Rachels gay best friend -- oops hes not gay just a writer. Krasinski has a great comic touch; his every reaction shot is a relief from the tedium of nobody telling the truth. And its probably all he can do not to glance at the camera Office-style as if to say ""Can you believe how dumb this stuff is?""

It was directed with extraordinary impersonality by Luke Greenfield (Rob Schneiders The Animal) and produced by Hilary Swank in collaboration apparently with the restaurant Shake Shack--one of the lifestyle brands prominently featured in this tale of love and betrayal among New York Citys young and affluent. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Rachel White (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a successful single gal though her face in repose is a frown with creases starting to show at the corners. As the film begins she walks into her own dirty 30th birthday party thrown by her lifelong best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson). Among the guests are Darcys groom-to-be Dex (Colin Egglesfield) and Ethan (John Krasinski) the comic-relief platonic pal.Normally Rachels the schoolmarm and Darcys blond and having more fun but something is askew tonight. Maybe its Rachels shock at starting a fourth decade maybe its Dexs pre-wedding jitters maybe its the way Darcy leaves Rachel with the fond slur ""I just hate your shoes so much"" as she stumbles home early--but Rachel and Dex go for a nightcap together and wake up in the same bed.In addition to giving them a guilty secret to conceal this act shakes loose an avalanche of flashbacks. Before Darcy got Dex he was Rachels study-buddy at NYU Law and it seems their flirty friendship stopped just shy of a hook-up six years prior when Rachel stepped aside for Darcy as were told she always has. Ethans given the job of explicating that friendship dynamic to Rachel--and the viewer. Goodwins an appealing wallflower and Hudson shows flashes of blithe funny egotism but they lack moments together that illustrate Darcys feminine gamesmanship in action. From the opening birthday-party scene in which Darcy narrates a slideshow introducing the cast of characters its clear that Something Borrowed finds it easier to tell us about relationships than to show us them under way.For the rest of the summer spent between Manhattan and the Southampton rental Rachel and Dex carry on and off hesitating to drop the bomb on Darcy. Dexs other big roadblock in breaking off the wedding are his stereotyped WASP parents a neurasthenic mother and disapproving father who says things like ""Its not the kind of people we are""; wants to buy the newlyweds a Westchester manor; and presumably quashed Dexs dreams of being a teacher--because he is having a career crisis on top of everything else. (A Happy Ending showing Dexs first day at some Bronx P.S. would be welcome.)In other romantic complications Ethan is followed to Southampton by a hopeful puppyish old fling played by Ashley Williams--a chewtoy for Krasinski whose comedy always seems to require someone to cut. Still Ethans a more appealing bachelor than Dex. Egglesfield has fine genes but hes a limited actor playing a character that requires a vulnerability in order for us to forgive his frequent caddishness and constipated decisionmaking. Egglesfield cant transcend his guy-who-just-cut-you-off-in-his-convertible air; misting up over his family troubles he registers as schemingly sensitive looking to take advantage of any sympathy that comes his way.The Something Borrowed is of course the premise embellished from a 1997 Julia Roberts vehicle My Best Friends Wedding. Befitting a demographically precise movie about second-chance nostalgia Borrowed raids young professionals Clinton-era pop-culture memories. Dexs wildman pal played by Steve Howey resembles Mark McGrath the middlebrow go-to ""bad boy"" in 1998. At one point Rachel goes to check out a "" 90s cover band"" for the wedding and were treated to meaningful renditions of Third Eye Blind standards; later Goodwin and Hudson perform a Salt-N-Pepa dance number rehearsed to perfection in distant youth. (This is the one moment they actually seem like symbiotic BFFs.)The poster featuring colorful little boxes with headshots of the stars is nearly the same lazy design used to promote the superb humane comedy How Do You Know last year--a disturbing example of insensate Hollywood selling its best and worst in the same package. If not the worst this is at least the most dissembling. Its no coincidence that Something Borrowed features lawyer protagonists; while making a pretense of being a comedy of modern sexual ethics the movie never asks a hard question without an answer prepared in advance.1 Hudson and Goodwin trying really hard to seem like best friends.David Lee Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Something blue as well as this wedding party has enough unlikable characters to put anyone into a funk. TWITTER The wedding comedy ""Something Borrowed"" raises provocative questions regarding love commitment and marriage only to dismiss them with a brush of a hand as so much dandruff. Weddings are clogging the cinema calendar these days with invitations coming in for Jumping the Broom Bridesmaids Love Wedding Marriage and Something Borrowed. What these films also share in common is a comic ineptitude that makes you wish for Divorce American Style. But one invitation at a time since Something Borrowed is the cliched predictable and exasperating movie under review here. The problem with this one is that of forcing rote characters into tired formulas that call to the mind the worst sort of TV sitcoms. All thats missing is a laugh track. Something Borrowed doesnt so much borrow from other movies as settle into a comfort zone of raising provocative questions regarding love commitment and marriage only to dismiss them with a brush of a hand as so much dandruff. Box office will reflect audiences willingness to tolerate such laziness. The really odd thing about all the characters in Something Borrowed is how much they dislike or manipulate one another. The engaged couple is clearly mismatched the ""best friends"" friendship of bride and bridesmaid is a one-way relationship and everyone on their periphery either mock or take pains to avoid each other. Fun times. Darcy (Kate Hudson) a blonde party-girl with an overpowering sense of entitlement has stolen away an infatuated law-school classmate Dex (Colin Egglesfield) from Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) supposedly her best friend since childhood. Now on the eve of the nuptials Dex and Rachel impulsively sleep together and rekindle all those glorious law-school memories. Gosh what to do? Well call off the wedding and rethink things. Alas if that happens there goes the movie so everyone dithers so much Hamlet looks like a decisive guy. Surrounding this soap opera are such best enemies as Ethan (John Krasinski) Rachels confidant and secret admirer who seems to exist for reaction shots; Dexs best mate Marcus (Steve Howey) a loathsome skirt-chaser that many of the films women tolerate if not favor to the point of making them look daft; and Darcys friend Claire (Ashley Williams) whose pursuit of Ethan makes him willing to pretend to be gay. Every weekend these folks head for the Hamptons for thoroughly awful get-togethers. This does however gives rise to -- spoiler alert -- the movies one and only witty line. Ethan declares the Hamptons are ""a zombie movie directed by Ralph Lauren."" If only screenwriter Jennie Synder Urman had further pursued this sort of wit in a script based on Emily Giffins novel. If only director Luke Greenfield (The Girl Next Door) had relied less on music cues and more on his cast to tell this admittedly lame story. The film most reminiscent of Something Borrowed was the quite enjoyable Steve Carell-Juliette Binoche romantic comedy Dan in Real Life. What separates these two films besides the creation of real characters in reasonably real situations in the latter is an insistence that the two romantic leads in Something Borrowed once had their chance at romance and blew it only to drag a somewhat innocent person into a three-way that makes everyone look pathetic. (Actually Hudsons character is anything but innocent so the word is used here in the loosest possible sense.) Consequently you dont really like anyone here. No one deserves to be happy given the bad decisions wrong values and susceptibility to outside pressure all the characters suffer from. Production values are Ralph Lauren slick without a zombie in sight.

Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson play lifelong best friends whose bond is strained when the sheepish good girl sleeps with her bossy gal pals fiance in ""Something Borrowed."" Based on Emily Giffins beach-read bestseller this relatively charmless adaptation centers on the relatable-enough panic of watching ones ideal partner tie the knot with the wrong person but ditches all the elements that link the premise to real life skidding off into irreconcilable differences long before the wedding. Chick-pic appeal should ensure a modest domestic opening though the films many miscalculations will sabotage its chances at a lasting connection with auds. Six years after introducing law-school study buddy Dex (Colin Egglesfield) to best friend Darcy (Hudson) still-single Gotham attorney Rachel (Goodwin) realizes shes made a mistake. Turns out Dex is the man of her dreams -- a fact she has somehow refused to admit until the pair end up sleeping together on the night of Rachels 30th birthday party. Such a fling might be the start of a promising relationship if only Dex werent engaged to Darcy the overbearing attention hog who ""always wins"" as Rachel puts it. In Hudsons hands Darcy is such an unpleasant egotist its a wonder either Dex or Rachel can stand to have anything to do with her and apart from some antiquated notion of duty its not clear why they dont just ditch her and get together instead. Such passivity is all too common in real-world relationships but makes for frustrating onscreen entertainment with neither party strong enough to do the right thing. And so the affair continues undetected by Darcy (and chastened considerably from the novel focusing more on guilt than pleasure) while the two backstabbers try to work out their next move. A series of bad decisions would be better than no decision at all but theres no inertia to Jennie Synders screenplay as every scene brings the characters closer to the wedding -- as if an exchange of vows might realistically put the issue to rest. Backed by a big-enough budget to make things look slick director Luke Greenfield is too busy selling the lifestyle (a trip out to Darcys usual Hamptons getaway begins with a montage of high-end retail establishments) to recognize the universal aspects of Rachels situation. That leaves the story dangling somewhere between soap opera and sitcom offering up such distractions as meathead suitor Marcus (Steve Howey) a horny creep ineptly competing for Rachels attention and third wheel Ethan (John Krasinski) who must play gay to ditch a clingy one-night stand (Ashley Williams). Try as she might Hudson cant turn Darcy into a three-dimensional character Shes astonishingly easy to dislike but not nearly amusing enough in what could have been an unforgettable camp performance. And so in the absence of a naturally comedic cast Krasinski becomes the go-to guy for funny cutaways with ""The Office"" thesp delivering his trademark monkey-face expressions whenever the other characters do something weird. Even with nothing more to do hes a more plausible love interest than Egglesfields Dex a Tom Cruise-handsome rich kid whos spent his whole life trying to please his parents. ""Something Borrowed"" aims to be this decades ""My Best Friends Wedding"" which also hinged on our forgiving a frantic womans increasingly desperate efforts to break up an engagement. Goodwin earns sympathy points playing someone whos convinced herself she doesnt deserve happiness though just a soupcon of silliness would have really endeared us to her character. After all auds love movies about people who risk it all crazy lovesick fools who play boomboxes outside bedroom windows or confess their love in the rain. But by the time the equivalent scene finally comes around here its too late. Dex and Rachel are like a pair of perfectly matched doormats which makes the ""To be continued ... "" tag over the end credits all the more horrifying when you consider how poorly these two do under pressure.
