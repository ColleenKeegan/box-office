Just checking for breast cancer. Caught from behind making jerk-off motions with Tara Reids panties dangling from your finger? It was just a fugitive mouse scurrying through Reids purse (hence the panties) and into your button-down shirt. Really what else could it be? A little common sense might have sorted out all of these improbable situations or kept them from happening in the first place. Yet these moldy sight gags are the fine tissue that connects My Bosss Daughter an abysmal screwball comedy that relies heavily on idiocy from both sides of the screen. After logging some hard time on the studio shelf the film has presumably escaped the straight-to-video route due to the surging popularity of Ashton Kutcher who should consider himself punkd by his own ephemeral celebrity. While much of the blame for this mirthless variation on The Apartment belongs to screenwriter David Dorfman (Anger Management) and director David Zucker (Airplane) Kutcher isnt exactly Jack Lemmon either. Wearing a near-constant mask of dazed bewilderment his sleepwalking straight man cant keep Dorfmans madcap characters in orbit sending an already mismanaged ensemble into all-out chaos. For reasons too convoluted to dignify with an explanation low-level publishing lackey Kutcher agrees to housesit for callous boss Terence Stamp hoping the gesture will help land him a big promotion and get him closer to Stamps daughter Reid. Left with simple instructions to care for Stamps pet owl and not allow anyone into his immaculate house Kutcher immediately bungles when uninvited guests come out of the woodwork. The chief offenders are Shannon a disgruntled ex-employee who brings her friends (Electra and David Koechner) along to party and Stamps estranged son Andy Richter a former drug dealer on the run from lowlife thug Michael Madsen. The sleepy owl meanwhile doesnt react well after drinking from a toilet bowl laced with cocaine. The misunderstandings in My Bosss Daughter cascade from Kutcher picking up a discarded briefcase and having it open to a gay mens magazine which of course gives Reid the wrong idea. From there the gags and characters follow in the same what-were-they-smoking randomness the coke-addled owl a girl-next-door type with a bleeding head wound an elderly neighbor who carries Evander Holyfields ear in a bag a blind paraplegic who brags about his erections and a JFK conspiracy theory centered on Desi Arnaz. Of course throwaway bits have been Zuckers stock-in-trade in joke-a-second films such as Airplane Top Secret and The Naked Gun but his sense of timing has evaporated. The only real physical comedy in My Bosss Daughter comes from Zucker Dorfman and Kutcher stumbling over each other but its unlikely anyone will laugh.

Story of a misunderstood young man getting in a mess when he housesits for his boss is as old as Harold Lloyds two-reelers but director David Zucker a master of whacked-out visual comedy during his ""Airplane"" era drops the ball here. Comedys cardinal rule is never make it look hard but that wisdom is ignored in ""My Bosss Daughter."" Story of a misunderstood young man getting in a mess when he housesits for his boss is as old as Harold Lloyds two-reelers but director David Zucker a master of whacked-out visual comedy during his ""Airplane"" era drops the ball here. The long delay from lensing to release (sans advanced screenings for critics) provides a bit of good timing given star Ashton Kutchers recent media-driven fame but B.O. boost will be limited to opening weekend with a fair stay in vid houses following. In voiceover young Tom Stansfield (Kutcher) explains that he works as a researcher at a big Chicago publishing house but really wants to be in the creative department. Egged on by pal Paul (Jon Abrahams) to say something to Lisa (Tara Reid) daughter of the company boss Tom manages to give her the incorrect hint that hes gay. Meanwhile Lisas father Jack Taylor (Terence Stamp) the firms intimidating topper fires his secretary Audrey (Molly Shannon) for making undrinkable coffee. Key misunderstanding happens when Lisa asks Tom to come to her house that night -- which he reads as a date and which she means as a favor to housesit while shes at a party and dad is away on business. When Tom arrives at the house Stamp turns Jacks grand tour of his immaculate mansion into an aria of command and control but even half-awake viewers will note the mines being laid for the innocent Tom -- from Jacks prized owl O.J. who must be fed two pills (one in the mouth one in the rectum) to the exquisite furnishings that mustnt be touched and the anal house rule that all visitors must replace their shoes for disposable surgery room booties. Yet even though David Dorfmans script establishes the conditions for farce with the entry of a series of unexpected visitors to the estate -- starting with Jacks disowned criminal son Red (Andy Richter) and Audrey coming to plead for her job back -- things quickly spin so far out of control that an entire peace-keeping force couldnt possibly restore order. Soon after Red comes T.J. (Michael Madsen) who then becomes a one-man wrecking (and peeing) crew. With Audrey comes her gaggle of friends who further trash the place in their witless attempts to capture O.J. who has flown away. One sure sign of a movie without a compass is how fine comic talents like Jeffrey Tambor (given curiously high billing) are wasted in throwaway roles while thesps of extremely limited comic range like Shannon have generous chunks of time. The low point for the cast seems to come when Madsen is reduced to urinating over the furniture but its actually later when Stamp is literally deluged in liquefied garbage and stuffed with a rat. Nonetheless the movie looks and sounds reasonably good particularly with Andrew Laws crucial and shiny production design.

Directed by David Zucker from a screenplay by Dave Dorfman. 85 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude and sex-related humor drug content and language. Several theaters. In a movie that will do nothing to advance his career in which hes asked to do little but transfer his goofy good-natured persona from ""That 70s Show"" onto the big screen Ashton Kutcher gives it his all and scores a few big laughs. Given that hes supposed to be playing straight man to a zany supporting cast in ""My Bosss Daughter"" its impressive to see him shoulder the burden of making the thing work. This modest little movie -- which wasnt screened for critics before opening day -- is almost enough to make you forget about Kutcher the celebrity whos famously dating Demi Moore. Instead ""My Bosss Daughter"" presents Kutcher as the too-pretty comic actor with a few solid sitcom-honed skills. He falls down and breaks furniture he gets caught with his pants down and he provides about a dozen variations on the incredulous reaction shot -- all funny. Kutcher is Tom Stansfield a frustrated employee of a publishing company lorded over by Jack Taylor (Terrence Stamp). Hes smitten by Jacks daughter Lisa (Tara Reid) and thrilled when she seems to be asking him out -- but really she just wants him to housesit so she can go to a party. Oh and both Jack and Lisa think Tom is gay. Let the hilarity begin -- sort of. Jack is more than a bit uptight about his house. Of course as soon as Tom is left alone there people start showing up and wrecking things including Lisas drug-dealing brother (Andy Richter) and a goon (Michael Madsen) hes doing business with; Jacks unstable former secretary (Molly Shannon) to whose firing Tom accidentally contributed; and for no reason Carmen Electra. Director David Zucker was part of the team that made ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" so youd think hed have things under control -- or better yet let them descend into gleeful madness. But his good-humored style doesnt jive with the barely-there script by Dave Dorfman (""Anger Management"") who seems influenced by the crueler comedy of the Farrelly brothers. Jokes about race and the disabled fall flat in part because theyre poorly executed in part because they seem out of place. The spectacularly unfunny supporting cast -- including Dave Foley Jeffrey Tambor and David Koechner -- doesnt help either. But luckily Kutcher is there to try to clean up the mess.

Out of devotion to her Tom agrees to house-sit Jacks mansion (and feed his pet owl) while the father is away on business and the daughter is out partying. Mayhem ensues of course and the worst of it is the utter abandon-all-hope trashing of the great ""Airplane"" and ""Police Squad"" tradition established yea decades ago by David Zucker who directs this mess like a substitute teacher soldiering through a days work for a days pay at a decertified school. A lot of unafraid comedians participate with manic sloppiness in the debacle - among them Molly Shannon Andy Richter Kenan Thompson Jeffrey Tambor Michael Madsen and for buoyancy Carmen Electra - yet never have the delicate calibrations that keep slapstick funny been so jammed leaving the six or seven people who see this in theaters to wonder what if? What if the script (by relative greenhorn David Dorfman who also wrote the more polished ""Anger Management"") were under the care of experienced comedy doctors? What if the leads had been played by stronger actors rather than two actor-shaped celebrities cast more for punchline interest than for punch? I await the bosss executive report at his earliest convenience to clear up this grievous matter.

Starring Ashton Kutcher Tara Reid Terrence Stamp Molly Shannon. Directed by David Zucker. (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Someday Ashton Kutcher will appear in a movie that justifies his ""hot"" status. ""My Bosss Daughter"" is not that movie. But at least we can see what Demi Moore sees in him. Kutcher helped by a slumming Terrence Stamp keeps this lousy comedy from complete disaster. The rare male beauty who lacks vanity onscreen -- think a young Rob Lowe without the self-awareness -- the warm winning Kutcher makes the transition to straight man after playing doofuses in ""That 70s Show"" ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" and ""Just Married."" If only the comedy around him were funnier. Released Friday without a screening for critics ""My Bosss Daughter"" tries screwball and gross-out comedy and fails on both counts. Director David Zucker one of the brothers who made ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"" has lost the crack timing of those movies. There are moments in ""Bosss Daughter"" where actors seem to be looking off camera for direction. Seriously. Through contrivances not worth going into Kutcher winds up house-sitting for his exacting boss a publishing magnate played with gusto by Stamp whose ice-blue eyes and tendency to chew on the word ""schedule"" (pronounced ""shedule"") would have any junior editor shaking in his boots. Make that medical booties since the publisher is so careful about guests tracking dirt into the house that he requires slip-on socks. Hes also particular about his pet owl and the owls food -- a cage of mice. Fans of slapstick comedy especially bad slapstick comedy know that both owl and rodents will roam free the second the boss leaves. Its also a safe bet that all sorts of eccentric types (read supporting actors looking for paychecks) will wander in to debase the house. Kutcher keeps his dignity throughout a hard thing to do with mice down ones pants. His good-guy character is exceptionally likable because hes nice to everybody not just the boss attractive daughter (Tara Reid) whos in the title but not in the movie much at all. Molly Shannon appears more often as the boss trashy secretary. But not even the reliable Shannon can squeeze laughs from this dud. When a fight erupts between the secretary and her roughneck beau he claims that hitting her with an open hand isnt abuse then tells her ""Youre no longer welcome in the double-wide."" Making fun of spousal abuse and poor people in the same bit would seem a new low until the jokes about disabled people. Bad taste is one thing -- like the Farrelly brothers the Zuckers are famous for it -- but it has to be warm and witty to succeed. Here the setups are flat and a bit sickening. Screenwriter David Dorfman also wrote ""Anger Management"" a bad movie dressed up by the star wattage of Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. As lively as they are supporting players Andy Richter Jeffrey Tambor and the always game Carmen Electra lack that kind of transformative power. The romantic angle might have worked better if Reid didnt look so ready to roll. Tanned and eyelinered as if about to dash out to meet the Hilton sisters at Nobu she doesnt read as a publishing executive but she does seem at home in a brief strip scene. Very little distinguishes her good girl from Electras bad girl except that Reid is a little more tan. Even her armpits have a healthy glow. ----------------------------------------------------------------This film contains gross-out humor nudity raw language.

Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG-13 (vulgar sex humor drugs profanity). At the Orpheum the Sutton the Chelsea others. BLAME it on Demi Moore. If it werent for her tabloid-baiting midlife fling with boy toy Ashton Kutcher Miramax wouldnt be inflicting ""My Bosss Daughter"" on paying audiences instead of say airline passengers who might well contemplate bailing out at 40000 feet. In this three-year-old brain-dead variant of ""Risky Business"" Kutcher - who receives a co-producer credit and wears a vaguely stunned expression throughout - plays Tom a researcher at a Chicago publishing house. To ingratiate himself with Lisa (Tara Reid) the daughter of his megalomaniac boss Jack (Terence Stamp) Tom volunteers to spend a night house-sitting their home and Jacks prized possession - which is not a Porsche but an owl named O.J. ""O.J. like the murderer?"" Tom asks. ""No O.J. like the football player O.J. Simpson"" Jack replies. Thems the jokes folks - presumably an inside joke at that since David Zucker credited with directing this mistake oversaw the real O.J. in three ""Police Squad"" movies before Simpsons retirement from show business. Actually a guest appearance by O.J. - which never comes in case you were wondering - might have brightened the dull proceedings. No sooner has Jack left town than Tom confronts a series of uninvited guests intent on wreaking havoc. They include Jacks disowned drug-dealer son Red (Andy Richter as Tara Reids brother which makes you wonder who their mother was) and a psychopathic killer (Michael Madsen) whos after Red. A low-rent former colleague of Toms (Molly Shannon) turns up with her friends (including Carmen Electra in for a wet T-shirt scene). The script credited to David Dorfman (""Anger Management"") futilely tries to find humor in Tom being mistakenly taken for Jewish and gay (pretty-boy Kutcher here wears almost as much makeup as Reid) and in a young woman with an oozing head wound. Even Kutchers staunchest fans will find little justification for enduring the witless ""My Bosss Daughter"" - unless theyre dying for glimpses of Stamps and Richters backsides in the same movie.

"Kutchers up to the task at hand in My Bosss Daughter - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Kutchers up to the task at hand in My Bosss DaughterThe appealing actor doesnt stretch much but he delivers another innocuous treat.August 25 2003|Kevin Crust | Times Staff Writer After a summer of being plastered on every magazine cover this side of the Economist enjoying a splashy tabloid romance with Demi Moore and scoring a modest hit with ""Just Married"" earlier this year Ashton Kutcher has become a face to be reckoned with.His high exposure makes it all the more odd that Dimension Films has consigned Kutchers new film ""My Bosss Daughter"" to the literal dog days of August and because it was unavailable for pre-release preview ""Daughter"" gets lumped in with another orphaned film ""Marci X"" on the cinematic slag heap of Monday morning reviews.The thing is ""My Bosss Daughter"" is not awful. It is a genial youth comedy that serves Kutcher well as a vehicle. Thats it. Thats all it tries to be.The film provides the actor no challenges to move to another level but neither will it disappoint his fans as he casually switches from his usually befuddled-but-sensitive self to more of a sensitive-but-befuddled persona.As Tom Stansfield a lowly researcher at a publishing company Kutcher becomes smitten with the daughter of the firms head Jack Taylor played with cold steely calm by Terence Stamp.Tom feels he could perform better in a more creative role but is intimidated by Jack. The daughter Lisa also works for the company but like Tom finds her artistic impulses stifled. The role is played by Tara Reid with whom it is easy to become smitten but who must be tired of playing object-of-affection roles.A series of misunderstandings leads to Tom housesitting for the Taylors while Jack goes away on business and Lisa attends a party. His main charge is caring for Jacks prize owl O.J.""Like the murderer?"" asks Tom. ""No like the football player"" replies Jack. (This is the first of way too many jokes on a gag that expired in 1995.)Once ensconced in the Taylor home Tom is besieged with uninvited guests. Red Taylor (Andy Richter) Jacks son and unknown to Tom the subject of a restraining order stops by to borrow the TV Guide and drop off an ominous package.Molly Shannon turns up as a receptionist Tom inadvertently got fired. Michael Madsen does a riff on the psychopaths hes played in such movies as ""Reservoir Dogs"" (come to think of it there is a gag about an ear).Inevitably O.J. gets loose; Shannons character Audrey enlists some friends (two of whom are Carmen Electra) to help locate the AWOL owl; Lisas distraught boyfriend arrives to hang out; and the house is basically destroyed.Tom must attempt to pull everything back together before Jack returns which obviously will happen earlier than it was supposed to.Maybe he should have never gone on that trip because Stamp is sorely missed. The actor brings a dead earnestness to the early scenes giving throwaway lines a sort of sadistic gravitas that yields the movies biggest laughs but creates a vacuum when he is off-screen. Regrettably when he does return the air seems to have been let out of his performance grounding him with the rest of the cast for the predictable finale.Directed by David Zucker of ""Airplane"" fame (and the upcoming ""Scary Movie 3"") and written by David Dorfman (""Anger Management"") the film thankfully reaches back to pre-Farrelly brothers levels of raunch.Thats not to say it isnt crass only that the vulgarities are more ""Bachelor Party"" than ""Dumb and Dumberer.""Its too early to tell whether Kutcher is the Rob Lowe or the Andrew McCarthy of his generation and although he has reportedly passed on a sequel to ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" hell be cashing residual checks from ""That 70s Show"" for years and also hosts a popular MTV prankster show called ""Punkd."" While the jury is still out on Kutcher who hasnt proved he can act hes yet to show he cant.`My Bosss DaughterMPAA rating PG-13 for crude and sex-related humor drug content and languageTimes guidelines Gross-out comedy with an 80s sensibilityAshton Kutcher...Tom StansfieldTara Reid...Lisa TaylorTerence Stamp...Jack TaylorMolly Shannon...Audrey BennettAndy Richter...Red TaylorA Gil Netter production a John Jacobs production released by Dimension Films.
