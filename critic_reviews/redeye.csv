Mostly set onboard a commercial airliner cruising at 30000 feet Red Eye takes a leaf out of Phone Booths directory by making a virtue of its tight parameters. It also shows that veteran horror director Craven can venture outside familiar genre territory and still deliver thrills and chills.Flying home after her grandmothers funeral workaholic hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls) realises that her cosy seat next to the superficially charming Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) is not a romantic coincidence but a deadly trap. Without alerting the flight crew or their fellow passengers Jackson quietly informs Lisa she is now part of a plot to assassinate the deputy director of Homeland Security who will be staying at her hotel the following day. Carl Ellsworths smart script and Cravens tight direction exploit not only the suspenseful situations but also the complex sexually tinged chemistry between the professional problem-solving Lisa and her ruthless manipulator. Murphy and McAdams give their best performances yet and theres some leavening humour from first-time actor Jayma Mays as ditzy trainee hotel manager Cynthia who becomes Lisas eyes and ears on the ground.  The psychological mind-games are played to the hilt the pressurised cabin air increases the edge-of-the-seat tension and the 85-minute flight time is gratifyingly short.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

By David Denby One way or another sex is always in the head. Its clear from the opening gag of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" that Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) the gentle fellow who finds himself in so unhappy a state in early middle age is not impotent. Anything but. Yet Andy is definitely a head case. His story goes something like this he got frightened when he was still green (we see an encounter with an eager teen-age girl who sports scary steel braces on her teeth) and thinking about his fear made him more frightened; years later his anxieties have snowballed so heavily that hes permanently flummoxed. He wont even go near a woman. One of the nice things about this lewd and funny hit comedy is that it springs its wildest most scabrous jokes from a recognizable male dilemma. Gentility not to mention sophistication and indirection has departed from our raucous culture forever but if we are going to have our comedies dirty they might as well be human too. The Dickensian moniker Stitzer with its suggestions of ""stiff"" ""zipper"" and ""stitched"" tells us what Steve Carell and Judd Apatow who wrote the movie together want us to think of their hero hes aroused but all locked up. Carell makes him a pleasant-looking guy with a too bright smile that flashes nervously a man who has more testosterone than he knows what to do with; his overexercised chest bristles with thick dark hair--its a jungle cry in itself. But Andys inhibitions go so deep that he cant say what he thinks about anything much less about sex; he clings to blandness as a kind of safety. The movie treats this modern Caspar Milquetoast tenderly theres really not much wrong with him except that hes missing the only heaven that God in his wisdom granted us on this earth. In the past thirty years or so ever since ""Saturday Night Live"" went on the air performers from late-night television have attempted to charge up the movies not always with happy results. Some of the comics and comedy writers who jumped from one medium to the other have landed on their heads turning out work that was gag-centered fitful and skittish (in both senses). Except for a few inspired sequences last years ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" which involved some of the same TV-based talents as ""Virgin"" was a klutzy mess. But Judd Apatow who produced ""Ron Burgundy"" directed this time and he has developed a rhythm that sustains a long movie. Much of the comedy is as coarse and obvious as a burlesque show and almost as foul-mouthed as ""The Aristocrats"" but within the broad license that Apatow allows himself he works with considerable delicacy psychological insight and a surprising sense of detail. ""Virgin"" may be a one-joke movie but a variety of comic styles get packed into the joke. Steve Carell (from ""The Daily Show"") is now about halfway between a TV comic doing traits and gags and a good actor who happens to be funny. Like all comics he trusts laughs and he makes Andy a mass of tics twitches and pratfalls. Here and there however a mans pained temperament steps out from behind the professional comics armature--a touch of wounded dignity of yearning for peace and quiet as well as for love. The only thing a forty-year-old virgin needs more than sex is to be left alone--thats why hes still a virgin. Carell understands that agonizing ambivalence. Apatow surrounds Carell with a large exuberant cast beginning with the actors who play Andys fellow-workers at a large San Fernando Valley electronics store--the gentle-giant bearded comedy writer Seth Rogen the speedball rapper and actor Romany Malco and the unpredictable Paul Rudd who has a crazy streak lurking behind his good looks and friendly smile. Andys friends want to help him find a girl; they are full of stupid schemes the point being of course that they are even more screwed up in their relations with women than he is and delusional as well. The group scenes with Carell and these noisy clowns were mainly improvised (the best takes were edited together) and theyre full of odd corners and curlicues--for instance a quasi-obscene phrase passed back and forth among them and elaborated into a kind of bizarre verbal monument that they all stare at in wonder. Each of these madcaps also gets a number of extravagant solo arias--Malco in particular lets loose a couple of sex rants so preposterous that he seems to have distilled them from the boasts of a dozen losers topping one another on street corners. Apatow appears to be a generous director and a great fan of comic talent. Elizabeth Banks and Leslie Mann have good bits as predatory women who terrify the hero and Jane Lynch as the tough boss at the electronics store who suddenly softens and takes a shine to Andy breaks into a tender Guatemalan love song--an unexpected gift and exquisitely sung too. ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin"" is a hit I would warrant because its truly dirty and truly romantic at the same time a combination thats very hard to pull off. The romantic part comes alive every time Catherine Keener is on the screen. Keener has a big smile and a husky laugh and shes warmer more welcoming than usual. She plays Andys new friend whos a real woman--that is shes loving and shes trouble too. The movie leaves us with the grateful realization that for a man love and trouble are worth having more than anything and it ends with a triumphant double coda that brings the jokes down to earth with a touch of sexual realism and then sends them off again with a flight of lyrical fantasy. Are we imitating them or are they imitating us? The hugely successful French documentary ""March of the Penguins"" yields itself so readily to anthropomorphic readings that its hard to say where bird ends and man begins. With a reassuring smack the penguins emerge one after another from the ocean and hit the ice. Its the first stage of what the movie presents as the routine annual sublime--the trek across seventy miles of Antarctic wasteland to the thick-iced mating ground. As they shuffle across the terrain with bowed shoulders the penguins look from the rear like shtetl Jews heading off to shul. Flopping to their bellies for greater speed they could be kids taking a wave on a surfboard. When male and female find a partner they stand with heads bowed before each other in what appears to be silent adoration. If we are moved are we experiencing what they are feeling or what we are feeling? After some demurely photographed funny stuff a baby is conceived. The egg is then transferred from mother to father and as the dad huddles for warmth with the other dads balancing his package on his toes the mom makes the long journey back to the water to eat returning when she is ready to feed her hungry chick. Such scrupulous and selfless devotion to children would not seem out of place in lacrosse-mom precincts like Glen Cove or Montclair. Yet heres the miracle the extreme coldness and clarity of the air and the translucent blues and searing whites of the landscape lend the ritual however mundane familial and instinct-driven an aspect of eternal splendor. And given the extreme difficulties that the filmmakers (led by Luc Jacquet) must have endured the entire moviemaking enterprise has an aura of heroism too. A perfect family movie a perfect date movie and one of the most eye-ravishing documentaries ever made. In 1967 the Italian director Elio Petri made a film called ""We Still Kill the Old Way."" Well the veteran American director Wes Craven still kills the old way too. His dandy little thriller ""Red Eye"" which is exactly eighty-five minutes long has been made with classical technique and bravura skill and its leaving moviegoers in a rare state of satisfaction. (The absence of people whizzing through the air on green wings or deliquescing into corpses and coming back to life again has been much appreciated.) When the beautiful young hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) gets picked up at the Dallas airport by a handsome fellow (Cillian Murphy) who jokes about his name--Jackson Rippner as in Jack the Ripper--were alerted to danger by his overfriendly manner and by the joke itself which would seem to be unnecessary if he werent trying to reassure Lisa of his harmlessness. But the screenwriter Carl Ellsworth doesnt tell us too much. He knows that for the audience the pleasure of this kind of filmmaking lies in taking the bait and then being slowly but inexorably reeled in. Cillian Murphy who has angelic looks that can turn sinister is one of the most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies and Rachel McAdams has large doll-like features that mask a surprising amount of calculation and rage. As Murphy sits down next to her on an airplane the movie turns into a complicated duel that depends on precise observation of physical detail and moment-by-moment continuity so closely calibrated that its impossible to find a wasted shot or an exaggerated emotion. Craven who made ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the ""Scream"" series has a slightly off-center wit. As Murphy and McAdams are engaged in a death struggle in the airplanes toilet a huffy stewardess disapproves of what she takes to be an inappropriate use of a public facility. The joke is almost worthy of Hitchcock.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Red Eye Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2005) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/red-eye-2005,200,redeye3,redeye,rogerebert
"Red Eye A Short Hop Of In-Flight Turbulence washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Correction to This Article An Aug. 19 Style section review of ""Red Eye"" misidentified actress Rachel McAdamss hair color in ""The Wedding Crashers."" She is a brunette in both films. Red Eye A Short Hop Of In-Flight Turbulence Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 19 2005 Sometimes movies are adjectives and sometimes theyre verbs. ""Red Eye"" is all verb. Thats not to say its great; its not. Maybe its not to say its good because its only sort of good. It is to say however that its nifty. Fast and furious and tightly focused and blessedly short at 85 minutes it recalls not so much todays bloated computer-crazed films but tighter melodramas of the 50s such as ""Narrow Margin"" and ""The Killer Is Loose."" It has the same attributes a small cast a compressed time frame a narrow compass of action a single dominant dramatic situation not much detail and such intensity that you dont notice its absurdities until later upon reflection. The situation An attractive young woman a Miami Beach hotel middle-manager takes the overnight flight from Dallas back to Miami. In the airport she meets and later on the flight she sits next to a handsome charming young man to whom shes attracted. But early into the flight he lays a trophy before her her fathers wallet. His pitch Use your authority in the hotel by phone to arrange that a certain incoming high-powered visitor be moved into a new suite (a seaside locale all the better for predation by Predator missile). If not her father now in the sights of a professional assassin will be killed. The decision assuming the young man is telling the truth (and he is) She must choose whether her father dies or some anonymous Important Man. She has a few hours to decide she can tell no one she has no apparent resources no way of reaching anybody. Tick tick tick goes the clock as clocks will. At first the actress Rachel McAdams seems like just another pretty face. She looked too much like Kate Beckinsale for my taste and I couldnt even remember her then a blonde in ""Wedding Crashers"" a very few weeks ago. But she does grow on you and in fact her initial blandness and the way in which under pressure it peels back to reveal resourcefulness grit and even warrior instinct may be one of the movies best moves. The director horror guy Wes Craven a competent pro has always shown a gift for dealing with actresses; witness his ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. He seems to get something out of McAdams that she didnt show in ""Crashers."" As for the bad boy in the aisle seat hes played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy who was equally creepy in ""Batman Begins"" earlier this year. His prime attraction as an actor isnt his pretty-boy looks but his huge dead blue eyes. These frozen orbs have a terrifying dullness to them signifying a soul without empathy or mercy and when he gets charming you see through it completely and in seconds. Hes convincing as a character of cute deportment and malicious will; I kept thinking how good hed be as novelist Patricia Highsmiths charming psycho Tom Ripley. (Matt Damon played him more tentatively in the movie version of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" John Malkovich more icily in ""Ripleys Game."") Needless to say there are many little glitches not that you notice until youre in the parking lot. For one Brian Cox -- the original Hannibal Lecter -- puts out the wrong vibe as Rachels father. Hes hardly sympathetic and his best thing as an actor like Malkovichs like Murphys is his lack of human center. Whats he doing in this role? Then gee once shes momentarily broken free of her captor why doesnt she tell the police? Is that so hard? And could he give her a knockout blow in a crowded plane so efficiently that . . . nobody would notice? And would she not be bruised terribly by such a thump? On and on it goes little imperfections which for some will ruin the film and for others more generous in their inclination to suspend disbelief not. So hungry for coherent thrills are most of us including myself that I suspect most will fit into the latter category. Red Eye (85 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for brutality and emotional intensity.

And is that really so bad? Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Wes Cravens ""Red Eye"" uses nothing more novel or innovative than the stock vocabulary of thrillers jolts that make you leap out of your seat or yell out loud (I did both at one point or another) or deliberately paced sequences where stalker and prey do a canny cat-and-mouse dance. Youll recognize every one of Cravens heirloom tropes -- and so what? Theyre the very source of the rippling pleasures the movie has to offer. With ""Red Eye"" Craven plays us like an orchestra of violins and most of the fun comes from our own recognition that were responding exactly as he wants us to. We fall for his tricks and then laugh at ourselves for doing so -- punkd ""Red Eye"" doesnt just stick to the basics -- it reminds us why they still matter. Rachel McAdams is Lisa a disarmingly together young woman with an important managers job at a big Miami hotel. Shes taking a night flight back home from Dallas where shes just attended her grandmothers funeral. The flight is delayed and partly owing to the communal spirit that sometimes settles over disgruntled air travelers she slips into a conversation with a striking-looking young man (Cillian Murphy) who as we figure out long before she does is trying his darnedest to seem completely normal. His name is Jackson and Lisa asks him if he goes by ""Jack"" for short. Not since he was a kid he tells her because his last name is -- wait for it -- Rippner. When she breezily remarks that it was a pretty cruel joke for his parents to play on him he responds agreeably ""Thats what I told them before I killed them."" And then he laughs showing a row of white teeth that look as if each one had been sent to prep school individually and Lisa laughs too. Jackson is -- wait for it -- not as he seems. But you already guessed that didnt you? Without being hiply self-referential ""Red Eye"" makes you feel as if youre both a step behind and a step ahead of it every moment. Craven uses simple details to make us squirmy things like the claustrophobic airlessness of airplane cabins and the fact that for the duration of your flight youre forced to share uncomfortably close quarters with people who might want to oh kill you. (Craven and his fine cinematographer Robert Yeoman give us a realistically cramped-looking cabin -- not one of these luxury-liner deals where three people can walk comfortably down the aisle carrying on a casual conversation. The filmmakers suggest confinement by means as simple as keeping McAdams and Murphy in medium shot so it looks as if theyre filling all the available space.) You Might Also Like The movie occasionally takes us out of that airliner and into the living room of Lisas dad (Brian Cox playing a nice guy for once) and best of all into the hotel where Lisa works. Shes left everything in the quivery hands of her nervous young assistant Cynthia (Jayma Mays in a wonderful movie debut). Cynthia isnt used to having to manage the hotel on her own and shes terrified of making a mistake. By the end of the movie shes stepped through hoops of fire with jittery aplomb. Shes a minor character who makes a big impact. In a movie like this where so much of the action takes place in such close quarters the actors faces take on heightened importance. McAdams is an alert fully alive actress and shes completely keyed in to the tone of the picture. Lisa has her weak moments and her spunky ones and McAdams plays everything along the spectrum with great relish. Murphy -- most recently seen as the Scarecrow in ""Batman Begins"" one of that movies only genuinely unnerving elements -- is her perfect match. For one thing his lips are almost as pillowy as hers are. And with his menacing china-blue eyes and pale 2 oclock stubble he manages to look both innocently newborn and barroom dissolute. These are faces that can sustain multiple tight closeups and they hold us tight too. Craven has built a long career from the 1972 ""Last House on the Left"" through ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the three ""Scream"" pictures. If you wanted to take the cynical view you could say that ""Red Eye"" is just another example of Cravens pulling all the right strings just so he can clean up at the bank. But I think ""Red Eye"" in all its dazzling obviousness is much subtler than that. Its an example of a filmmakers treating his audience like a living organism with a collective pulse -- and isnt that exactly what we are? When Craven says ""Jump"" we all do it at once and giggle at how easily weve fallen under the spell. The key is that Craven is laughing with us not at us.

The movie opens in the U.S. on Friday. NO ARCHIVES NO ... more Photo HO Wes Cravens overnight flight travels into creepier territory -- more Hitchcock than slasher 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Red Eye Drama. Starring Rachel McAdams Cillian Murphy Brian Cox and Jack Scalia. Directed by Wes Craven. (Rated PG-13 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Wes Craven takes his time setting up the airplane thriller ""Red Eye"" as if it were a Meg Ryan / Tom Hanks romantic comedy. Finally directing a horror film with no supernatural forces at work the creator of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" can savor the fact that he doesnt have to eviscerate anybody in the first 25 minutes. The destination is the land of subtlety and its a pleasant departure for the legendary horror director. Favoring precision filmmaking over cheap thrills with a vibe more Alfred Hitchcock than Freddy Krueger ""Red Eye"" establishes two intelligent characters and lets audiences sit back and enjoy an entertaining battle of brains and wills. Rachel McAdams plays Lisa Reisert a capable hotel manager returning to Miami on the evenings last flight. She meets handsome stranger Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) who seems perfect at first flirting harmlessly about her favorite cocktail and stepping in gallantly as another airport traveler gets out of line. When he turns evil after more than a quarter of the movie has been a scare-free jaunt the slow transformation makes the psychological fear-mongering at the center of ""Red Eye"" more horrifying and unnerving than all of Cravens ""Scream"" films combined. Both actors are excellent. Murphy is alternately charming creepy funny and imposing -- sometimes all four in the same scene. Hes the anti-Freddy committing most of his worst deeds with conversation yet still seeming capable of carrying out his worst threats. But this is the rare case in movies where the psychopath is upstaged by the victim. McAdams plays a heroine in the mold of Clarice from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and Maggie from ""Million Dollar Baby."" She never screams or acts like an idiot under pressure and when it comes time to fight back she swings for the fences. Sometimes with just a cell phone conversation McAdams sets up complex relationships with her movie father (Brian Cox playing a nice guy for once) co-workers and fellow passengers and the performance never seems false. Carl Ellsworths script is taut and filled with fun twists masking the shortcomings of the broader story. There are some logic-defying moments -- after the film is over youll be able to brainstorm 10 or 12 easier ways to accomplish the same evil plot -- and there are too many convenient accidents. At times ""Red Eye"" seems as if it were paid for with frequent flier miles. The one special effects scene is blatantly cheap and there are other low-budget distractions. (The worst idea Colby Donaldson from ""Survivor Australian Outback"" shows up in a speaking role.) But ""Red Eye"" never insults the audience. The movie is a pleasant surprise at the end of summer and an exciting detour from one of the most influential directors of horror films. -- Advisory This film contains profanity plenty of violence and frightening scenes involving air travel.

But frequent fliers who catch this suspense thriller will be impressed by how well it captures the tedium of airport delays and the protracted exhausting ordeal that air travel has become. Cillian Muprhy (left) plays the villain again this time Wes Cravens Red Eye. Rachel McAdams also stars as his chosen victim. Dreamworks Pictures The psychological horror elements might seem a bit far-fetched but theyre fun to watch because of the strong performances of Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy and the claustrophobic manner in which classic horror film director Wes Craven has shot the film. McAdams is Lisa an efficient hotel manager who travels regularly for work but hates to fly. Before boarding a late-night flight to Miami she makes the acquaintance of Jackson (Murphy) a charming if mysterious business flier. She joins him for a drink and tells him about her family. Hes a good listener but reveals little about himself. As it turns out Lisas assigned seat is next to Jacksons. When her nerves get the better of her during take-off Jackson politely gets Lisa talking. Relieved and grateful she interprets his efforts as thoughtful. They are anything but. About the movie Red Eye   1/2 (out of four) Stars Rachel McAdams Cillian Murphy Brian Cox Jack Scalia Director Wes Craven Distributor DreamWorks Running time 1 hour 25 minutes Rated PG-13 for some intense scenes of violence and language Opens Friday nationwide Fear of flying is nothing compared with the panic that comes over her as she learns Jacksons real identity and the part he wants her to play in his villainous plans. While theyre on the plane Red Eye is tense smart and nerve-wracking though not quite terrifying. The close quarters heighten the movies tension. McAdams plays her role with a blend of vulnerability and courage. The Irish-born Murphy pulls off a convincing American accent and a menacing manner. Consequently the first hour is entertaining and scary. But once the plane touches land things go downhill. The movie devolves into a by-the-book action flick. There are some highly unlikely slip-ups by Jackson. Even harder to swallow are the nearly superhuman maneuvers by Lisa who has endured Jacksons abuse and then turns the tables. Unfortunately Red Eye goes from being a powerful thriller to a far more predictable story of revenge.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post At the start of Wes Cravens visceral fast- paced thriller ""Red Eye"" the camera snoops around hotel manager Lisa Reiserts childhood home. Lisas father still lives there amid sheets of plastic and rooms under renovation. The only bedroom not getting the once over since her parents divorce is hers. Her room remains that awkward shrine adult kids wince at when they drop by. Theres a framed photo of a beaming Lisa in her cheerleader outfit another one where she wields a field hockey stick. Turns out a cheerleaders skills and at least the fortitude of the varsity field hockey player can be helpful in the swank hotel biz. As she heads for the airport Lisa (Rachel McAdams) fields questions from her nervous underling Cynthia (Jayma Mays with a nice dollop of ditz). Forget that shes returning on a red-eye flight from Dallas to Miami having just attended her grandmothers funeral. Duty calls on a cellphone. The more urgent issue is to make sure the security for the arrival of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security is set. It is. The lesser emergency - but dont tell them that - is that two regulars are unhappy with their accommodations. ""Red Eye"" is rife with well-observed moments of imperious fools the sort of badly behaved customers who browbeat concierges or torment airline staff at ticket counters. Having helped dispatch the former Lisa faces the latter at the airport. Only she has some backup. When she tries to dial down an irate passenger a handsome guy named Jack (Cillian Murphy) comes in with an effective assist. What began with a nice underplayed hint of a flirtation gets a boost when Lisa and Jack find themselves seated next to each other on the jet. One of the charms of this entertaining if minor fright flight are the details about airline travel From the irate jerk to the friendly encounters of strangers from the complaints of a flight attendant (Suzie Plakson) about pensions to the annoying banter of a guy teasing his jittery pal mercilessly about the plane crashing. Some passengers sleep the sleep of the dead as the jet shudders with the bumps. Others look anxious beneath the pinlight glow of their reading light. Note from a fellow traveler to anyone afraid of flying Craven doesnt once exploit that fear. Hes got bigger fears to tackle. Jack isnt who he seems. He begins a whispered self-satisfied confession about his role as an operative sent to persuade Lisa to move the Homeland Security honcho from one room to a suite with a view. In a space built for maximum claustrophobia Jack has the upper hand. He also has the wallet of Lisas father (Brian Cox) proof that they can kill him at will. The moral predicament Lisa faces recalls those ethics tests about doing wrong for the right reasons. And McAdams does a fine job of twisting us on the sharp horns of her dilemma. When she finds out the deputy will be traveling with his family her horror is palpable. Lisa and Jacks tense interactions unfolding in the recycled air of coach turns out to be a clash in managerial styles. Lisas more strategy-minded than Jack gives her credit for. Once the action touches down Jack is more emotionally driven than he pretends to be. No wonder Dr. Phil figures into the plot. Fans of two of televisions proud woman warriors wont be surprised that Lisa hails from the mind of Carl Ellsworth a writer on ""Xena Warrior Princess"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Part of the upgrade here is that Lisas not alone in fighting back. ""Red Eye"" is the first of two movies with heroes on flights gone awry. (""Flightplan"" starring Jodie Foster has a projected Sept. 23 release.) Its hard to ignore the 9/11 shadings. With a plot that includes terrorism homeland security and a plane Craven and Ellsworth arent pretending otherwise. Yet ""Red Eye"" isnt heavy. Briskly paced it takes less time than a flight from Denver to L.A. It may not be a classic but its way more satisfying than a mini-bag of pretzels and a soda.

"Improbable Red Eye never gets off the ground - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Improbable Red Eye never gets off the ground By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 19 2005 Red EyeDirected by Wes CravenWritten by Carl EllsworthStarring Rachel McAdams Cillian Murphy Brian CoxAt Boston Common Fenway suburbsRunning time 85 minutesRated PG-13 (intense sequences of violence language) 1/2In Wes Cravens Red Eye""Rachel McAdams that nice young lady so lusted after in The Notebook"" and Wedding Crashers"" plays a nice young lady who is forced to get in touch with the tough cookie she played in Mean Girls."" It takes a while and the wait is not really worth it. But thats not her fault. Red Eye"" is a one-trick action thriller that feels like a poor cousin of an episode of 24."" Call it 12.""McAdams plays Lisa an extremely efficient luxury hotel manager whos catching the red-eye flight to Miami where there is about to be trouble. Because the movie is meant as a work of suspense we must bide our time until the trouble is revealed. Meanwhile Lisa works her charms at the check-in defusing other passengers crises. Her aplomb and politesse catch the attention of the man behind her a thin bloke with stubble and a shaggy haircut. Hes played by Cillian Murphy the Irishman who was Scarecrow in Batman Begins.""Ominously in principle at least his character is called Jackson Rippner and after some casual flirting with Lisa on the way to the plane and in the cabin where they happen to be rowmates we find out why. The deputy secretary of homeland security is staying at Lisas hotel and unless she switches Rippner to the room of his choosing hell have her father (Brian Cox) killed. (The suite is the preferred target of a rocket launcher the size of a Civil War cannon perfect for firing through the holes in this tale.)After doing a lot of crying Lisa tries her best to furtively warn her fellow passengers that shes sitting next to a nut. Naturally nothing works. The movie is obligated to get well past the 45-minute mark although meeting that requirement cuts the plots credibility into thin deli slices. Whats left is a baloney sandwich with no surprises. There is the occasional overture to the Alfred Hitchcock combination of suspense and comedy mostly involving Lisas fellow passengers.But alas there is no subtext finesse or wit in Carl Ellsworths screenplay which aspires to be as fun to watch as a paperback potboiler is to read. For that the movie needs frills and Red Eye"" has virtually none. In the last act Murphy is entertainingly forced to wear an ascot and speak in a rasp committing what seems like a fey impression of Cravens Freddy Krueger. Youll have to see why for yourself.Otherwise I could tell you the entire plot and spoil nothing. It doesnt bend or twist or wink. Once the plane lands the movie becomes a series of foot chases that ends exactly as weve been trained to expect. But not from Craven who over four decades has built a sterling reputation on cheek irony and the grotesque one that hes had a tough time living up to since he completed his Scream"" trilogy five years ago. His last movie a werewolf comedy-thriller called Cursed"" was half-hearted self-parody.On film Craven has already dismantled himself his Nightmare on Elm Street"" series and in the Scream"" movies the teen slasher genre that put him on the map. But his brilliance was costly. At 66 Craven seems to have forgotten that he would still have to work even after hed murdered his beloved genre so effectively. He should start looking into reincarnation. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Red Eye First Class Tension washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Red Eye First Class Tension Hes not asking for more peanuts. Jackson (Cillian Murphy) wants Lisa (Rachel McAdams) to make it easier for his colleagues to pull off an assassination attempt. (Dreamworks Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 19 2005 WES CRAVEN the man who gave us Freddy Kruger a villain with a face like chewed-up bubble gum and a set of Ginsu knives for a hand has a new villain to haunt your nightmares but this one has the sapphire-blue eyes and baby-soft stubble of a boy-band singer. As Jackson Rippner the impossibly pretty sweet-talking bad guy of ""Red Eye"" Cravens taut airplane-set thriller Cillian Murphy goes from charming to creepy in about three seconds -- just as soon as the plane hes on has left the runway and the woman sitting next to him has nowhere to run. Up until then hes been simply dreamy dazzling his seat-mate Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) with his gallantry and shy boyish smile which hes been flashing ever since the two first bumped into each other -- far from coincidentally as it happens -- while standing in the ticket line. Before long Lisas going to wish shed been assigned the seat next to the crying baby or the guy with the pad Thai noodles hanging out of his mouth. Anyone but Jackson Rippner whose name (if its his real one) isnt the only thing that evokes the famous serial killer. In short order Jackson who describes himself innocuously as a ""manager"" has made it clear to Lisa that he needs something from her and that he will go to great lengths to get it. Pick up the phone he tells Lisa who runs the front desk of a five-star hotel in Miami and tell your underling Cynthia (Jayma Mays) to transfer the room assignment of a particular VIP guest (Jack Scalia). Do it now Jackson coos and Ill call off the hit man whos sitting outside your daddys house cleaning his silencer. The thing is the reason for the room change isnt because the toilets backed up as Lisa tells Cynthia but so that several of Jacksons associates can get a better shot at the man who just so happens to be deputy secretary of Homeland Security with their surface-to-air missile. Talk about turbulence. A simple setup and one made all the more intense by the fact that the main characters are stuck inside a metal can several thousand feet in the air with not much room to maneuver except psychologically. That and the fact that Lisa unlike most movie damsels in distress is one smart tough and resourceful cookie make ""Red Eye"" a gripping suspenseful journey over what is essentially a well-traveled route. Working from a script from first-time feature screenwriter Carl Ellsworth (whose previous writing credits include such you-go-girl TV fare as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Xena Warrior Princess"") Craven is in top form here masterfully orchestrating the cat-and-mouse mind games played by Lisa and Jackson. In fact ""Red Eye"" is at its best when it has nowhere to go except inside the characters heads. The films final reel set in Miami after the plane has landed and Lisa must scramble to fix what she has fouled up actually suffers -- if only in a small way -- from the loss of cabin pressure. If the films coda feels more familiar to fans of Cravens oeuvre its because by opening up the action to car-chase-and-boogeyman-in-the-bathroom territory hes traveling down an even more well-trodden road. But thats a small quibble about a movie that like its heroine is lithe limber and quick-thinking. Like a triple latte from the airport Starbucks ""Red Eye"" will keep you awake jittery and perched on the edge of your seat for pretty much the entire flight.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red-eye ) Red Eye (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Red Eye belongs to the genre in which a director attempts to sustain a heightened level of suspense for long enough that the audience will not notice how incredibly stupid the screenplay is. Alfred Hitchcock was a master at this - although some of the scripts he worked with were masterpieces one could argue that his true skill as a filmmaker was evident with those that werent. More recently Phone Booth and Cellular achieved success by doing as much as possible with a thin and implausible premise. Wes Cravens Red Eye is more of a mixed bag. There are stretches during the course of this 85-minute long motion picture when the director elevates the tension to an acceptable plateau but there are also occasions when too much of the narrative seeps through and we see the seams in the storytelling. Red Eye introduces us to Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) who is stuck in a Texas airport on one of those days when weather issues make travel more of a trial than usual. After Lisas regularly scheduled flight to Miami is canceled she snags a seat on the red eye then settles down with her cell phone to wait. Business intrudes as Lisas fill-in at a swank Florida hotel calls with an urgent need for advice. Apparently although Lisa appears to be little more than a glorified receptionist shes the most trusted person at the multi-million dollar hotel and nothing can get done without her. But I digressa| A suave international type with the unlikely name of Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) chats up Lisa in the airport lounge then lo and behold ends up in the seat next to her on the plane. At first Lisa cant decide whether or not shes attracted to him but after the plane takes off and they start having a heart-to-heart she discovers that the stomach-lurching turbulence the plane is enduring is a minor irritant compared to the dilemma she is about to face. Red Eye is divided into three clearly identifiable acts. The first is setup. The second feels like more setup but is actually the meat of the story. And the third is where all the good stuff occurs. Unfortunately that means viewers have to sit through nearly an hours worth of material before Craven starts ratcheting up the tension. The final 30 minutes are taut and by then the adrenaline is flowing but Red Eye takes too long to come up to speed. Consequently the payoff - such as it is - is brief (although satisfactory). The movie starts out by trying to fool us into believing were going to watch an airport-based romance but there are a couple of clues that this is a red herring. In the first place its hard to imagine Cillian Murphy as a romantic lead. The guy is too creepy. Thats like making a love story starring Crispin Glover or Peter Lorre. Then theres the director. Wes Craven does not make romantic movies unless its about the tender kiss between a serrated knife and a jugular. Excepting the mainstream misfire Music of the Heart Craven has remained a genre director and that genre has nothing to do with love. Red Eyes problems arise not only from the protracted airport scenes but from the lack of tension while the characters are seated next to each other. We learn that Lisas life is not in immediate danger (although her ground-bound fathers is) which dampens the excitement of what transpires. Plus theres a limit to what can happen in a crowded plane without raising the suspicion of other passengers. Once the plane has landed however possibilities open up and Craven takes advantage of them. Suddenly Lisa is in mortal danger Jackson has given up all pretense of being cultured (hes into full psycho mode) and things start happening at a rapid clip. Rachel McAdams continues to expand her range on her climb to what will likely be A-list status. (Shes too good and too attractive to end up elsewhere.) In her last three movies she has appeared in a romantic comedy (Wedding Crashers) a romantic drama (The Notebook) and a satire (Mean Girls). Now she can add ""Wes Craven thriller"" to her resume. Cillian Murphy is exactly what we would expect from a guy named Jackson Rippner. He previously appeared with a burlap sack over his head as Scarecrow in Batman Begins and Im awaiting his inevitable collaboration with David Lynch. (How is not possible that such a strange director and strange actor could not work together at some point?) The only other cast member with significant time is the highly respected British actor Brian Cox and he probably showed up for about a weeks worth of filming. As Lisas dad he spends most of his time sipping tea and talking to her on the phone. As B-movies go Red Eye acceptable although its probably better as video or TV fare than as a theatrical experience. Because of the attention lavished on setup and exposition during the first half the film stumbles out of the starting gate and it seems like more than 25 minutes have passed before the planes wheels leave the ground. Nevertheless there are enough thrills during the final third to give Red Eye viewers a few of Cravens patented jolts near the end. But it requires forbearance for both a silly script and uneven pacing to get to that point.

And the movie takes off and lands in a trim 85 minutes the perfect length with no changing planes. Super-cutie Rachel McAdams plays Lisa a super-competent people-pleasing luxury hotel manager whos flying home to Miami after her grandmothers funeral. McAdams had to deal with Owen Wilsons adorable subterfuge in Wedding Crashers but its nothing compared to what she gets from Cillian Murphy as someone who calls himself Jack Rippner. Advertisement Murphy is the guy who battled viral zombies in 28 Days Later and put a gas-spewing bag over his head in Batman Begins. With his pallor cut-glass cheekbones and glazed blue eyes hes right on the border between dreamboat and spooky freak. He and Lisa meet cute in the ticket line when he defends a harried agent from an impatient blowhard cute again when they share Bay Breeze cocktails at the bar and cute once more when it turns out he has the seat next to hers on the plane. He jokes that shes stalking him. Heh-heh. You wont hear from me what happens next--only that the flatness of the setup is nicely creepy and that it gets even creepier once Rippner makes his intentions plain. I will say that a hawkish (but heroic) homeland security chief is in peril and so is Lisas dad played by Brian Cox--who has dropped some weight and thanks to an odd brown thatch some years. Theres a theme here having to do with Lisa being too much of a super-competent people-pleaser to stand up for herself in a crisis. But this is the sort of thriller that really comes down to the teasing use of props and characters-as-props a pen a book a friendly old lady a curious little girl a plane phone a cell phone. On the edge of a people-mover Craven serves up a low-angle shot thats a masterpiece of composition and theres no loss of momentum in the more conventional climax. Yes its the same old stalking-killer-with-a-knife bit. But this is Wes Craven of Scream and Scream 2 and--oh yeah--Scream 3 and Wes knows from stalking-killer-with-a-knife scenes. He must have already used every ""Boo"" setup imaginable and he still comes up with a couple of new ones to make you jump. What a treat. When Red Eye is all over youll probably look back--over steak tips and margaritas at the Applebees next door--and wonder just what made your stomach juices slosh around in your throat. And youll have another margarita. Virginity optional Advertisement At this time in August when many of us are too dazed and sunburned to jump through intellectual hoops the next best thing to a terrific empty multiplex thriller is a terrific empty multiplex sex comedy. But if you want a good time with The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Universal) youll have to--in the words of another sex-crazed dork Jon Lovitz--""Low-er your stan-dards."" Certainly the writer-director Judd Apatow and the writer-star Steve Carell have lowered theirs. Apatow was a force on The Larry Sanders Show and Freaks and Geeks; Carell was a hoot on The Daily Show and even carried the ill-advised Americanization of The Office. But when brilliant TV-comedy guys do big-studio multiplex movies they put on their stupid hats. Carell is Andy an everlasting adolescent who lives among vintage monster models and other geeky bric-a-brac. When he gets up to pee in the morning theres very visible evidence that (to quote the script) you dont lose it if you dont use it. Quite the reverse. But at home Andy lives in a world of private audio-video fantasy and he works in an audio-video superstore where no one pays much attention to him. Too bad Apatow makes so little of the private audiovisual culture that feeds Andys masturbatory single life. There could have been a mini essay here on how easy it is to be a 40-year-old virgin when you have so many outlets for fantasy. When his co-workers need a fifth for poker they enlist this dull stockroom nerd and end up trading obnoxious and disgusting stories about their sex lives. Thats when all eyes turn to Andy and well his description of the feel of a womans breast doesnt quite have the ring of authenticity. Advertisement Carells jittery white-guy anti-hipness is amusing but the character doesnt track. First Andy is a half-bordering-on-quarter-wit who doesnt even know how a condom works and then hes a savvy charmer. He could certainly contain multitudes but it seems more likely that Carell (and Apatow) were too impatient (and proud?) to ring endless variations on his cretinousness or come up with yet more sadistic sight sags. (The requisite pain set piece here revolves around a hairy chest waxing and ejaculatory expletives.) They also follow studio dictates and edge The 40-Year-Old Virgin into the realm of the corny and sincere. Catherine Keener shows up as a been-around-the-block mom who for no discernible reason instantly falls for Andy. This could be the movies can-you-top-this absurdity but Keener is such a smart grounded and soulful actress that she makes you believe it. She even makes you believe that it wouldnt be so bad to lose ones virginity at 40 if you could lose it to her. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is too long too sexist and too--shall we say--flaccid. But it has its moments. The big bushy comic Seth Rogen  is hilariously matter-of-fact as he details assorted acts of sex and bestiality. And theres a riotous sequence in which Andys buddies introduce him to a surefire conquest--an outrageous alcoholic played to the hilt by Leslie Mann (the wife of the director). She and Andy climb into her car for the ultimate Dont Try This at Home Kids drunk-driving scene. Even Cillian Murphy would abandon all hope with this babe.

Corrections were made to this review on August 15 2005. Departing less from his horror bailiwick than he did with ""Music of the Heart"" in 1999 Wes Craven retains shocks but dispenses with scares in the negligible ""Red Eye."" A virtual two-hander for the ever-engaging Rachel McAdams as a senior hotel staffer and Cillian Murphy as a hired killer holding her hostage on a Dallas-Miami overnight flight pic generates tension that rises and falls fitfully on its way toward a climax suitable only for a farce. The post-9/11 residue and gal-in-distress pressure could draw a strong female aud in opening frame but a nonstop vid landing isnt far off. As the aptly named ""Cursed"" demonstrated earlier this year Craven needed a respite from his favorite genre and he found one in tyro screenwriter Carl Ellsworths script (based on a story hatched during college days with Dan Foos) playing off collective fears of flying and conspiracies against government Homeland Security officials. But while solid basic thriller elements are in plain sight their arrangement and certain storytelling basics -- including an unnecessarily extended opening an extra-talky middle and a risibly impossible conclusion -- prevent ""Red Eye"" from tapping into zeitgeist paranoia. An extremely short playing time of 76 minutes with the estimable Brian Cox in a secondary role with minimal dialogue suggest a film that has been pruned if not as massively reworked as was ""Cursed."" The mysterious theft of a wallet sets an enticing opening note and its connection to Lisa (McAdams) an efficient front-desk official at Miamis swank Lux Atlantic hotel is considerably delayed given pics brevity. Arriving at Dallas-Fort Worth airport she briskly fields calls from stressed-out assistant Cynthia (Jayma Mays) and her lonely father (Cox) three years divorced from her mom. The way Lisa juggles cell calls sends a clear message If she can handle call waiting she can handle anything. A seeming gentleman (Murphy) comes to her defense during a verbal tussle in a flight-delayed line but one look into his piercing blue -- not red -- eyes bluntly announces trouble. More suspiciously Lisa soon finds him sitting right next to her on the plane and alarm bells go off with the revelation of his name Jackson Rippner. Or they should but since Lisa is trained to stay cool under fire (despite her fear of flying in general) she stays in her coach seat. Bad mistake. Within minutes of takeoff Rippner has Lisa under his quiet but firm control telling her that unless she phones Cynthia to reassign visiting Homeland Security director Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia) and his family to another suite in the Lux Atlantic her father will be killed by Rippners partner currently watching his home. Subsequent 40 minutes pit Rippner against Lisa as she tries to slip SOS messages out under his watchful eye. ""Red-Eye"" relies on hoodwinking an audience with its tension so that the sheer illogic of the conspiracy plot can slip by without detection. But there isnt enough on screen for the strategy to work not even watching the increasingly impressive McAdams as she finds new and interesting ways of silently projecting fear. Indeed Murphys broad and obvious telegraphing of his bad guys intentions only draws attention back to the storys inane details Keefe supposedly cant be assassinated in suite X but can be in suite Y. After reams of dialogue the two actors must go on what is certainly the most ridiculous movie chase through an airport since -- well the advent of Homeland Security -- and then all the way back to Lisas fathers home. Cravens fine eye for staging characters in domestic settings makes this routine flurry of action down hallways and staircases and around corners feel gripping. Its a case of a skilled helmer using anamorphic widescreen to get the most out of very little. As clean and technically well-crafted as any of Cravens higher-budget horror romps pic looks a bit cheap only in certain cutaway visual-effects moments. Key coach cabin set piece is an exceptionally detailed and -- when bumping in the bad weather -- realistic element in Bruce Alan Millers production design.
