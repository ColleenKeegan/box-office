Entertainment Theres A Lot Missing From Johnny Depp And Tom Hardys Gangster Movies The actors make impressive crime bosses but Black Mass and Legend cant get into the heads of their showy mobsters. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Johnny Depp in Black Mass. Warner Bros. ID 6905900 Theres no way of knowing for sure how many guys have gotten into the acting business with dreams of playing a gangster but my gut tells me its roughly 1000% of them. Gangster stories just occupy such a significant swath of space in that coveted territory between ""classic"" and ""cool."" The Godfather Goodfellas Reservoir Dogs Scarface and others arent just movies people might want to watch but ones theyre told they should. The greatest of these (inevitably) men arent just swaggering macho fantasy figures theyre complicated characters whose journeys undermine the very glamorization that makes them so alluring. The indulgent worst of them are usually at least still bad boys in good suits. Gangster may only rarely be an iconic role but its always a showy one.But showy and blood-splattered isnt enough -- a movie needs more to it than just a dude playing a kingpin no matter how good he is at it. Black Mass the new film starring Johnny Depp and Legend the new film starring Tom Hardy have more in common than just being two based-on-a-true-story crime lord flicks; theyre movies that seem to have all the stuff of potential greatness including attention-grabbing central performances and source material filled with outsize misdeeds. But theyre laborious and leaden showing little grasp of what might actually be compelling about the dangerous charismatic men theyre chronicling. Even notorious criminals can be boring in the wrong hands. View this image > Depp in Black Mass. Warner Bros. ID 6905918 Black Mass is all about James ""Whitey"" Bulger whos now living out his remaining days in prison in Florida after more than a decade on the FBIs Ten Most Wanted list and who headed up organized crime in Boston while informing on his rivals to the FBI. Depp who could use a rebound after a bunch of mustache-twirling roles settles into the part of the fortysomething Whitey with an almost visible relief. His is one of the better out of a range of some seriously stagey Boston accents though looks-wise hes almost as theatrical as he was in Dark Shadows especially with the vampire-light contacts.Whitey looks like a member of the undead but his life unfolds in enough unglamorous settings -- the seedy bar in which his gangs headquartered the surreptitious meetings at the docks the dinners with his mother -- to require Depp to keep both feet on the ground. It works well enough. While in danger of being oversold its certainly Depps best and most nuanced work in years.But Black Mass directed by Scott Cooper (Out of the Furnace) and written by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk cant figure Whitey out. Developments that seem important come and go without their mark on the man being clear. Whiteys only child dies and he seems sad about it but then its past and the woman (Dakota Johnson) he was with heads offscreen without another mention. Whiteys time in prison as a volunteer in LSD experiments is brought up and then let slip past. Whiteys brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) with whom hes close is (amazingly) a state senator but whether theres tension there is never explored -- Billy as much as we see him seems unruffled by his siblings murdering and racketeering his way around Boston. View this image > Edgerton in Black Mass. Warner Bros. ID 6905912 The films most significant relationship is between Whitey and John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) whos retained a sense of hero worship of the crime lord from when they were growing up together leading him to make some very bad decisions as a grown FBI agent. John woos Whitey whose ""no rats"" decrees dont extend to his own behavior into becoming an informant proclaiming an ""alliance"" but in practice just sheltering Whitey from prosecution.Whitey doesnt give a damn about John other than as a strategic source of information but John basks unhealthily in his proximity to the guy. Whitey doesnt change in any significant way over the course of Black Mass -- he just expands his territory. Its John who deludes and destroys himself out of toxic Southie loyalty and its John who really should have been the films focus from the beginning if it werent like the character too in love with the idea of its ice-blooded gangster.Everyone falls for Legends Ronnie and Reggie Kray too. Theres no use resisting the gangster twins who would have seemed over the top as fictional creations but they were real people rising up through the underworld of Swinging London while mingling with celebrities at their nightclub attaining their own sort of infamy. Theyve already been the subject of one movie with Spandau Ballets Gary and Martin Kemp playing the identical brothers. View this image > Hardy and Hardy in Legend. Universal Pictures ID 6905928 Legend which was written and directed by Brian Helgeland (42) places all of its trust in Tom Hardy who fills dual roles as Ronnie a gay man with schizophrenia and the suave straight Reggie. For a while his acting accomplishment is enough to marvel at by itself -- hes astoundingly good. Theyre both Hardy but the characters are so markedly different that thats easy to forget even when the movie arranges for the two to fight each other. Though it seems impossible somehow Reggie is handsome and Ronnie isnt. Reggies the slick outgoing one the people person liaising with the mafia and romancing Frances Shea (Emily Browning) the sister of one of his underlings. Ronnie has a psychotically violent streak but also a disarmingly homebodyish air -- hes someone equally poised to offer a cup of tea or smash the mug into someones head.Like Black Mass Legend chooses to start with its subjects having already done their crimes and some time and it follows them up the ladder and then back to their downfall without finding much resonance to them as people. Reggie and Ronnie are distinct beings onscreen but were told about their inseparability rather than shown it. Reggie toys with going straight at Francess urging while Ronnie has no desire for respectability but they never seem happier than when beating people up which makes that conflict a little less easy to invest in. And filtering the story through wan Frances who narrates the film places us on the outside of the Krays relationship. Legend makes clear in its title what it thinks of its twin subjects but looking up at your main characters that long makes your neck start to cramp. View this image > Legend Universal Pictures ID 6905933 Black Mass and Legend are both about murderers who are also good mamas boys dutifully stopping home for dinner and to be doted on. Their mobster protagonists are shown being greeted fondly as local heroes around the neighborhoods in which they grew up though not to the cops who also follow them around. And both films feature characters drawn into and then destroyed by that crime boss allure. These movies fit neatly into the gangster genre with all of its standard beats and actorly showboating but theyre empty inside. Its not actually that interesting or that soulful to watch someone go around beating the criminal world into submission if you dont know or care who they are.

By Anthony Lane Baltasar Kormakurs new movie is based on a 1996 expedition to the Himalayas.   Credit Illustration by Matt Taylor Climb every mountain. Such is the impulse that drives the dramatis personae of ""Everest"" who spend their days and their dollars tramping uphill until they run out of air. The bulk of the movie grounded in fact is set on and around Mt. Everest during an attempt on the summit in 1996. The man in charge is Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) who heads a company called Adventure Consultants. Leaving his pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) at home in New Zealand he leads a bunch of climbers to Nepal and onward to their destination--or as they might think of it their destiny. Theyre not rookies by any means but neither are they professionals and one strength of the film is the tension that springs from this uneasy status. If youre nearing the top and the clouds are closing in like an army and all your instincts are telling you to turn back but the fellow beside you has paid sixty-five thousand bucks and is damned if hes giving up now what do you do? The mountaineers are a mixed bag. We have Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a scrawny type who almost conquered Everest once before and who treats this effort like a high jumper as his final go. Asked what he does the rest of the time back in Seattle he says that he delivers mail. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is a Texan so mountain-mad that he hasnt even told his wife where he is just as a boozer will deny his presence at the bar. Then there is Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) who has climbed six of the Seven Summits (comprising the highest peak in each continent) and has left the tallest till last. Any of them could merit a whole movie as could Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) a friendly rival of Robs who is conducting his own clients toward the roof of the world. The one thing they all have in common I noticed is an indomitable urge to use the word ""summit"" as an intransitive verb. That takes guts. The dilemma of ""Everest"" is that the director Baltasar Kormakur cant quite decide which of these people--some brave some deluded others both--belongs at the heart of the tale. I wanted more of Boukreev (Ingvar Sigurdsson) who is so coolly acclimatized in body soul and breath that he can amble up the mountain without oxygen. Other viewers I suspect will be crestfallen to get so little Gyllenhaal for their money not only because hes the brightest star in the cast but because his dudeish character--the Imperturbable Snowman shaggy but chilled first seen sunbathing at seventeen thousand feet--has so much more to give and therefore so much to lose. Just to add to the pile Knightley and Emily Watson who plays the coordinator at base camp are given substantial scenes on the telephone during which their expressions betray a dread of mortally bad news plus the intense concentration required to maintain a New Zealand accent. ""Everest"" in short suffers from the same problem as Everest overcrowding. If Rob and Scott join forces melding their groups for the climactic ascent its because of the crush on the slopes with not enough gaps in the roster to reach the top. There is plenty of material for tragedy here yet the impression given by the film is less one of suffering and sorrow than one of sheer implacability and we are left as it were with a caution never bank on any hero for long because Everest will glance at human beings with their baggage of presumption and dust them off like crumbs. At one point a small herd of them comes to a crevasse. A steel ladder only just long enough is placed across it. The spikes on their boots slip on the frozen rungs. Below waiting to eat them is the void. If that sounds almost unbearable to watch get this ""Everest"" is in 3-D. The high priest of ""Black Mass"" is James Bulger (Johnny Depp) who ran the Winter Hill Gang in Boston from the mid-nineteen-seventies until he went on the lam in 1995. The core of Scott Coopers film is the rapport between Bulger known as Whitey and an F.B.I. agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who under the shroud of night proposes that Bulger become an informant for the bureau. This entails a delicate balance of power Bulger will lead Connolly and his fellow-agents to the prize they crave the Mafia and in return Bulger will be left alone to run his rackets. He likes the arrangement. There are complications. Bulger has a brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is a state senator and the proximity of government to organized crime is though occasionally useful something to be handled with care. Closeness indeed is a running theme of the movie. Associates of Bulger like Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and Steve Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) become as time rolls by men who know too much and although its great if Bulger keeps you near and trusts you it also means that he can reach out and shoot you in the head. Then there is his wife (Dakota Johnson) and son (Luke Ryan)--an angelic kid who admits to having hit another boy at school. The mistake his father tells him was not the hitting but the presence of observers the moral being ""If nobody sees it it didnt happen."" That sermon over the breakfast table may be the best thing in the movie. Its funny plausible harmless yet spiky with hints of danger and it doesnt outstay its welcome. So much else in ""Black Mass"" bows beneath the weight of the lugubrious and the dialogue by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth strains too hard for earthiness ""Youve got two weeks. And thats fucking it."" The profanity far from toughening the line trips up the beat. At the other extreme we get to watch Bulger as he helps an old lady with her groceries. Please. As with Martin Scorseses ""The Departed"" which also prowled the Bostonian badlands the question is How much longer must we subscribe as moviegoers to the sentimental brotherhood of violence? In its pomp stretching from ""The Godfather"" to ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and concluding with ""The Sopranos"" such kinship was thrilling to behold and the marriage of family values to corporate corruption was performed with a flourish of dark wit. The protestations of allegiance in ""Black Mass"" however have the hollow sound of a rote ""The streets taught me that you give and you get loyalty from your friends. And loyalty means a lot to me."" That is Connolly who grew up in the same neighborhood as the Bulger boys explaining his modus vivendi to his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). You cannot miss the skeptical scorn on her face and its true that the female characters do their best to put the moral brakes on the men but theres no mistaking the movies obsession with that loyalty or the cunning with which many scenes are designed--even rigged--to show the criminal fraternity as a closed loop. Look at the streets for example. Theres nobody on them. Thugs cruise around either to meet with other thugs or to be pulled over by a cop bearing a message from opposing thugs or to allow the thug whos driving to beat the bejesus out of the thug in the passenger seat. Where are the shoppers? Where are the noncriminal citizens out for a walk? Are they really affected by the internal jousting of the Mob any more than they would be by doctrinal disputes within a church? We are told that the Winter Hill boys planned to wrestle control of the local vending machines away from the Italians. Whoo. So now you know if you bought a Snickers in Boston in 1981 chances are that some of it belonged to Whitey Bulger. What you get from ""Black Mass"" finally will depend on what you make of Johnny Depp. His hair is pale and thin like dry grass and combed back over his crown. The eyes of gelatinous blue seem barely to belong to him; maybe Whitey stole them from the sockets of a guy he didnt like. His thin-mouthed meanness is on constant display yet I felt not threatened or cowed so much as impressed by an actor giving a master class in threat. Its pure Oscar bait. The comparison here is with Cagney--another compact figure more ebullient but equally fond of hopping from one genre to another. Depp fans will be amazed to see him drop the sweet eccentricity of Jack Sparrow for the sake of Bulger the brute but Cagney was more of a piece the savage slugging in his Warner Bros. gangster flicks was meted out with the verve of a song-and-dance man. The hoofer was present in the hoodlum. When he bunched a fist at Loretta Young in ""Taxi"" (1932) then kissed her lifted her chin and lightly pushed her face aside the whole thing took under a dozen seconds but all of him was packed into that space whereas the comparable scene in ""Black Mass"" when Whitey issues a warning to Marianne stroking her cheek and turning the caress into a throttle goes on and on as if we were too dumb to get the point. The movie is often absorbing and skillfully played but along with its snarling hero it doesnt have much time for ordinary folk. By the end like Marianne we are left gasping for air.

Is Black Mass as great a film as say Goodfellas? No of course its not. Will some of its themes and formulations be familiar to moviegoers who have watched their share of mob cinema and of films set on the South Boston? Yes they will.Related Story 10 Great American Gangster Movies But for those willing to grant these (perhaps inevitable) allowances Black Mass is a very very good film. Directed by Scott Cooper and starring Johnny Depp the movie tells the true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger who rose to become the most powerful and ruthless crime lord in Boston thanks in large part to his ""alliance"" with the local branch of the FBI.The story--largely accurate though with occasional details rearranged--begins in the mid-1970s with the return to Boston of FBI Special Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Connolly a native of Southie had known and admired Bulger (Depp) while growing up and he soon sells his superiors on the idea of turning the crime boss into an FBI informant.The deal he offers Bulger is rather different in tone however The latter wont have to inform on any of his Irish partners in crime from Southie; instead hell merely help the Bureau take down the Patriarca crime family a Mafia outfit operating out of the North End--and as such a principal competitor of Bulgers own Winter Hill Gang. As Bulger describes it to one of his men ""Its a business opportunity to get the FBI to fight our wars against our enemies while they protect us and we do whatever the fuck we want."" The only catch Connolly stresses is that Bulger cant kill anyone.This detail of the arrangement is however flagrantly and repeatedly ignored by Bulger and his gang. As Bulger grows stronger Connolly and his partner (David Harbour) find themselves ever more deeply enmeshed to the point that they are working more for the crime lord than for the FBI doctoring records and tipping him off to threats from other agencies and their own informants more than one of whom wind up dead.For those willing to grant these (perhaps inevitable) allowances Black Mass is a very very good film.It is a grim and grisly ride and over its course Bulger is revealed to be a genuine psychopath. (It is perhaps worth noting here that while serving an earlier prison sentence Bulger participated in the CIAs MK-ULTRA program receiving dozens of doses of LSD and other drugs which he described as taking him to the ""depths of insanity."")The role is Depps best in many years and a welcome respite from the parade of prancing pseudo-villains--Mortdecai the Wolf Barnabas Collins Jack Sparrow Willy Wonka--to which he has devoted far too much of his career. Ashen-faced with a rotting tooth and deathly blue eyes (accomplished by means of remarkable hand-painted contacts) he looms and whispers like a Beantown Beelzebub. And if there are occasional echoes in his performance of Pacino De Niro Pesci and Nicholson (whose mob boss in The Departed was based in part on Bulger) they may be unavoidable and are in any case welcome.Edgertons Connolly makes for a nicely overheated contrast a local boy made good but all too eager to be made bad again. Slightly puffy and puffed-up when the movie begins he only grows more so as it unfolds. The supporting cast--featuring Kevin Bacon Dakota Johnson Corey Stoll Julianne Nicholson Peter Sarsgaard Juno Temple and Adam Scott--is exceptionally strong. But perhaps best of all are the actors who make up the rest of Bulgers crew fleshy and heavy-lidded as cuts of aged beef Jesse Plemons Rory Cochrane W. Earl Brown. Plemonss visage--the first we see in the film--is an especially evocative map of accumulated thuggery the kind of face Matt Damon might have if you dropped him head-first down a well and left him there for a month.Black Mass is a considerable step-up in scale for Cooper (Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace ) but his direction is neat and unfussy stylish without calling attention to itself. In a nice touch he uses the latter-day testimony of Bulgers old partners as an effective narrative device the feeble revenge of underlings grizzled used arrested utterly spent. The insufficiency of their revenge is only highlighted by Bulgers ultimate flight from justice in 1995. Occasionally spotted (perhaps) around the globe Bulger wasnt captured until 2011 in Santa Monica after 12 years in the number two spot on the FBIs Most Wanted List--behind Osama bin Laden.Despite its many strengths Black Mass has its missteps and omissions. The female characters (wife mistress hooker) are sorely underdeveloped and Benedict Cumberbatch who plays Bulgers brother the 18-year President of the Massachusetts State Senate Billy Bulger is never quite satisfyingly integrated into the central story. How did this fraternal bond between Bostons most powerful criminal and its most powerful politician play out? The disappointing truth is that they may be the only two human beings who know and neither is talking to filmmakers.Moreover there are two particular scenes--one recalling Pescis ""What do you mean Im funny?"" speech in Goodfellas and another reminiscent of Pacinos baptismal bloodletting in The Godfather--that are too specific in their homage and serve only to summon unflattering comparisons. Unlike those films Black Mass is not a classic of the genre. But such comparisons aside this is a case where it would be unwise to let the perfect be the enemy of the (very) good.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

"Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in Black Mass reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Johnny Depps Ice-Cold Whitey Bulger Is the Highlight of Black Mass Johnny Depps Ice-Cold Whitey Bulger Is the Highlight of Black Mass Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 18 2015 1218 PM Black Mass Johnny Depps ice-cold Whitey Bulger is the highlight of a solid Boston gangster movie. By Dana Stevens Johnny Depp in Black Mass. Photo by Warner Bros. Casting Johnny Depp as the fabled Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger didnt sound on paper like the most promising proposition. Depp tends to excel at and to revel in playing hyperstylized characters who exist in fanciful filmic worlds Hes perfectly at his ease as a vampire a pirate a blade-fingered freak or a singing demon barber but can seem uncomfortable inhabiting the skin of real-life people whether its a Prohibition-era gangster (Public Enemies) or a disco-era cocaine importer (Blow). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Black Mass a Bulger biopic directed by Scott Cooper is based on an all-too-true story about a decidedly unfanciful world the grim streets of South Boston during Bulgers criminal reign which ran from the mid-70s to the mid-90s. Yet Depps performance as Bulger is as strong and as energized as anything hes done on screen for years. (If theres any earlier Depp vehicle this movie resembles its the 1997 mob drama Donnie Brasco in which he gave a fine naturalistic performance as an undercover FBI agent cozying up to Al Pacinos sad-sack hit man.) After making a career for decades off his own inextinguishable charisma (with enough success that he now owns an island in the Bahamas) Depp has taken a role that allows him to examine charismas dark side--the unholy power that can accrue to people who know how to make others love them fear them and most chillingly obey them. Depps Jimmy Bulger (call him Whitey explains another character and you might get on his bad side--never a wise move) does have his share of vampire-like elements starting with a piercing ice-blue stare that comes courtesy of the creepiest contact lenses since Ray Millands in X The Man With X-Ray Eyes. But the character is neither written nor played as an over-the-top monster. Jimmys menace lies in his stillness his coldly assessing intelligence and his unpredictable and lightning-fast shifts between canny businessman and ruthless butcher. Advertisement It takes a while for Jimmy Bulger to emerge as Black Masss lead character--indeed you could argue that he never quite does given the near-equal importance to the narrative of Joel Edgertons John Connolly an FBI agent who grew up in the rough Southie neighborhood with Bulger as his friend and protector. Jimmy Bulger wasnt the only boy in his family to rise to a position of power His younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a Massachusetts state senator with ambitions to become something more. The story of how Jimmy Bulger went from small-time hood to Bostons top kingpin gets told from the points of view of multiple minor players all testifying against their former boss into a reel-to-reel recorder at a police station. Jesse Plemons who played a vile neo-Nazi thug in the last two seasons of Breaking Bad is the first of these narrators Bulgers dimwitted but loyal bodyguard and driver. The wonderful character actor Rory Cochrane plays Steve Flemmi Jimmys right-hand man whose eyes burn with repressed self-loathing as he commits unspeakable acts at his bosss behest. Peter Sarsgaard has a brief but memorable arc as a coke-addicted gun for hire. The true-life story of Bulger and Connollys long relationship might have been scripted for a gangster epic. (The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is based on a book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill former Boston Globe reporters.) Using his childhood bond with the Bulger brothers as a wedge Connolly prized his way into Jimmys inner circle eventually convincing him to become an FBI informant--not snitching on his own gang but on the Italian mafia that ruled the citys North End. For years Connolly and Bulger mutually profited from this arrangement Bulger was able to put the competition behind bars just as the drug trade was taking off rising to the top of the Boston underworld as a result. Connolly for his part was able to build his reputation at the bureau as a taker-down of bad guys while enjoying the spoils of the mob lifestyle decadent parties flashy suits gold watches. The heart of the movie lies in the friendship--and for all its complications and uneasy alliances it does amount to a real friendship of sorts--between the pugnacious but vulnerable lawman and the soft-spoken but death-dealing criminal. But there are other significant relationships as well like the strained loyalty between the two Bulger brothers each striving to succeed in his own racket one making the laws one breaking them. Or the deteriorating marriage of Connolly and his wife (Julianne Nicholson) whos not thrilled about the alleged murderers who gather to grill steaks on her back porch. Secondary characters with no more than a scene or two apiece--including Corey Stoll as an FBI higher-up and Juno Temple as a prostitute--leave a lasting impression. Top Comment Billy aka William Bulger went on to become the President of the University of Massachusetts.  Swear to god a ""Wheres Whitey?"" chant broke out at my college graduation in 2002.  More... Join In Though its directed by Cooper (Crazy Heart) with an able hand and a fair degree of visual style Black Mass cant be said to reinvent the gangster movie; it pulls tricks from Goodfellas The Godfather The Departed and a host of other sagas. But the movies ace in the hole is Depps performance as the psychotic but never inhuman Jimmy a man capable of returning from a long night of extortion and beatings to play an affectionate game of cards with his aged mother. He may never win our sympathy or understanding but he has a way--as criminals and movie stars will do--of capturing our complete attention.

Last years documentary Whitey United States of America v. James J. Bulger lacked only one element but that one was a doozy footage of its subject. ""Whitey"" Bulger (dont call him that to his face) might have been one of Bostons most notorious mobsters but the director Joe Berlinger had to rely on first- and secondhand reports of his demeanor to bring him to life -- and those reports didnt quite do the job. Whitey is also a void in Black Mass the new dramatized Bulger film. Johnny Depp makes a valiant stab at the part but even with his hair thinned and lightened and his face hardened Depp remains Depp I never forgot I was watching a big star doing an impersonation. Its as if the spirit of a psychopath like Bulger resists the camera. Or maybe the movie isnt imaginative enough to penetrate his shell. The script by Mark Mallouk and Jez ButterworthA (based on a book by former Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerald ONeill) uses a creaky framing device Captured Bulger associates tell an interrogator stories. Theres no tension between perspectives What were told is what there is to know. Its decent journalism -- one thing after another the major events ticked off -- but turgid dramaturgy. The director Scott Cooper (he made the Jeff Bridges alcoholism musical Crazy Heart) brings little to the material but good pacing and obvious fealty to his leading man. The actors in smaller roles have lived-in faces that help you suspend your disbelief but Boston-accent-affecting stars like Joel Edgerton (an Aussie) and Benedict Cumberbatch (a Brit) throw you out of the film. You learn stuff but you dont understand it. Theres no controlling idea. Despite his wobbly accent Edgerton isnt bad. His character FBI agent John Connolly is the movies dramatic fulcrum -- the only character with a real arc. What makes the Bulger story different from other gangster yarns is the peculiar alliance between Connolly and Whitey. They grew up in the same working-class neighborhood where Bulger was idolized -- even as a youth -- for his fearlessness. Connolly revered him too and reached out to ""Jimmy"" -- through Whiteys younger brother William (Cumberbatch) a legit Boston political force -- when Connolly returned from a Midwest posting. He wanted Whitey as an informant. He wanted the inside line on Whiteys ""business"" rivals the Italian mob. Black Mass is too shallow and clunky to bring out all the forces at work on Connollys psyche. He evidently saw a way to achieve instant status in the eyes of Whitey a childhood hero. He also saw a way to achieve instant status in the FBI with a source to beat all sources. He saw a way to make the bust of a lifetime -- the Angiulo brothers of the North Ends Patriarca family. Theres no indication that in the beginning he saw a way of getting rich although as money began flowing his way he did little to turn off the spigot. Theres no indication that he imagined himself in the beginning as an accessory to murder alerting Bulger to informants whom Whitey would subsequently eliminate. Its a story of how one compromise forces another and another -- a cautionary tale more interesting than Whiteys. Genuine -- clinical -- psychopaths arent really that interesting. Their motives are pure -- no pesky dramatic tensions. They have no empathy so they feel no guilt. They lie well enough to pass lie-detector tests -- confidently calmly. To Depps credit he doesnt soften the man try to find a bogus core of ""humanity."" He nails Bulgers watchfulness the way Bulger saw the world only in terms of power relationships. He has a couple of amazing scenes in which he feigns courtliness -- even empathy -- before he menaces or kills. One opposite Julianne Nicholson as Connollys increasingly repulsed wife is the movies highlight; when he strokes her face you can feel it on yours an inch from your throat. Depps integrity is impressive. But hes rusty. Superstardom borne of hambone impersonations and the overidealization of gonzo -- in the form of the late-life sybaritic Hunter S. Thompson and the late-life sybaritic Marlon Brando -- halted his evolution as an actor. (His Whitey looks like a sober Thompson.) Almost everything he does seems in quotation marks. Early in the film there are scenes with the mother (Dakota Johnson) of his child that threaten to show Whitey from another vantage but theyre largely there to make plot points and theres nothing in the film of Catherine Greig Bulgers companion in hiding for 16 years. Some of this wouldnt matter if Black Mass had been shaped with more cunning. (Why is it called Black Mass? Theres zero indication in the film itself.) A major major event centers on Deborah Hussey the mistress of Bulgers associate Steve Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) and Juno Temple hits a couple of touching notes in her brief screen time. But apart from a glimpse of Hussey early on we have no idea she even exists until Bulger decides shes a threat. Everything about her -- and Flemmis affection for her and the way in which Bulger keeps tabs on his associates personal lives -- is shoehorned into one potent but ill-prepared scene. Deborah we hardly knew ye. Lots of recognizable faces pop up among them Kevin Bacon as an officious FBI honcho and Adam Scott his undemonstrative underling. David Harbour has a few good quavery scenes as one of Connollys partners who knows more than he wants to about Whiteys murders and so does the ubiquitous Peter Sarsgaard as a putz who knows hes a dead man walking and desperately tries to rat Whitey out. Jesse Plemons of Friday Night Lights Breaking Bad and Fargo looks convincing as a Bulger functionary his nose extra-squashed. (The role isnt a stretch.) There are no real embarrassments apart from Cumberbatch. There are some British actors -- wonderful wonderful actors -- who simply cant sound American and the banks of the Neponset River are metaphorically lined with the corpses of those whove perished in their attempts to do South Boston accents. Cumberbatchs nasal head voice is not the worst Ive heard but its pretty close. Some critics have suggested that Black Mass is a Whitey-wash insofar as Depp makes Whitey seem utterly clueless of his own psychopathology. Id actually like to have seen that movie -- one that brought out the self-blindness of those we label ""evil."" But Black Mass doesnt risk that much. Its just the facts maam. And facts have a way of stopping at the waters edge just when you want to go deep.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 18 2015 Save for later Saved Black Mass stars Johnny Depp (r.) and Benedict Cumberbatch (l.). Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide In ""Black Mass"" Johnny Depp plays the notorious Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger and its nice seeing him give a real performance for a change after swashbuckling and mumbling his way through a series of clinkers. Despite a makeup job that with its high-domed forehead and slicked hair makes him resemble a Kabuki samurai he holds the screen as pure malevolence. The film itself directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth doesnt delve very deeply into Bulgers psyche which also means that Depps performance more often than not resembles a species of horror film monster. The attempts to ""humanize"" him as in the scenes with his doting mother or his young son are obvious sops for our sympathy. The filmmakers do a straightforward job of laying out the collusion between Bulger and the FBI which decimated the influence of the Mafia while allowing him to reign in Boston throughout the 70s and 80s until he was forced into hiding in 1994. (Joel Edgerton as the Bureaus John Connolly a boyhood friend of Bulgars growing up in South Boston is especially good). The mob hits and garish murders are swift and brutal and effectively staged.Whats missing is the high inspiration that set this films models - ""The Godfather"" movies and Scorsese gangster films and all the rest - above the usual mob movie fray. ""Black Mass"" is like a playlist of greatest hits from other better movies. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The chance to do something more than this was I think inherent in a conflict never realized here The relationship between Bulger and his upstanding brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch excellent) who served with distinction as the Massachusetts Senate president and later as the president of the University of Massachusetts. A movie that focused on those brotherly bonds might have ended up as more than a creditable knockoff.

The makers of Black Mass seem to understand that theyve got a prettiness problem with Depp. They also want to be careful that in dramatizing the dirty doings of James ""Whitey"" Bulger they dont romanticize him. To that end theyve given Depp pale skin tight enough that it could flake at the merest expression of much beyond menace. Bulgers thinned hair has been slicked back into a shell and his crooked teeth appear to cast shadows on themselves. When he laughs -- barely half a hand is required to count the times -- youre staring into a cave. The color has even left his eyes. When the light catches them they sparkle like fish scales. Despite recent evidence to the contrary -- think junk like Transcendence and Mortdecai -- Depp isnt an ""I just sent you a fax"" sort of actor. But the movie doesnt take any chances; it makes Bulgers monstrosity literal. He looks like a supervillain who never got to finish transitioning to evil. Bulger was apparently a psychopath but he didnt look like he was ready to wreak havoc in Avengers 6. But the hair and makeup are smart. Theyre used to set apart the bad from both the worst and everyone else. One evening not far into the movie Whitey pays a visit to his little old Irish lady of a mother (Mary Klug). They play gin and his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a state senator is there cooking her dinner. Youre searching the dining room for some sign of resemblance among these three and there is none. Cumberbatchs clammy but attentive beauty has nothing to do with the talking corpse at the head of the table. That doesnt feel accidental. Neither does the conception of Bulgers two closest henchmen Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) who here is rotund and baleful and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) whos got prosthetic-looking skin big hair and a dogs loyalty. They could be in Abbott and Costello Meet the Wolf Man. The movie focuses on the years Bulger worked as an FBI informant from the mid-1970s until he fled Boston in the mid-1990s. A slickster agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) seduces him into the role. At the time the feds wanted to rid the city of the Italian mafia and Connolly sells his reluctant bosses -- one is Charles McGuire played inevitably by Kevin Bacon -- on Bulger. A happy (and not entirely accidental) consequence of these consultations for Bulger was that the demise of the Italian mob cleared a path for his Winter Hill Gang to dominate not only the vending-machine racket but to run drugs and arms too. Connolly and another agent John Morris (David Harbour) reap the most intimate spoils in money and trips and time with Whitey but you get the sense that the men are just two prominent for-examples of corruption within the agency. As the years pass theres comedy in McGuires flipping his lid whenever he wants to bring charges against the Winter Hill guys but realizes he cant because Bulgers protected. Theres more in Connollys almost adolescent prevaricating about the turpitude of his source. I have to say the acting here is much stronger and more soulful than I would have expected and not only from Depp. Hes played so many of these walking zombies that its surprising hes found yet another way to do it the daylight bogeyman. Hes not out for sympathy. People blanched after a premiere screening in Boston this week when Depp tried to make what sounded like a case for Bulgers humanity. And that may be how Depp got through this part but whats onscreen is cold-blooded. Flemmi was as brutal as Bulger but I really like what Cochrane does with his body here. One of the darkest moments involves Bulger strangling to death someone Flemmi claims to care about. When its over Bulger makes Flemmi and Weeks dispose of the body and Cochrane darkens Flemmis demeanor which was never bright to begin with. Theres a part for Peter Sarsgaard as the sort of jittery disposable two-bit crook these movies always cough up. Sarsgaard is among the last actors youd cast in a part that requires him to say ""I make my living in the streets."" But hes so wrong that hes almost right. Meanwhile the women here have nothing to do but hang around houses and hospitals. But Dakota Johnson Juno Temple and especially Julianne Nicholson -- as a baby mama floozie-junkie and a long-suffering FBI wife respectively -- apply themselves to thankless canned roles of actual people. (Nicholsons accent works but like spoken palimpsest; as U.S. attorney Fred Wyshak Corey Stolls suggests a 51st state only he knows about.) Edgertons physicality takes the movie. When hes strutting and strolling around the office or virtually floating to heaven as a cluster of agents sit in a conference room listening to a mafioso incriminate himself or speaking in a treble accent that exists in Boston but that Ive never heard in a movie because the degree of difficulty is high its like hes inventing some new kind of machismo. Hes a bull-cock. Who knows where he found that accent (hes from Australia) but hes found one of the most entertaining performances Ive seen all year. And more than anyone else in Black Mass hes free to stay on a cloud since the movies depiction of Connollys employer is nothing short of scathing. The coolness and detached sense of horror that director Scott Cooper furnishes comes right from the source material the 2000 book Black Mass The Irish Mob the FBI and a Devils Deal by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill two former reporters for the Boston Globe. Most of the lighting is sepulchral and the pacing is funereal. Death is just about everywhere in this version of Boston which makes it close to almost every version of Boston filmed in the past dozen years. (The Heats an exception; its also a law-enforcement comedy.) The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi keeps its head lurking slowly to and fro. This is a leap forward for Cooper whose last movie was 2013s Out of the Furnace a testosterone-soaked tour de force of working-class phoniness. Hes decided to be a stylist -- which is something to be grateful for -- but Out of the Furnace was full of bad style. This time the declarative script which has been credited to Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk keeps the film on a moral tether. Theres only so far over the top his shotmaking can go before things turn glamorous before all of the allusions start rushing in. All the slow motion tracking moves and framing and wide and long shots are hauntingly descriptive In that strangulation sequence a shot in an apartment hallway with Bulger and his victim in the foreground slowly accommodates in the background one out-of-focus henchman then another. Takayanagi wants you to feel the sin. If youre going to dance with the devil the tune had better be a dirge.  Lionsgate It takes real balls to open your gangster movie in the same month that Martin Scorseses Goodfellas turns 25. But the sense of consequence of doom in Black Mass rebukes the high voltage and fun of Scorseses movie which is still an achievement of rhythm and tone. The camerawork and editing and framing still zing. The violence still shocks and time hasnt diminished the dread say of watching Karen Hill experience deep second thoughts about walking into an alley for a free coat -- no director has been more attuned to the importance of unnatural cinematic beats for even the possibility of murder. Even when you can anticipate a gun to the skull or a bag over the head youre surprised anyway. The movie remains this tremendous living breathing organism a fireman who turns out to be a stripper a jack springing from his box yeast. Its a classic but a distastefully besotted one. I could watch it every day of my life and thats not not a problem. Its unassailable as pop art but somewhat indefensible as a love story between a director and organized crime. But the level of stress at which this movie operates has never been topped by any crime opus and becomes its own form of caution. The movies legacy lingers quietly in some of the visual devices in Black Mass and boastfully shamefully on something like Narcos a show about the DEA and the Medellin cartel that began streaming last month on Netflix. Scorseses trapeze acts are tough to follow. Very few directors move the way he still can. He swings and pirouettes. Denis Villeneuve who also has a drug-war movie (Sicario) opening today pumps iron. Villeneuves movie is set on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border and tells the story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) whos been recruited by a beachy government asshole (Josh Brolin note-perfect) to help bring down a drug lord. On their side is a former prosecutor from Ciudad Juarez (Benicio Del Toro). Naturally the lady agent drowns in the moral murk while the dudes never lose sight of how the game is played. Looking like a man who has let go of himself as a survival tactic Del Toro really scares you. Hes got a speech at the end that points to the better movie this could have been. Aside from that performance and Roger Deakinss cinematography which is full of desert sizzle and searchlight-generated shadow Im not buying this movie; and Ive seen it twice. Mostly because Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan arent selling more than a tautological action movie with the dread and body count of a horror film. A friend and I were just saying about Villeneuve the other day that he really doesnt care what hes directing as long as it shows off his abs.  Universal Pictures Thats almost true of Baltasar Kormakur but he also seems capable of yoga or Krav Maga. Hes directed Everest which also opens today. (People the gym is crowded this week) Hes from Iceland and his Hollywood action thrillers include the enjoyably nasty Contraband and the proudly cynical 2 Guns. Written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy the movies based on the 1996 disaster at Mount Everest and was shot in 3-D and is worth seeing in that format. It puts you dizzyingly close to impossible vistas but also right beside staggering death. It has a cast that operates at just the right levels of starriness to be credible. Brolin John Hawkes Naoko Mori and Michael Kelly playing the journalist Jon Krakauer whose bestseller Into Thin Air was based on this trip are the civilian climbers. Jason Clarke is the New Zealander Rob Hall whose company is leading them up the mountain. Sam Worthington and Martin Henderson work with him. Emily Watson runs the base camp; Elizabeth Debicki is by her side as the camps physician. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hotdog leader of a rival expedition group and he acts with less mustard relish and sauerkraut than youd predict. And on wife duty are Keira Knightley (for Clarke) Down Under and in Texas Robin Wright (for Brolin). Knightleys character is pregnant. Wright wears some of the most atrocious clothes youre ever going to see -- even for mid-90s Texas. The film devotes the first half to preparation for the climb and most of the second to the disaster. Throughout the filmmakers keep you aware of the elevation and the time of day and how much reaching the summit means for the civilian climbers. Mick Audsleys editing proves as crucial to your absorption as what the daring cinematographer Salvatore Totino and the stunt and effects teams come up with. The toggling between the base and various points along the way to the summit becomes stressful then heartbreaking. Macho-ness doesnt preoccupy Kormakurs two other American films as much as money and the criminal motivation to acquire and spend it. Motivation starts to matter here just less crudely and more majestically. Within 30 minutes of everyone meeting each other and sharing their stories I became fascinated by what could have drawn them up there. Krakauer even asks this one night before things turn grim and never receives a truly satisfying answer. Kormakur makes you feel the existential wonder relentless risk and spiritual exaltation of the climb. When one character gets a hand on the summits peak he doesnt want to leave. Hes done something close to impossible and achieving that might be better than living to tell people you did. But I left feeling a Werner Herzog kind of churlish. Failure always feels inexorable in this movie and the mystical touches toward the end suggest that Kormakur doesnt disagree. Nature never loses.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Scott CooperWritten by Mark Mallouk and Jez ButterworthStarring Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton and Kevin Bacon3.5 stars (for Johnny Depps performance)1.5 stars (for the rest of the film).Johnny Depp is an easy actor to hate. The charm and wit he once brought to the role of Captain Jack Sparrow in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie now seems like a distant memory replaced by cringe-inducing turns in such duds as Tusk Transcendence The Lone Ranger and everyones favourite cinematic punching bag Mortdecai. Johnny Depp says he feels a lot of responsibility when playing a character based on a real person. The actor spent hours in makeup every day to play James Bulger in ""Black Mass"" screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. CP Video Video Video Johnny Depp on his transformation into James Whitey Bulger Johnny Depp offers a bizarre excuse for missing a press conference in Tokyo; Funk legend Sly Stone is awarded 5 Million dollars in Lawsuit; Placido Domingo is to sing in a Woody Allen-directed opera. (Jan. 28) AP Video Video Video ShowBiz News Johnny Depp goes AWOL in Tokyo Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star in Star Wars The Force Awakens which comes out Dec. 18. Fall Film Preview Whats on offer this fall on the big screen In those films (and so many others since 2003s Curse of the Black Pearl - seriously his IMDb profile reads like a movie critics PTSD journal) Depp wallowed in mugging half-there accents and character tics so thuddingly obvious they mustve been spelled ""TICS"" all-caps in the screenplay. The once sensitive actor who was so skilled at playing loners and lost souls had become a ham of the first order - he was done with the concept of trying. Judging by the box-office receipts audiences had lost interest too.All of which makes his performance in Black Mass that much more remarkable. This is Depp fully invested and frighteningly committed. As the real-life Boston gangster James (Whitey) Bulger Depp creates a villain for the ages - a single-minded killer who knows his place in the world and has the blood on his hands to prove it.Of course such a blatant sociopath would be easy to oversell - just look at Jack Nicholsons scenery-chewing in Martin Scorseses The Departed which also riffs on Bulgers FBI-sanctioned exploits. Yet Depp keeps things restrained and chilly in Black Mass. There are no thundering speeches assaultive outbursts or Cheshire grins here - just a steely gaze and a composure that announces calculated evil.By the time Depp-as-Bulger descends into full-on paranoia - murdering an associate for disloyalty based on basically a hunch - it becomes clear that Depp has been sleepwalking for the past decade and a half only now awake and in control of his talent.Its a shame then that the actor is stuck in an otherwise middling film. Black Masss Bulger is one of the most indelible characters of the year yet director Scott Cooper treats him as a sideshow preferring to focus instead on the antics of corrupt FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who makes a pact with Bulger that never quite makes sense (at least in the film - aside from the fact that both men grew up in the same neighbourhood Cooper never bothers to give Connolly any motivation for hooking up with Bulger; for more context its best to refer to the dozens of features and books written about the real-life case).The fact that Bulger is both overshadowed and undervalued shouldnt come as a total surprise to followers of Coopers work. As hes shown in his previous two features the director is great at assembling high-level talent and coaxing a revelatory central performance (Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart Christian Bale in Out of the Furnace) but at a loss when it comes to crafting a compelling propulsive film around them.In Black Mass famous faces pop in and out for quick spells (hey its Kevin Bacon Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson) only to disappear and be replaced with equally recognizable actors (great to see you Adam Scott Benedict Cumberbatch and Julianne Nicholson) to little effect. Scenes cut off mid-story what seem to be crucial historical events are glossed over (Bulger won the lottery what?) and the soundtrack wants to be Scorsese-esque but is more on the level of a Frank DAngelo mix-tape.Still whenever Depp is on screen nothing else matters. If he needs to keep making mediocre movies to keep his enthusiasm and interest buoyed so be it. But then again we have only two years before he stars in Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales. Arrrrrr.

Entertainment / AP)Efficiently made and extremely well-acted there is nevertheless a hollowness to ""Black Mass"" a lack of emotional connection. There is blood all over the screen but very little running through this movies veins.Which may simply reflect the icy demeanor of its central character the notorious Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger played by a near unrecognizable Johnny Depp. Its Depps most adventurous role in years but its also necessarily cold and uninviting for the most part.Or the emptiness may simply be history speaking; the truth or even an approximate of the truth is not necessarily dramatically satisfying. The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth based on a book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill follows a presumably accurate but somewhat predictable rise and fall trajectory with few twists and turns and little subtlety. Again there may have been little that was subtle about Bulger but shadings are needed in a film.One things for sure Theres almost no one to like in this macho movie. Its mostly populated with killers and crooks crooked cops and bureaucrats. Three women -- Dakota Johnson Julianne Nicholson and Juno Temple -- are given scant chance to humanize things but end up abandoned threatened or dead. Jesse Plemons offers a bit of spark initially as a spunky thug and Benedict Cumberbatch brings some dignity as Bulgers younger brother a state senator but its not enough to encourage entry.The result is a cold hard telling of a cold hard story which may be what director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") was going for. He certainly gets fine performances from a large ensemble cast and Depp fully communicates how scary dangerous and powerful Bulger was.He didnt start out powerful. After nine years in prison Bulger returned to the streets of Boston as a minor crime lord. But then FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who grew up with Bulger was assigned to Boston and charged with moving the Mafia out of town. Connolly approached Bulger and proposed an ""alliance"" Bulger would become an FBI informant basically giving him immunity from prosecution and help drive one mob out of town while his own took over.Eventually it worked and Bulger became the crime boss of Boston at the same time he was supposedly working for the FBI (in truth he offered very little information) while Connolly moved up the career ladder. The film follows their mutual success while sprinkling in assorted shootings stranglings and betrayals to keep things hopping along.Tellingly the films best scene involves no real violence just a haunting threat as Bulger confronts Connollys wife (Nicholson) expressing false concern for the illness shes feigning to get away from his company. As he runs his hand over her brow and down her face the violence waiting to be unleashed and her fear fill the screen. Theres more tension in the action not taken than in all the films many other murders.Some of the actors being touted on the movies poster barely show up in the film. Two who arent being touted -- Rory Cochrane as Bulgers right-hand man and W. Earl Brown as his hitman -- are major components and do fine if dirty work.If nothing else ""Black Mass"" at least shows Depp is still capable of surprising. With discolored teeth thinning hair and dead blue eyes hes an appropriately creepy figure. But with all the talent on board here expectations go beyond creepiness; unfortunately creepiness is about as far as the movie ultimately goes.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongBlack MassGRADE C+Rated R for brutal violence language throughout some sexual references and brief drug useRunning time 122 minutes 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1F5EIJn MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/17/movie-review-tom-long-black-mass-cold-connect/72371964/,200,blackmass8,blackmass,detroitnews

Pictures)Only Johnny Depp could begin 2015 with one of the years worst movies and end it with one of the best.The silly Mortdecai takes a backseat on the A-listers resume to the excellent crime drama Black Mass (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) which casts Depp in arguably his most visceral and evil role to date. As notorious gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger Depp astounds with one of the best performances in his long career while co-star Joel Edgerton steps up equally well as John Connolly an ethically questionable FBI agent who flirts with the wrong side of the law.The well-crafted period yarn from director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace) and screenwriters Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth takes a working-class approach to the genre. While theres nothing totally new here Black Mass works the tropes extremely well and sets the scene early in the mean streets of 1970s South Boston. Jimmy Bulger is trying to protect his turf from the Italian Mob in the north and guys like club bouncer Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) the first of his henchmen we meet and others are willing to do whatever they can to get into Bulgers inner circle.USA TODAYBlack Mass aims for a human gangster filmOne of those men happens to be Connolly. An agent on the rise he is more eager than Jimmy to take out the Italians and he proposes Bulger an alliance -- i.e. become an informant -- that benefits both childhood friends. All goes well until Bulger grasps too much power and Connollys dealings at the FBI catch the interest of assistant U.S. attorney Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll).Black Mass is more The Departed than Goodfellas -- Jack Nicholsons mobster in the former actually was inspired by Bulger. But with sneering menace an air of unpredictability and a chilly demeanor Depp wholly owns the character and is scary good embodying the psychopathic Bulger.One scene in particular coming at exactly the right time courtesy of Coopers outstanding pacing puts Bulger across the dinner table from one of Connollys superiors. By this point the audience has seen Whiteys love for his relatives -- including his state senator brother Billy (a wicked good turn by Benedict Cumberbatch) -- but also his killer mean streak so a dinnertime debate about a family recipe turns into one of the films tensest moments.USA TODAYJohnny Depp goes to dark places for Whitey Bulger in Black MassJust as good as Depp however is Edgerton. Mainly known for indie roles he could be in for an award-worthy breakout here as the embattled Connolly who begins with good intentions but ultimately has his ambition bring the house of cards down around him. The first-rate cast also includes Peter Sarsgaard as a twitchy crook Kevin Bacon as Connollys boss and Julianne Nicholson as Connollys wife who has a chilling run-in with Bulger.The violence is sufficiently savage for a Mob picture and often merciless and prosthetics and makeup among Bulgers henchmen give them a weathered look not unlike old gangster flicks. Plemons hardened Weeks almost resembles a Dick Tracy villain as the FBI interrogates him about his dealings with Bulger.With Depps icy villain theres no semblance of any other characters from the actors past making his man in Black a one-of-a-kind descent into Beantown darkness.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The story of Whitey Bulger one of the most notorious gangsters in U.S. history and his unusual alliance with the FBI.

"Review Johnny Depp creates a chilling indelible Whitey Bulger in Black Mass - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Johnny Depp creates a chilling indelible Whitey Bulger in Black Mass Black Mass movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Black Mass starring Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger Joel Edgerton as John Connolly Benedict Cumberbatch as William ""Billy"" Bulger. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Black Mass starring Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger Joel Edgerton as John Connolly Benedict Cumberbatch as William ""Billy"" Bulger. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Johnny Depp has always been the most reluctant of movie stars a criminally handsome actor with an almost visceral distaste for playing the conventional Hollywood leading man. ""Black Mass"" however allows Depp to do things his way and the result is some of the best most chilling work hes done in awhile.A bleak claustrophobic based-on-fact film that draws us completely into a dark world of crime and complicity ""Black Mass"" stars Depp as James ""Whitey"" Bulger a gangland patriarch and stone-cold killer who ruled the Boston underworld for years in large part because of a secret deal he had with the FBI. This is an ideal role for Depp because it calls on both his formidable charisma -- Bulgers terrifying presence would chill the blood whenever he walked into a room -- and his penchant for hiding in plain sight.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Using silicone prosthetics blue contact lenses and a receding hairline wig so elaborate it had to be worked on in shifts 24 hours a day makeup department head Joel Harlow and his team created a look Depp could disappear into and still be himself. His convincingly psychotic and homicidal Bulger is a Nosferatu look-alike a bloodless vampire of crime whose performance is the essence of this film. Johnny Depp creates a chilling indelible Whitey Bulger in Black Mass Warner Bros. Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in ""Black Mass."" Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in ""Black Mass."" (Warner Bros.) Adapted by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth from the nonfiction book of the same name by the Boston Globe reporters (Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill) who broke the original story of Bulgers FBI connection ""Black Mass"" does not hesitate to show us Bulger at his most murderous.Director Scott Cooper has surrounded his star with an excellent cast including Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch Kevin Bacon Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. A former actor himself Cooper is adept at eliciting strong performances all around.

When director Scott Cooper was first approached about directing ""Black Mass"" -- the story of the notorious Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger and the FBI agent who abetted his bloody rise to power -- he had some serious trepidation. Not only was the film in a genre that included some of the... (Josh Rottenberg) Cooper whose previous films include the warm-hearted ""Crazy Heart"" and the disturbing ""Out of the Furnace"" knows how to make the skin crawl and his effective direction as well as the films frequent acts of appalling violence do just that. If the final result doesnt transcend emotionally in the manner of the gold standard of Boston noir Clint Eastwoods ""Mystic River"" the fault is not in the execution but the unyieldingly oppressive nature of the underlying material.Evocatively shot by Masanobu Takayanagi ""Black Mass"" is set not in some generic Boston but in the specific environs of South Boston or ""Southie"" a clannish heavily Irish neighborhood where loyalties never go away and Byzantine codes of honor are the order of the day.Which is why one of the first things we hear is low-level criminal Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) insisting ""Im not a rat you understand."" He says this before he becomes one of several people interviewed by law enforcement who proceed to spill the beans about what it took to survive in the World According to Whitey.Bulger who hated the nickname ""Whitey"" and preferred to be called Jimmy was very much a man with his own particular sense of right and wrong. He delighted in helping old ladies with their groceries but could turn unexpectedly menacing should an associate reveal a secret family recipe for marinating steak. To Bulger murder was just another way of doing businessIn one of the storys numerous strange but true elements Bulger has a brother Billy (Cumberbatch) who -- as a career politician who became the longtime president of the Massachusetts State Senate -- gradually gathers as much influence in the straight world as his older sibling does in criminal spheres.Things change dramatically for Bulger when another kid from the old neighborhood returns to Boston. That would be FBI Agent John Connolly played by Edgerton with his trademark combination of bluster and vulnerability.Obsessed with eliminating the Italian Mafia in the city and believing that the enemy of my enemy is my friend Connolly decides to make a devils bargain with his old pal Jimmy Bulger. In exchange for information that would hurt the Mafia Connolly in effect agrees to give Bulger a free hand in his own nefarious activities. ""An alliance like this doesnt weaken you"" he tells his new partner. ""It makes you stronger."" Which as we see in increasingly violent detail is exactly what happens.""Black Mass"" makes sporadic attempts to humanize Bulger including detailing his relationship with his mother and with the young woman (an affecting Johnson) with whom he has a child she is raising. Bulger shows up regularly and imparts The World According to Whitey life lessons like ""If nobody sees it it didnt happen.""Finally however Bulger is a scary menacing individual and attempts to paint him as otherwise are doomed to failure. To see him simultaneously flirt with and threaten Connollys wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson) is to see both a nightmare in flesh and blood and one of the most indelible moments in Johnny Depps career.Twitter KennethTuran------------Black MassMPAA rating R for brutal violence language throughout some sexual references and brief drug useRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Johnny Depp Reviews Out of the Furnace Kevin Bacon Peter Sarsgaard Black Mass trailer Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-black-mass-review-20150917-column.html,200,blackmass10,blackmass,latimes

Please make it stop Propelled by a raw and primal performance by Johnny Depp Scott Coopers Black Mass will have you barricading your doors and hiding under the bed after seeing this corrosive gangster film. That is a good thing. Black Mass is not a Robin Hood romp that romanticizes criminals. It shows the real deal in terms of violence brutality and a profound disconnect from mainstream society. Given that Black Mass is based on a true and recent story -- with action set primarily in Boston in the 1970s into the 1990s -- it is also a contemporary morality tale. As the definitive but dramatized biopic about real-life gang-leader killer satanic sociopath and self-styled folk hero James ""Whitey"" Bulger Coopers film picks and chooses what it tells about the mythology and the facts. Not every viewer will be pleased with how Cooper tells Bulgers sordid tale. Especially people involved in or affected by the years of thuggery by Bulger and his Winter Hill Gang in South Boston. But no one can dispute Depps remarkable and terrifying contributions. Going through an emotional as well as a physical transformation Depp brings Bulger to life as a full-blooded (yet blood-curdling) human being. You see here -- while looking into Depps glassy shark eyes and his characters utter lack of compassion -- how Bulger could have been on Americas Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for years after he went into hiding in 1994. Following 16 years on the lam and 12 years on the FBI list Bulger was arrested in Santa Monica in 2011. He is now jailed for life. As a film Black Mass peaks early and often. The final chapter just before Bulger goes into hiding in 1994 is a less thrilling coast into the nothingness at the end. The energy has been spent. So Black Mass is unsettling overall. That said just watching Depp and a stellar support ensemble led by Joel Edgerton is mesmerizing enough to keep you intrigued. Edgerton plays the FBI agent John Connolly who enlisted Bulger as an FBI informant and then protected him; Julianne Nicholson is Edgertons wife; Kevin Bacon is his FBI boss; the surprisingly feisty and effective Dakota Johnson is the mother of Bulgers young son; Benedict Cumberbatch as usual is splendid as Bulgers brother a Massachusetts state senator at the same time as Whitey emerged as Bostons most notorious criminal; Peter Sarsgaard Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane play key Bulger confidants or criminal contacts. Black Mass deftly directed by Cooper despite the dissipation of energy at the end is constructed as a series of flashbacks through testimony to investigators by some of Bulgers henchmen. The screenplay is credited to Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk. It is based on the 2000 book Black Mass Whitey Bulger The FBI and a Devils Deal by Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill who originally uncovered Bulgers nefarious association with the FBI. The two also collaborated on its 2013 sequel Whitey The Life of Americas Most Notorious Mob Boss. The latter book helped the actors and filmmakers understand Bulger but the script had already been written when it was published. The film presents what is on the screen as fact but obviously shows where this version of ""the truth"" comes from because we see Winter Hill Gang members such as Stephen Flemmi (played by Cochrane) and Kevin Weeks (Plemons) testifying. But this device also means that Cooper is presenting only this version of the story -- and not everyones facts are in alignment. So viewers need to research more deeply to decide what they want to believe. Meanwhile Depp has that enthralling presence. At selected times he almost looks like Jack Nicholson -- which is scary enough. But at all times he looks like Bulger himself from that era -- which is fascinating. Yet far beyond the impact of his physicality Depp lets us into the soul of a human being who has chosen to strip away decency empathy and the best elements of that humanity. It is no accident that the title of this film (like the book) invokes a satanic ritual.

(Warner Bros.)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted September 19 2015Black Mass a down and dirty crime drama based on the exploits of Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger is thrilling for a number of reasons. Foremost among them Johnny Depp isnt doing his Captain Jack Sparrow shtick - or any shtick at all.In the wake of all those salty dog Keith Richards impersonations in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise after Depps flop-o turn as Tonto in The Lone Ranger and work in lamentable pictures like Mortdecai the actor was beginning to look like hed lost interest - at least in anything that might present a challenge that wasnt one-joke one-note.As the South Boston racketeer who helped old ladies with their groceries and dumped corpses into the citys harbor Depp is utterly transformed. The thinning hair the icy stare the horrific dentition the dropped consonants - hes a pasty psychopath a nightmare guy who can smile nice and pummel the people who cross him into bloody pulp.Which is what he does a lot in director Scott Coopers swaggering disco-era period piece.Although not as roiling and resonant as Martin Scorseses Beantown cops-and-crooks saga The Departed (in which Jack Nicholson served up a wildly italicized fictionalized version of Bulger) Coopers movie - adapted from a book by Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill - deftly traces the rise of Bulgers so-called Winter Hill Gang. The mobster struck a deal with the FBI that essentially gave him license to run the competition the Mafia out of town. Aided and abetted by John Connolly a fellow Southie kid who grew up to become a federal agent and who is played with barrel-chested intent by Joel Edgerton Bulger was pretty much let loose to wheel deal and whack feeding the feds ""intel"" in exchange for letting him operate in South Boston then all of Boston and beyond.This is an unredeemingly dark tale. A story with Bulger foot soldiers turned government witnesses (the film is structured flashback style with tape-recorded interrogations pointing the way). A story about bonds of brotherhood filial and otherwise. A story where women dont figure much except to bear children bring food to the table and wonder what the hell the men in their lives are doing. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger Whiteys brother a bespoke-suited state senator a power broker who doesnt need to break legs to achieve his goals. Kevin Bacon is FBI supervisor Charles McGuire who wears his ties wide and whose eyes periodically go wide too in disbelief over what Bulger is getting away with. (Murder.)Peter Sarsgaard plays Brian Halloran a Bulger associate who has good reason to be wary and 50 Shades of Greys Dakota Johnson has a couple of unnerving scenes with Depp. She plays Lindsey Cyr Bulgers mistress the mother of his son. When the boy turns sick their relationship gets very ugly very fast.If Black Mass finds its audience (an audience that likes its gangland yarns served meat-and-potatoes style) one scene is sure to be remembered and much discussed. In fact its a meat and potatoes scene a dinner in which Bulger asks his host an FBI Boston bureau boss what the steak has been marinated in. ""Its a family secret"" David Harbours John Morris responds but then Bulger works the recipe out of him anyway. Bulgers voice turns cold accusatory ""You spill the secret family recipe today maybe you spill about me tomorrow. Is that something maybe thats a possibility?""Its one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences anybodys ever going to have. And its brilliant.

(Claire Folger) Johnny Depp presides over ""Black Mass"" as crime boss Whitey Bulger. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 17 2015 215 PM Title ""Black Mass"" Film Info Gangster Whitey Bulger terrorizes South Boston. Director Scott Cooper (202). R Violence language. Area theaters. The deadliest punch in ""Black Mass"" comes from Johnny Depp. The movie itself is an intriguing but ultimately unspecial Feds-vs.-hoods drama. But as the sinister snakelike South Boston criminal Whitey Bulger Depp delivers. Beginning in 1975 Bulgers mayhem in ""Southie"" as its called by locals is relatively small-time. Hes the leader of an Irish crew the Winter Hill gang. He and his guys are at odds with the Italians across town but theres little interference from the Boston PD. Theyre resigned to simply cleaning up the mess. Bulger who spent time in Alcatraz may have a reputation as a dangerous thug. But he loves his ma his elderly neighbors and his young son whose mom is Lindsey (Dakota Johnson). JOHNNY DEPP POKES FUN AT AUSTRALIAN DOG DRAMA I KILLED MY DOGS AND ATE THEM Then a young FBI agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) devises a plan. Connolly grew up with Bulger and Bulgers brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a straight arrow whos his brothers complete opposite and a Massachusetts state senator. Connolly promises his boss (Kevin Bacon) he can get information from Whitey Bulger that will help the district attorney take down the Italians -- and help contain the Winter Hill gang as well. It doesnt pan out that way. Ten years later Bulgers power is even greater. His killing is more brazen. And his sharing of information -- he insists hes not a ""rat"" -- is seen by the new district attorney (Corey Stoll) as unhelpful. As Bulgers crew splinters he becomes more dangerous. Johnny Depp in ""Black Mass"" (Warner Brothers Pictures) JOHNNY DEPP DOESNT SEEM FULLY ON BOARD AT PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN SHOOT IN AUSTRALIA Director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") keeps the atmosphere nicely dank and shadowy. Cooper resists the urge to overuse pop songs or try to out-Scorsese Scorsese on violence and Goodfella culture. The Bulger story is seemingly perfect for the movies since the gangster was caught in 2011 after 20 years on the run and given two life sentences. But in ""Black Mass"" the tale comes off as tin-eared -- and Bulger is the same at the end as he is at the beginning. Depp though is not same old sleepwalking star who has foundered in bad films lately (""Transcendence"" ""Dark Shadows"" ""Lone Ranger"" ""Mortdecai"" ... lets stop there). He does love transformations so sometimes its distracting how much he acts with his fake bald forehead and whitened hair. But the sneer on his face and his semi-passable Boston accent work and the strong supporting cast matches him. ""Black Mass"" isnt ""The Departed"" and its a bit too black and white. But movie mobster fans can relax cause the movie doesnt need to have a hit taken out on it. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movie reviews johnny depp benedict cumberbatch dakota johnson kevin bacon corey stoll joel edgerton Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Entertainment FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton left) convinces crime boss Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) to turn informant in ""Black Mass."" As Boston crime boss Depp chills to the marrow By Jocelyn Noveck Jocelyn Noveck Denton Record-Chronicle Associated Press Published 17 September 2015 0804 AM Shakespeare had his tortured Hamlet his ambitious Macbeth his malevolent Iago his warring Montagues and Capulets.But what would the Bard have done with the tale of James ""Whitey"" Bulger and all the supporting players around him? There was Whitey himself at first a minor criminal who became one of the most feared crime bosses in history ruling his turf for two decades and evading capture for nearly two more. There was his brother Billy who grew up in the same home in the ""Southie"" section of Boston but became one of the states most powerful politicians. There were the feuding Boston mob and Bulgers Winter Hill gang. Then the FBI agent whose efforts to gain Bulgers cooperation led to his own undoing.And the FBI itself which ended up protecting Bulger for years and facilitating his murderous rise.Yes Shakespeare would have had a field day. And so does Hollywood namely director Scott Cooper and a top-flight ensemble led by Johnny Depp in a performance that reminds us after a string of uninspiring movies why hes one of our most compelling actors. Yes Depp is excellent. But the star attraction here? Thats the stunning story itself.Black Mass with a taut and effective screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is based on the book by Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeil (they make a brief appearance here). It begins with police interviews of Bulgers aging henchmen then quickly flashes back to 1975. We meet Bulger as hes asserting control of the Winter Hill gang which is engaged in a bitter turf war with the Angiulo family.Luckily for Bulger a childhood friend has arrived back in town -- John Connolly an ambitious FBI agent. Connolly (a terrific Joel Edgerton -- and this Aussie nails the Boston accent too) figures the way to make headway quickly is to bring his old pal into the fold as an informant. He first goes to Billy a state senator (a fine Benedict Cumberbatch) who coldly rebuffs him.Then he goes directly to Jimmy. ""You know what I do to rats John?"" Bulger asks at first. Connolly replies ""It aint rattin Jimmy. Its an alliance.""When Jimmy agrees he rationalizes it ""They protect us and we do whatever the [expletive] we want.""Which is basically what happens as Connollys plan spirals into a catastrophe for the FBI. Jimmy provides marginal information at best; meanwhile he wreaks havoc with impunity. Heres where its absolutely chilling to watch Depp. With bad teeth and a head of dramatically receding hair the actor somewhat resembles Jack Nicholson in The Departed but deftly avoids caricature as he grows more sinister with every murder.These include putting a bullet into the head of an associate who addresses him inappropriately; strangling a disloyal henchman with chains and choking to death the young stepdaughter (Juno Temple) of a colleague (her last gasps are a sound you wont soon forget.) He becomes so menacing you truly fear for the one person seemingly unafraid to talk back to him the mother of his young child (Dakota Johnson).Then theres a frightening dinner table scene where Bulger asks for a recipe.Without revealing too much lets just say that his sinister is-he-kidding-or-isnt-he demeanor immediately recalls Joe Pesci in Goodfellas. Depps Jimmy isnt manic like Pescis Tommy but hes mercurial and hes scary.The supporting cast also includes Kevin Bacon as a skeptical FBI boss Peter Sarsgaard as a jittery gang associate and an excellent Julianne Nicholson as Connollys wife.If you havent read the detailed news accounts of Bulgers years on the run and eventual capture nows not the time -- in other words see the movie first. And marvel again at how real life really does provide the best material.MOVIE RATINGBlack MassRated R 122 minutes.Opens Friday. Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

What starts out as a daring bid for rapid advancement quickly turns -- surprise -- into a morally murky and decidedly one-way relationship with Connolly forever seeking to justify a primal allegiance to his native tribe and its crazypants chief. Depp puts on a good show but the movie doesnt really move. Its just Whitey doing evil often violent things and various narrators explaining those evil often violent things and Connolly ignoring those evil often violent things. Until suddenly it all starts to unravel. (One character complains that a vise is closing in but durned if the viewer senses any gradual increase in pressure.) Southie looks appropriately dingy and everyone has fun trying on a Boston accent especially Benedict Cumberbatch as Whiteys brother the State Senator. But it would have been worthwhile to spend less time on strangling and more on the mechanics of both FBI-protected gang life and FBI-conducted investigation. Scott Cooper (Out of the Furnace) directs. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW Black Mass Running time 122 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sex drugs). Johnny Depp does his finest acting in years as legendary Boston crime czar Whitey Bulger in ""Black Mass"" wiping away fears by his fans that the increasingly mannered actor has grown comfortable playing only fantasy characters like Captain Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter. Depp may be working under pounds of latex -- something apparent in the overly abundant close-ups -- but his psychopathic killer Bulger is a scarily recognizable human being unlike say Depps flamboyant star turn as 30s gangster John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies."" Its an even more effectively controlled performance than a way-over-the-top Jack Nicholson gave as a character based on the Irish-American Bulger in ""The Departed."" Nicholson wasnt nominated for an Oscar for that one but Depp may well be. Director Scott Coopers movie however is no classic like ""The Departed"" which won the Best Picture Oscar for 2006. While highly entertaining and sometimes inspired ""Black Mass"" is more like Scorsese lite. In perhaps the most memorable sequence Bulger sardonically tests a childhood friend (Joel Edgerton) for loyalty by teasing out a ""secret"" steak sauce in whats basically a reworking/homage of Joe Pescis famous ""Im funny how?"" scene in ""GoodFellas."" Edgerton (very good under his own ample prosthetics) plays John Connolly an ambitious but ethically flexible FBI agent who convinces Bulger -- whose criminal enterprises in 1975 are confined to Bostons South End -- to turn informant so the bureau can smash the citys Mafia. In return Edgerton persuades his superiors to turn a blind eye as Bulger extends his extortion drug dealing and murders throughout Boston. Joel Edgerton (left) and Johnny DeppPhoto Warner Bros. Entertainment Many wonder if Bulger is being somehow protected by his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a clean-cut state senator who becomes the citys preeminent power broker (and later president of the University of Massachusetts). His career nose-dives after Bulgers deal with the feds goes south in 1985 when a tough outsider (Corey Stoll) takes charge of the bureaus Boston office. (Bulger became a fugitive and was not captured until 2011.) The bond between the tightly knit Bulger brothers goes largely unexamined as the film focuses on the tense dynamic between Connolly and the increasingly paranoid Whitey Bulger who is quick to eliminate associates (sometimes personally with great brutality) when he has the slightest suspicion they are going to betray him. Depp is very frightening in some of these scenes. The large and excellent cast includes Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott as FBI agents frustrated by the hands-off policy toward Bulger and Peter Sarsgaard as a druggie businessman who gets mixed up in Bulgers ill-fated attempt to open a Florida casino. Dakota Johnson pops up briefly as Bulgers wife in a sequence about the death of Bulgers son designed to somewhat humanize this monster. (Poor Sienna Miller as Bulgers girlfriend during his fugitive years ended up on the cutting-room floor.) You would think that Bulger somehow winning 14 million in the Massachusetts State Lottery would rate more than 30 seconds in ""Black Mass and it sounds like all of the actors used the same dialect coach so uniform are their Boston accents. But these are small complaints about a movie that delivers the goods.

Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in ""Black Mass."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Can an outstanding performance send people racing to the box office if the role is housed in a lengthy and wearisome movie? ""Black Mass"" is as promising as they come with Johnny Depp stepping out of his ho-hum fantasy comedies. As longtime Boston crime lord James ""Whitey"" Bulger he is taking on a dense shady character to show off his chameleon gift. He doesnt disappoint. Depp is darker here than we have ever seen him tapping into the demeanor and depravity of a notorious criminal who made it to the top of the FBIs most wanted list. The leader of the Irish mob the Winter Hill Gang Bulger shot strangled or ordered the execution of dozens of business rivals adversaries disobedient cronies and anyone who knew anything about him. Depp re-created himself chillingly for the role. You cant see his ugly dentures breathtaking facial makeover and ice-blue contact lenses without gasping at the change -- lets face it theres not a film actor alive who is a bigger fan of character makeup than Depp. But theres much more. Growling out charm and guile in a South Boston accent even his conversation feels hellish. Depp brings his A-game to the role creating a serial killer whose self-satisfied smirk would fit easily into a Martin Scorsese movie. Its the sort of bombastic showy turn that can lead a stalled actor needing a career comeback to a meteoric McConnaissance. You watch this kind of acting with a feeling of falling in love again; its Depps best work since ""Donnie Brasco"" and a likely Oscar run. Unfortunately the story surrounding his diabolically evil character is a mess of double-cross mind games. The film follows the period from the mid-1970s to the 90s when Bulger the brother of a prominent and respected Massachusetts state senator became an FBI informant to take down the rival Mafia family invading his territory. It follows as that morally confounding partnership gives him immunity from prosecution and he grows increasingly unhinged. Director Scott Cooper (who guided Jeff Bridges to a best actor Oscar in ""Crazy Heart"") fills the opening with surreal shots of carnage that feel like the prelude to a solid underworld movie. For a while it seems as if everyone involved will be working at the peak of their craft. But soon were tripping on the scripts interwoven story lines. Screenwriters Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth take Whitey through some crucial events such as the death of his only son at age 6 a loss that turned him against his girlfriend and fatherhood permanently. But too often the film makes bad narrative choices introducing us to well cast but nonessential subsidiary characters. Joel Edgerton gets loads of screen time as FBI detective John Connolly a Boston native who set up the agencys alliance with his boyhood pal Bulger calling him ""a top echelon informant"" throughout his climb up the gangster ranks. Connolly seems to have a raging man crush since Whitey saved him from a neighborhood bully back in grade school. Peter Sarsgaard pops in for a very effective cameo as one of Bulgers targets. Benedict Cumberbatch drops by as his politically influential brother without explaining how he distanced himself from his dear criminal sibling. Corey Stoll growls a lot as a hard-line prosecutor determined to bring the Winter Hill Gang down and Adam Scott plays an FBI guy who ... Sorry I started losing track. As did the filmmaking team apparently hiring Sienna Miller to play the woman who was Bulgers lover for 30 years and then completely abandoning the subplot. Its a shame to lose an A-lister like Miller but the films version of Bulger has no visible libido and the project is already crushed by excessive cast footnotes. It would have been nice for the film to tell us what made Bulger a mad dog. It hints that his beloved mother was no saint and mentions his volunteering for multiple LSD tests while in prison in the 1950s but digging deeper into his background would have made this evil mystery man clearer. More interesting. Less monotonous. ""Black Mass"" is the sort of gangland film you would call run of the mill if only it dashed faster. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Black Mass smartly directed by Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) casts a wide if hardly deep net since the tentacles of Bulgers tale could fill a mini-series or five. The script by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is based on the 2000 book Black Mass The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill. And an unholy alliance it truly was. Bulger had known FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) from the Boston hood. Its Connolly who persuades his fellow Southie to turn FBI informant in return for help in crushing the Italian Mob. Bulger got the best of that deal leaving the FBI boss (Kevin Bacon) fuming. Edgerton excels at detailing the dread eating at Connolly; the dread also infects his ethical wife Marianne (a superb Julianne Nicholson) whose quiet scene with Depp instills more terror than a hail of bullets. But you get the bullets too and the gore especially when Bulger lieutenant Stephen Flemmi expertly slimed by Rory Cochrane is on the scene. And duck when Bulger turns his gun on informant Brian Halloran played with bug-fuck lunacy by Peter Sarsgaard. Is there any sympathy for the devil that is Whitey? The death of his only son at age six clearly rocks him as it does the boys mother (a touching Dakota Johnson). But the key path into Bulger is his good brother William ""Billy"" Bulger former Massachusetts Senate president. Billy remains shrouded in mystery. Luckily Brit acting icon Benedict Cumberbatch doesnt need dialogue to make his character understood. Cumberbatch reveals Billys loyalty in the space between words. Frustrating? At times yes. But you forgive the zigs zags evasions and subplots for the hardcore power of Depps performance and the films portrait of moral rot on both sides of the law.

"Black Mass reveals a devils deal with a satanic crime boss review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBlack Mass reveals a devils deal with a satanic crime boss reviewJohnny Depp emerges from the shadows of Black Mass like a vampire from a crypt the central figure of a crime drama that creeps like a horror movie -- and in many respects it is.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 17 2015Black MassStarring Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch Dakota Johnson Julianne Nicholson Corey Stoll Peter Sarsgaard Kevin Bacon Adam Scott and Juno Temple. Directed by Scott Cooper. At GTA theatres. 122 minutes. 14AJohnny Depp emerges from the shadows of Black Mass like a vampire from a crypt a fearsome figure of pale skin serpentine eyes and murderous leer.Hes the central figure of a crime drama that creeps and drips blood like a horror movie and in many respects it is.Article Continued BelowThrough makeup and intuition Depp utterly transforms himself into James ""Whitey"" Bulger the mobster who ruled South Boston with savage entitlement from the 1970s to the early 1990s before his Irish luck ran out. (Now 86 hes behind bars on 48 charges including 19 counts of murder.) Joel Edgerton left and Johnny Depp star in Black Mass which screened at TIFF and now is opening in wide release.Bulger ran drugs and guns shook down honest business folk for protection money and even -- so it is thought -- boosted a 14-million Massachusetts state lottery prize. Anyone who crossed him for any reason risked getting two in the head and a final dunk in the Neponset River.Bulger did all this with startling impunity because he was a secret gangland snitch for the FBI which cared more about stopping the local Mafia than his Winter Hill Gang. The devils deal was brokered by Bulgers childhood ""Southie"" pal John Connolly an FBI man played as a mess of ambitious intentions by Joel Edgerton. The gang lord also had a brother in high places Massachusetts Senate President William ""Billy"" Bulger whom Benedict Cumberbatch coolly portrays as incorruptible yet somehow sinister.Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace) works the story like a campfire fright tale told by Martin Scorsese heavily referenced from a fact-based screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth. Ex-accomplices of Bulger spill their guts to police inquisitors while flashbacks reveal the extent of Bulgers satanic doings.Depp digs into Bulgers black soul with obvious relish no doubt seeking a role worthy of his abundant talents after years of mostly mirthful coasting. He presents him as a collision of opposites a cold-blooded killer with bad teeth vile temper and a trigger finger; but at the same time a fastidious family man devoted to his aging mother (he lets her cheat at cards) and bullied young son (he counsels the art of stealth defence). This towering performance threatens to overwhelm all the other actors as well as the narrative but three women rise out of the testosterone tide. Dakota Johnson makes brief but memorable appearances as Bulgers fearless girlfriend Lindsey mother of his son; Julianne Nicholson commands respect as Connollys brave wife Marianne; and Juno Temple owns one of the films most riveting scenes as a hooker who mistakes Bulger for a reasonable man.Its good to see Johnny go toe-to-toe with other strong actors but in most other respects Black Mass is his film and ticket to a Best Actor nomination. After seeing this the Academy might be afraid not to give him Oscar gold.

(  / Warner Bros.) Johnny Depp delivers a frigid dead-eyed performance as ruthless South Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger in ""Black Mass"" a somber-toned dramatization of how Bulger manipulated the local FBI to become a pawn in his criminal game. Director Scott Cooper does an admirable job of de-valorizing the kinds of characters that Martin Scorsese has made a career of colorfully mythologizing. But therein lies the rub As a movie purposely lacking in the kind of sweep brio and anthropological detail of crime dramas like ""GoodFellas"" and Francis Ford Coppolas ""Godfather"" cycle ""Black Mass"" winds up being as dreary and mundane as the thugs and plug-uglies its about. Many viewers probably know the rough contours of Bulgers story. He was a beloved and feared figure in South Boston throughout the 1970s and 1980s subsequently going on the lam for 16 years until an anonymous tip led to his capture in 2011. Hes serving consecutive life sentences for racketeering and involvement in 11 murders. Framed as the story told to prosecutors by Bulgers former associate Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons)""Black Mass"" is mostly told in flashback. The plot is set in motion when Bulger begins working with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) an old neighbor and friend of Bulgers brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who at the time is a powerful state senator. The psychological push-pull between the Bulger brothers and Connolly alone would provide ""Black Mass"" with a fascinating cat-and-mouse dynamic. Boys who once played cops and robbers on the playground as Weeks observes are now playing them in real life. But Cooper working from a script by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth keeps the story literal and linear bouncing from a shot of Jimmy Bulger (no one in the know ever called him ""Whitey"") tenderly helping an old lady with her groceries to a scene in which he casually shoots a colleagues brains out on a deserted riverbank. ""Black Mass"" feels out of place as it follows the violent life of South Boston gangster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp). (Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictures) To Coopers credit the violence in ""Black Mass"" is never depicted as anything but the sadistic stupid venality that it is. But even with Depp working at the top of his game -- blue contact lenses slicked-back hair cock-of-the-walk strut and rotten teeth included -- Bulger remains a forbiddingly recessive figure. The film suggests that having been given 50 tabs of LSD during an early prison stint as well as the loss of his young son may explain why he became increasingly psychotic. (As for the childs mother played by Dakota Johnson she disappears without a trace once the character has served her narrative purpose.) Those psychological speculations quickly evanesce in a narrative that spends relatively little time with its central protagonist who remains a collection of tics and contradictions rather than a fully realized character. Connolly who had the idea of enlisting the Irish American Bulger as an ally in eradicating the Italian mob in Bostons North End isnt much more compelling. Looking puffy and punch-drunk Edgerton uses ""Black Mass"" mostly to burnish his Southie drawl as does a regrettably underused Cumberbatch. With f-bombs and rub-outs flying comparisons to ""GoodFellas"" are inevitable especially when Bulgers Winter Hill Gang goes south to Florida to take charge of the jai alai gambling racket. At this point ""Black Mass"" takes on the predictable rhythms of a procedural weve seen before with the familiar puffed-up male codes of honor loyalty and aggression -- minus the unique attributes of a story in which those same codes animate the collusion between criminals and law enforcement at its most breathtakingly cynical. For all its style atmosphere and acting chops ""Black Mass"" winds up being a respectable but unremarkable alternative within a canon of films that for decades have depicted their protagonists as romanticized rebels and anti-heroes. The bitter irony What ""Black Mass"" gains in moral honesty it loses in dramatic momentum. Even filmmakers and actors as fine as these havent managed to solve one of cinemas most enduring challenges -- making criminals interesting without exalting them. R. At area theaters.

"Black Mass review Depp revels in mobster role - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Black Mass review Depp revels in mobster role Black Mass (Trailer) Trailer for Black Mass. Sept. 16 2015. (ScreenPlay) Trailer for Black Mass. Sept. 16 2015. (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Weve seen it before but ""Black Mass"" works anyway thanks to a uniformly strong ensemble. Turns out the thing Johnny Depps career needed was simple. He needed to play a type of role relatively new to him even if its relatively familiar to the rest of us.Some scenes in the solid vividly acted gangster picture ""Black Mass"" come from real life or something like it. These trade off with scenes yanked straight out of the movies. In a major ""GoodFellas"" moment Depp as South Boston underworld kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger has been invited over for steaks on the grill at the home of his old neighborhood pal and current Federal Bureau of Investigation liason and protector John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) along with Connollys colleague John Morris (David Harbour). Connollys wife is upstairs both angry and fearful about the social engagement. Bulger raves about the marinade. Whats the recipe he asks. Morris says cant tell you its a family secret. Then Morris capitulates with a smile and says well Ill tell you its soy sauce a little garlic.He fixes Morris with an icy blue stare; Depp probably took the role simply to be able to wear the scariest contact lenses in movie history. In a low Southie growl Bulger responds How can I trust with you with anything if you spill an alleged family secret so easily? The room gets very chilly and the specter of Joe Pescis ""I amuse you? How?"" routine in Martin Scorseses gangland chronicle floats above the proceedings. The true-crime film directed with calm authority by Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"" ""Out of the Furnace"") draws direct and indirect parallels to other films ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Departed"" among them. (Scorsese is the inevitable elephant in this mobbed-up room.) Beyond the Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" which Scorsese and screenwriter William Monaghan adapted for a Boston setting and took all the way to the Oscars ""The Departed"" drew some pulpy inspiration from the criminal exploits of the real-life criminal convicted killer and eventual fugitive Bulger. Telluride Film Fest tantalizes with a curated list of movies Michael Phillips Very little about the four-day Telluride Film Festival which concluded Monday appears to match its own reputation as a key influence on the painfully elongated six-month awards season now upon us.

Very little about the four-day Telluride Film Festival which concluded Monday appears to match its own reputation as a key influence on the painfully elongated six-month awards season now upon us. In its scale ease and scenically memorable setting in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado... (Michael Phillips) Heres the rich part. Bulgers brother Billy was the most powerful politician in Massachusetts the president of the state Senate. ""Black Mass"" revels in multidirectional corruption. The script by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk uses Connolly as a symbol of the good man brought low by temptations and by neighborhood loyalty.After a prologue in which one of Bulgers Winter Hill Gang associates (Jesse Plemons) recounts his story to the feds the movie zips back to the mid-1970s. It traces Bulgers rise; his relationship with a sometime mistress played by Dakota Johnson with whom he has a son with his own tragic destiny; and an empire founded on slots vending machines drugs and extortion plus murder.Then comes the sweetheart deal just as some FBI higher-ups are getting suspicious about the leeway the local boys are giving Bulger. Connolly makes a proposition If Bulger helps the FBI rat out and clean up the Irish underworlds nemesis the Italian-American mafia Bulger can do as he pleases. Just lay off the killing Connolly says. Bulger does not. The Dreamcatcher review Compassion rehab for sex workers Guy Lodge There are certain documentaries that thrive on a real-world version of movie-star magnetism and in volunteer social worker Brenda Myers-Powell ""Dreamcatcher"" has found itself something of a supernova.

There are certain documentaries that thrive on a real-world version of movie-star magnetism and in volunteer social worker Brenda Myers-Powell ""Dreamcatcher"" has found itself something of a supernova. A former prostitute doling out tough love escape plans and copious condoms to the unsupported... (Guy Lodge) The movie goes light on the drug dealing and the seriously grubby business of being one of these people. If anything director Cooper is so intent on portraying Bulger as a man not a monster the man comes off a little softer than he was probably. The dialogue occasionally enters a realm of fanciful criminalspeak straight out of Damon Runyon. (Im paraphrasing but at one point Bulger says to a local cop giving him grief ""Its a sad day when a good man takes up with his oppressor."") And yet in scene after scene some fine actors go to town and dive into the material gratefully.With false and rotted teeth slicked-back hair and a masklike countenance right next door to Kabuki the makeup and costume particulars of the role no doubt appealed to Depp who loves to play dress-up on screen. (Most actors do.) He resembles Orson Welles as the older hollowed-out Charles Foster Kane only hes tricked out in black leather and massive sunglasses. Behind those glasses Depps sidelong glances are enough to curdle milk. For a while you wonder Is this performance going to settle for tics mannerisms a collection of character flourishes? But Depp gets past that. ""Black Mass"" spreads it around; we see Bulger in his native elements and his scene partners are up for anything.Edgerton at times edges over the caricature line as Connolly but this is the risk a movie runs when it features an excellent Australian actor whos good at dialects; sometimes the dialect leads the way. Benedict Cumberbatch oozes quiet influence as Billy Bulger. The supporting ranks are lousy with enjoyable turns from Kevin Bacon Adam Scott Peter Sarsgaard Rory Cochrane Corey Stoll and many more including Juno Temple in a rare female-driven sequence. She plays a prostitute naturally but Bulgers world was what it was.The superb Julianne Nicholson plays the conflicted Connollys wife. During the marinade dialogue shes upstairs pretending to be sick to avoid being in Bulgers fearsome company. Ill go check on her see how shes doing Bulger tells a nervous Connolly. At her bedroom door Bulger calls her bluff and then Depp and Nicholson ease into the films most unnerving encounter. We see a new more intimately predatory side to Whitey Bulger in this sequence and Cooper is smart enough to linger on Nicholsons horrified reaction. At such moments ""Black Mass"" does not feel like other gangster movies; it feels like its own gangster movie and real life in the bargain.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""Black Mass"" -- Three starsMPAA rating R (for brutal violence language throughout some sexual references and brief drug use)Running time 202Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Whitey Bulger Johnny Depp FBI Scott Cooper Martin Scorsese Benedict Cumberbatch Kevin Bacon Sales of Whitey Bulger memorabilia rise with film release This fall at the movies danger is the watchword Dont know actress Elizabeth Laidlaw?

Depps portrayal of the crime boss appears to be filtered through an impersonation of 1980s Ray Liotta while buried under a prosthetic forehead that borders on Klingon. The result feels like watching a lost Martin Scorsese film or at least the trailer for one. ""Black Mass"" is a very satisfying piece of entertainment -- a gritty showcase for Depp with scores of quality supporting roles. Its hard to imagine anyone aware of the subject matter feeling as if they didnt get their moneys worth with this film. But it all feels less like an exploration of Bulger and more like a celebrity costume party -- a costume party made up almost entirely of dudes. Depp doesnt disappear into the character as much as he creates a hyper-real facsimile. Hes a mob boss Captain Jack Sparrow. As much as that sounds like a criticism the approach mostly works because Bulger (or at least his legend) is so much larger than life to begin with. The leader of the Winter Hill Gang thwarted Mafia encroachment by working with the FBI until that law enforcement ""alliance"" imploded under Bulgers criminal success in the 1970s and 1980s. His later fugitive status only added to the mythical nature of the legend. Depp does mythical well and once again crawls into character like its a full body suit leaving no room for even a hint of Real Johnny Depp to peek out. Its the opposite of a Tom Hanks performance where Hanks always seems to be playing a character through the lens of his own personality. (It would be interesting to see Depp and Hanks appear in a film together -- Depp might simply absorb Hanks persona like a parasite with a host.) Depps similarity to Liotta in appearance and mannerisms is so striking its hard to believe it was coincidence. But the homage to the Scorsese ""GoodFellas"" era is a comfortable one -- especially when the 1970s and 1980s rock songs get cranked up on the soundtrack. Were provided with plenty of signature Mafia film moments including a slow build around an FBI agents dinner table that is Joe Pesci-esque in its humor and cruelty. Scott Cooper directs ""Black Mass"" with sharpness often filming outdoors at dusk or dawn. You can feel the chill whether its a light dusting of snow that none of the characters seem dressed for or the sudden fear of a South Boston outsider who realizes hes in over his head. The director once again assembles a stellar crew repeating the standout production design (Stefania Cella) and cinematography (Masanobu Takayanagi) that elevated Coopers ""Out of the Furnace."" The cast gives distinct performances in small roles; Jesse Plemons W. Earl Brown and Peter Sarsgaard all contribute with limited exposure as Bulger underlings possessing varying degrees of loyalty. Cooper is less successful in reining in the story of Bulger who turns from a sympathetic and layered protagonist in the beginning of the film to a horror movie villain at the end. The result is a distance between audience and character. The camera becomes increasingly fetishizing in these later scenes offering a stylish angle of Bulger as he commits a savage deed or lingering on the horrified reaction of one of the witnesses as the musical score soars. Those witnesses are almost always men. Its truly eerie how few women there are in this movie and not just because most who do show up are hookers or suffering housewives. For entire sequences women dont seem to exist as if a South Boston virus has wiped them out. Bulgers state senator brother William (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a script casualty as well; theres simply not enough time to explore the dynamic of the politician and the crime lord sibling. You get the feeling that Cumberbatch had the most scenes left on the cutting room floor to keep the movie running a tightly paced two hours. Joel Edgerton gets more room to develop as FBI agent John Connolly but there are few surprises in his journey. Bradley Cooper basically played the same character in ""American Hustle"" two years ago but with the added risk of a home perm. Speaking of costume and makeup choices Depps giant fake forehead is much less of a distraction in the movie than it is upon first sight in the trailers. The prosthetic moves realistically with the rest of his head and it ages with Bulger who adds a graying tooth later in the film. (We hope J.J. Abrams is taking notes for his next ""Star Trek"" movie or ""Star Wars"" cantina scene.) These are nice cosmetic touches in a film that pays attention to detail. ""Black Mass"" is a solid piece of filmmaking from subtle beginning to the excessive end. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicle pop culture critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Judging by crime movies of the past 10 years or so Irish gangsters have largely supplanted Italian gangsters in the popular consciousness of the new millennium. In a roundabout way Scott Coopers Black Mass addresses this process. Based on the true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger the South Boston hood who inspired Jack Nicholsons character in The Departed it chronicles how Bulger (Johnny Depp) was able to stay out of prison because the FBI led by Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) uses him as an informant to help take down the Italian mafia out of North Boston. Eventually they succeed so thoroughly that Bulger comes to dominate crime in the city unchallenged by either fellow criminals or the feds. Theres even a scene where Connolly and Bulger casually sit down to a holiday dinner.Connolly grew up alongside Bulger along with Bulgers brother State Senator Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and while those relationships certainly play into Bulgers reign of terror Black Mass isnt the stuff of mob opera. There are no flashbacks to Connolly and the Bulgers as Southie kids and no ""as far back as I could remember"" conspiratorial color in the narration which is instead pieced together from a variety of lower-level informants left with no choice but to spill about Bulgers operation. The relationship between Bulger and Connolly is fascinating but doesnt have much passion or emotional pull.That may be because the movies Bulger isnt an especially passionate guy even when committing horrific murders. Something about working in crime movies causes Depp to tamp down his flamboyance as a performer; his work as Bulger joins Public Enemies Donnie Brasco and Once Upon A Time In Mexico under the ""effective underplaying"" heading of his resume. He also gives lie to a particularly tedious truism about his acting habits He hides behind make-up--with a balding head and eyes so blue and still that they look iced-over--that doesnt detract from his performance in the least. (Its almost as if Depp knows what hes doing with all that makeup business) Edgerton also does strong work as the more relatable Connolly whose excitement at combining his professional and personal lives turns him into a sort of mini-mafioso. While the movie is divided evenly between the two of them Depp lays claim to all of the most memorable scenes implying threats to Donnollys partner (David Harbour) over a family recipe and to Donnollys wife (Julianne Nicholson) over a faked illness; imparting his circumstantial sense of morality to his young son (""If nobody sees it it didnt happen""); and carrying out violence with so little hesitation that he appears unstoppable.In these scenes and elsewhere Coopers filmmaking is clean confident and suffused with the appropriate menace. Hes especially fond of push-ins that subtly escalate tension and his staging of the movies many hits make him seem as ruthless an executioner as Bulger (however briefly). His focus is such that few other members of the enormously talented cast--which includes Kevin Bacon Adam Scott Dakota Johnson Corey Stoll and Juno Temple--has as much to do as Depp or Edgerton. The leads respective domestic scenes opposite Johnson (as the mother of Bulgers child) and Nicholson feel particularly perfunctory even with Johnson and Nicholson doing what they can. Instead of condensing years of marriage into a few scenes the movie spreads a few minutes of material across the years.Despite the inherent lack of fairness in comparing almost anyone to Martin Scorsese its hard not to think of The Departed what with all of the Boston accents the cutting back and forth between line-blurring cops and criminals and even the presence of Jesse Plemons who looks like a beefier less golden Matt Damon in his role as a longtime Bulger associate. Pulpy as that movie is it pulses with life. Without an emotional core a stronger sociological angle or many visceral thrills Black Mass more or less limits itself to procedural status. Within those aims its a pretty good one absorbing and well-made. But it seems like there should be a more distinctive story behind the gangster FBI agent and senator who have Christmas dinner together.

Photo Credit AP / Claire Folger advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The rise and fall of the notorious Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Depps brutal antihero is the highlight of this compelling if somewhat familiar gangster movie. CAST Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch LENGTH 202 Yes thats Johnny Depp balding and steely-eyed glaring out from the poster for ""Black Mass"" in which he plays notorious Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Its almost stunt casting -- the fine-featured Hollywood actor as a Southie sleazeball -- but Depp turns in one of his most convincing performances in years. If anything ""Black Mass"" focuses so intently on its star that the films more interesting aspects dont get the attention they deserve. Based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill ""Black Mass"" explains how James Bulger -- always called Jimmy despite his better-known nickname -- managed to run a wide-ranging crime ring and kill virtually anyone he pleased (19 victims that we know of) for roughly 20 years with barely a peep from law enforcement. As the film tells it the answer is simple Jimmy was an informant for FBI agent John Connolly (an excellent Joel Edgerton) who happened to be a childhood friend. As an added wrinkle Jimmys brother William (Benedict Cumberbatch) became president of the state senate. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Jimmy may be a more grounded role than Depps recent outre creations (say Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") but theyre still of a piece. Jimmys slicked-back hair age freckles and milky blue contacts compose a costume that sometimes feels distracting. Still Depp paints an exceptionally scary portrait of a serial killer a walking moral abyss wearing a gold chain and a cheap jacket. Stylistically there isnt much to distinguish ""Black Mass"" from any of a hundred other mobster movies particularly Martin Scorseses genre-defining ""GoodFellas"" (1990) but the film packs a punch. Director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") and writers Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth nicely illustrate Jimmys stranglehold on his turf (Jesse Plemons Rory Cochrane and W. Earl Brown play his unsavory entourage) and his canny way of gaming a corrupted system (Kevin Bacon David Harbour and Corey Stoll play the hamstrung authorities). In the end Jimmy destroys nearly everyone he touches on both sides of the law. ""Black Mass"" sometimes overlooks the emotional impact of its narrative in favor of driving home Jimmys sheer brutality and nastiness. Still its a compelling true-life tale of power loyalty betrayal and ruin.

Movie review Black Mass Article Tweet Warner Bros. Johnny Depp in Black Mass Black Mass      (out of five) Director Scott Cooper Cast Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch Rated R (brutal violence language throughout sexual references brief drug use) Running time 122 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Sep. 17 2015 Thursday Sep. 17 2015 Thursday Sep. 17 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are few films outside of the horror genre where a characters exterior so aptly mirrors the evil brutality within like Johnny Depps James ""Whitey"" Bulger in the gripping and brutal crime saga Black Mass. With cold-blue eyes set against a cadaver of ashen white skin Bulger is more reptile than human a man with neither soul nor conscience.That Bulger really exists -- he ruled the Boston underworld as the head of the Irish-American Winter Hill Gang in the 80s and early 90s -- makes it all the more creepy. And while Depps physical transformation may be an exaggeration on what the actual man looks like his layered chilling performance makes it disturbingly real.Yet director Scott Cooper who burst on the scene with the country-music drama Crazy Heart in 2009 doesnt just want to tell the story of Bulgers rise and fall. Based on the nonfiction book Black Mass Whitey Bulger the FBI and a Devils Deal the film is also about FBI agent John Connolly (a terrific Joel Edgerton) a childhood friend of Bulgers who thinks he can leverage his relationship with Bulger and the crime lords state-senator brother Billy (a miscast Benedict Cumberbatch) into success for himself. His intricate dance of ambition survival and denial even as the walls are closing in makes him both more relatable and pitiable than the monstrous Bulger.The film is told in flashbacks as Bulgers arrested henchmen recount to a federal agent the extent of Bulgers vicious crimes and how he climbed his way up from the projects of South Boston to become a feared figure throughout the city. Bulgers tentacles even stretch to South Beach (where he gets involved in the backroom deals involving the betting sport of jai alai) and Northern Ireland (where he shipped arms to be used by the IRA).His power only grows after the FBI gets involved. Connolly thinks he can use Bulger as a bulwark against the Italian mobsters. Yet like a small planet against a powerful sun Connolly gets sucked into Bulgers orbit to the point where Connollys wife (Julianne Nicholson) doesnt recognize him anymore. Its not until a new no-nonsense FBI boss shows up (Corey Stoll) that Bulger has something to fear.Cooper shoots the film in grays and dark tones -- Boston seems perpetually overcast -- and theres a gnawing sense of dread throughout. In a tense dinner scene a seemingly playful question about a recipe curdles into a threat exposing the undercurrent of violence thats never far from the surface.If theres a problem with Black Mass its that the general arc of the story is well known. Its not just that Bulgers story has been widely publicized but its details reflect the plot points of many other gangster films. From the first scene an FBI interrogation you know where its going.But its the getting there thats the thrill. Nearly all of the performances are strong with character-actor Stoll turning in another convincing turn and Peter Sarsgaard effectively playing against type as a red-eyed Miami lowlife.But its Depp -- who has been squandering his talents with such dreck as Transcendence and The Lone Ranger for the past few years -- whose character will stay burned in your memory. The scene where he comes on to Connollys wife is so unnerving that many moviegoers may wish their local theaters had showers installed so they could immediately wash off the ick. In that regard Black Mass is a masterful horror story where the monster lives among us. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

VPCJohnny Depp is outstanding as Whitey Bulger the notorious Boston criminal in Scott Coopers film. But the acting is superb all the way around.Johnny Depps performance as Whitey Bulger shines through the layers of makeup it took to transform the actor into a likeness of the notorious gangster.(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out of 5Johnny Depp buried under makeup still makes the role his own.Joel Edgerton is just as good in a deeper role.In ""Dark Shadows"" Tim Burtons 2012 film version of the TV soap opera Johnny Depp went for high camp in his portrayal of doomed vampire Barnabas Collins leaching out whatever frights might have been in store.In ""Black Mass"" Scott Coopers new film Depp plays a real monster and in much more terrifying fashion.Depp plays James ""Whitey"" Bulger the notorious Boston crime lord whose Winter Hill gang ran amuck in the 1970s and 80s in part because of the deal he cut with James Connolly (Joel Edgerton) a rising star in the FBI to try to bring down the Mafia in the area. The scheme failed in spectacular murderous fashion in part because of the South Boston bond between Bulger and Connolly who grew up together.Cooper doesnt break any new ground here in terms of movies about gangsters and he doesnt delve too deeply into the machinations of the deal between the feds and Bulger. (For an outstanding film about that see ""Whitey United States of America v. James J. Bulger"" Joe Berlingers 2014 documentary about the case against Bulger.)AZCENTRALTop 10 mob moviesut the acting in ""Black Mass"" is tremendous. All the way around everyone sinks deeply into their characters whether the role is large (Depp Edgerton) medium (Benedict Cumberbatch Rory Cochrane Jesse Plemons) or small (Kevin Bacon Peter Sarsgaard). Theyre tremendous. In the creepiest scene in the movie Julianne Nicholson who plays Connollys wife Marianne expresses terror and hopelessness in about 60 seconds no more.Of course having Depps hand around her throat probably helped the portrayal.The acting in ""Black Mass"" is uniformly good. (Photo Warner Bros.)The film opens with Kevin Weeks (Plemons) being interviewed by an investigator. Cooper uses this technique throughout as Bulgers former underlings talk about the crimes; this frames the action moving forward.""I am not a rat"" Weeks insists a theme that runs throughout the film. Part of it is Southie pride. Part of it is fear -- they know what Bulger does to rats; in many cases theyre the ones who meted out the retribution.But Bulger also finds himself saying this repeatedly after cutting the deal with Connolly. Hes no rat he tells his lieutenant Steve Flemmi (Cochrane) -- something he also insists to Connolly. Yes hes supposed to give the FBI information. But its to help bring down the Mafia something that benefits both sides. Of course the FBI isnt supposed to be helping Bulger do anything but sometimes the greater good outweighs the cost.Until it doesnt.AZCENTRALBlack Mass (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBulger can be charming particularly to the old-timers in the neighborhood but he turns on a dime with a violent outburst if he thinks he has been threatened or wronged. A couple of personal tragedies accelerate his instability. Given a longer (almost non-existent) leash by the FBI hes soon out of control.Complicating matters is Bulgers brother Billy (Cumberbatch) a powerful politician who of course is aware of what his older sibling is up to. But to what extent?Its often dark and rainy here -- South Boston looks cold messy unforgiving. Bulger looks like a blue-eyed vampire roaming the landscape but with the color of his eyes sharper than his lousy teeth. Theyre piercing weird -- scary. Depp is buried under a pile of makeup and a skull cap but those eyes ... theyre astonishing.If the FBI helped create a monster in Bulger Connolly made his own mess. He had done good work in San Francisco and New York  before he was welcomed home to try to eradicate the Boston Mafia. But the combination of ambition and loyalty to his old friend proves  too much. Hes the character who is developed the most and Edgerton takes him through his devolution from a tough investigator to an arrogant man who thinks hes untouchable. His wife says hes changing and we see it too -- the expensive suits and watches but more tellingly the swagger. Connolly thinks hes growing stronger not realizing that hes becoming more vulnerable. Edgerton captures that -- as with most of the performances (besides Depps) not in his grand gestures (screaming fits at the boss etc.) but in small moments.""Black Mass"" has its share and its there that it finds its strength.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

EntertainmentMovies Black Mass Johnny Depp transforms into a monster of a mobster Originally published September 17 2015 at 100 am Updated September 19 2015 at 1208 pm A review of ""Black Mass"" director Scott Coopers look at notorious Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger played by Johnny Depp. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Johnny Depp as notorious Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger in Scott Coopers ""Black Mass"" seems almost phosphorescent; hes all forehead and unblinking eyes glowing in the films yellow light. Theres no trace of the actor here transformed by a receding hairline (its as if even his skinned-back hair is afraid of him) and chilly blue contact lenses and the result is uncanny. ""You unduhstahnd?"" he rasps in slurry South Boston-ese and theres something not quite human in his monotone; its as if long ago this mans emotions dissolved in the winter air. Coopers long been a fine director of actors (his ""Crazy Heart"" brought Jeff Bridges an Oscar) and though ""Black Mass"" is Depps movie its crammed full of strong performances. Watch how Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulgers good-boy brother Billy (a state senator) displays a wonderfully insincere politicos smile as if an assistant pasted it there; or how Dakota Johnson in just a few scenes as Bulgers ex-girlfriend wordlessly tells an entire story of disappointment placed on a shelf. ""Black Mass"" is an ambitious film spanning several decades and numerous characters Its primary focus is Bulgers long shady alliance with the FBI crafted by an agent (Joel Edgerton) in the 1970s and emergence from small-time hood to notorious crimelord. Its always intriguing or perhaps unsettling but never quite seems to build to a peak. (What could have been perhaps its most electric moment is nearly thrown away at the end as little more than a title-card afterthought.) Its one of those movies that you dont exactly enjoy (so many guns so many deaths) but you appreciate for its craft and tension and for its casts willingness to lose themselves in the darkness. Movie Review    Black Mass with Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch Rory Cochrane Jesse Plemons Kevin Bacon W. Earl Brown David Harbour Dakota Johnson Julianne Nicholson. Directed by Scott Cooper from a screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill. 122 minutes.

"Black Mass | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-mass ) Black Mass (United States 2015) September 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli For Black Mass Johnny Depp has dusted off his A-game which has lain dormant for far too long. The actors transformative portrayal of Whitey Bulger reminds us that Depp when motivated can do impressive work. By inhabiting the character rather than merely playing him Depp deepens an otherwise generic gangster story that often feels familiar (a little like Scorsese-lite). Bulger is by far the most interesting thing about Black Mass and Depps acting is what gives Bulger his screen presence and intensity. As a dramatic thriller Black Mass has trouble getting into low orbit. There are some tremendous scenes but the narrative as a whole feels more like a chronology of dastardly dealings than the epic tale of a criminals rise and fall. Theres a sense that too much of Bulgers life has been compacted into an easily digestible two hours disallowing the kind of character development that would have made Black Mass a richer more disturbing experience. We catch glimpses of complex conflicted relationships but they are never allowed to germinate beyond the basic needs of the story. To the extent that Scott Coopers goal is to relate the events of Whitey Bulgers life between 1975 and 1995 he succeeds. As a straightforward bio-pic Black Mass works. Framed a series of extended chronological flashbacks the movie introduces us to the lead character when hes the leader of a two-bit South Boston Irish criminal gang in 1975. His hair-trigger temper and violent inclinations get him in trouble with the larger more dangerous Italian mob and he ends up being targeted by the Mafia for elimination. Enter FBI Golden Boy John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) a South Boston native who has come home to spearhead a task force assigned with cleaning up the city. A childhood friend of Whiteys younger brother (and current political heavyweight) Bill (Benedict Cumberbatch) John reaches out to the gangster with a deal if Whitey will provide the FBI with actionable intelligence that leads to the decimation of the Mafia the FBI will allow Whitey to act unmolested. This results in a mutually beneficial relationship that sours when Whitey becomes the biggest boss in all of Boston and openly defies law enforcement with brazen criminal acts. Aspects of Black Mass echo other Boston-based crime films most notably The Departed. The setting is sufficiently different from New York to give these films a unique flavor.  And although The Departed was adapted from the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs the lead villain (played by Jack Nicholson) was loosely based on Bulger. Black Mass follows the ""Scorsese approach"" in its non-glamorized depiction of organized crime showing the brutality and viciousness of the participants as a counterpoint to a so-called ""moral code"". Although Bulger is a ruthless killer we are provided with hints of a softer side he loves his mother and dotes on his young son. Those humanizing elements disappear however as the objects of Bulgers affection are removed and he becomes obsessed with control and power. Central to Black Mass storyline is the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. More a business arrangement than a friendship this provides Bulger with a degree of immunity and Connelly with a quick ladder to promotion. The film is less successful in developing Connolly than Bulger. Perhaps its because of the latters larger-than-life persona but despite character building scenes between Connolly and his wife the FBI agent never feels fully formed. The density of Connollys motivations is only partially explored. To what degree does he allow himself to be manipulated? Is his primary motivation personal gain or is he in awe of Bulger? Although Depp will get the lions share of attention for his efforts in Black Mass he is supported by a capable group of actors. Leading the way is Joel Edgerton whose cocky self-assured Connelly is the polar opposite from the damaged twisted character he played in the recent The Gift (which Edgerton also wrote and directed). Also in the mix are Benedict Cumberbatch Kevin Bacon and Dakota Johnson whose affecting performance as the mother of Bulgers son shows theres more to the actress than what she (figuratively) displayed in Fifty Shades of Grey. Black Mass is not The Next Great American Gangster Film. When Oscar season rolls around its unlikely to be found on any Best Picture nomination short lists. However by putting aside the outrageous Captain Jack-fueled image that has earned him so much money over the past decade Depp provides a character who transcends the screenplays weaknesses. He makes Black Mass not merely watchable but enjoyable. He brings Whitey Bulger to life with force and flair that allow us to forgive the movies narrative shortcomings.

"Review Johnny Depp terrifies in Black Mass - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Johnny Depp terrifies in Black MassBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 09/16/2015 103513 AM PDTUpdated 09/18/2015 083751 AM PDT Johnny Depp has made Whitey Bulger into nothing short of a terrorist.A white middle-aged man from Bostons south side isnt exactly the image one connects with the term but Depps Bulger in ""Black Mass"" is one of the most terrifying figures in recent big screen history. With his icy stare growling cadence and perpetually disgusted sneer Depps Bulger terrifies his enemies. He terrifies his friends. He terrifies the FBI.And best of all he terrifies the audience.""Black Mass"" wont join the ranks of the great mob movies. The scope and vision dont reach far enough which reflects director Scott Coopers intent to tell a true singular story rather than an allegorical one. It lacks the twisted joy of ""GoodFellas"" the moral push-and-pull of ""The Godfather"" and the frenzied shock of ""Scarface."" (L-R) Joel Edgerton as FBI Agent John Connolly and Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in Black Mass. (Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictures) ( Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictu ) But Depp who dominates the screen like a simmering Jack Nicholson in his prime is every bit as good as he can be. He doesnt make you want to be a gangster like some of the aforementioned films. He makes you want to run away if you see one coming. ""Black Mass"" isnt a typical gangster tale of the lavish rise and tragic fall of someone pulling an end-around on the American dream. Bulger -- a real-life legendary character now 86 and in prison for life -- is portrayed by Depp as a man possessed by a violent bloodlust for power. The performance is simultaneously frightening and fascinating.Advertisement Narrated through flashbacks by Bulgers former associates in witness protection the story focuses on the 1970s and 80s relationship between Bulger a rising Irish crime boss and FBI agent John Connolly (a thoroughly believable Joel Edgerton) who hail from the same South Boston neighborhood. The pair forge a partnership meant to cripple the citys Italian Mafia but which also allows Bulger to eliminate his rivals and consolidate his stranglehold on the city. Allegiances among the various players begin to blur and Connolly desperately seeks to keep his suspicious superiors at bay.Director Cooper (""Out of the Furnace"") tries injecting a sliver of humanity into Bulger by showing him doting over his 6-year-old son with girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson who surprisingly keeps pace with Depp during an explosive hospital scene).The film is bloody and violent but its most chilling moments come in scenes in which no one gets physically hurt. The first is the ""Black Mass"" version of the ""GoodFellas"" ""Do you think Im funny?"" scene in which Bulger seemingly menaces FBI agent John Morris (David Harbour) into a twisted jangle of nerves before landing a punch line. But Cooper makes sure theres no mistaking Bulger for a jokester by following that scene with a terribly unfunny confrontation between Bulger and Connollys wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson) in which a horrifying threat is delivered through kind words steely eyes and an ugly smile. Its Depp at his most terrifying.As dominating as Depp is its Edgerton who really expands his character as he shows Connolly being squeezed on all sides as he tries escaping the inevitable. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Bulgers brother William Bulger a state senator who manages to stay connected to the old neighborhood without getting his hands dirty. Unfortunately its a role not equal to Cumberbatchs talent as it doesnt really explore Williams relationship with his brother or explain how a politician can manage such a career when he has the citys most notorious gangster for a brother. Still ""Black Mass"" is a riveting character study and might land Depp an Oscar nomination even if the film itself is not very ambitious. At the very least on the heels of wasted efforts like ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Mortdecai"" ""Black Mass"" is a shotgun blast announcing that Johnny Depp is still one of the best actors in the business.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayArea NewsGroup.TonyHicks.BLACK MASS    Rating R (violence language some sexual references and brief drug use)Cast Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Benedict Cumberbatch Dakota JohnsonDirector Scott CooperRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesOpens Sept. 18 wide releasePrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Black Mass (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Black Mass (R) Johnny Depp resorts to the same-old in this crime drama about a notorious gangster. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/16/2015 Editor rating 2 Black Mass has been touted on the festival circuit as Johnny Depps big comeback film -- the one in which he finally takes acting seriously again. But Depp isnt doing anything different here than he did in Dark Shadows or Alice in Wonderland or the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Once again hes unrecognizable under elaborate makeup and prosthetics and he speaks with a peculiar voice (this time a thick South Boston accent). And once again hes playing a thinly written character who is all surface. James ""Whitey"" Bulger is a real person -- a murderous Irish-American gangster who spent 12 years on the FBIs ten most-wanted list and is currently serving two life sentences for an astounding array of crimes -- but the way hes presented in Black Mass hes a two-dimensional boogeyman with cold hard blue eyes a rotten tooth and a death-pallor complexion. Hes a Halloween costume a scary monster. But the man inside remains so remote and opaque he might as well have been stitched together on a slab in Dr. Frankensteins laboratory comprised of pieces from more memorable movie gangsters James Cagney to Joe Pesci. Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace) is so mindful about not turning his period crime saga into a Martin Scorsese imitation that he drains all the style and energy from the movie. This is an unusually somber and talky film about the evil men do a movie so concerned with not romanticizing its protagonist that it becomes an unfocused unconvincing slog. Its too cold and restrained for its own good. Black Mass opens (and regularly cuts away to) interviews with Bulgers foot soldiers (including Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane) as they spill their guts to detectives about the assignments they carried out for a man who would later betray them. The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth tries so hard to give us a panoramic view of the South Boston criminal underworld over a span of a decade that it forgets to find a way to carry us through the story. Too often Depp is sidelined on the screen by Joel Edgertons corrupt FBI agent who was Bulgers childhood friend and persuades his bosses (Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott) to strike a shady deal with the killer using him as a ""top echelon"" informant to bring down the mafiosos ruling the citys north in exchange for protection (or at least interference) from any serious criminal charges. Edgertons character a mass of moral and ethical contradictions is complex enough to merit his own movie. So is Bulgers brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a powerful politician who was elected president of the Massachussetts State Senate in 1978 yet still maintained relations with his evil sibling. How these two men were born from the same parents is a fascinating question the film simply glosses over After their elderly mother passes away Whiteys heart hardens even further fueling his rampage of paranoia and murder that gradually becomes psychopathic. Black Mass delves into Bulgers various rackets (including a stint dabbling in Miamis then-burgeoning jai alai scene) but the movie doesnt show us the mechanics of his crimes Instead Cooper focuses on the ways in which Bulger and his crew eliminate any potential rats or eyewitnesses and they seem to derive a little too much enjoyment out of their wet work. Women play no role in this universe other than to serve as mothers wives or whores. Dakota Johnson pops up in a couple of scenes as Bulgers girlfriend but only as a way to introduce us to his young son who died at age 6 from an allergic reaction to aspirin. Despite the films attempt at a sweeping depiction of the rise of a neighborhood wise guy into a kingpin told from both sides of the law Black Mass often feels small and claustrophobic a repetition of familiar themes without fresh insights (for a much more comprehensive and informative look at Bulgers life check out Joe Berlingers documentary Whitey United States of America v. James J. Bulger). The movie which has been elegantly shot in a palette of blues and blacks might have still worked if it had been anchored by a strong lead performance. But Depp never lets us inside Bulgers head. The actor makes poetry out of endless f-bombs and turns his Southie accent into music but it all comes off as superficial trickery. He remains hidden behind Bulgers aviator sunglasses so were left with a clever sadist who takes pleasure in the suffering of others whether hes casually taunting a frightened FBI agent over a home-cooked meal or pointlessly threatening another agents wife in her own bedroom (to what end?). Black Mass struggles to find something new to say about organized crime the loyalty between men and how we can never really leave behind the places in which were born. But the only thing the film manages to do is remind us weve seen all this stuff done before -- and done better. Bulgers bizarre life might be tailor-made for the movies (Jack Nicholsons character in The Departed was loosely based on him). But Black Mass is so timid and derivative so earnest in its attempt to be serious and profound the film turns him into an ordinary garden-variety punk unworthy of all this attention.

If you notice a debt to Martin Scorsese thats no surprise; clearly what this Boston story of tribalism wants to be is ""Wicked Good Fellas."" But before its half over its strictly wannabe status is clear. Like a lot of movies this coming Oscar season its a so-so film surrounding a great performance an empty frame with one terrific portrait inside. Thats thank to Johnny Depp who finally strips away the extravagances that have cluttered his work for years. Of course in the past some of his roles needed that excess - his Jack Sparrow is the only thing still worth watching in the tired ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. And in their own collaborations Tim Burton always seemed to be just as guilty for egging him on. But here - apart from a truly bizarre pair of ice-blue contact lenses - Depps put away the over-the-top effects to create a real and terrifying person The absolutely guiltless mob boss Whitey Bulger who loves his family but will coldly kill anyone who gets in his way who hates snitches but doesnt mind slipping his own tips to the FBI. Its a terrific acting job - veering from tender familial concern to monstrous rage to an absolutely inscrutable stare - but its mostly surrounded by air. Scott Cooper delivers the same sort of faked authenticity he did in his ""Out of the Furnace"" melodrama - there are tokens of ethnicity (religious pictures on the wall genuflections to the IRA) but no real life. There are no other characters just targets. Theres no visual sense just violence and chatter. The influence of ""Goodfellas"" is felt - Cooper has the daring or foolhardiness to stage his own version of the ""You think Im funny?"" scene - but felt too is the absence of Scorseses genius. Depp provides Joe Pescis mad energy but wheres the weaselly hunger that Ray Liotta gave that film? Or Paul Sorvinos slow grave dignity? Nor does the movie tap into the moral complexities of Scorseses own fictionalized take on the Bulger story ""The Departed."" Like that film this is a story of trust. But the film only gives lip service to the idea of informing itself a grave sin in the insular Irish community from which Bulger sprang. ""Black Mass"" does have things to recommend it. It has an excellent if overwhelmingly male cast - Depp Benedict Cumberbatch as his politician brother and Joel Edgerton Kevin Bacon and Corey Stoll among the FBI agents. There are moments of icy violence and some great lived-in faces among the characters. But this is no ""Goodfellas."" Its just another punk talking tough. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and substance abuse. Black Mass (R) Warner Bros. (122 min.) Black Mass Directed by Scott Cooper.

Warner Bros. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - James ""Whitey"" Bulger was more like a character from a seventeenth-century folktale than a late-twentieth-century criminal the sort of figure whod murder innocents on wooded roadways and then with a shrug toss their bloody bones to hungry wild dogs. In Eighties and early-Nineties Boston he headed a criminal syndicate known as the Winter Hill Gang thugs who plied their trade -- selling drugs extorting small local businesses out of millions bumping off anybody who happened to look at them sideways -- on the streets of Southie using a dive bar called the Triple Os as HQ. Bulger was as mean as they came a snickering little rat in a windbreaker and cowboy boots and though everybody knew he was up to no good nothing ever stuck to him. Even the FBI was hoodwinked He served as an informant though the information he forked over turned out to be useless. If you were living in his city at the time whenever his name would pop up in the news youd more likely than not feel a shiver of revulsion mingled with a twisted curiosity. Who was this heartless creep and how could he get away with so much? The fact that he was the brother of straight-arrow Massachusetts Senate President William ""Billy"" Bulger made him even more fascinating. The two were like streetwise funhouse-mirror Kennedys one of whom had made good the other distorted by pure evil.Whitey Bulger disappeared in late 1994; he was finally captured in Santa Monica in 2011 and is now serving two consecutive life terms plus five years at USP Coleman. But he rides again onscreen at least in Scott Coopers ambitious and engaging Black Mass where hes played by Johnny Depp in a fake bald pate so wide and solid you could bounce a basketball off it. The elaborate makeup job is a problem Depp might have been better off just channeling Whitey from deep within -- its almost as if the radiation beams hes trying to send out cant penetrate all that latex.Film Details Black Mass RatingR GenreDrama Running Time122 min. More Info Trailer Even so Black Mass is a tightly wound piece of work and Cooper (Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace) keeps its many small parts moving with ease. Hes skillful at merging telling minute details with bigger looping schemes. We see Whitey sitting down to play cards circa the mid-Seventies with his senior-citizen mom (whos shocked when he wont take the opportunity to cheat) and working his treacherous wiles on one of his childhood pals now grown up to be FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton who plays his character as likable believable and just slightly pitiable). Connolly thought he could use Bulger to break up a Boston mafia syndicate only to step all too easily into Bulgers pit of corruption himself. Connolly too is serving a prison sentence 40 years for a second-degree murder conviction.Bulgers is a horrible and brutal story and Black Mass never shrinks from it. After he puts a bullet in the head of a crony who defies him and later tries to apologize Bulger and his all-too-loyal henchmen bury the body under a bridge on the Neponset River as if it were just the sort of thing youd do on a sunny weekday or any time really. Most of the violence occurs off-camera but you wouldnt call the film tasteful The sound of a young prostitute (Juno Temple) gasping for breath as Bulger squeezes the life out of her is almost more harrowing than anything Cooper might have chosen to show. And Coopers sprawling cast -- including Benedict Cumberbatch as the stalwart but unfortunate Billy Bulger whose political career was destroyed after it was revealed hed been in touch with the disappeared Whitey -- is almost uniformly terrific. The now-playing-everywhere Dakota Johnson appears in a small role as the mother of Whiteys young son Theres a sweet but flinty pensiveness about her particularly when she lashes out after her sometime partner lectures her about her manner of dealing with a tragedy that has shaken them both. (Its telling that of all the players in this vicious sorry tale only a woman has the nuts to stand up to this snake.) If youre an expert on Boston accents you might find a few shaky bits here and there but the actors strike the right mood and tone which is what counts.The only performer I couldnt wholly buy is Depp. With that prosthetic balding scalp and strange glued-on eyebrows he looks less like the real Whitey Bulger than like a bulb-headed alien from an old Twilight Zone. I tried hard to look beyond the makeup but the more I watched the performance the more mechanical it seemed Depp as Bulger is meticulous and deliberate scowling at his enemies (basically everyone) through smoke-tinted aviators or allowing some chilling pronouncement to leak from the side of his mouth. But I kept thinking of another actor who had played similar roles or types and who had perhaps done it better. Unintentionally perhaps Depp appears to be channeling Ray Liotta and his tics and mannerisms feel more derivative than original and complex.Since the premiere of Black Mass in Venice numerous critics have been murmuring about how terrific they think Depp is which means it wont be long before people start using the O-word. Actually this is the sort of performance that could easily win an Academy Award -- which isnt the same as calling it good. For years Depp was one of our most sensitive original actors; more recently buried under matted pirate hair and all those layers of Tim Burton makeup we seem to have lost him. Black Mass will probably be hailed as a comeback and thats not a bad thing -- it might help boost Depp out of a stagnant period. But its still disheartening to see such a marvelous actor running the numbers in his head instead of slipping right into a characters skin. Whitey Bulger pulled off an almost magical disappearing act and then managed to stay hidden for years. Maybe hes such a sneaky mean little creep that not even Johnny Depp can find him. Thats the mark of a really bad guy.Black Mass Directed by Scott Cooper Warner Bros. Opens September 18Directed by Scott Cooper. Written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth.

He was a criminal a kingpin and a convicted killer but he was also more than that. He was a vicious amoral spectre who looked in the mirror and saw Robin Hood staring back. After Whitey was finally apprehended in 2011 after years on the run it wasnt a question of if but when Hollywood would turn the leader of the Winter Hill Gangs bloody reign of terror into a movie. Now with Scott Coopers new gangster epic Black Mass we finally have our answer. Whitey wasnt what anyone would call a handsome man. He had a receding hairline and a predators smile marred by a dead tooth that seemed to symbolize the rot emanating from within. So when it was first announced that Johnny Depp would be playing Whitey in the film there was a cognitive dissonance in the casting choice. But Depp perhaps sensing that the time had come to step away from flamboyant cartoons like Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter and take on something meatier and more adult tears into Coopers absorbing portrait of villainy with sick gusto. From his on-the-money Southie accent to his mottled ashtray complexion to his strongman strut the actors really done his homework after playing hooky for what feels like too long. Its telling that the first line in Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworths screenplay is ""Im not a rat."" Although those words arent spoken by Whitey himself but rather by one of his henchmen whos turned informant that sentiment of tribal loyalty is the theme of the film - how its earned how its honored and how easily its betrayed. The film kicks off in 1975 as Whitey reigns over the insular blue-collar neighborhood of South Boston from behind a black leather jacket and a pair of dark Foster Grants. At the same time we meet Joel Edgertons John Connolly a kid from those same streets whos grown up to become an FBI agent charged with cleaning up his old neighborhood. But Connollys conflicted. It turns out that when he was a kid he was once on the receiving end of one of Whiteys rare good deeds. And even though hes on the other side of the law now theres still an underlying feeling of respect for him. As a wobblier third leg of the table theres Benedict Cumberbatch as Whiteys more legitimate brother Billy a state senator who struggles mightily trying to weigh Whiteys dark deeds and his blood-is-thicker-than-water sense of family loyalty. Its a fascinating dynamic that could have - and should have - been more fleshed out in the film. Based on a book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill Black Mass chronicles the tangled deal Whitey struck with Connolly to become an FBI informant against their common enemy Bostons Italian mafia in exchange for the bureau turning a blind eye to his own criminal interests from vending machines to dope dealing to jai alai. Needless to say neither side comes out looking very honorable. After all as much as Whitey insists that he isnt a rat thats basically what he and his easily-turned lieutenants become. Cooper the director of Crazy Heart and the underrated Out of the Furnace has made a tight and tense gangster film with Black Mass. But its a pretty straight-ahead entry in the genre albeit one peppered with spicy performances. Its satisfying in the way that great mobster movies like Goodfellas Scarface and Depps own Donnie Brasco are. But Coopers working in a genre thats become so familiar to us that were able to see most of his films beats coming before they arrive the hair-trigger outbursts of violence the whispered-threat monologues the montages of corruption and the double crosses that eventually tighten the noose around Connolly and send Whitey on the lam. Theres a scene in the film (one of its best actually) where Whitey has dinner with Connolly and one of his fellow Feds and gets the agent to reveal his familys secret steak sauce recipe with such ease that its clear he cant be trusted. Depp plays the scene to the hilt purring with menace grinning that dead-toothed grin until you almost cant take it anymore. He plays the audience like Toscanini. But when its over you cant help thinking that as great as it is its basically Joe Pescis ""Funny how?"" scene from Goodfellas. Thats Black Mass in a nut shell. Its a very good film about a very bad man. But as well-crafted and well-acted as it is it never rises to greatness because weve been watching this story in one way or another going back to the time of Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson. Whitey may now be in good (which is to say bad) company but hes still the same old monster.

Its the entertaining if limited tale of how seriously nasty South Boston crim James Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp looking like an embalmed vampire with terrible teeth and a bald patch) operated with near immunity from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Bulger cut a deal with an FBI agent childhood pal John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who in turn was seduced by the danger and rewards of the thug life he was meant to be eradicating. Its a knotty tale of loyalty v legality. Bulgers brother Bill (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a state senator and as Bills power increases Bulgers crimes escalate from ripping off vending machines to shipping drugs and supplying arms to the IRA. So the material is meaty and director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) offers an appropriately grim and moody atmosphere; Black Mass is painted in greys blues and blacks and offers sobering bursts of psychopathic violence. Yet the way the film embraces its near-30-year time span regularly cutting to police interviews with informers years later can feel more episodic than epic. The key relationships in the film - especially those between men and women - feel undercooked too. A scene in a hospital between Bulger and his partner Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson underused) as their son lies dying in the next room is emblematic of a repeated failure to scrape beneath the surface of what these people really mean to each other. Moreover some of the films livelier moments feel like replays of better films - not least a scene involving Bulger and a nervy FBI agent that is like a straight rewrite of Joe Pescis Im funny how? scene in Goodfellas. Still Depp is more engaging than hes been in years even if his performance can feel a little restricted and one-note. Hes joined by an eye-grabbing supporting cast including Kevin Bacon Peter Sarsgaard and Juno Temple as well as some more anonymous meatheads who play grizzled lieutenants on whose pock-marked faces you could play 18 holes of golf. But its Edgertons Connolly who most impresses and is the heart of this film. His swagger increases in line with the price tag of his suits; hes harder to read; his tragedy is subtler; and his downfall is especially well-handled. Its Bulger whose grim appearance and even grimmer behaviour Black Mass indulges. But its the quieter more complicated Connolly who offers the films subtler pleasures.

Buried under tons of makeup a very convincing bald wig and countless prosthetics Depp looks eager for a comeback role after several years of lackluster projects. Such extreme attempts at physical transformation by famous faces often lead to misguided vanity projects. Fortunately just when Depp seems like he could be set up for failure Bulgers sharp blue eyes peer out from a menacing scowl and an iconic monster comes to life. As a movie ""Black Mass"" often drowns its dramatic potential in a dreary atmosphere and grisly violence used to dubious effect. Depp however operates on another level. While his Boston accent takes some time to convince the actor turns Bulger into a demonic presence whose ruthless antics are made all the more unsettling by his ability to get away with them. An opening segment establishes the decision by former Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons best known as Todd on ""Breaking Bad"") to share intel with the FBI about Bulger during the 12 years that he was on the lam before his 2011 incarceration. From there the movie unfolds as a series of flashbacks by way of testimony from Weeks and other former Bulger allies. Theyre looking for lenient sentences but nothing they do can match the absurd amount of freedom Bulger enjoyed for over a decade. Starting in the mid-seventies when the FBI loosely regarded him as an informant and allowed him to get away with a laundry list of illegal activities ""Black Mass"" portrays the horrific outcome. Depp is the storys psychotic engine throughout. Bulgers unique arrangement with the law comes together thanks to an ethically questionable proposal by misguided FBI agent John Connolly (a stern Joel Edgerton). Connolly a thinly developed amalgam of conflicting motives suggests that Bulger become an informant in exchange for FBI protection. He also proposes a daring alliance for the criminal and the law to join forces and take down the mafia. While Connolly sees the gamble as an ambitious attempt to face down a target much larger than one man for Bulger its an excuse to go about his maniacal routine. ""They fight our battle"" he tells a colleague. From there ""Black Mass"" takes a page from the Martin Scorsese playbook of criminal odysseys portraying the rush of excitement clouding its subjects mind with a series of stylized elements. Chief among them Cooper offers up plenty of snazzy pop songs set to montages of Bulgers Massachusetts terrible reign. As he kills and bribes his way through a series of shady dealings Bulger comes across more like an unstoppable terminator than a full-fledged character though screenwriters Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth (adapting the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill) make some effective attempts to deepen the characters struggles As he copes with the unexpected death of his young son Bulger funnels his grief into more acts of depravity. Mostly though ""Black Mass"" obsesses over that depravity. More than once the movie finds Bulger slowly killing locals who either betrayed him or threatened his empire. In one memorable scene he guns down a key character in broad daylight casually striding past horrified onlookers who cant do a thing about it. Elsewhere he chokes a harmless woman to death with his bare hands while Coopers camera drifts to Bulgers mortified underlying nearby. Coopers framing of these killings like the ear splicing sequence in ""Reservoir Dogs"" leaves much to the imagination even as it creates a heightened sense of dread. In addition to probing Bulgers psyche ""Black Mass"" also explores the institutional failure that let him run loose. While the 2014 documentary ""Whitey The United States of America v. James Bulger"" explores the way the FBI essentially turned its back on Bulgers crimes no former agent agreed to be interviewed. But Coopers movie provides more insight into the frantic arguments between Connolly and his uncertain colleagues (includes a furious special agent played by Kevin Bacon) that Connolly regularly pushed aside essentially orchestrating his own downfall in addition to Bulgers. With its grave fixation on the impact of Bulgers lunacy from his casual approach to murder to the eerie snakelike grin that accompanies his threats ""Black Mass"" at times feels exceedingly one-note smothering Depps formidable turn in a thick grim aura. Bulgers tale has so many moving parts that some ingredients -- such as his relationship to his politician brother Bill (Benedict Cumberbatch) -- suffer from a tacked-on quality. Yet Depp remains a frightening presence throughout with each scene carrying the suspenseful possibility that he might lash out. While ""Black Mass"" aims to examine the impact of corruption across many decades Depp acts as though hes at the center of a horror movie. In a few occasions he wins out. One unnerving sequence finds his FBI contact inviting the killer over for dinner where he conveys a series of increasingly less veiled threats. Constantly threatening to veer into parody the scene builds an unnerving tension. Depps performance is bolstered by a boogeyman quality because we never really see him receive his comeuppance Whereas the Bulger documentary chronicled his recent trial which resulted in a life sentence ""Black Mass"" barely touches on that fate. Instead Cooper conveys the haunting legacy of Bulgers criminal deeds and the lingering sense that no justice can erase their impact. Grade B- ""Black Mass"" opens nationwide September 18.

Its another role in which Depp can disappear into the prosthetics yes but this time hes not letting the contact lenses and the fake teeth do all the work. (Oddly enough given the actors ongoing fascination with Hunter S. Thompson he does resemble the Thompson-influenced Uncle Duke character from ""Doonesbury."") There are shades of 1970s Jack Nicholson and Robert DeNiro in the performance but ultimately this is Depp bringing his skills to the table as a man with a propensity for being both terrifying and charming often switching between the two on a dime. See Video Johnny Depp Is Even More Dangerous in New Extended Black Mass Trailer Theres more to the film than just Depps standout work however director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") -- working from a script by Jess Butterworth (""Edge of Tomorrow"") and Mark Mallouk based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill -- tells the larger story of how Bulger and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) struck a devils bargain in which the bureau ignored Bulgers crimes in return for his help in bringing down his Italian rivals in the Boston underworld. Its the kind of story loaded with twists you wouldnt believe if they werent true in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" fashion Connolly and Bulger grew up together on the mean Southie streets and their sense of loyalty to each other came to overwhelm their respective duties as Fed and criminal. (Lots of Bulgers associates wind up talking to the FBI in this movie but they preface everything with ""Im no rat."") Meanwhile Bulgers brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a state senator wielding power in Massachusetts politics while Jimmy was running drugs and prostitutes. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (whose exemplary work is also on display in ""Spotlight"" another Venice Film Festival premiere) achieves a stripped-down look that doesnt try too hard to consciously ape the contemporary mob classics of Coppola or Scorsese. In Coopers last crime saga ""Out of the Furnace"" the photography overwhelmed everything else in the movie but here it accentuates the storytelling without calling attention to itself. (The same cant be said for the Junkie XL score which tends to excessively underline whatevers happening on screen.) Also Read Sienna Miller Cut From Black Mass Director Scott Cooper Confirms Just about every speaking role here has an acclaimed actor attached to it and theyre given varying amounts of time and material to make an impression. For every standout like Julianne Nicholson (as Connollys wife) Corey Stoll (as a no-nonsense US attorney) or Rory Cochrane (enacting vengeance upon Bulgers enemies) theres Adam Scott who gets to do little but sport a really great 1970s mustache and Juno Temple stuck playing her umpteenth streetwalker. While ""Black Mass"" is frequently engrossing it has occasional pacing issues; some characters (like Dakota Johnson playing the mother of Bulgers child) disappear sooner than youd imagine while the films last act could stand to lose 15 or 20 minutes. (If the movie starts with hoods turning states evidence thus guaranteeing the plots outcome we shouldnt notice how long its taking to get to the finish line.) Also Read Black Mass Director Scott Cooper in Talks to Tackle American Wolf for Warner Bros. (Exclusive) Ultimately this is Depps show all the way featuring his best dramatic performance since another organized-crime movie 1997s ""Donnie Brasco.""

TWITTER Johnny Depp plays legendary crime boss Whitey Bulger in Scott Coopers Boston gangster saga costarring Benedict Cumberbatch Joel Edgerton and Dakota Johnson. After too many Caribbean vacations Johnny Depp finally gets back down to some serious business in Black Mass a major league real-life gangster film loaded with ripely presented murders beatings betrayals and vengeance-takings all backed up by a deep-secret arrangement between Bostons top-dog criminal and the FBI. Even if director Scott Coopers jump into big-time studio filmmaking feels familiar and derivative in some respects he has taken care to borrow only from the best and a top-notch cast socks over the many dramatic opportunities. Box-office prospects look potent. Long-time Depp fans who might have lately given up hope of his doing something interesting anytime soon will especially appreciate his dive into the deep end here to personify genuine perfidy in the guise of legendary hoodlum James ""Whitey"" Bulger the crime kingpin of South Boston from the 1970s until 1994 when he was forced to go on the lam for what ended up being 16 years. For a dozen of them he was second only to Osama Bin Laden on the FBIs Ten Most Wanted list. What gave him such status provides the substance of this continually absorbing melodrama one that scarcely glamorizes Bulgers complete allegiance to a life of crime. Bulger to this day denies that he was a rat for the Feds the worst thing you could be in his world; to him it was an ""alliance"" to rid Boston of the Italian mafia. You can detect Depp behind the elaborate makeup job -- the thinning blondish brushed back hair the blue eyes the rotten teeth. He may be better-looking than the real Bulger but not by much. Hes far from the biggest guy in the room but hes plenty tough and has a Bloodhounds sense of smell for anyone who might be thinking of crossing him. He grew up in the slums of Southie and has known most of his cronies since playground days. In a nod to Citizen Kane the script by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is structured around interview testimony given by some of Bulgers longtime henchmen after their arrest and their boss disappearance. Their comments are revealing but not conflicting Their boss was the thug of thugs the baddest ass in Boston a man who finally in his 80s was sentenced to two life terms plus five years after having been charged with murder (19 cases) extortion racketeering narcotics peddling and money laundering. Early scenes neatly establish the tough-guy ways of Bulger recently sprung from nearly a decade in federal prison including Alcatraz and his underlings in the bars and cars of Southie. An escalation of war with the Angiulo family in North Boston seems inevitable but Bulgers Winter Hill Gang isnt the only organization that wants to bring the Italians down The FBI cant get anything on them so the bureaus John Morris (David Harbour) and an agent whos known Bulger since boyhood times in the neighborhood John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) eventually persuade Bulger that its in his interest as well as theirs to secretly team up against their mutual enemy. Read more Spotlight Venice Review This works out brilliantly especially for Bulger who now not only has Boston to himself by enjoys virtual carte blanche as far as the Feds are concerned; he can extort or kill essentially anyone he wants and knows he can get away with it. Turning a blind eye toward this as best he can is Bulgers upstanding brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who happens to be Massachusetts most powerful state senator. The one thing Bulger cant control relates to his only child a six-year-old boy who dies from an allergic reaction to an injection. He breaks down and argues with his wife (Dakota Johnson) after which we never see her again; maybe we dont want to know what happened to her. Where killings are concerned sometimes Bulger does them himself while on other occasions he lets one of his beefy goons handle them; Rory Cochrane W. Earl Brown Jesse Plemons and Scott Anderson are plenty convincing as his inner-circle boys. Cooper who previously directed Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace after working as an actor times and stages the violence for sharp visceral impact and street realism avoiding operatic extremes as well as trendy fast cutting and ridiculous forms of physicality. But especially in regard to some key interior dramatic sequences Cooper would seem to have given the Godfather films some very close re-viewings as his typical approach is much like Coppolas starting with carefully composed and sometimes lengthily held master shots that are followed by unusually tight and sustained close-ups which make the actors look really good. The performers return the favor with very strong sometimes riveting work -- and all with pretty passable Beantown accents. As Bulgers childhood crony who went straight only to make his bed with Bulger and then had to sleep in it Edgerton is outstanding painting a vibrant picture of an ambitious hustler who thinks he can talk his way into and out of anything but whose anxieties begin to show like cracks in melting ice. Peter Sarsgaard has some memorable moments as a drug-addled businessman who has the misfortune of ending up on Bulgers bad side; Harbour Adam Scott and Kevin Bacon seethingly express as federal agents the FBIs growing frustration with the situation; Corey Stoll comes on strong as a federal prosecutor determined to nail Bulger while Cumberbatch must go the other way to elegantly portray the distinguished brother who escaped the slums had nine kids served as longtime Massachusetts Senate president and then as president of the University of Massachusetts. Read more Beasts of No Nation Venice Review In short they all offer very strong support for Depp who takes control of the proceedings from the outset and never yields it except for when he disappears for a while in the second half. Hes as charismatic as his character must be fully convincing and frightening as his Bulger toys with friends and enemies alike to keep them guessing hides his true intentions and dishes out punishment at an alarming rate. Depps instinct for observing underlaying and keeping things in then letting it all out when required pays big dividends here in a performance far more convincing than his previous big gangster role John Dillinger in Michael Manns Public Enemies; its unexpected very welcome at this point in his career and one of his best. The Boston locations are numerous and evocative and production values are strong to to bottom notably Masanobu Takayanagis cinematography Stefania Cellas production design and Kasia Walicka-Maimones costumes.

September 4 2015 | 0200AM PT Johnny Depp does career-best work as notorious Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger in Scott Coopers taut elegantly understated crime drama. The icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger stare out from the screen in Scott Coopers ""Black Mass"" like the gaze of some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait holding his ground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly calculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing Bulger embodies the role or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny Depps mesmerizing performance -- a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires -- is the chief selling point of ""Black Mass"" there is much else to recommend this sober sprawling deeply engrossing evocation of Bulgers South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an anti-""The Departed"" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case) the movie has an intentionally muted 70s-style look and feel that may limit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd but quality-starved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the falls first serious awards-caliber attractions. Based on the exhaustively researched book of the same name by Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill (who make cameo appearances in the film) ""Black Mass"" passed through the hands of several directors (including Jim Sheridan and Barry Levinson) on its way to the screen and nearly fell apart entirely in 2013 when Depp briefly quit the picture over a reported salary dispute. But the project found the right steward in Cooper who showed a sure hand with actors on his prior ""Crazy Heart"" and ""Out of the Furnace"" and who here challenges Depp to give the kind of less-is-more performance the actor has scarcely been asked to deliver in the post-""Pirates of the Caribbean"" era. And Depp more than rises to the occasion doing career-best work as a man who might easily have been played for ghoulish caricature (a la Jack Nicholson in ""The Departed"") but instead emerges as a complex undeniably charismatic figure who draws other criminals and lawmen alike into his cult of sociopathic personality. Indeed it takes a few moments to fully recognize Depp -- transformed by latex contacts and dramatically receding whitish-blond hair -- in the films opening scenes set in 1975 just as Bulger was beginning his ascent as the leader of the Winter Hill Gang a loose confederacy of Irish- and Italian-American hoods vying for control of the South Boston streets against the mob-connected Angiulo brothers. Bulgers turf war coincides with the homecoming of Connolly who has established himself as a rising Bureau star on assignment in San Francisco and New York and who has returned to Boston with the explicit task of taking down the Angiulos and their associates. To do this he conceives of the plan that will ultimately lead to his undoing recruiting his childhood friend Bulger to supply the Bureau with intel about his rivals in exchange for de facto immunity for his own dirty dealings. In Connollys logic Bulger wont be a ""rat"" per se but rather will enter into an ""alliance"" a quid pro quo of sorts that will also help him to rid himself of the competition. (Bulger for his part would later deny ever having served as an informant claiming he paid the FBI for information and not the other way around.) ""Black Mass"" hinges on this increasingly compromising pas de deux and Edgerton (sporting a flawless Boston accent) is superb at showing how the ambitious but straight-laced Connolly is ever more seduced by the decadent gangster lifestyle his professional ethics muddied by the clan loyalty and street justice that in some corners of Boston are more sacred than the Constitution. But working from a script credited to Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth (other hands are also said to have been involved) Cooper enlarges the frame to give us a full-bodied portrait of both mens worlds -- in some ways diametrically opposed in others oddly similar. Each has his own crew -- the fellow thugs Bulger keeps close and sometimes turns against in hair-trigger fashion (including the very good Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane as right-hand men Kevin Weeks and Steve Flemmi); the fellow agents (played by the likes of Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott) whom Connolly manipulates in an elaborate shell game designed to deflect attention from Bulger and himself. And though Connolly is the ostensible family man with a concerned wife (Julianne Nicholson) who sees him changing in ways he doesnt realize we also experience an oddly tender side of Bulger himself -- a devoted son to his elderly mother loving sibling to his state-senator brother Billy (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch) and a protective father who indoctrinates his young son in the ways of the streets (""If nobody sees it it didnt happen""). The script compresses the potentially unwieldy narrative into three major acts the second set in 1981 (when Bulger makes an ultimately ill-fated play to corner the Jai Alai gambling market in Florida) and the third in 1985 when the Bulger-Connolly alliance has so successfully eliminated Whiteys competitors that the agent can no longer shield the Winter Hill Gang from the wrath of a dogged federal prosecutor (Corey Stoll). And at each step Cooper stages taut riveting setpieces that feel destined for the genre canon including an unforgettable dinner scene (already revealed at some length in the films first trailer) in which Bulger turns a seemingly innocuous discussion of a ""secret"" family recipe into a blistering attack on the loyalty of Connollys supervisor John Morris (David Harbour). The insidious cackle Bulger unleashes at the end of that rant is about the closest ""Black Mass"" ever comes to the grisly gallows humor that has become the lingua franca of the gangster movie in the post-""GoodFellas"" era but mostly Depp and Cooper play things in a more understated key. Depp hasnt been this tamped down in a movie since he played second fiddle to Al Pacino in ""Donnie Brasco""; even his Oscar-nominated J.M. Barrie in ""Finding Neverland"" seems a whirl of outsized tics and mannerisms by comparison. Even great actors (Nicholson and Pacino being among the perfect test cases) can fall back on indulgences and bad habits when they feel theyre giving the audience what it wants to see. But Depp is fully restored here to the daring inspired performer of his early Tim Burton collaborations and ""Dead Man"" knowing he is so deep inside the role that whatever he does we will come to him. The violence in ""Black Mass"" when it comes is swift and brutal but nothing here is more startling than a single sudden dart of Bulgers eyes across a room. Working with a top-flight craft team that includes production designer Stefania Cella (""The Great Beauty"") and costume designer Kasia Walicka Maimone (""Foxcatcher"") Cooper bathes the film in a look that feels unfailingly true to the period without ever verging on kitsch; its a movie that isnt just taking place in the late 70s and early 80s but seems to have been made then. That feeling is further enhanced by the hard-edged elegance of cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagis 35mm widescreen lensing (which strongly recalls Gordon Willis work on ""Klute"" and the ""Godfather"" movies). In a complete about-face from his adrenaline-pumping ""Mad Max Fury Road"" soundtrack Dutch composer/producer Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) supplies an elegiac orchestral score that perfectly complements the films desperate wintry mood.

Gail Mooney says January 13 2016 at 1125 pm I saw the movie last night and really have to say I enjoyed the movie. Great characters portrayed in the movie by JDepp Dakota Kevin Bacon Julianne N and many others. Good Boston accents and loved scenes of Boston. Reply Shawn says October 26 2015 at 243 pm Saw the movie and was disappointed when I started to do some research into the whole scene came across a review from Kevin Weeks. It is eye opening Reply Mike says October 5 2015 at 744 am I agree with the review 100% Great movie. Johnny Depp is fabulous in his role of the sick minded Whitey Bulger. A must see Reply chip232004 says September 30 2015 at 112 pm This movie was awful. It was long and boring. The acting writing directing etc. I kept waiting for it to get better and more interesting but it didnt. Johnny Depp was not impressive as Bulger poorly cast. Reply Ernest Kinas says September 20 2015 at 1025 am I am from Boston. My grandparents and my Uncle Chris lived right on Broadway. They used to get Christmas cards from the Bulger family. I agree with whoever said that this territory was already covered successfully by Mssrs. Scorcese and Nicholson. This piece of garbage is nothing but a retread. I know several people whose lives were completely destroyed by this psychopathic monster and any attempt to portray Whitey in a human light is an incredible disservice to the victims and their families. Boycott it. Dont see it. But of course that will simply make you want to see it more right? Knowing what a complete den of perversion Hollywood is I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if Depp gets the Oscar nod at the annual Tinsletown circle jerk known as the Academy Awards. P.S. Johnny Depps ""thinning hair"" as Bulger is actually his real hair. Johnnys been losing his hair since 21 Jump Street. Peace and love Ernie the K. Reply James G says September 21 2015 at 306 pm I lived in South Boston for all the 70s and part of the 80s and am ashamed to say i knew of him and some of his associates as i worked sometimes in this organization and knew of some of the people he killed like Buddy Leonard and Tommy King he was a beast while scaring people to death but the streets were a lot safer then than they are now as Southie is now a safe haven to yuppies who can afford to change the neighborhoods and heroin addicts that rob and kill people for nothing but a fix Reply Sam America says September 17 2015 at 826 pm Donnie Brasco was Depps last great movie Nothing but garbage and that horrible Dark Shadows crap that wasnt even really a Dark Shadows movie. Hollyweird sucks and so has Depp. There is no reason to go to movies anymore with the garbage they make but this seems like a movie that might be good enough to take a chance and see if Depp has still got the goods to deliver. Reply JDF says September 23 2015 at 750 pm Johnny Depp is a legend. Reply JDF says September 23 2015 at 749 pm Donnie Brasco was not Depps last great movie. He did a lot of great movies after that. He gave some of his very best performances after that. You obviously havent seen much of his work since 97 Reply James says September 9 2015 at 1008 am Looks amazing. Reply iamtrue2bill says September 8 2015 at 957 pm I am delighted to read that Depp is again demonstrating his incredible talent and understated intensity that I remember so well in ""Johnny Brasco"" a favorite of mine. Sounds like this is a winner. I love a good crime drama. Reply oli says September 7 2015 at 1207 pm Those blue eyes still look very strange. Reply neobux login says September 4 2015 at 1004 pm Im very excited for this movie Johnny looks great. Reply ConnorFilm says September 4 2015 at 841 pm Im ecstatic to hear Depp as back in his prime. This is exactly the time of role Ive wanted to see from him. Sick of the pirate and clown shtick. Reply 85wzen says September 5 2015 at 123 pm Must agree that pirate stuff really set him back. Reply RTF372 says September 4 2015 at 104 pm As much as I like Johnny Depp I just cant see his treatment of Whitey Bulger outdoing Scorsese and Nicholson even if Depps portrayal is far more accurate. Ill see it. Hopefully by watching it with low expectations it might be a pleasant surprise like Donnie Brasco. Reply prophet1965 says September 4 2015 at 1153 am I hate to say it but this movie is gonna tank big time. No one is interested in this story. Reply James G says September 21 2015 at 258 pm it should tank its not the real true story nothing but fictional made from briefings of Boston Globe writers who thought they new the real details i know what i am talking about as i lived thru this era in South Boston and i am ashamed to say i knew him and his counterparts as i was sometimes involved with some of there devious plots working in there organization at times some of the things they say are not true as Johnny Matarano was number 1 hit man not Stevie Flemmi as Stevie was his right arm many people left out namely his girl fiend and cohert Catherine Greig and top collector Robert Ford who is now deceased and his successor Bobby OConnor with all the books written which i have read all and now these movies the real truth has not come out 100% yet at times my sister still tells me at holiday gatherings that i probably could tell a truer and more accurate version since i was aligned with them in the early years Reply Stephen says September 21 2015 at 443 pm So what kind of work did you do for themgt; Murica says September 4 2015 at 1219 pm Wrong loser This movie will be a hit. Reply prophet1965 says September 4 2015 at 1152 am I hate to say it but this movie is gonna tank big time. Reply James says September 9 2015 at 1007 am I hate to break it to you but its gonna be huge. Reply John says September 4 2015 at 1056 am Edgerton such an underrated actor. With younger Aussie actors like Worthington and Jai its a shame seeing Edgerton missing the push into big mainstream pictures Reply Daryle says September 4 2015 at 715 am I am so thrilled to see this review and hope the movie delivers. I have always thought that Johnny Depp was a unique and incredibly creative talent - perhaps the very best of his generation...and that Oscar sooner or later would recognize him. Maybe ""Black Mass"" will be the movie that brings him the statue. Hes been memorable in SO many films going all the way back to ""Gilbert Grape"" and ""Benny and Joon"" and is way past due for recognition. But if he gets honored for this one... it would be for a much more subtle controlled performance than for the daring flashier ones that made his characters unforgettable (e.g. Jack Sparrow Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood). I suspect that the Academy would HAVE to honor Depp with a lifetime achievement award some time regardless simply because the parade of characters hes uniquely portrayed would make such an irresistible visual montage for an Oscar audience Reply Robert McCabe says September 4 2015 at 637 am I cant wait Ill stand in line for it. Reply Sam says September 4 2015 at 545 am Those contact lenses on Depp look so unnatural and creepy which I suppose helped make the character. Reply Amber says September 4 2015 at 537 am So relieved to read this review Depp was on the verge of torpedoing his own career of late.This sounds like a real return to form. Reply IT 2 IT says September 4 2015 at 405 am PSYCHOPATHS are fascinating from some angles but in the end they have NO second act. Scorsese and Stone were responsible for replacing character development with PSYCHOPATHIC frenzy. Riveting --and repetitive NOWHERE. We understand Hollywood itself is now 100% PSYCHOPATH RUN. Judging by the lack of freshness variety and even genuine creativity we MUST believe its TRUE. Reply JohnThomas says September 4 2015 at 301 am Plant Reply buffalobilly says September 4 2015 at 242 am edgerton is xcellent as ever. depp is depp as usual...alas. Reply James says September 9 2015 at 1005 am So Depp is as amazing as ever too? Reply Movie Expert says September 4 2015 at 237 am his best performance is Ed Wood Reply Marty Gillis says September 4 2015 at 650 am I agree. Ed Wood is most certainly his personal best and the one to beat for Mr. Depp.. Being a JD fan  I have high hopes for Black Mass.
