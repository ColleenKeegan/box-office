An odd little premise is developed in surprisingly effective ways in ""One Hour Photo."" This immaculately made first feature from noted musicvid and commercials director Mark Romanek provides Robin Williams with one of his creepiest atypical roles and the comic star responds with an unusually restrained performance that is in the end quite moving. Supported by good reviews Fox Searchlight should be able to cultivate a sizeable audience in broad specialized release for this offbeat but accessible picture. His Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"" notwithstanding Williams occasional departures from his comic persona have not always been well received and he is definitely working in a different gear as Sy Parrish a blandly fastidious photo developer at the giant Savmart discount store. With pale skin and thinning cross-cropped blond hair Sy almost blends in with the decor and bright lighting of the establishment where he prides himself on the exacting standards of his work. Among his favorite customers are the well-to-do Yorkins who to Sy look like the ideal family Nina (Connie Nielsen) is fashion-model gorgeous Will (Michael Vartan) could be a movie or rock star and 9-year-old Jake (Dylan Smith) is a fine normal kid. Whenever they come in Sy is solicitous to the edge of obsequiousness. But the weird nature of Sys attachment to the Yorkins is revealed when after dining alone in a coffee shop he returns to his forlorn little downtown apartment an entire wall of which is covered with hundreds of pictures of Nina Will and Jake through the years copies of which Sy has surreptitiously printed at work. Without any personal life of his own Sy has become an emotional rather than voyeuristic peeping Tom willing himself figuratively into the Yorkin family. In a fantasy he makes himself at home in their house when theyre away he visits Jake at soccer practice and offers the boy a present that Will wont buy for him. His attentions while excessive never really seem threatening although there is obviously such a degree of loneliness and apartness about the man that it wouldnt be surprising if something unsavory were to one day come bubbling to the surface. And so it does when Sy is abruptly fired from his beloved job. At nearly the storys halfway mark Sy is let go when his supervisor (Gary Cole) discovers the huge discrepancy between the number of photos paid for and actually printed. At the same time Sys world is further shattered when photos left by a sexy customer suggest that shes having an affair with Will. Deeply distressed that ""his"" perfect family has been poisoned Sy gives copies of the photos to Nina and begins spying on Will thus initiating an increasingly sick form of revenge on the man who he feels has thrown away the most precious thing in the world the sort of happiness that proves unattainable for so many people Sy included. As curious a character as Sy is and as misguided as his eventual actions become the story is saved from slipping off into the simply macabre by its emotional validity. At the very end however too explicit a point is made for Sys deep-rooted psychological problems as Romanek makes easy use of a pat explanation for aberrant behavior even as he leaves matters on an open note. While remaining within a narrow expressive range as dictated by the circumscribed nature of his role Williams keeps Sy interesting all the way and crucially resists playing for sympathy and sentimentality. Other significant cast members including Nielsen Vartan Smith and Eriq La Salle as a police detective are solid in an understated manner. From a technical point of view the film is nearly as fastidious as Sy himself. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweths clean and crisp compositions Tom Fodens elegantly spare production design and Jeffrey Fords no-fat editing all function like precision instruments in helping Romanek create a pristine-looking picture and the outstanding electronic score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek helps channel the various moods in subtle ways.

It got to the point where insulin shots should have been sold along with the tickets to his films. Williams says he was rarely offered villainous roles and was actively looking for challenging parts. Whatever the reason the Academy Award-winning actor certainly did change gears -- big time. In three films this summer Williams has played decidedly non-warm-and-fuzzy roles with varying results. His turn as a psycho kiddie-show host in ""Death to Smoochy"" bombed bigger than Michael Jacksons latest album but as a killer in ""Insomnia"" he was actually quite good. Now ""One Hour Photo"" ends his 2002 summer of the bad boy trilogy and this dark obsessive drama may be the best of the lot. Williams plays Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish an unassuming man whose clothing skin and hair are all the same bland shade of beige. He lives his life leaving no trace behind. His primary contact with the world is through his job as a one-hour photo technician at his local SavMart a large graceless discount store.

Starring Robin Williams Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan. Directed by Mark Romanek. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""One Hour Photo"" is the movie that suggests that its not only best not to talk to strangers but that its probably also a good idea to avoid anyone remotely needy or lonely. After all even someone who looks benign -- even someone who looks as beneficent as Robin Williams -- could turn out to be a knife-wielding psycho. Needless to say the thinking part of this thriller needs work. Its not nearly as intelligent thoughtful or penetrating as it promises to be. Yet the consistent delicacy and emotional clarity of Williams acting in ""One Hour Photo"" makes the picture impossible to dismiss. Its his fullest and yet most restrained effort a performance characterized by many of those little moments of pained introspection that are his trademark. He plays Sy who runs the photo-developing lab at the local Savmart. Sy has nothing in his life but his job and his fantasies -- no friends no family no wife no girlfriend. The stove in his apartment is electric; otherwise hed probably put his head in it. He looks depressed in repose and downright suicidal when he smiles. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / The picture of creepiness / Williams loner is simply nuts in One Hour Photo Sys obsessive nature has a good side. The prints he develops in his lab really do look gorgeous. The bad side is that he is also developing a fixation on a family the Yorkins and has an entire wall of his apartment plastered with photos of them dating back 10 years. And now -- though the movie never specifies an emotional trigger -- hes going crazier following the boy (Dylan Smith) home from school and sitting outside the Yorkins Brentwood home fantasizing about being welcomed into the family unit. He wants to be Uncle Sy. Williams has a great little moment in a scene in which Sy deliberately runs into the mom Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) in the food court of a mall. He talks about having developed all the Yorkins family pictures over the years and then adds that he thinks of himself as ""Uncle Sy."" He tosses this off with a perfect little laugh. Sy is offering up a treasure from his inner life and presenting it as an idle thought -- even as hes hoping for some kind of invitation or welcome. Its the kind of personal moment that only movies can convey. Though the whole look of ""One Hour Photo"" would suggest a thoughtful piece of work -- production designer Tom Foden drains every Sy scene of color except for white and grayish blue -- the movie has few thoughts to offer up. Sys voice-over comments about photography and the preciousness of individual moments are both banal and irrelevant to his crackup. Gradually it becomes obvious that having created Sy writer-director Mark Romanek has little insight into him. Its probably a good idea that Romanek doesnt give Sy a garden-variety psychosis. He doesnt make Sy sexually obsessed with the wife or weirdly obsessed with the child. Yet leaving Sys madness generalized and unspecific is no solution at all. We understand that Sy is lonely -- that he sees the Yorkins as his ideal -- that his life as an outsider is driving him mad. But could that be it? Sy just wants to be upper middle class? Its the irony of ""One Hour Photo."" For all the screen time devoted to Sy and for all of Williams investment of emotional capital the filmmakers grasp of Sys problem is no more sophisticated than that of the Yorkins. To them as for Romanek he remains the other the fellow with less who wants more. They look at him and think two things Wouldnt it be awful to live with less stuff? Wouldnt it be awful if he came after our stuff Its hard not to see the movie as an unintentionally comical elaboration on class anxiety. Yet none of this takes away from Williams achievement. This is a daring role and he does it well. This may be the third picture in a row in which Williams has played an unwholesome character but ""Death to Smoochy"" and ""Insomnia"" were departures. Sy the Photo Guy is a lot like other Williams characters only nutty. The movie gives audiences permission -- indeed it invites us -- to see Williams in his smiling benevolent mode as creepy. Its probable that Williams and his audience can go back to the gentle tear- and-a-smile stuff but after ""One Hour Photo"" its hard to see why either would want to. This movie contains violence nudity and strong language.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Its even more startling when that oh-so-familiar face morphs into one that is infinitely forgettable and nearly invisible. Robin Williams accomplishes these feats with astounding skill in One Hour Photo. After such misfires as Patch Adams and the more recent Death to Smoochy one might have forgotten the breadth of Williams impersonation talents. But seeing the manic comic metamorphose into the sinister yet sad Sy Parrish the efficient photo technician reminds us what a talented actor Williams is. We know from the start that something terribly wrong has happened. The movie opens with Sy sitting in an interrogation room talking to a police detective. We also can feel the aura of grim foreboding that director Mark Romanek conveys throughout the movie. We soon learn that Sy has a frighteningly intense sort of crush on the Yorkin family an attractive and affluent couple with an adorable young son who regularly bring photos into the SavMart for developing. Their name derives from ""your kin"" and that is exactly what Sy believes the family is to him. He keeps an extra set of all their pictures imagining himself their beloved uncle. When Sy is not stalking the Yorkins or marking time in his featureless apartment he is on the job taking his mundane tasks way too seriously. He points out that if anyone centuries later would look through our photo albums ""they would conclude that our lives were joyous."" His life is anything but. As Sy Williams slows down to an eerily deliberate pace. Perhaps repressing all that energy helps him appear all the more frighteningly contained like the proverbial time bomb. He grows increasingly terrifying as he breaks into the Yorkin home tracks down their son (Dylan Smith) at a neighborhood soccer game walking alone with him and presenting him with a toy. When Sy finally becomes completely unhinged the movie loses some of its chilling potency going from a psychologically gripping portrait to a pulpy thriller (though not a predictable one). But Williams remains unnerving throughout devolving from a modern-day Boo Radley to a methodical criminal a la Taxi Drivers Travis Bickle. One Hour Photo takes Robin Williams to darker and more complex places that we cant turn our eyes away from.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

In Sys case its obsession with the Yorkins a family of customers as handsome and richly tinted as Sy is blurry and underexposed. To the stunted lonely Sy a dun-colored man who lives in a sterile impersonal apartment stylish Nina (Connie Nielsen) her architect-husband Will (Michael Vartan) and their huggable young son Jake (Dylan Smith) are the photogenic picture of family closeness; certainly they appear to be happy in the photos they have dropped off for processing over the years. In fact after handling the Yorkins snapshots for so long Sy has almost come to believe - actually psychotically to believe - that hes a member of the perfect Yorkin family too. ""One Hour Photo"" is about what can happen when a man (unbalanced by circumstances in his own miserable life and of course by the nerve-deadening mall culture so attractive to indie filmmakers) is wrenched from his illusions too abruptly and without supervised medical care. In Sys case the opaque friendless clerk goes from being a simple and creepy obsessive to being a complicated and dangerous stalker. And the movie goes from being music-video director Mark Romaneks slick and simple study in human isolation to being a pulpier and squarer flick. (Sy tells the story in flashback in a police interrogation room; from now on at least he couldnt hurt a fly.) On the one hand Romanek (director of Madonnas ""Bedtime Story"" and Nine Inch Nails ""Closer"" videos) who says he was influenced by the trip-wired loners of classic 70s films like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Conversation"" becomes too enthralled by his own portrait-of-alienation camera shots at the expense of laying a believable foundation for that estrangement in his script. ""Youre neglectful. Youre never here"" Nina accuses her husband although weve got no backup for the accusation based on the hundreds of photographs accumulated as a family. On the other hand Williams Sy is so fascinating and pitiless that the actors performance overrides the directors penchant for fancy-video moments (e.g. Sys dream that his eyes are spurting blood). Dark grim unsympathetic roles like this one and the crafty murder suspect he played earlier this summer in ""Insomnia"" are proving to be the very identity- and career-revitalizer the protean Williams misplaced during his dismally sappy ""Bicentennial Man""/""Patch Adams"" movie years. Watching an episode of ""The Simpsons"" without laughing from his sad easy chair or looking through a new batch of Yorkin photos with way too much pleasure Williams shows us Sys misery with no funny business. In ""One Hour Photo"" his is a snapshot of human complexity worth framing.
