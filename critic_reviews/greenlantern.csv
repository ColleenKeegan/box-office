Repeated studies by psychologists and marketers have shown that when confronted with a multiplicity of similar options in consumer products -- say two dozen brands of yogurt or peanut butter -- people become overwhelmed and rather than making a choice do nothing. Thats whats going to happen with all these men-in-tights. This weekend its ""Green Lantern"" which features a longtime stalwart of the D.C. Comics superhero stable. (""Lantern"" is Warner Bros. attempt to get another comics franchise up and running alongside its durable duo Superman and Batman.) Of course despite their super powers not every unitard-wearer has what it takes to make the leap from page to screen. Remember Supergirl Daredevil Elektra Batwoman Spawn the Hulk (a two-time loser) and the Fantastic Four? (Granted there were two FF movies and a reboot is possibly on the way but that quartet was seriously yawn-inducing.) ""Green Lantern"" doesnt sink to those levels. Its a ho-humly competent example of the genre but despite all the supernatural zipping around planets stuff going on it never manages to make any magic. The increasingly ubiquitous Ryan Reynolds stars as the special powers ring-wearing world-saving title character. In regular life hes Hal Jordan an ace test pilot whose cocky swagger is a cover for his deep-seated fears all stemming from when he was a boy and witnessed his father also a test pilot perish in fiery crash. As the first human tapped to be a part of an elite galactic peacekeeping force the Green Lanterns its up to Hal to save Earth from the movies villain Parallax a fire-breathing black cloud with a scowling face. Along the way he finds time for some superhero training sessions in a galaxy far far away and here on his home planet to romance Carol Ferris (Blake Lively who actually shows a spark of promise) a fellow pilot and rising executive. Director Martin Campbell (""Casino Royale"") makes sure the expected story beats all arrive on schedule and Reynolds brings a lightweight Im-not-taking-any-of-this-too-seriously charm to the proceedings. But not for a moment does a single character on screen seem even vaguely real nothing in the plot has consequence and theres no deeper meaning (or even metaphorical symbolism) to any of this. Which is exactly the point many would argue. ""Green Lantern"" is a summer movie and its supposed to be loud dopey fun and nothing more. Yes but. In the dark of a movie theater all these superheroes are beginning to sound look and act alike. So heres my modest proposal Why not just put all these guys into one big Ultimate Fighting pit and let em duke it out ""Hunger Games""-style? The last one standing becomes the only superhero allowed to have his (or her) own movie franchise for at least the next 10 years. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Green Lantern | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Green Lantern Print Page Email Page Search Green Lantern  (2011; Rated ) C- "" Hes an ambiguously...heroic hero."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Green Lantern (2011; PG-13)In theaters Friday 17 June 2011Genre Action Science FictionCast Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (14) Post a Comment  Tedsaid on Tuesday July 03 2012 110024 PMI watched Green Lantern today with my 3D tv and found the movie to be more enjoyable than I remembered. I watched Spider-man last night and even though I loved the reboot I dont think that the 3D was as bright and dazzling as Green Lantern. Green Lantern looks sharp. Spider-man has a darker look. Critics are so very fickle. I dont think that GL received a fair score. There is no way that Spider-man deserved a 70 percent if Green Lantern deserved an 18 percent. I dont think that GL is overly campy.GL is no more campy than a teenager getting bit by a spider-or an alien with great molecular density defying gravity-or a god man guzzling beer with a scientist - or a woman spy grabbing ahold of a space craft flying at 45-60 miles an hour. The light show alone should garnish over 50% for Green Lantern. Scott Egglestonsaid on Saturday December 10 2011 105758 PMEarlier tonight I gave you a rather harsh comment because you didnt like this film. I want to officially apologize. I was acting like a prideful fanboy brat. I decided to veiw some of your other reveiws on such things as Machete and House of Wax (both of which i really enjoyed). And i noticed you did give positve reveiws to some comic films. Now Im not turning around and kissing your ass because you actually happen to like some of the movies I like. And Ill still never trust critics in general as i beleive in the individual and Im sure there are even people out there that liked ""Kickin It Old School"" haha. I felt the need to write this as even I dislike dickhead fanboys and refused to be seen as one. A respectful opinionated fanboy is better and thats how Id like to be seen. Ohter than that Green Lantern was great Scott Eggleston said on Saturday December 10 2011 92425 PMSigh You just cant wait to trash these films can you Roeper? Dont lie to me. Your obviously not a fan. Hey I knew Id hate Twilight so I avoided veiwing it and when a friend asked me to give it a fair chance I did....and I hated it But thats obviously not my kind of movie. Plenty of people like it its successful so I cant really knock it. But what I wont do is trash it publicly to people who might actually enjoy it because obviously I KNEW it wouldnt be my kind of thing. Somehow I think its the same with you Richard. You went into this with a air of contempt anyway. Hell you just bashed a highly beloved character. Obviously you dont like Green Lantern as a character anyway so why watch it and press your opinion on others who do. Now I understaind its your job but you dont seem very credible when you just ooze with ""I could care less about this franchise or comic movies in general"" vibe. Seems unfair but I understand thats the way the reveiw buisness is done. Makes me sad. Green Lantern had a few setbacks in the way of being true to the core material (something you obviously wouldnt catch) but on a whole it gets an acceptable score from this fella. It did its job as a movie. It entertained me and my compadres. But hey Im just an average joe not a big time movie maker like yo-....oh yeah...Heck man if you even post this comment Ill be suprised... nonyasaid on Friday September 02 2011 22759 PMa movie for geeks written by geeks made by geeks it lacked any soul. I made the mistake of thinking Ryan Reynolds might make Green Lantern more than it is even getting close to being comparable to Edward Nortons resurrection of The Hulk series into something I look forward to seeing more of. Reynolds doesnt have it not sure if hell ever be one of those actors ever. dragonsaid on Monday August 08 2011 41419 PMdoes anyone think some movie critics read comicbooks before seeing comicbook film to get an idea what the movie amp; characters are all about or do they go to do there job without reading comics? it was good film i it some kid humor in it but thats hal jordan character is littel humor all serious origins of characters where exactly except for the evil force forgot its name  amp; yellow ring origin where changed. slightly a bit but still true to comic story unlike greenhornet Seth Mecklenburgsaid on Monday August 08 2011 20106 AMLike ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" this overly budgeted summer wannabe lacks a key component Soul. The action scenes have no dramatic kick and the ""romance"" or ""dramatic"" scenes or almost comparable to soap opera acting(or Twilight Saga Acting). Disappointing film. Lousaid on Friday July 29 2011 103138 AMI kind of liked the movie after seeing it for a second time yesterday. If you just forget all the negativity about the film and just watch it for what it is without judging every second then its rather enjoyable. The only part I absolutely hate is when Hal shows off in front of his friend Tom and then goes to ""get the girl"". That part couldnt be more cheesy and didnt fit into the movies mood at all. Anyway I believe now that the origin is out of the way a sequel would be a good idea to boot this franchise with Sinestro going evil. Its too early in the game to just call for a reboot which seems to be a solution to everything now. The sequel just really needs better writing a director who knows the material and focused as a space sci-fi epic rather than just another CBM flick. Gordonsaid on Wednesday July 06 2011 43151 PMRichard Thanks for the advice...I was on the fence but after seeing your review I think Ill wait for the RedBox. Tell Jim Johnson I said hey Stevesaid on Sunday July 03 2011 120110 AMGreen something thats for sure. Roch Longueepeesaid on Wednesday June 29 2011 100515 AMI was sorely disappointed with Green Lantern. The movie script had no substance. The acting seemed more suited for juveniles and children. Certainly when one compares movies like Batman Begins Spiderman Xmen etc... Green Lantern just doesnt make the grade at all. I am surprised by the generosity of some in their personal ratings of this film. The movie received way too much hype and promotion. I dont think Ryan Reynolds should hang his hat on this one. Terrible movie a waste of money. Comments 1 - 10 of 14 1 2 | Next 4   Page 1 of 2 POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

DC Comics - All Rights Reserved Another week another colossally budgeted superhero origins picture in murky 3-D DC Comicsa Green Lantern. Apart from having no particular reason to exist onscreen especially at these prices itas not half bad. The early computer-generated scenes on Oa the luminescent planet of the green lanterns (there are hordes) are gorgeous saturated in comic-book greens and violets and magentas and unbeholden to petty laws of gravity with the immortal bulb-headed aguardiansa suspended on long poles and draped in 100-foot-or-so-tall red capes. Itas too bad the rest of the movie isnat similarly unfettered. It falls to Earth wicked fast. It falls in fact in the form of esteemed alien lantern Abin Sur who has been mortally wounded by the intergalactic Parallax a cosmic mass with a somewhat discernible head that feeds (and grows larger and larger) on fear. The color of fear were informed many times is yellow as opposed to green which is the color of will. Poor Albin Sur must send his super ring to find a human to replace him (""Choose well"") despite the universally held belief that humans are too yellow to make good lanterns being ""all too human"" as the brilliant but hitherto irresponsible test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) puts it. Hal is spirited away by a green orb and plunked down on a beach beside the rapidly expiring lantern. Soon hes in a form-fitting one-piece superhero suit trying to pretend hes not all that humiliated. The promise of sequel money surely eased the embarrassment. Reynolds has a slender but muscular physique and a doughy face with a hint of self-mockery which makes him a treat in romantic comedies but less convincing when lecturing alien lanterns and guardians on the green versus yellow issue. Green he says is indeed the color of will and yellow of fear but to acknowledge ones yellow is not necessarily to turn yellow (although that can happen) but to make the green glow even more brightly. Unanswered is the question ""What is the color of boredom?"" Peter Sarsgaard gives Green Lantern a lift as the human villain Professor Hector Hammond. A balding scientist in love with a test pilot (Blake Lively) who prefers cocksure Hal Hammond gets infected by an alien parasite and his forehead swells up to the size of the Elephant Mans. Sarsgaard makes the man such an unholy mess of festering resentments that hes actually worthy of his bloated brainpan.

"Green Lantern | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; green-lantern ) Green Lantern (United States 2011) June 17 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to bringing their top-line superheroes to the big screen DC has been lagging behind Marvel in recent years. While Marvel has aggressively built franchises DC has shown little inclination to attempt more than occasional new installments for their Big Two Batman and Superman. Green Lantern which provides a motion picture introduction for another member of the Justice League is designed to change that. Although the idea of a Green Lantern movie has been floating around for about 15 years it wasnt until after the phenomenal success of The Dark Knight that it was (pun intended) green lit. Considering all the time this concept has been percolating however the result is disappointing. As origin stories go this one would seem to have the potential to be innovative. Unfortunately the four () credited screenwriters and director Martin Campbell do their best to force Green Lanterns uniqueness into the expected story mold. The result makes the movie seem assembled from bits and pieces of other superhero yarns rather than existing on a plane of its own. Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a hot shot pilot who puts ego above fraternity. A day after being fired for accidentally destroying an expensive fighter plane during a war game Hal makes an unlikely discovery a dying purple alien (Temeura Morrison) who gives him a green lantern imbued with cosmic powers and its associated ring. After putting on the ring and pledging allegiance to the lantern Hal finds himself transported to another world where he learns that he is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps a band of intergalactic warriors who use the power of Will to fight against the forces of evil and Fear. In addition to getting a quick crash course on how to use his Will and receiving a dressing-down from Sinestro (Mark Strong) the leader of the Green Lanterns Hal learns that an ancient enemy the Parallax has been released from its prison and is rampaging through the galaxy heading (of course) for Earth. Wearing a cool new costume Hal returns to his home planet to confront the Parallaxs agent Dr. Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) prove his worth to his ex-girlfriend Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) and defeat the bad guy. The Green Lantern screenplay has been assembled by picking plot elements from the Superhero ClichA(c) grab bag. Nothing is likely to surprise anyone Green Lantern fan or otherwise. On the other hand ignoring the cringe-inducing dialogue and occasional instances of CGI fakery it can be argued that the production has been assembled competently. Simply put Green Lantern is capable of diverting those who relish superhero movies but it contains little to seduce others. A viewers reaction to the trailer will provide an excellent gauge as to whether he will like the movie. Green Lantern is not a sequel but the pervasive sense of familiarity causes it to feel like one despite the origin plot line. Ryan Reynolds sells Hals transformation from self-absorbed hotshot to self-sacrificing champion. Reynolds interpretation of the Green Lanterns journey is similar to what Chris Pine gave us with James T. Kirk in 2009s Star Trek although its a cut below how Robert Downey Jr. traversed Tony Starks parallel character arc in Iron Man. The mentor/student relationship between Sinestro and Hal is far from the best weve seen in a superhero movie (contrast it with for example the one in Batman Begins). Reynolds does the best he can with the limited material he has been given. The most interesting secondary character is Hector Hammond although he is badly treated as Green Lantern moves toward its climax. Hectors conflicted angry personality his buried jealousy and his daddy issues all represent the building blocks of a fascinating anti-hero (not unlike Loki in Thor) but after developing him the screenplay cant seem to figure out how to use him so his potential is never fulfilled. Would that similar short shrift had been given to Carol who may be the most lifeless superhero love interest since Kim Basingers Vicki Vale in Tim Burtons Batman. As appealing as Blake Lively might be in the right role shes miscast here and it shows in her wooden unconvincing delivery. A life-size Barbie Doll would emote better. Visually Green Lantern is a mixed bag. The CGI is variable - occasionally impressive sometimes cartoonish. The 3-D although saddled with the usual problems is less aggravating than is often the case. In fact many scenes make little or no use of it so its possible to watch stretches of the movie without the glasses and not notice any double images. There is some blurriness during the action scenes but thats to be expected. 2-D is probably the way to go for Green Lantern but at least if youre stuck seeing it in 3-D you wont want to gouge your eyes out (although youll still have to pay the surcharge for the dubious privilege). Warner Brothers would like us to believe Green Lantern is one of the 2011 summers ""tent poles"" but this is more in the nature of what one expects from a February superhero movie. Its not the kind of production to generate excitement outside its core audience. Its passable entertainment but not much more than a two hour distraction. Green Lanterns generic derivative approach causes this motion picture to fall into the stereotyped hole from which the superhero genre has been trying to escape.

This force with apologies to The Merchant of Venice represents not jealousy but ""the will""--and yes if the historical echoes are somewhat unfortunate be forewarned that they will recur. (Note to filmmakers Having a promotional poster in which the martial heroes are all raising one fist in salute really doesnt help.) Where was I? Right in space. All was well until an evil countervailing entity called Parallax arose powered by a fear-energy colored yellow (or was that ""yella?"") and voiced by Clancy Brown--who ought to have this schtick down having over the years provided the menacing intonations of among other legendary baddies Hades Lex Luthor and Eugene H. Krabs of SpongeBob fame. Fortunately Parallax is captured and imprisoned on the planet Ryut by a powerful ""Green Lantern"" one of a corps of 3600 cosmic policemen empowered by the Guardians. Less fortunately his prison is evidently devoid of guards alarms or structural integrity. When a few harmless aliens set foot on the planet they immediately fall through the crust into the chamber where hes held thus ending the era of quiet Ryut. Parallax escapes looking something like a cross between Voldemort and the flying fetus from Hellraiser. After devouring a few planets and packing on a couple million pounds though he comes to resemble the intergalactic offspring of Cthulhu and a crude-oil spill. Cut to present-day Earth where test-pilot Hal Jordan (gifted? check; impulsive? check) is test-dogfighting a couple of high-tech drone jets which he ultimately defeats by risking his life (check) and crashing his plane (check). Various muckety-mucks are displeased with Hal (played by Ryan Reynolds) as is his flying-partner/sometimes-girlfriend/CEO-in-training-of-the-aeronautics-company Carol Ferris (Blake Lively). To make matters worse Hals near-death antics have spoiled the 11th birthday party of a beloved nephew who appears in this one scene and is then with the rest of Hals family completely forgotten. Oh and then an alien Green Lantern mortally wounded by Parallax crash lands on Earth and his ring--from which the Lanterns get their power; I mentioned this didnt I?--chooses Hals finger as its new home. Familiar motions are gone through the experimentation with great powers (flight the ability to create a green force field in the shape of anything Hal imagines) the rejection of same when he discovers that with them comes great responsibility etc. Hal is briefly whisked away for training on Oa the planet of the Green Lantern Corps but when the other Lanterns convince him that hes unworthy and the ring made a ""mistake"" he quits. (Yes this sequence is essentially Kung Fu Panda without the panda or the kung fu.)Reynoldss and Sarsgaards characters are like high-school stereotypes inflated to Nietzschean proportions. Back on Earth a homely xenobiologist named Hector (Peter Sarsgaard) who happens to be the exquisitely improbable son of a John-Ensign-pompadoured Senator (Tim Robbins) has been infected by a piece of Parallax and begins discovering powers of his own telepathy telekinesis and a tendency toward grotesque head-bloat. Hal returns from Oa to quarrel with an increasingly dangerous Hector rescue the Senator rescue Carol come to grips with his fears and fulfill other narrative obligations that you can probably guess more quickly than I can type them. Parallax decides that Earth and its billions of souls are next on his menu of interstellar entrees leading to a finale in which--never mind Im sure youre ahead of me already. A few years ago it seemed the superhero genre was utterly tapped out that wed be treated to a litany of Daredevils Catwomans and Ghost Riders before we again saw the likes of a good X-Men or Spider-Man. But since the surprise double-whammy of Iron Man and The Dark Knight in 2008 weve had better-than-to-be-expected luck with the inherently limited genre an overwrought but intermittently compelling Iron Man 2 a mildly diverting Thor a classy X-Men First Class. But now the piper has come for payment and the price is the manifold shortcomings of Green Lantern a woefully underdeveloped script; dubious casting (I dont care how many billion galaxies are out there in none of them is Tim Robbins the father of Peter Sarsgaard); slack aimless direction by Martin Campbell; and a set of decidedly uneven performances. Its hard to judge Ryan Reynolds who has shown signs of promise in the past given the material he had to work with. Like Iron Mans Tony Stark Hal is meant to be a charming wit; unlike him he has been provided no witty lines by the long list of (unwisely) credited screenwriters. Blake Lively is a flat-out dud the only way she could establish more distance from her surname would be to forego speech and locomotion altogether. And Mark Strong who plays Lantern honcho Sinestro does about as well as one could reasonably expect in a role that is essentially Spock with the pencil mustache of a 1940s cad. Perhaps worse than the shoddiness of the film though is its sour narrative undercurrent. This is at first evident only obliquely in the aggressive duality of ""will"" and ""fear"" and implicit assumption that other motivations (love? introspection?) are at best secondary. But it becomes decidedly more apparent in the interplay of the Reynoldss and Sarsgaards characters who are like high-school stereotypes inflated to Nietzschean proportions. Hal Jordan the buff beautiful promiscuous flyboy who disappoints everyone around him--especially Carol the putative love of his life--receives his comeuppance in the form of a) unimaginable powers; b) a profoundly unearned role as hero; and c) a skintight costume that presents his anatomical advantages in even starker relief. Sarsgaards Hector by contrast--a scientist and teacher--is from the outset made as homely as the cosmetic arts can manage a crummy little moustache a disastrous hairline that retreats into greasily mutinous Orphan Annie ringlets. Ignored by women and bullied by his successful dad hes nonetheless presented as a perfectly decent guy prior to his alien infection. Alas physiognomy is destiny and just as Hal is fated to become an intergalactic Adonis its Hectors lot to evolve into a psychic ogre at once vicious pitiful and doomed. Yes yes yes Its Hollywood and one should scarcely be surprised by the tyranny of physical beauty. But the superhero genre is the home-court of the underdog of skinny Peter Parkers and mutant outcasts of heroes born from pain or ingenuity. In Green Lantern the rich get richer and the rest are left to the meager consolations of the green-eyed monster.

Twitter previousWill the Maniac Always Dominate the Media?nextSmart but Not Wise Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

"Green Lantern A front-runner for the worst movie of the year. Slate Sign In Sign Up Green Lantern A front-runner for the worst movie of the year. Green Lantern A front-runner for the worst movie of the year. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 17 2011 138 PM Green Lantern Kind of like The Tree of Life except its terrible. By Dana Stevens Ryan Reynolds in Green Lantern Like Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life Martin Campbells Green Lantern (Warner Bros.) begins at the very beginning the origins of the universe.  And like The Tree of Life Green Lantern relies on extensive voice-over as it links those cataclysmic intergalactic events to the life of one mortal vulnerable man. True The Tree of Life doesnt include a giant many-tentacled villain named Parallax who subsists on the fear of his victims or a magical glowing green ring that lends its wearer superhuman strength and the ability to fly or a purple-blooded alien crash-landing in a swamp. But Malick is rumored to be preparing a six-hour directors cut so you never know. Another basic difference is that Tree of Life is already a front-runner for the best film I will see this year whereas Green Lantern is a powerful contender for the worst. Even by the standards of the current run of mediocre comic-book movies this one stands out for its egregious shoddiness. Its characters dialogue and pacing recall a destined-to-be-canceled Saturday morning cartoon from the early 80s or possibly an extended Hasbro infomercial. Advertisement Green Lantern opening voice-over informs us in a massive data dump of exposition that the Guardians ancient keepers of the universal order who resemble the large-skulled aliens from the pilot episode of Star Trek have created a ""galactic community of peacekeepers."" This corps of 3600 green-clad recruits is taught to harness ""the emerald energy of willpower"" in order to defend justice across the cosmos. When one of these do-gooders crashes his spaceship on Earth and realizes death is near he sends his ring or a green ball of energy emanating from the ring--something green anyway--to search for a worthy successor. Inexplicably the verdant glow alights on Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) a womanizing hot-dog pilot whos just been fired from his job testing state-of-the-art military aircraft for an aviation contractor. Hal has an endless supply of macho bravado but no real courage. His ex-girlfriend and fellow pilot Carol (Blake Lively) gives it to him straight Hal is an immature irresponsible twit perhaps due to unresolved grief over his pilot fathers untimely death. (Are there any superheroes with unproblematic fathers? Caped crusaders who just call their dads on Sundays to talk sports?) Hal figures out how to charge the ring with energy from a lantern the dying alien also gave him (a process not dissimilar from syncing your iPhone) and in no time hes traveling to the planet of Oa a sort of Camp Pendleton for Lantern recruits where hes given a crash course in the use of his new powers. But soon Hal must return to Earth to test his mettle against a double threat. Theres the abovementioned Parallax a city-block-sized galactic invader whos sort of an ash cloud in the shape of a fanged octopus. (Ill grant the movie this Parallaxs animated swirling smoke-tentacles look pretty rad.) The planets survival is also threatened by a more human enemy Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) a biologist who while dissecting the body of the alien was infected with an organism from its blood thats slowly taken over his body and deformed him horribly. In his pre-transformation phase Sarsgaard makes a pretty good villain-to-be with his quiet demeanor and creepily insinuating voice. (Nobody creepily insinuates like Peter Sarsgaard.) But when he turns into the giant-skulled slavering version of himself Sarsgaard overacts almost desperately as if struggling to be seen and heard under what must have been a very uncomfortable latex head. A word about Ryan Reynolds Though hes not able to harness the emerald energy of willpower to save Green Lantern from destruction hes also not at fault for the disaster. This is an actor who perhaps because of his network-television-grade handsomeness initially struck me as pleasantly bland. Then he made Adventureland in which he was outstanding as a pitiful amusement-park Lothario and I realized that Reynolds has the same problem as the young Brad Pitt Hes so good-looking that no one realizes how funny he is. Used in the right roles Ryan Reynolds could develop into a comic actor with the timing of a Paul Rudd and the body of a ... slightly hunkier Paul Rudd. Use your powers wisely Green Lantern. Turn down the role in the inevitable sequel and swoop in to save romantic comedy.Correction June 17 2011 This review originally included an article in the title of the movie. Its Green Lantern not The Green Lantern. ( Return to corrected sentence.) Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 17 2011 Save for later Saved Actor Ryan Reynolds is shown in a scene from the film Green Lantern. Warner Bros. Pictures/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Just in case you thought there werent enough comic-book superheroes crowding our screens heres ""Green Lantern"" starring Ryan Reynolds in green jammies and matching mask to set you straight. The way things are going the only movies getting financing will be franchise installments. Or are we already there?Franchise-wise ""Green Lantern"" which reportedly cost 300 million to make and market is not a done deal yet although Warner Brothers which owns the rights to the venerable DC Comics character boldly offers up the mandatory sequel teaser in the credits. Since quite a bit of ""Green Lantern"" is slowed down by exposition a sequel might actually be an improvement - less time spent setting up situations already known to fanboys of the comic book. On the other hand its been my experience watching these films that things inevitably bog down anyway. New villains need back story just like old heroes. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The director is Martin Campbell who shook up the ""James Bond"" franchise with ""Casino Royale"" starring Daniel Craig as a 007 looking a lot more pummeled than shaken or stirred. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Pictures Summer sequels 2011 Reynolds represents an altogether different mode His retro-handsomeness looks naturally airbrushed. Hes also blithely affable although this may not bode well in the long term. On the other hand Ive kind of had it with darkly brooding comic heroes even when theyre played by Robert Downey Jr. Its time to lighten up.That is not to say that ""Green Lantern"" is a marvelous antidote to all this gloomy gravitas. Its not only light its thin. Its self-deprecating to a fault. Reynolds is required to practically wink at the audience as if to say""I know this looks silly."" But at least the filmmakers acknowledge that Reynolds in green tights and mask still looks like his non-Green Lantern alter ego cocky test pilot Hal Jordan. Theres none of this Clark Kent/Superman silliness where Lois Lane cant seem to figure out that both men are one and the same.For those who havent been schooled in the DC Comic mythos Hal is chosen by the intergalactic police squad Green Lantern Corps to wear the ring that grants him the power to conjure up anything his mind can conceive. (Ive never understood why Green Lantern cant just conceive of an invincible weapon to vanquish his enemies but I guess Im being annoyingly literal-minded.)Before the movie is through he has battled not only renegade scientist and Elephant Man-look-alike Hector Hammond (deliciously played by Peter Sarsgaard) but the megavillain Parallax whose power comes from absorbing his combatants fear or some such. Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) resembles a tarantula that has ingested the entire Gulf oil spill. The love interest is supplied by Blake Livelys Carol Ferris herself an ace test pilot who doubles not altogether convincingly as an aviation company honcho. Its ""Top Gun"" meets ""War of the Worlds."" At least she isnt fooled Lois Lane-style by Hals green jammies. By the way for Ryan Reynolds completists there is now a new comic book in Bluewater Productions ""Fame"" series. The comic book as its been reported is all about Reynoldss rise as an actor from bit roles to ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" and ""The Proposal"" to his current Greenness. Next up in the series Michael Jackson 50 Cent and Howard Stern.Where is Parallax when you need him? Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action.)

But taken as a serious attempt to make an entertaining hero film? Egads. Disastrous. The wheels have fallen off and can be seen gently tumbling down the hill. Ryan Reynolds is your typical irresponsible fighter pilot. You know the guy you probably remember the archetype from Top Gun. This is the type of fellow who speeds down the highway and yet is always late so then has to double park his vintage ride right there on the street like a total miscreant. Hes a foolhardy individual shunning responsibility so of course theyve entrusted him with a one hundred and forty million dollar fighter jet. Dont act like that doesnt happen because it does. It definitely does. And so in our introduction to Reynolds Hal Jordan we learn that this is a guy who just wont play by the rules unless the rules include having rock-hard abs. If those are the rules hell play by them all night long. But were getting ahead of ourselves because the green ring hasnt even chosen Hal yet. The opening scenes start with an expository voiceover on Lantern philosophy and rules as if the screenplay is already throwing up its hands to say ""Ugh I give up."" Were whisked off to the glamorous planet of Ryut where some Green Lanterns are doing Lantern stuff in space suits. Theyre under attack Yeeps theres something terrible out there an awful yellow something of fear and this guy is almost certainly the bad guy The angry yellow fellow is named Parallax though he looks a bit like the ""Yellow Bastard"" from Sin City. Parallax mocks the doomed Lanterns as they perish just so you know the type of hombre youre dealing with and then we get defeated scriptwriter technique number two. Six months later... One can only imagine what Parallax has been up to for the past six months though I could definitely see a fear-monster of his ilk starting fake wedding registries and buying illegal fireworks across state lines. Such is the level of his nastiness. A new Lantern heads out to challenge him but it all goes terribly awry and THIS is how Ryan Reynolds finally gets to become THE Green Lantern the first human one ever protector of Earth and overall swell fighter pilot dude. But first... Weve got to see young Hal Jordan strut his stuff. Its here that the ""daddy issues"" theme will present itself a theme that will hammer you over the head Thor style until you pledge to understand that Hal Jordan is complicated and troubled. Blake Lively is Jordans fellow F-35 pilot (naturally) and they are tasked with dogfighting the newest in robot fighter plane technology as part of a presentation. Theyre employed by a defense contractor you see. Blake Lively is Carol Ferris (in the movie) the daughter of someone named Mr. Ferris who heads up (or used to head up) Ferris Aero-planes. That established Reynolds and Lively don their flight suits to duel the robot fighter planes so they can sell them to the government so that everyone lives happily ever after off the tax dollar fat of the land. Unfortunately frickin Hal Jordan pulls one of his typical jerk moves and instead of allowing the robo-planes (patent pending) to shine he goes out and instead wins the dogfight. Ugh men are the worst -- amiright ladies? This puts the government contract in peril because who in sam hell would want to buy robot fighter planes that cant even shoot down a mavericky loose cannon sort of guy? Chances are should these robot planes ever come up against someone who took their job seriously theyd be in a whole heap of robot trouble. This whole ""winning"" thing makes Carol Ferris furious because its just like Hal Jordan to blow a billion dollar defense contract. So Hal Jordan super jerk. Got it. No way this guy finds redemption eh? And where the heck is that green ring at anyway? Flashcut to a doomed alien Lantern crashing on Earth and telling the ring to go choose someone worthy. Sadly the ring doesnt want to leave him so he has to throw rocks at it in order to get it to leave. Whoops sorry that was Harry and the Hendersons. No the ring finds Jordan and hes whisked off to Abin Surs side (the Lantern who crashed). Sur and Jordan chat for a bit and then Sur hands over the ring telling Jordan to grab the lantern out of his spacecraft. And say the oath Its handled with all the haphazardness of a first date which it kind of is except for the alien dying plus the whole Lantern angle. Now lets reflect on what weve learned. Jordan is not equipped to be a Green Lantern thats been made extremely clear but we can tell from the posters and title of the film that hell likely just have to figure it out. That transformation would make sense as a narrative for a film and is the momentum behind quality superhero products weve seen before so its not the concept thats so mightily flawed. Its the execution. The motivation behind the villains including the yellow fear monster could have been thought up by a reasonably priced blender. The plot doesnt flow in the slightest. The whole mess is an extended trailer or the sound a 10th grader makes when he knows he hasnt done his homework and the teacher is about to ask him about it. The movie shouts at you the entire time punishing the audience but it never says anything remotely important or interesting. Here are some of the key notes the film hits Hal Jordan is crazy Ugh can he and Carol Ferris MAKE THIS WORK?? This guy just blew a defense contract The Lanterns are under attack Hal Jordan is now Green Lantern Hes afraid But hes also awesome Parallax Fight Fight Fight Each of these scenes is five minutes and none of them have much to do with the other. Main characters make sweeping proclamations that dont relate to anything. At one point were told that fear is the enemy and that Lanterns dont fear and then the bad guy comes ... and hes not scary but the Lanterns are terrified and getting obliterated and wait I thought they didnt fear? The movie wants logic to bend about 12 different ways and it doesnt earn any of it. Either the bad guy actually is scary or the Lanterns actually are courageous and Hal actually is irresponsible or hes not and just make a decision already. There are also moments where its not entirely clear they werent making a Waiting for Guffman-style comedy. When Hal Jordan transforms into Green Lantern a little mask appears over his eyes. This is to ""protect"" his identity. And amazingly it basically works. I imagine when people starting asking questions about who the Green Lantern was eyewitnesses would say ""He had the hair height and facial structure of Ryan Reynolds. But I didnt get a great shot of his forehead ... so really it could be anyone."" I mean why bother with a mask that clearly hides nothing? Just skip it altogether or make it a real mask. But dont show us a cheesy mask and then make it logically effective within the story. Theres also a character who is introduced to the camera as hes playing chess. Did they have a meeting where people threw out ways ""to make a guy look smart"" without having to waste dialogue? Oh I see. This smarty is playing chess. Better keep an eye on that one audience In another scene a villain is put under sedation wakes up only to hear another character give a speech before someone shouts ""Keep him under"" Why wasnt he kept under in the first place? And why did he get to hear the speech before someone gave the order to knock him out again? Its almost as if no one cared to try hard enough to tell a coherent and engaging story. Then theres the issue of scope. Were told that 3600 Green Lanterns protect the universe they have meetings a code and a home planet. Were then informed that the home planet must be protected from Parallax But why? Why must it? Four seconds ago I didnt even know this place existed and now Im supposed to care if it gets eaten by a yellow fear monster? Again nothing is earned no story is told and everything is handled with the care of a toddler. Knock some buildings over make a few loud noises and hope mom comes soon with a bottle. Spoiler alert she doesnt. All of these items (and more) add up to a big ol mess. Theres a scene in the film where Hal Jordans friend looks at him in full Lantern regalia and giddily exclaims ""Youre a superhero"" Sadly as an audience with decades of legitimate superhero films under our belt we can all see the lie in his eyes.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 17 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The venerable DC Comics has two big names in its catalogue - the extraterrestrial Superman and earthbound Batman - both of which have yielded profits in various media for the past seven decades. Though of a similar vintage The Green Lantern has flickered on and off over the decades with a half-dozen different human protagonists playing the space-cop character and until now has remained on DCs second shelf with Wonder Woman Flash and Aquaman. Movies Green Lantern The official trailer One consequence is that the new Warner Brothers. movie groans with the strain of explaining who Green Lantern is while also trying to sell the movie as a big eye-popping summer entertainment. What gets sacrificed on the altar of this new franchise launch is any real sense of fun. In an overcalculated effort to cover all the bases the movie is tonally all over the place. Spectacular and pompous grim and glib and disconcertingly choppy it grabs bits from Star Wars The Mask Top Gun and Superman in a sort of superhero chop suey. Four writers are credited to the screenplay which unfolds as if the scenes were worked on in isolation chambers - cutesy romantic followed by high-tech gibberish followed by cosmic mythological mumbo jumbo. In the needlessly elaborate voice-over introduction we learn that the ""Green Lantern Corps"" is a federation of space cops who have divided up the universe in 3600 sections to patrol. They are overseen by the guardians who energize the universe with the force of Will. Then an enemy emerges called Parallax who uses the force of Fear which is defined as the opposite of Will. (Colour-coding keeps things clear Will is green and Fear is yellow.) When one of the top Green Lantern Corps soldiers was fatally wounded by Parallax he transferred his power - along with an accompanying magic ring and its power charger a green lantern - to a new Lantern human test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). A separate snazzier introduction takes us out of legend mode into regular life on earth where Hal is introduced as a smart-alecky womanizing reckless test pilot. Though apparently fearless Hal is haunted by a childhood flashback in which he saw his own pilot dad go up in flames on the tarmac. One evening Hal gets snatched up in a ball of green light and is transported to an distant space training centre. There he gets advice from the fish-faced alien Tomar-re (Geoffrey Rush) gets knocked about by the military trainer Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan) and sneered at by the Lantern commander Sinestro (Mark Strong). Hal decides that as a vulnerable human he may not be cut out for this line of work. Unless of course a threat to humanity and the love of a good woman can cause him to man up as Hal realizes he along with the guardians of the universe have been suffering from a linguistic misunderstanding; What is needed isnt ""fearlessness"" but ""courage."" Ho-hum. As the cocky pilot Reynolds is in his familiar element in early scenes but as the film moves into its second hour the lack of connection between Hal the wise guy and Hal the wide-eyed sincere mask-wearing humanity-saving hero feels incoherent. The character doesnt evolve he diverges down two parallel paths. The ultimate showdown sees Hal facing the evil monster Parallax who goes on a Godzilla-style city-stomping visit to earth. Moderately more compelling are the two other bad guys of the piece with Strong buried under beet-red makeup as the ambiguously-motivated Sinestro. Best is Peter Sarsgaard as scientist Hector Hammond who is inadvertently exposed to Parallaxs poison which causes Hectors head to swell with growths and his eyes to turn yellow as releases his pent-up rage at a lifetime of geekdom. Though comic book stories can no longer be described as appealing solely to adolescent sensibilities cliches die hard Why is a bad skin condition still the surest indication that a character wants to wreak vengeance on humanity?

Starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Director Martin Campbell Running time 145 Release Opened Jun 17 2011  Editorial Review Green Lantern is passable plausible -- and none too illuminating By Mark Jenkins Thursday June 16 2011 Of the available green heroes the Incredible Hulk Kermit the Frog or even Al Gore seems more likely to carry a movie than Green Lantern. But the third-string DC Comics character has nonetheless been selected to hold the super-being turf at the worlds megaplexes for a few weeks between ""X-Men First Class"" and ""Captain America The First Avenger."" ""Green Lantern"" is capable of doing that although its neither amusing nor exciting enough to ensure a long-running franchise. Like Captain America Green Lantern is a ""Golden Age"" comics hero debuting in 1940 -- a simpler time for strong-jawed do-gooders. The character has been reconceived many times since and this version is largely based on a 2004-05 update. But the premise still seems as musty as a dog-eared pulp magazine Earths Lantern is one of thousands of intergalactic cops who wear magic rings that draw their juice from ""the emerald energy of willpower."" Strong and resolute these are the sort of champions who can resist snacking between meals. The latest contender for emeraldhood -- whos introduced after a blandly cosmic prologue narrated by Geoffrey Rush -- has the courage thing down. Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a bad-boy test pilot forever striving to be as brave as the top-gun father he saw incinerated by exploding jet fuel. Yet Hal doesnt seem the hero type exactly. A self-described ""total screw-up"" hes personally unreliable and emotionally unavailable even to longtime love/hate interest Carol Ferris (Blake Lively). A fellow test pilot Carol is an executive at her fathers aeronautics company. (All the movies major characters have daddy issues.) Shes the kind of desk jockey who routinely wears sexy cocktail dresses to the office. Half of ""Green Lantern"" transpires in CGI-created outer space and yet this is the type of movie where all the central players are close at hand. Not only is Hals true love an office mate; so is his potential adversary Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) an eccentric ""xenobiologist"" who labors at the Ferris complex. (To add a dash of political discontent Hectors father is a smarmy U.S. senator played by a condescendingly grinning Tim Robbins.) Hal and Hector are thrown together -- and into opposing camps -- when a spaceship crashes on the edge of town. Inside is a dying Lantern whose ring selects Hal to be its new owner and thus the champion of this sector of the galaxy. But the wounded alien is infected with the evil of the Green Lantern Corpss greatest enemy Parallax. This blobby ever-changing monster is fueled by ""the yellow power of fear"" which is almost as frightful as the movies other nemesis the gray power of boredom. A bit of the icky yellow infects Hector who becomes disfigured with fury and resentment and suffused with campy theatricality. Hector also loves Carol of course although he knew he could never compete with Hal whos buffed to perfection and always impeccably unshaven. Even in street clothes Reynoldss physique seems otherworldly. Imagine what it looks like in a skin-tight super-suit that shimmers and pulsates like a lava lamp. Director Martin Campbell is perhaps best known for ""Casino Royale"" which brought some realism to the violence of James Bonds livelihood. Realism is not on the agenda for ""Green Lantern"" whose mayhem is loud and sweeping but impersonal. Campbells big challenge is knitting together the storys two strands the earthly and the extraterrestrial. He does what he can but the transitions between the two are choppy and the spacey creatures -- including Mark Strong as a Lantern who thinks that Hal isnt bright enough -- owe more to CGI than characterization. As in most superhero flicks the protagonist is more interesting when hes not in costume or at least has willed away his magic mask. The four credited screenwriters would never have cut it in 40s Hollywood but their bantering flirtatious dialogue is livelier than the action sequences. No matter how many times hes been reimagined Green Lantern retains a crucial flaw Hes a DC Comics character without the weaknesses and neuroses that make Marvel Comics heroes interesting (sometimes even on screen). What superpower does the ring give the Lantern? He can use green energy to create whatever he sees in his mind. Given that kind of dramatic blank check the movies battles are sure to be anticlimactic. The Lantern is less engaging when embroiled in deep-space combat with Parallax than when doo-wopping to the Fleetwoods ""Come Softly to Me."" Is that 1959 hit before your time? Then so is the sensibility of ""Green Lantern.""

Following his failed marriage to Scarlett Johansson hes become a failed superhero.       Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Geoffrey Rush gives voice to a monster amphibian (center) chatting with Ryan Reynolds. (Warner Bros. Pictures) His face largely pasted on a computer-generated body poor Ryan Reynolds acts only from the neck up in ""Green Lantern"" a relentlessly silly superhero flick with eyeball-rolling dialogue -- set in vast familiar-looking digital realms that look like rejected models from the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. I actually bought issue No. 1 of ""Green Lantern"" as a 10-year-old and Ive read up on the characters convoluted history since then. But I still had trouble following his densely plotted largely fun-free big-screen debut without a concordance. There are several screens-full of mind-numbing exposition at the outset. Someone is invariably explaining something at great length when they arent stiffly proclaiming things such as ""Your words are compelling young Earth Man"" (even if they really arent). The line is delivered by an animated amphibian voiced by Geoffrey Rush. Hes referring to Hal a hot-shot test pilot played (from the neck up anyway) by an uncomfortable-looking Reynolds who appears like hes ready for a fetish convention in his computer-generated costume. PHOTOS GOSSIP GIRLS amp; BOYS ON THE BIG SCREEN Hals been chosen for duty by a ring belonging to a dying extraterrestrial who was the greatest warrior among the Green Lanterns. Hal thus becomes the first human in a multispecies group protecting the universe under the guidance of a handful of wizened immortals. Got that? Using a ring he has to periodically recharge with a lantern -- and you thought your smartphone charger was cumbersome -- our hero can carry out his duties by materializing anything he can imagine as weapons. In practice though Hal is rather limited by the overly familiar concepts advanced by the movies four writers who effectively turn ""Green Lantern"" into a sort of poor mans ""Iron Man"" with corny special effects (presented in the usual eyeball straining 3-D). Sinestro (Mark Strong) the head of the corps -- whose heavily computer-generated appearance suggests that eyebrow shaping and tanning beds are popular pastimes at Green Lantern HQ -- is skeptical that irresponsible Hal has the willpower necessary for the job. But for reasons that remain as unconvincing as they are unclear Hal is the only one of 3600 Green Lanterns who can save Earth -- and the universe -- from Parallax a boring CGI villain and erstwhile immortal who resembles a particularly bad case of California smog. Since Green Lantern is basically computer-generated himself its not exactly exciting watching him battle the smog creature no matter how many chain saws and cannons he materializes. Martin Campbell (""Casino Royale"") is a capable action director but there isnt really much to root for in a movie where everything and everyone is more or less blatantly fake. Some sequences -- such as a helicopter crash thwarted by Green Lantern -- are so confusingly edited its hard to figure out whats going on. Blake Lively doesnt have a whole lot to do as Hals employer and occasional lover who sometimes requires rescuing. No great loss; she and Reynolds have minus-zero chemistry. Peter Sarsgaard (born in 1971) and Tim Robbins (1958) collect paychecks for chewing scenery as an amusingly unlikely son and father. Robbins is a fatuous US senator who arranges for his son a balding biology professor to conduct an autopsy on the dead E.T. -- with truly unfortunate results for both of them. Fellow Oscar nominee Angela Bassett also avoids the unemployment line in some of these scenes. ""Green Lantern"" gets so bogged down in the characters arcane mythology that it makes surprisingly little use of Reynolds facility for light comedy. I couldnt even figure out where the Earth scenes were supposed to be taking place (the press notes say the movie was shot in New Orleans). ""Let me prove to you our best days are not behind us"" Sinestro begs the immortals at one point. If the immortals are worried about the overworked superhero genre -- last months ridiculous ""Thor"" will be followed by next months ""Captain America"" -- their concerns are probably well-placed indeed. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Rita Wilson named editor of Huff/Post 40 site Read Next Rita Wilson named editor of Huff/Post 40 site Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 15006 How Hillary blew her big moment 8542 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 6130 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

By Francois Duhamel Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are lovers and fellow combat pilots in the film which is based on a comic book. EnlargeClose By Francois Duhamel Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are lovers and fellow combat pilots in the film which is based on a comic book. Instead its muddled overwrought and noisy. It may have something to do with the character being a second-string crime fighter or it may be because of an incoherent script. Basing a movie on a less popular comic book character did not hurt director Kenneth Branaghs Thor which did a much better job of creating a visually thrilling alternate universe. STORY Can Green Lantern ignite a franchise? VIDEO Watch the trailer The planet Oa where the Green Lanterns Guardians of the Universe reside is a big bore with vast terrain that looks blandly digitally rendered. A long tedious narration kicks things off reminiscent of Star Wars mind-numbing exposition. Theres lots of babble about the emerald energy of willpower and the importance of the peacekeeping Green Lantern Corps. This positive greenery is being threatened by Parallax an entity that rules via fear (signified by yellow) and seeks to upset the universes balance of power. About the film Green Lantern  1/2 out of four Stars Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong Tim Robbins Director Martin Campbell Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The action switches to Hal (Ryan Reynolds) a hotshot fighter pilot. We find out via intrusive flashbacks that hes scarred by witnessing the plane crash and death of his pilot father. As a child he asked his dad if he was scared. The answer was ""Lets just say its my job not to be."" Hal aspires to shrug off fear as lightly. He has the chance to incorporate this philosophy when he becomes the first human chosen by the Guardians as the warrior sworn to keep intergalactic order. He accomplishes this with the aid of a gaudy emerald-colored ring powered by a lantern. Also essential is his singsongy oath ""Let those who worship Evils might beware my power-Green Lanterns light."" While he fights his biggest enemy Parallax and faces off against the tough leader of the Lantern Corps Sinestro (Mark Strong) Hal cant seem to convey his affections to a mere mortal Carol (Blake Lively) his childhood sweetheart and fellow fighter pilot. Hal and Carol engage in an aerial pas de deux in their respective combat jets. His cockiness results in a crash landing that ruins pricey high-tech gear. Just as Hal is grounded he gets the intergalactic Green Lantern gig in a classic example of failing upward. Somehow he inherits the position from a dying purple alien who has crash-landed on Earth. And why not? Lantern rarely taps the charm Reynolds has shown in previous films. Consequently its hard to imagine why the nebulous Corps chose a cypher such as Hal as its savior. Tim Robbins plays a pompous politician and Peter Sarsgaard is his nerdy scientist son Hector who morphs into something menacing. Given how badly his father treats him youll feel sympathy for Hector rather than being frightened by his villainous transformation. And speaking of fathers Carol has a doting one while Hal had an idealized one. But no one appears to have a mother. Surely director Martin Campbell didnt intend for Reynolds skin-tight green suit to be the highlight in a movie cluttered with explosions stunts and CGI special effects. But theres not much else worth focusing on. For a movie that touts the importance of humanity Green Lantern is a strangely lifeless spectacle.

Comments click to enlarge Green Lantern Video Rated PG-13  114 minutes  2011 Warner Brothers tries to launch yet another superhero franchise with this big-screen vehicle for the green-masked DC Comics crime fighter whos been around in some form or other since the 1940s. The result is a deadly disappointment despite Ryan Reynoldss cocky muscle-flexing charisma as the daredevil test pilot turned intergalactic peacekeeper and Peter Sargaards movie-stealing turn as a nerdy scientist turned psycho monster. Director Martin Campbell did right by the James Bond franchise with GoldenEye (1995) and Casino Royale (2006) but a lot of this looks fuzzy and gloomy (the over-dark 3D version should be strenuously avoided).

Why just think of the possibilities. One could fly. Create an awesome race car out of thin air. Change clothes in an instant. One might even conjure a movie review of Green Lantern a discourse so brilliant that it gleams with pulsing cosmic energy. Thatd be nice. But if thats not possible Id be content with just a few paragraphs capturing the pros and cons of this half-campy half-compelling adaptation of the super-heroic DC comic books. First the pros Ryan Reynolds. Hes Hal Jordan the hotshot test pilot who inherits the ring from (as he puts it) ""a dying purple alien"" one in a corps of so-called Green Lanterns created by a race of megacephalic baldies to serve and protect the universe. The job requires him to be fit funny to not look like a complete boob in a digitized green costume that belongs in the produce aisle and to repeat the Green Lantern oath (""brightest day and blackest night no evil shall escape my sight"") without cracking up. He scores on all counts. Lovely Blake Lively as spitfire love interest Carol Ferris scores right beside him. Another pro -- in every sense of the word -- is Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond the sniveling mad scientist who performs an autopsy on the purple alien and winds up infected with the yellow goop that killed him. The goop comes from Parallax a monstrous planet-killing multilegged supervillain who uses the yellow energy of fear to defeat the green energy of willpower which is the greatest force in the universe -- except when it isnt. Now comic-book backstories are silly as a rule but this ones sillier than most - and Green Lantern embraces the silliness with the full force of big-budget cinematic mythologizing. After Hal gets his ring he whooshes through space to Green Lantern HQ on the planet Oa and meets many other lime-green Lanterns some of them bipedal (the talking fish voiced by Geoffrey Rush) some of them not (uh is that a bottle fly?). Parts of this will remind you of Star Wars. Parts will you remind you of Superman. Still other parts will remind you of G.I. Jane especially the bit where the muscle-headed Lantern voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan smacks around Hal in a training sequence. Oof. At first the cosmos newest Lantern just cant get the hang of the ring; when he does he isnt all that creative. The best he can muster is big guns and water stunts? Really? Wouldnt someone appointed to protect humanity devise lets see a water-purification system for impoverished countries? Overall director Martin Campbell (who made Casino Royale the least silly of all Bonds) and his screenwriting quartet do a much better job with the films Earth-based story lines -- especially its gothic horror arc - than the portions set on Oa. Many of the effects are good trippy fun and the 3-D conversion is A-OK (a definite pro). But a movie that advocates the power of imagination might have tapped a bit more of the stuff itself. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Gillette Silver Blue Razor Blades 100-Pack for 14 + free...

"" Take that as a sign of just how much time this ostensible action movie spends explaining itself.This is the problem with building a movie around a superhero that many (most?) people either dont know or know little about How much do you need to tell viewers before you can just start showing them? This is after all show business not tell business.Unfortunately director Martin Campbell and his quartet of screenwriters were unable to come up with an answer other than endless exposition. The result is a movie that is almost all prologue. An hour in and viewers are still trudging through back story and setup. At the 80-minute mark characters are still asking Superhero 101 questions like ""How does it work?""Its an understandable impulse given all green-energy-good yellow-energy-bad intergalactic peacekeepers history thats built into Green Lantern lore. But as with so many facets of comic-book mythology the more you try to explain it the less sense it makes. At some point you just want to tell the movie to shut up and start blowing stuff up.Finally almost 90 minutes in we get the first full-on fight sequence between superhero and supervillain. Except even then its not really the supervillain who spends all but the last few minutes floating through deep space. Its his earthly stand-in.Green Lantern represents Warner Bros. first attempt to do with DC Comics what Disney has done with Marvel Turn it into a reliable conveyor belt of comic-book-based action movies. While this effort doesnt prove to be the cinematic equivalent of making pancakes -- where you throw the first one away -- there are problems that the studio is going to have to address.The choice of Ryan Reynolds to play Hal Jordan the reckless test pilot who becomes humankinds first Green Lantern is a mixed bag. Hes got the Greek-god physique which is a requirement given the Green Lanterns speed-skater outfit. (Theres a drinking game to be played here where you take a shot every time Reynolds takes his shirt off.) In our post-Iron Man world of superheroes Reynolds is adept at making with the self-spoofing hip-cynic wisecracks. But where Robert Downey Jr. is able to anchor all that smirking drollery in a deep sense of walking-wounded humanity Reynolds offers little more than the insubstantial sum of his quips.All the attempts at character-endowing hardship and tragedy -- flashbacks of young Hal watching his test-pilot dad blow up -- end up feeling like items being checked off the superhero formula. Dead dad check. Wasted potential check. Fear of intimacy check.Theres not much in the way of backup. Gossip Girls Blake Lively is generically appealing as Hals love interest Carol Ferris who is apparently supposed to be a cross between Amelia Earhart and a Kardashian sister. Peter Sarsgaard manages to have a little fun cast as the pathetic nerd transformed into a grotesque villain. As his Hector infected by the dreaded yellow energy mutates into an Elephant Man-like blob with telekinetic powers Sarsgaard a sly and smart actor provides Green Lantern with its only real sparks. For all the intergalactic travel and green-energy tricks the only visual effects that really pop are in the climatic finale when we finally see Parallax as this malignant poly-tentacled cloud of evil swallowing everything in its path.Green LanternC Starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard and Tim Robbins.

"Green Lantern Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie Review Green LanternThe comic-book adaptation starring an able Ryan Reynolds is uneven but watchable.June 17 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ryan Reynolds as the title role in ""Green Lantern."" (Warner Bros. Pictures )""Green Lantern"" is both off the wall and out of this world a literally. More science-fiction space opera than superhero epic it works in fits and starts as its disparate parts go in and out of effectiveness but the professionalism of the production make it watchable in a comic book kind of way. The films wacky premise comes from the 1959 rebooting of the earlier comic book that floated the notion of a huge intergalactic legion of way-powerful Green Lanterns each with his very own lantern a think upscale lava lamp a and each being the protector of a particular corner of the universe. But though the Lanterns and their potent matching rings have been around for eons a member of the human race has never been tapped to join the corps. And when hotshot test pilot Hal ""Call Me Irresponsible"" Jordan gets the nod there is a lot of scratching of heads both on Earth and elsewhere. That mirrored the response in Hollywood when charming leading man Ryan Reynolds was tapped for the role. How would he look in the computer-generated form-fitting Lantern uniform and would he have the gravitas to take on the dread Parallax the evilest entity that ever lived?"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt; As it turns out Reynolds can handle most of what the script by Greg Berlanti amp; Michael Green amp; Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg throws at him. The problem is not all of that stuff is worth doing. Not surprisingly Reynolds is on target for the early Hal Jordan. The cocky but charming test pilot for Ferris Aircraft a who has a who-cares relationship with gorgeous old flame Carol Ferris (a capable Blake Lively) a is so nonchalant he oversleeps on the morning of his biggest flight. Also effective thanks to production design by Grant Major and visual effects that looked perfectly fine in 2-D are the films first glimpses of the planet Oa the home base of the Lanterns and their supervisors. Those would be the older-than-dirt Guardians of the Universe who first figured how to harness the force that energizes the Lanterns the power of will. (Had Leni Riefenstahl not gotten there first ""Triumph of the Will"" would have made a heck of a subtitle here.) Its from Oa that Lantern Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) takes off to battle Parallax. Things do not work out well and after a crash landing on Earth his ring which always chooses who it goes to next selects Hal. No one is more surprised than the man himself to be suddenly reciting a sacred oath (""Let those who worship evils might beware my power a Green Lanterns light"") that sounds like it might have come from the back of a cereal box. ""Green Lanterns"" biggest problem never completely overcome is that there is a serious tonal shift between the devil-may-care Hal Jordan of the opening sections and the dead serious savior of the universe of the finale. The film tries to bridge that gap with unnecessary characters and extraneous plotting including tedious sections involving other Lanterns who tend to look like refugees from ""Star Wars"" Mos Eisley Cantina but it is to no avail. Though he is nothing if not game star Reynolds is not at his best either in these sections where among other things he learns how to control his ring-linked ability to create anything his mind can imagine. Michael Fassbender as the future Magneto in ""X-Men First Class"" has set the bar quite high for superhero ambivalence this summer and Reynolds inevitably falls short. ""Green Lantern"" does have the advantage of good villains starting with Parallax an amorphous blob of endless iniquity that thrives on terror and has an affinity for yellow the color (in case you didnt know) of fear. Evils man on Earth is scientist Hector Hammond played by Peter Sarsgaard. Contact with Parallax turns him into a kind of creepy Quasimodo with beady yellow eyes and a huge misshapen head who wreaks havoc wherever he goes. Always an adventurous convincing actor Sarsgaard does this role right."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; Given its ups and downs ""Green Lantern"" is fortunate to have Martin Campbell (""The Mask of Zorro"" ""Casino Royale"") as director. Though this is not Campbells finest hour his proficiency counts for a lot in so far-fetched a venture. With a sequel in the works (a clip is shown during the closing credits) lets hope everyone ups their game the next time around. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Green Lantern MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Playing In general release"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVD The Tree of LifeOctober 9 2011A ripe season of celluloidMay 1 2011Greg Berlanti lets out his inner fanboyOctober 6 2010M.

Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture It must be a difficult task to assemble an action-adventure fantasy especially for this summer of superhero-origin movies with Thor and X-Men already in theaters and Captain America following in July. Difficult that is unless the writers abandon originality and build their script with elements from other movies -- all other movies. Greg Berlanti Michael Green Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg the concocters of Green Lantern had 70 years of the DC comic-book character to use as inspiration yet they borrowed enough tropes from old film fantasies to make an Identi-Kit of blockbuster cliches. Check off the punch list of items in this Green Lantern manifest 1. A world governed by wise elders perched on high columns with their desiccated faces in fishbowls; cf. Clash of the Titans 2. A backstory of interplanetary battle between the Green Lantern Corps and a malignant force called Parallax that destroys its foes through soul sucking; cf. Raiders of the Lost Ark 3. A magical ring that imparts great power to the wearer; cf. The Lord of the Rings 4. A bold reckless hero Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) who is traumatized by father issues; cf. Star Wars Iron Man etc. 5. A heroine Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) who is meant to assume control of her fathers aircraft company; cf. Iron Mans Tony Stark 6. A nerdy scientist Hector (Peter Sarsgaard) -- also with pretty severe father issues -- whose thirst for interplanetary knowledge makes him drunk with power and whose exposure to a strange element turns him into a villain; cf. The Thing from Another World The Incredible Hulk etc. 7. An alien aristocrat Sinestro (Mark Strong) with a mysterious agenda and pointy ears; cf. Spock in Star Trek 8. The catchphrase ""With great power comes great responsibility""; cf. Spider-Man ... plus dozens of other examples we either didnt notice or dont care about in a movie that abandons creative storytelling for manifest destiny. Apart from some spiffy visual effects which create coherent scary textures and architecture for outer space Green Lantern is the most generic of summer time wasters. The tone chosen by director Martin Campbell is an uneasy mix of solemnity and jock joking as the film hopscotches from deepest space to shallowest Earth. Hal a roguish flyboy with a tendency to freak out in the cockpit when he thinks of the plane crash that killed his dad is chosen by the dying Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) a stalwart of the galaxys guardian Green Lantern Corps to represent planet Earth. His superpower to imagine anything into reality which impresses Carol to no end and helps him avert dozens of deaths when another plane occupied by Senator Hammond (Tim Robbins) crashes at a garden party. Hammond has secretly enlisted his brilliant dweebish son Hector to examine Abin Surs corpse but the autopsy goes awry and the lad is infected by the yellow slime of the dark lord Parallax. He becomes a kind of Elephant Man mutant instantly able to read peoples memories. Now hell do Parallaxs bidding to bring about the Apocalypse and if hes lucky win Carol by default. For Hal the big question is Will he save the world -- or his girlfriend? Politically Green Lantern could be a Tea Party recruitment video. It believes that the federal government is both omnipotent and inefficient and that the country nay the world can be saved only by an individual hero -- a Paul Revere out of Sarah Palins mythology who uses his lantern to warn the enemy that we will not give up our arms especially such muscular ones. Positing Hal against Hector Green Lantern praises test pilots over scientists the military over the university brute force over knowledge. Granted Hal was drafted into this galactic battle; he didnt volunteer. But once he gets to exercising his Will hes nearly an Ayn Rand hero -- less Luke Skywalker than Howard Roark. The laws of the movies galaxy are also firmly right wing. They say that Will (represented by the color green) is good and Fear (yellow) is bad. Really? Hasnt the will to dominate been the trigger for wars and oppression? Doesnt the very word summon uneasy recollections of Leni Riefenstahls Hitler documentary (Triumph of the Will) and the memoir of rogue Nixonite G. Gordon Liddy (Will)? Anyway who thinks green is good? Isnt it the color of envy ""the green-eyed monster"" of jealousy as Iago told Othello? And yellow isnt that the color of the sun the source of all power in our universe? One other thing What is the record for rhetorical questions in a single paragraph? This semi-fascist scheme isnt what torpedoes Green Lantern; the culprits are familiarity and ennui. Though the movie has plenty of eye candy its mostly Snickers. Undressing or going topless three times in his first five minutes on screen and outfitted in a superhero uniform that is little more than emerald body paint (genitals not included) Reynolds is handsome and ripped enough to be his own action figure; his trainer gets a closing credit and deserves it. But Reynolds is so blandly amiable so deeply Canadian that the hallmark of a male movie star -- the musk of danger -- is something he doesnt radiate; he only simulates it. Sarsgaard has fun on a serious actors holiday at summer camp but his scenes are the only instances of saving eccentricity. Geoffrey Rush shows up as a kind of fish god and Angela Bassett looking fine drops in for a paycheck. Strong whos played bad guys in RocknRolla Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass telegraphs Sinestros ultimate malevolence by sporting a receding hairline and mustache worn mainly by villains in 40s movie serials. Sinestros true nastiness is revealed only during the closing credits as the promise or threat of further episodes. Thats a foolhardy tactic similar teases in Prince of Persia The Last Airbender The Sorcerers Apprentice The A-Team and Kick-Ass did not guarantee the popular success needed to finance a sequel.

First it was feel-good doctors dispensing amphetamines then feel-good films dispensing formulaic good cheer and surefire happy endings. But a really good film like ""Buck"" a documentary by Cindy Meehl does much more than serve as a drug substitute. It keeps you fascinated even enthralled; elicits astonishment even wonderment and makes you grateful for the chance to meet someone remarkable. Watch a scene from the film ""Buck."" Video courtesy of Sundance Selects. At first glance Buck Brannaman seems less remarkable than abundantly likable. A middle-age cowboy who travels around the country giving four-day horse-training clinics he is eloquent in a laconic Western way and likes to downplay the potential uplift of the clinic experience. ""A lot of people"" he says wryly ""they want it to be fuzzy and warm and cosmic."" Fuzzy it is not and warmth doesnt play as much of a role as wisdom and control (of ones self and the horse in that order). Yet you could make a case for cosmic once youve seen Buck in action--teaching horses the way of the world without breaking their spirit and riding them like a centaur out of Greek myth. ""You look like one mind and one body"" he says while demonstrating it. ""If you get a taste of it a taste of what Im talking about you couldnt get enough of it."" ENLARGE Horse trainer Buck Brannaman in Cindy Meehls documentary about him Buck. Sundance Selects If training horses were all there was to Mr. Brannamans story the encounter would still be worthwhile. Hes the closest thing imaginable to that staple of modern myth the horse whisperer. Robert Redford hired him as an advisor when ""The Horse Whisperer"" was going into production and as the movies director and star recalls in Ms. Meehls documentary ended up modeling much of his character on Bucks gentleness and humanity. Mr. Brannamans techniques stress kindness (how you treat a horse reflects how you treat your family and other people in your life) combined with firmness. (Like Cesar Millan TVs ""Dog Whisperer"" he teaches humans how to be an animals parent not its friend.) Ms. Meehls own techniques include astute showmanship and in one instance a shocking illustration that some horses remain immune to humane ministrations. What makes ""Buck"" the movie so uncommonly affecting is the tormented past of Buck the man. As little boys he and his brother performed blindfold rope tricks in a theatrical act created by their brutish father. Buck was beaten regularly and unmercifully as a boy broken in ways no one would wish on any animal. How he survived is a mystery how he was rescued is a marvel and how he used his torment to transform himself is an inspiration. He didnt find his vocation in a flash. At first he says ""I was just looking for a peaceful place to be where I wasnt threatened."" When you watch him now though giving horses the love he never got you know in the deepest sense where hes coming from. Green Lantern A dud that gives green a bad name ""Green Lantern"" starts with a contest between a drone guided by an artificial-intelligence program and a jet fighter controlled by Hal Jordan a test pilot who appears to have the wrong stuff. Hes played with unassuming--and mercifully self-deprecating--good humor by Ryan Reynolds. Thats fine so long as Hal is struggling with the turgid Oedipal issues that cause a temporary flame-out in his psyche. Once he becomes Green Lantern however unassuming doesnt cut it. The movie needs an assuming hero. It also needs a heroine with something more to do than act tentatively (Blake Lively wins this years Kristin Stewart Award for Indistinct Diction) and a plot generated by something smarter than the artifice program that guides it. Watch a scene from the film ""Green Lantern."" Video courtesy of Warner Bros. ""Green Lantern"" was meant to be a sci-fi adventure but it proves to be a genuine mystery. How could its megamoola budget have yielded a production that looks almost as tacky as ""Flash Gordon"" (which had the good grace to deprecate itself at every turn)? How could Martin Campbell the director who gave us such stylish delights as ""The Mask of Zorro"" and the BBC miniseries ""Edge of Darkness"" have committed so much clumsiness? Why does the storyline function as a handbook for aspiring Green Lanterns (theyre the elite guardians of the universe) and a set-up for a sequel but not as a coherent adventure with appealing characters? (Who cares about all these dim Lanterns and the blobby monster threatening universal nastiness?) I should note that I chose to watch ""Green Lantern"" in 2-D Its third dimension was added in postproduction and Im tired of writing ritual complaints about 3-D. Maybe I made the wrong call and watching this film through plastic glasses would have been a life-changing experience. Still the only character I cared about even slightly was the villainous Hector Hammond played by Peter Sarsgaard. When I say played I mean performed from deep inside latex makeup that gives Hector a dome larger than Peter Boyles in ""Young Frankenstein"" plus the general demeanor of a psychopath sucking on persimmons. Yet Mr. Sarsgaard succeeds in creating a real guy with real passions. Apart from him theres nada. City of Life and Death ENLARGE Gao Yuanyuan as Miss Jiang in City of Life and Death. Kino Intl. A drama that could pass for a documentary ""City of Life and Death"" re-creates the Nanjing Massacre when invading soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army slaughtered some 300000 citizens of what had been one of Chinas ancient capitals. Lu Chuans epic film is harrowing in the extreme. Every atrocity or so it would seem every unspeakable moment of bestiality has been culled from historical documents and woven into a narrative that begins with picture postcards of the period and ends with ritual dancing and drumming that could pass for a Japanese version of the Nazi rallies seen in Leni Riefenstahls films. The initial effect is both distanced and distancing a remarkable simulation--with stunning black-and-white cinematography by Cao Yu--that chronicles the horrors without pausing to concentrate on individual victims or individual predators. Forces gather sirens shriek tank engines roar troops march. (Lai Qizhens sound design contributes strongly to the illusion of being in the midst of it all.) Little by little though the friezes of mortal anguish that resemble collectivist art--or the photo chronicles of Nazi concentration camps--give way to such vivid individual portraits as a Nazi proconsul aghast at the slaughter his unprincipled Chinese secretary a sensitive Japanese soldier and a prostitute who touches his soul without trying to. This is hardly a film to recommend as entertainment. As an act of remembrance though it is singular and in its way soaring. Mr. Poppers Penguins At one would-be poignant point in the proceedings--Mr. Poppers perky secretary Pippi uses p-words so persistently that its catching--a family of penguins that has attached itself to Jim Carreys title character must choose between fish or love. The fish are being proffered--oops offered--by a cold-hearted functionary of the New York Zoo while the love emanates from yes you guessed it. Unloved as a child Mr. P. has had to learn how to love others. Watch a scene from the film ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. A cold-hearted observer might bet on the birdies opting for the food but it isnt that kind of movie. Given what it is--a family comedy for very young audiences--the fish fall short love conquers all and the cuteness of the penguins carries the day. My heart was warmed by gratuitous moments when Mr. Carrey clowns for clownings sake--in the best of them he makes a slo-mo entrance to a press conference even though the camera is running at normal speed. Flightless birds sporting tuxedos are fine in their place--ideally Antarctica--but the films portrait of trans-species passion did not prompt me to probe the possibility of purchasing a penguin through Petco. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Black Stallion (1979) Please forgive me for--or indulge me in--my love of this film which Ive recommended before and have written about on many other occasions. Recommending DVDs is an association game and the words horse trainer let alone horse whisperer point inexorably to Carroll Ballards sublime (and wordless) vision of a boy and a wild Arabian horse bonding on a tropical island. Kelly Reno is the boy and Mickey Rooney is the trainer. Mr. Ballard directed from an adaptation of the Walter Farley novel by Melissa Mathison Jeanne Rosenberg and William D. Wittliff. Caleb Deschanel did the peerless cinematography. Raise the Red Lantern (1991) ENLARGE Not sci-fi although Zhang Yimous masterful drama is set in a China of the early 20th century that might well have been part of another galaxy. Gong Li is 19-year-old Songlian a university student of unworldly beauty. Forced to quit school after the death of her father she marries a much older man of means becomes his fourth concubine and is forced to compete ruthlessly with women higher in his hierarchy. If ever a film cried out for Blu-ray release this is the one but its available only on a conventional--and mediocre--DVD. The Truman Show (1998) ENLARGE Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank a man who doesnt know hes the star of a TV show about his own life. Peter Weir directed Andrew Niccols funny and seductive fable about how TV has invaded our lives and hijacked our heads. The film requires frequent suspension of disbelief as questions of logic multiply. Yet its strengths are more dramatic and emotional than topical or logical. Truman Burbank is a touchingly gallant creation an unwitting Odysseus on an odyssey he cant fathom. The cast includes Ed Harris and Laura Linney. The cinematographer was Peter Biziou. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Wont satisfy a soul. Possibly wont make a dime. Green also happens to be the color associated with toxicity. Its the color of weeds certain scatological mishaps antifreeze and slime. Green is the color of the soup Linda Blair blasts in ""The Exorcist. If you were a club kid its also the color of late nights and very early mornings in the 1990s. This is the green of ""Green Lantern -- the neon green of glow-stick goo.That is to say not all green is created equal -- this is not the green of nature or big money. Most scenes purporting to be set on a distant planet seem like screensavers at war with one another. People claim to have waited their entire life for a movie that turns the DC comic book into a movie that re-creates how Hal Jordan the test pilot (and later a trucker) turned into an interstellar super trooper with a cosmic ring whose power is limited only by his imagination. The films is remarkably stunted.Four credited screenwriters have cobbled decades of the Green Lantern into a story so basic that the can its been served from should just say ""Superhero Action Film. The ring arrives more or less from outer space to choose Hal to become a human member of an intergalactic corps of crime fighters. There are 3600 of them and judging from the thousands of green dots junking up the screensavers Id say this outfit is terribly overstaffed -- even to battle Parallax the enormous collection of dreadlocks barreling toward Earth.What sparks of life there are come from Ryan Reynolds who turns Hal into the same Adonis of sardonic insincerity that is Reynoldss stock in trade. Its the only mode his comedic acting knows and accessorizes only with itself. His testy narcissism can annoy. But when theres nothing else afoot at least it can form an oasis of easy entertainment.""Green Lantern is 100 minutes of desert -- populated with either folks like Senator Tim Robbins and Dr. Angela Bassett or computer-borne non-human creatures that pontificate with British accents. The humans here sound like Reynolds or a fully Malkoviched Peter Sarsgaard as a mad scientist with an engorged cranium -- or far worse Blake Lively whos been cast as Carol Ferris Hals fellow pilot girlfriend and cheerleader. I dont think Ive experienced such a pulseless degree of acting since whatever last months zombie movie was. Zombies at least enjoy themselves. I dont know what Livelys excuse could be for seeming this undead. Shes not alone. At some point a helicopter seems poised to obliterate a cocktail party. The guests just stand around unfazed. Its as if theyre watching the movie theyre starring in. When Hal arrives in his skin-tight Green Lantern costume and creates a gaseous spiral strip and matching car to whisk the copter to safety theres more standing around. All his derring-do inspires from the crowd is a lone camera phone to record a piece of the action. Its a depressing state of affairs when not even the extras in the movie care enough to record a bootleg copy. The director Martin Campbell and his editor barrel through scenes with the haste of a movie scared its missing something like perhaps its own point.In a sense ""Green Lantern is refreshing not in a Mountain Dew way (though they have that color in common). Its a reminder that a superhero film can be only as good as the material its adapting. Martin Nodell and Bill Finger created the Green Lantern in the 1940s. Between the 1960s and the 1980s the comics took on matters of race justice science and metaphysics. Thats a lot of material and extracting a compelling story from it should be daunting. I dont care for ""X-Men First Class which is playing right now; but stubbornly misconstruing the Bay of Pigs Invasion as it does is a stroke of inspiration. ""Green Lantern is simply another movie daring to prove that green is not suitable for superhero adventure -- two Incredible Hulk movies failed although Ang Lees remains misunderstood. Its certainly not suitable for 3-D. Here most scenes become the green of mildew and mold and thats just when the civilian cast is standing around in a hangar or on a lawn.The movie does manage to reconfigure the romance of ""Top Gun allowing Lively -- as both aviator and paramour -- to conflate Tom Cruises passion for Anthony Edwards with his attraction to Kelly McGillis. Its unclear whether thats inspiration or an accident. Either way its boring.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

Sadly this one about a test pilot given superpowers by way of an energy-enhancing emerald ring is about as enjoyable as an explosion in the mold lab. Slideshow Lantern? Its so queasy seeing green Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Green Lantern >> Campbell the maker of The Mask of Zorro and the James Bond reboot Casino Royale specializes in contrived scenarios where actors give unexpectedly serious performances. He seemed like the ideal guy for Green Lantern. Alas murky 3-D effects sets that look like Frank Frazettas rejected album covers and creatures resembling bobbleheads doom Campbells film from the get-go. How can actors even ones as attractive as Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively emerge from the green gunk encrusting the sets like so much Silly String? What can these ordinarily nimble performers do with clunky dialogue about Will and Fear that sounds like boilerplate from an Ayn Rand manifesto? In one sequence Reynolds Hal Jordan recites the Green Lantern oath with 3000 other good guys on a craggy creme de menthe-colored set that resembles an infestation of grasshoppers on planet Oa. When they collectively chant ""Let no evil escape my sight"" I had to restrain myself from yelling ""Then do something about the art direction"" Because this is the origin story of a hoped-for franchise Campbell has to plow through a lot of exposition about who the Lanterns are and who Hal Jordan is. The Lanterns are evilfighters ""a race of immortals who have harnessed the emerald energy."" Hal is a cocky test pilot (is there any other kind?) who saw his test-pilot dad die in a crash and who is plagued by fear and doubt feelings that get in the way of his ability to use his emerald-fueled superpowers to fight the enemy a supersquid with X-ray eyes and nuclear breath called Parallax. In an abbreviated sequence of Lantern boot camp - ""Ringslinging 101"" - Campbell handles Hals evolution from flyboy to superhero most perfunctorily. Evidently if Hal can imagine a weapon it materializes in neon-green. There is no sense of mastering a weapon like a light saber. And then theres the Lantern suit a grass-green unitard. Lets just say it lacks the mystery of the Batsuit the Transformers chic of Iron Mans rig and the sex appeal of Supermans tights and cape. Reynolds should rock this unitard but even on the guy who possesses an enviable 12-pack it looks more Cirque de Soleil than Superhero. What has Campbell wrought? An intermittently amusing interminable affair that for sheer ugliness and a scenery-chewing performance by Peter Sarsgaard has a certain Camp appeal.

Its an impossible role but Sarsgaard plays it for real and gives the movie a touch of gravity. Nothing else sticks to the mind and heart. Hal claims that a Lanterns only enemy is fear itself. The thought of a sequel to this shamelessly soulless Hollywood product scares me plenty. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

This is not meant as a boast but a simple statement of fact given the characters relatively low level of name recognition and this reviewers relatively high level of geekery. Did you spend your youth devouring the four-color primary texts of Green Lanternalia? Did you as a child warm to the character only after spending hours poring over your copies of Whos Who in the DC Universe searching in vain for any hero whose hair was brown like yours and not the ubiquitous black-with-blue-highlights? (Or the canary yellow meant to pass for blond?) Consider This reviewer went into the Green Lantern preview screening already knowing the numerical designation assigned to our neck of the intergalactic woods by wizened blue hydrocephalic immortals called the Guardians of the Universe. (Sector 2814 duh.) He was conversant with the performance specs of the weapon those same Guardians distribute to the 3600 members of their intergalactic peacekeeping force -- a ring that runs on willpower and allows its wielder to shape emerald-colored energy into any form imaginable -- and he has been known given sufficient encouragement and a sufficient number of drinks at sufficiently nerdy parties to recite from memory the oath that Green Lanterns solemnly intone when recharging said rings from their batteries. (Yeah youre just going to have trust him on that one). Green Lantern like many of its forebears in the burgeoning cinema du spandex is an origin story. Ryan Reynolds Hal Jordan undertakes a (super)heros journey that transforms him from a cocky California test pilot to the first earthling representative of an elite corps of space cops. Unfortunately for the filmmakers Hals journey is mostly roadblocks and detours. For one thing the film splinters into three near-discrete storylines that dont play all that well together. Theres Reynolds fractious relationship with a fellow pilot played by Blake Lively; Peter Sarsgaard as a schlubby xenobiologist with daddy issues; and a muddy CGI space-opera involving an existential threat to the entire universe. Director Martin Campbell doles out choppy glimpses of each effectively leaching the hour-and-45-minute film of much-needed momentum. i Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) is an exobiologist with a big-head complex. Hammonds story is just one of the many subplots crammed uncomfortably into Green Lantern. Francois Duhamel/Warner Brothers hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Warner Brothers Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) is an exobiologist with a big-head complex. Hammonds story is just one of the many subplots crammed uncomfortably into Green Lantern. Francois Duhamel/Warner Brothers Also the villain of the piece is a cloud. An evil cloud to be sure composed as it is of nothing less than the Yellow Power of Fear. It has a face like Monty Burns and its given to slurping up its victims souls like so many bluepoint oysters but even so a cloud. ""This is the movie the fans want to see"" star Reynolds has been saying in press junkets leading up to the films premiere. Speaking as one such fan this reviewer can tell you Reynolds is right. And thats the problem. Because it turns out that what works in the comics -- geared remember for a small but deeply passionate demographic steeped in decades of arcana -- comes across as hopelessly flimsy and contrived when upsized to fit the big screen. Gleefully pulpy dialogue that evaporates on the comics page -- lines like ""You cant give in to fear I know what its like to be afraid to be afraid"" -- land with a series of heavy wet thuds on the cement floor of the cineplex. Dense back story about the intergalactic struggle between the powers of Will and Fear -- lore in which the character is steeped and in which fans exult -- gets delivered in thick clots of stentorian exposition robbed of any spark of fun or adventure. Information thats meant to lend an epic sweep to the proceedings instead seems merely insular hermetic and yes hokey. The films most frustrating quality is its eagerness to double back to connect its own dots as if it believes it needs to carefully walk us through its conflict between a buff handsome hero and an evil squid cloud. ""Explain it to me Hal"" says Lively after the audience has witnessed not one but several scenes dramatizing the very point about which she seems so doggedly damnably curious. Certainly there have been plenty of comics-to-films adaptations derailed by the structural demands of the Hollywood blockbuster; in formulaic movies like Elektra and X-Men The Last Stand the hammy fists of studio executives can be plainly felt. Green Lantern goes wrong in precisely the opposite direction It never quite frees itself from the gravitational pull of fan service long enough to tell a story that nonfans could be bothered to care much about. Sadder still even the characters fans will come away believing their hero has been done a vague disservice by the film. Theyll enjoy the competently realized battle scenes and acknowledge Reynolds ab-tastic charms yet wish the filmmakers had possessed the will and the courage to generate a steadier more powerful light.

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 16 2011 1246 PM Title Green Lantern With Ryan Reynolds. An alien ring turns a hotshot pilot into a superhero (154). PG Violence. At area theaters. After an eternity of effects and a dense voiceover about ""guardians of the universe"" hired by alien immortals Ryan Reynolds appearance in ""Green Lantern"" is jarring. Oh right -- this movie stars a real person. Soon though Reynolds is trapped inside a glowing energy sphere bouncing like a Powerball. While ""Green Lantern"" may look like his blockbuster lottery ticket this leaden adventure is more ""Daredevil"" than ""Dark Knight."" Reynolds plays Hal Jordan a hotshot pilot chosen by the finger ring of a dying extraterrestrial to become the protector of Earth and its intergalactic environs. Before you can say ""Star Wars cantina scene"" Hal is whisked to the planet Oa (dont even try to pronounce it) to meet the gilled lumpen and tentacled beings of the Green Lantern corps entrusted by those immortals to keep cosmic order. The ring can make its wearer fly and create anything so long as it doesnt smell fear. There are 3600 Green Lanterns. Ours is a goofoff hung up on fellow flyer Carol (bland Blake Lively) until scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) touches an otherworldly goo and becomes a giant-brained villain. Theres also a huge outer-space sphincter-thing with a head that must be stopped. And note the demonic-looking Corps member handily named Sinestro (Mark Strong). He seems angry. Clearly DC Comics needed to get another character onscreen after riding big guns Superman and Batman like a two-dollar cape. And ""Green Lantern"" a title older than ""Spider-Man"" and similar heroes has potential. But while director Martin Campbell starts franchises (he did Pierce Brosnans and Daniel Craigs first 007 outings) the silliness here oozes off the screen no fault of the crisp 3-D. The effects are so omnipresent its like Reynolds perfect hair is floating in CGI limbo. Yet when they need punch as in a ""Superman""-ish display-of-powers scene involving a helicopter theres no flair. Storywise Hal and Sinestros conflict is forced and a childhood-friends triangle between Hal Carol and Hector is convoluted not to mention chronologically challenged. And while tween boys may marvel at all the exotic lifeforms Sarsgaards Elephant Man-headed baddie is more icky than menacing. As for Reynolds his self-deprecating wise-guy shtick helps the movie get past its ponderousness then gets in the way of its more earnest intentions. ""Green Lantern"" is a movie in which almost everyone gets the weird glowing-eyes look and a smirk doesnt go well with that.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are movies willed to life by the passion of their creators and there are movies like Green Lantern which are willed to life strictly by market forces. Superhero movies are popular right now no one had tackled Green Lantern yet and voila heres an adaptation that only the mouse-clicking digital artisans behind the effects shots seemed to give a shit about. Beyond the undigested lump of information about the origins and purpose of the Green Lantern Corps and a new rogue force threatening the universe the early scenes are a marvel of CGI landscaping presenting deep space as a shimmering Technicolor arena that pops like the pages of a particularly arresting comic book. Then the film comes down to Earth repurposes Top Gun as a superhero story and goes through the motions with a kid-friendly arbitrariness not seen since the last Fantastic Four movie. Returning to the Van Wilder unctuousness that he lately had successfully dialed back Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan a hotshot fighter pilot who rides into the danger zone at every opportunity. He also ignores the rules of engagement has more raw talent than anyone has ever seen is haunted by his pilot fathers tragic legacy falls for his superior (Blake Lively) on the tarmac and would likely serenade ladies with ""Youve Lost That Lovin Feeling"" if Anthony Edwards were his wingman. Hals raw talent (and ripped abs) are not lost on the galactic forces behind the Green Lantern Corps a brotherhood of warriors that maintain peace in the universe. As a new enemy called Parallax threatens the balance Hal comes into possession of a ring that gives him the power to fight back with the force of his will and imagination. Green Lantern tries to make a case of human exceptionalism Out of the thousand-plus species comprising the Green Lantern Corps only Hal the newcomer has the humanity that can save the universe. But a message like that is hard to believe in a film so utterly lacking in conviction it needs a 25-year-old Tom Cruise vehicle just to keep its spine straight. Peter Sarsgaard seems to be enjoying himself as a nerdy shut-in turned evil scientist but Green Lantern otherwise goes through the motions even when it has the chance to deploy any digital weapon its hero can imagine. In staging an interstellar battle of will vs. fear all it can offer is a shrug.

"Michael Phillips Green Lantern review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Lantern or Hornet Films about emerald-hued heroes are no gemsGreen Lantern -- 2 starsJune 16 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRyan Reynolds stars in ""The Green Lantern.""Green just isnt the superhero color this year.Beyond its dominant hue director Martin Campbells earnest noisy ""Green Lantern"" has little in common with the blase comic indolence of ""The Green Hornet"" which starred Seth Rogen and came out to general disdain five months ago. (Now theres a name for a villain Gen. Disdain.) The media-generated questions preceding the arrival of ""Green Lantern"" have focused on the question of whether Ryan Reynolds above who had yet to headline a major franchise effort has the action-star stuff to shoulder a product launch such as this."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;He does. Even with his somewhat reedy voice hes an easygoing charismatic presence and a real actor. But the film itself is disappointingly routine as well as jarring in its violence. Only in fits and starts mostly in the most earthbound scenes between Reynolds and Blake Lively does ""Green Lantern"" offer traces of real personality.As test pilot Hal Jordan destined to become an intergalactic ""space cop"" sporting a ring that does a lot more than decode Reynolds has a way of playing a hotshot -- whos also a self-defeating screw-up -- that seems plausible and likable. The actors lightly sardonic comic touch matches up well with Livelys; she plays fellow pilot ex-girlfriend (though the spark remains) and aerospace heiress Carol Ferris who is thrilled with the superhero developments (wee green mask and all) in her unreliable exs life.""Green Lantern"" is a relationship picture in which the man learns to be a better more vulnerable and honest man en route to saving the planet from a fire-breathing soul-sucking whatzit called Parallax. All the other 3000-plus Green Lanterns the sentinels of the universe cannot find a way to deal with this punk not even Hals fellow Green Lanternite who goes by Sinestro (Mark Strong a credible and compelling presence). In this end of the cosmos those who slip on the evil yellow ring represent and promulgate fear yucky and addictive and destructive. Green is good -- pure valiant willpower like the next generation of energy drinks.Those unfamiliar with ""Green Lantern"" mythology begun by DC Comics in 1940 may experience the films chaotic exposition-larded first 30 minutes as pure homework for the test to come with quick bullet points about planet Oa the universes 3000-plus sectors the oath ... its a load. The faraway planets of Oa and others look like all the other places weve been on screen lately from ""Thor"" (which I enjoyed even in its squareness more than ""Green Lantern"") on back.If the movies a popular success itll be because audiences dig Hals ability to turn anything he can think of into adversary-vanquishing reality. Meaning In a training sequence (Michael Clarke Duncan voicing a computer-generated badass) and later in real battle against the infected sniveling yellow-eyed scientist played by Peter Sarsgaard (largely in full Elephant Man makeup) the trouble keeps coming via death bolts or whatever. And Hal simply thinks of a brick wall or a ridiculous machine gun and poof Its made manifest and the problem is momentarily solved. In the most bombastic of the action scenes a careening helicopter carrying the U.S. senator played by Tim Robbins transforms into a Hot Wheels vehicle steered clear of carnage on a green sky-borne track. This saves the day certainly for product placement."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;Realizing this isnt a very sophisticated argument I find the ""Green Lantern"" selling point -- think it and it happens -- to be a bit of a dead-end. If everythings possible then somehow everythings a little less magical. And ""Green Lantern"" isnt much fun; the head-bashings and pummelings pile up high and harshly. Reynolds and Lively and their unforced considerable chemistry got me through the rough stuff. But barely. Take this review with a grain of salt.

Pictures Franois Duhamel) Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively in ""Green Lantern"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Reynolds in ""Green Lantern"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) I never thought I could feel sorry for Ryan Reynolds. The buff fellow with the Canadian passport laughed all the way to movie stardom and a meteoric marriage to Scarlett Johansson. But now hes expected to keep a straight face while propping up an insanely expensive superhero movie. The spectacular collapse of ""Green Lantern"" is bound to be blamed on Reynolds but the villainy has its origins in an injustice league of TV-trained screenwriters and tin-hearted studio suits.Only a committee thats constructing the next ""Star Wars"" would start a fantasy flick with a backstory that begins ""millions of years ago"" when faceless forces of good (aka ""will"" aka the color green) confront the faceless forces of evil (aka ""fear"" aka the color yellow). A fat ration of the special effects budget is torched before we puny humans have the faintest idea whats at stake.Apparently one of the 3600 cosmic cops who protect the universe is hurtling toward Earth in his crippled spaceship. As he dies on a beach in California he bequeaths his magical green ring to Hal Jordan (Reynolds) a cocky test pilot with daddy issues. When Hal is teleported to one of those Oz-like utopias where big-headed elders wax philosophical he learns that the ring obliges him to defend the innocent - and enables him to conjure whatever weapon he can imagine.In a better comic-book movie Hals imagination and his rebellious attitude would generate some laughs but in this 3-D debacle Reynolds is flattened with little hint of the smarmy charm that got him this far. The formulaic script by three television hacks and a ""Harry Potter"" re-writer gives Hal a love interest (Blake Lively as a rival pilot-cum-industrial heiress) and an adversary (Peter Sarsgaard as a scientist who is mutated by an alien spore) but the earthly stuff is as senseless as the space opera. Sarsgaard tries to inject some life into this dead spectacle but anyone who bothers to pay attention will wonder why the 40-year-old actor is playing the son of 52-year-old Tim Robbins (who plays the obligatory evil politician). The message of the movie is the triumph of the will but ""Green Lantern"" is such a careless failure its radioactive.""Green Lantern""One and a half stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 145  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence Reynolds tried to illuminate Green Lantern SAN FRANCISCO  Initial photos of Ryan Reynolds as the Green Lantern were treated like a kry...

"Green Lantern review Giddy gritty Lantern looks likely to join the brotherhood of comic franchises |       NJ.com comments Green Lantern review Giddy gritty Lantern looks likely to join the brotherhood of comic franchises Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 16 2011 at 810 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1100 AM View/Post Comments Warner Bros./MCTRyan Reynolds as Green Lantern in Warner Bros. Pictures action adventure ""Green Lantern."" A cocky test pilot he has a habit of wrecking planes and relationships and pretending to walk away unscratched from both. A careless casual survivor the last thing hes looking for is ""greatness."" And then he has it thrust upon him. By a dying alien. Who drafts him into the cosmic crimefighters known as the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Lantern as Hal became known was an interesting comic-book character for just that reason -- unlike Superman (who was basically born to be a superhero) Spider-Man (who became one accidentally) or Batman (who decided on his own) he was chosen. Which added an original and very essential piece of self-doubt to the action hero Why me? Unfortunately for some diehard ""Lantern"" fans the new film stints a bit on Hals Im-not-worthy soul-searching. Fortunately for folks just looking for a summer adventure it doubles down on the cosmic imagery and way-cool effects. Movie Review Green Lantern (PG-13) Warner Bros. (114 min.) Directed by Martin Campbell. With Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and some suggestive material. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS Ryan Reynolds -- he of the shoe-button Hello Kitty eyes and awesome abs -- plays Hal as a less sarcastic version of Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark. Hes a good handsome hero and although he downplays the characters childhood trauma and anguish too (""The Dark Knight"" this isnt) that leaves him with places to go in the inevitable sequel. In fact in some ways this movie seems to be all about a sequel spending a lot of time on exposition or introducing characters -- such as Sinestro -- who are meant to become far more important later. It also rewrites some of the mythology -- repurposing Parallax and Hector Hammond (and worse giving Peter Sarsgaards Hammond very little to do). But when it comes to the big questions director Martin Campbell -- who knows about fresh starts having twice revived the 007 series first with ""Goldeneye"" and then with the recent ""Casino Royale"" -- seems to have most of the answers. Warner Bros./MCTBlake Lively left stars as Carol Ferris and Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan in Warner Bros. Pictures action adventure release ""Green Lantern."" He has a good sense of pace. A good sense of humor too -- although the film never plays things for easy laughs it gets a few smiles from Hals ""this-is-so-cool"" enthusiasm (and co-star Blake Lively as Hals sometime-girlfriend gets a big laugh out of mocking the secret-identity ruse beloved of every superhero). And while Reynolds may not be quite as buff as Chris Hemsworths ""Thor"" was the Lanterns visit to the CGI world of Oa is a lot more realistically surreal than the Norse gods trip to that trippy Yes-poster they had standing in for Asgard. (The funky cosmic crew he meets there would be right at home in any ""Star Wars"" cantina.) So is Hal Jordan worthy of the Corps? Its no spoiler to say he proves so by the final scene of the film. Is ""Green Lantern"" worthy of taking its place alongside the great superhero franchises? Could be -- but itll take at least one more mission and movie before we can be sure.

As summer garbage goes The Green Lantern cant go fast enough. Even in the brainless world of cinematic comic books gone bad its as bad as it gets--a dumb pointless ugly moronic and incomprehensible jumble of botched effects technical blunders and cluttered chaos. Oh yes. It is also--did I forget to mention?--boring. I retain a certain fondness for Superman Batman Spider Man and my favorite DC Comics superhero Captain Marvel who has mysteriously never been transposed to the screen. But of them all the never-fail cure for insomnia even for 10-year-olds who still buy Cracker Jack boxes searching for secret decoder rings is the Green Lantern deadlier and dopier than even the Green Hornet. Even to a hyperthyroidal prepubescent geek any attempt to relate something as simple as the premise for a plot must be downright defeating. Billions of years ago a power race divided the universe into 3000 sectors ruled by intergalactic peace keepers known as the Green Lantern Corps who live on the planet Oa. The worst threat to the world was imprisoned on the Planet Ryut. This fiend is the Parallax sort of an intergalactic Osama bin Laden who looks like a praying mantis with rabies. Parallax is now loose and declaring war on the planets one sector at a time. Wouldnt you know this unspeakable enemy of mankind is headed for Earth where the only person he cant beat is supersonic F-35 Sabre jet pilot and gym-pumped Esquire cover boy Ryan Reynolds. It gets worse. The dying Green Lantern warrior who comes to warn us hands over his green Buck Rogers ring to a goof-off with Coke bottle abs named Hal who points the ring at a target and--shazam--there goes Afghanistan. Hal has competition (Peter Sarsgaard trashing his career as a creepy wacko scientist and Angela Bassett whose specialty is examining purple aliens). He also has a sexy girlfriend (Blake Lively) the daughter of the demented aviation corporation owner (Tim Robbins) Hal works for. The Lanterns seek peace order and justice. To join them is a big responsibility.  Mr. Reynolds as Hal scarcely has the time to pull himself away from his bench presses long enough to bother. The dialogue consists mostly of lectures about brain-eating bacteria and the locations are identified as stuff like ""The Edge of the Milky Way Galaxy."" It took four writers who shall remain nameless to think up lines like ""We must harness the power of our enemies and fight fear with fear"" Or this favorite exchange ""Why are you glowing?"" ""Why is your skin green?"" ""What in the hell is with that mask?"" At the screening I attended the critics were laughing so loud I missed a few bon mots but you get the picture. The director is Martin Campbell who doesnt. Humans arent the strongest species or the smartest but were worth saving. As a Lantern Hal is a hit when he rubs the ring and turns the films primary color of lime Jell-O but hes also a flop because he has the one thing no Lantern is allowed to have human terror If you care this seemingly interminable rubble of bad technology and computerized escapades is devoted to Hals dilemma. Can he overcome fear and save the film industry from bloated budgets and fiscal apocalypse?  Surely it is time to save Ryan Reynolds from himself. Money says it all but after he went to so much trouble a year ago to prove his acting prowess in Buried the loafing and posing he does in The Green Lantern just seems like a lot of talent gone to seed.  Even as a prime example of rotten summer silliness this is a paralyzing experience. rreedobserver.com THE GREEN LANTERN Running time 105 minutes Written by Greg Berlanti Michael Green Marc Guggenheim Michael Goldenberg Directed by Martin Campbell Starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard 1/4 Comment Filed under Blake Lively Movie Review Ryan Reynolds The Green Lantern Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/06/the-green-lantern-is-a-blockbuster-bust/,200,greenlantern32,greenlantern,observer

An attempt to infuse an earnest piece of comicbook lore with an irreverent tongue-in-cheek sensibility yields decidedly mixed results in ""Green Lantern."" Starring a ripped wisecracking Ryan Reynolds as the greenest member of a mighty intergalactic league of superheroes helmer Martin Campbells visually lavish sci-fi adventure is a highly unstable alloy of the serious the goofy and the downright derivative. Sans Batman/Superman-level name recognition this risky DC Comics franchise launcher will rep a real test of Warners marketing muscle though it functions well enough as eye-popping spectacle to appeal to summer moviegoers beyond its core constituency of salivating fanboys. More than usual for this type of megabudget fare the studio will rely on favorable reviews and word of mouth to counteract negative buzz that has persisted since the release of the films first trailer in November. With four credited writers onboard (including producer Greg Berlanti once slated to direct) the picture has been conceived as a present-day origin story for Hal Jordan the most popular of the six human protagonists who have wielded the green power ring since the creation of the enduring comicbook series in 1940. Packing so much exposition that some viewers may require maps and flow charts a sonorous voiceover introduces the Green Lantern Corps a federation of alien warriors who use their extraordinary abilities for good. But an evil soul-sucking force called Parallax is spreading its tentacles across the 3600 sectors of the universe striking fear even in the intrepid Lanterns who draw their energy from the power of the will fears very antithesis. One of their top fighters Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) is mortally wounded by Parallax and realizes he must transfer his gifts to a new Lantern in the time that remains. Cut to planet Earth home of brash U.S. fighter pilot Hal (Reynolds) to whom the dying Abin Sur bequeaths a ring a lantern and some cryptic instructions. Swiftly teleported to the distant planet Oa Hal runs the usual rookie obstacle course receiving sage advice from chicken-fish hybrid Tomar-Re (voiced by Geoffrey Rush); rough training from piggish Kilowog (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan); and sneering disapproval from Sinestro (Mark Strong) the Lanterns supercilious red-skinned leader. Sinestro disdains human weakness and indeed Hals reckless nature hides feelings of insecurity rooted in his fathers fiery death years earlier as glimpsed in a manipulative childhood flashback. Paradoxically this trauma makes him just the guy to don suit and mask recite the catchy Green Lantern oath and prove that courage is a far greater weapon than fearlessness. Yet it also underlines the irony that this cinematic enterprise should feel so risk-averse in almost every particular and so slavishly devoted to its innumerable bigscreen forebears. For all its industrial-strength visual wonders ""Green Lantern"" is marked by a spirit of profound timidity straitjacketed by its need to satiate its target audience without seeming too geeky for the mainstream. Pic does show an admirable boldness early on embracing its material with a po-faced sincerity that may get laughs from the uninitiated; this is especially true whenever Sinestro seeks advice from the ancient Guardians of the Universe whose pallid oval-shaped heads and stilted diction suggest a council of Yodas several millennia past their expiration date. Yet the filmmakers mock their own bid for seriousness with a jokey self-conscious attitude elsewhere that far from providing knowing comic relief merely saps the picture of gravitas. Even the casting of Reynolds arguably the films biggest gamble soon reveals its calculation; the amusingly glib too-smart-for-the-galaxy actor seems to have been chosen primarily to inoculate the film against its own encroaching cheesiness. As Hal learns to fly conjure weapons with his mind and charm the socks off childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris (an underserved Blake Lively) Reynolds looks alternately flabbergasted and self-satisfied providing little emotional bandwidth for a hero whose sense of wonder the viewer is never allowed to access. Its especially disappointing given the rich psychological dimensions Campbell brought to a very different origin story in 2006s ""Casino Royale."" Registering more vividly as villains often do are Strong as the never entirely trustworthy Sinestro and Peter Sarsgaard as geeky scientist Hector Hammond whose exposure to Parallax triggers a descent into psychotic monomania. With yellow eyes and a freakishly engorged noggin Sarsgaard is feverishly creepy despite inadequate motivation from the script which makes a perfunctory attempt to set up a tangled backstory for Hal Carol Hector and Hectors smarmy-politico father (Tim Robbins). The viewer is left with the annoying sense that the ruling powers of the universe in their infinite wisdom have entrusted the fate of humanity to a Waspy overprivileged social circle with major daddy issues. If it offers little worth listening to in terms of dialogue or music ""Green Lantern"" does provide consistent visual diversions in Grant Majors production design whose otherworldly cityscapes bear some resemblance to the all-digital backgrounds in the most recent ""Star Wars"" pictures. Even when its fantastical effects look blatantly artificial the cleanly edited film has an elegance and overall design coherence that bespeak an able craftsman at the helm. While hardly essential to the viewing experience the application of 3D is well judged in its occasional isolation of foreground elements and image brightness was at acceptable levels at the screening caught.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Francois Duhamel) C+ Green Lantern Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Action/Adventure; Starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard; Director Martin Campbell; Release Date Wide 06/17/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 17 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT One of the essential pleasures of a superhero is that he possesses boldly defined powers. Superman is the space-age Hercules Spider-Man uses his web to catapult himself through the air and each of the X-Men (and X-Women) comes with a flashy metamorphic gimmick. So what of Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) the top-gun fighter pilot?turned?intergalactic crime fighter of Green Lantern? Well he can fly hes pretty damn strong and in a handful of scenes he turns images from his mind into tactile objects made entirely of green light. When a helicopter is about to crash into a fancy outdoor ball he saves the day by converting the chopper into a vintage car and rolling it down a green-light runway. (It seems like a lot of effort; Superman would have just swatted the thing away with his fist.) Hal however doesnt use this pictogram ability that often so there remains something a little vague about him. Mostly he stands around in his shiny pulsating emerald-green muscle suit all dressed up with no place to go. The Green Lantern character dates back to the 1940s and has been revived in comic-book series several times since (first in 1959 most recently in 2005). But even with all of that history the genially lightweight F/X-driven Green Lantern is less a vital origin story than a superhero pastiche. Hal thanks to his hot-dogging fearlessness gets chosen by a magic ring to become the first earthling member of the Green Lantern Corps an army of warriors who police the universe. Reynolds as always is easy on the eyes and hes the soul of likability. He tricks up his perpetually unfazed whats the big deal? presence into a loose-limbed superhero style and at times hes just about as kitschy a straight arrow as Sam J. Jones was in 1980s Flash Gordon. But Green Lantern could have used more of that films knowingly cheesy grandeur. Hals antagonist is Parallax a tentacled glob of floating malevolence who comes off as a rather abstract beastie; theres not much urgency to their showdown. On Earth the spirit of Parallax takes over Hector Hammond a milquetoast professor and turns him into a bulgy-headed vengeful nerd. But even with the gifted Peter Sarsgaard seething in the role hes a fairly innocuous villain. Blake Lively as Hals love interest is sweetly sexy eye candy. Darting between Earth and the rest of the cosmos Green Lantern can be fun as spectacle (which is why kids may go for it) yet the whole movie is eye candy and not much more. Reynolds makes Hal a perfectly functional comic-book hero but theres a big difference between functional and super.

TWITTER The latest superhero movie Warner Bros. reinterpretation of the comic book character stars Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively and Peter Sarsgaard. At least for some members of the public Green Lantern will prompt the question of how many more comics-based superheroes with awesome powers and responsibilities we really need. Dramatically tart in certain scenes but more often just spinning its wheels doing variations on similar moments from previous episodes in the lives of likewise endowed relatives in the DC and Marvel universes Warner Bros. attempt to launch a major new fantasy action hero franchise serves up all the requisite elements with enough self-deprecating humor to suggest it doesnt take itself too seriously. But familiarity may begin to breed creeping signs of contempt if not in immediate negative box office results then in a general fatigue with such enterprises thats bound to set in sooner or later. Known to multiple generations of comic book fans through various incarnations that have sprung up since 1940 Green Lantern possesses powers that would be the envy of many another hero including virtually infinite strength to unleash and ward off destruction as well as the ability to propel himself quickly into the deep reaches of space and back. Hes also accoutered in a uniform distinctly less cool than Batmans and less emblematic than Supermans a skin-tight green affair with a matching mask that here at least he can remove simply by wishing it away when his girlfriend prefers to look him in the eyes without laughing. Simply put its an outfit you really cant get away with unless youre as good looking as Ryan Reynolds. Not uncharacteristically the future Green Lantern suffered a terrible tragedy in his youth; his beloved test pilot father went up in flames before his very eyes. Courting the same fate himself little Hal Jordan also grew up to become a dauntless airman a mad daredevil whose abiding policy with both plane crashes and with women is to be able to walk away from them. Twice burned in this regard has been Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) a fellow flier and aviation heiress who nonetheless has eyes only for the reckless cad. But its for his apparent lack of fear that Hal is chosen by the guardians of an ancient and very distant civilization to join the ultra-elite Green Lantern Corps. a group so exclusive that no human has ever before been invited into it. The script by the quartet of Greg Berlanti Michael Green Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldberg is heavy on exposition for the benefit of the uncomprehending Hal as well as for the audience which cannot be expected to know much about this second-tier DC figure. In fact the backdrop is not uninteresting. The universe according to this gospel is made up of 3600 sectors with the oldest and most advanced is to be found on Oa an intergalactic outpost where wrinkled Yoda-like sages have long reigned over a select group of diverse aliens dedicated to boldly repulsing evil wherever it asserts itself. But when a renegade Corps leader decides to embrace fear and become the arch-villain Parallax (the boom-boxy voice of Clancy Brown) humanity is alerted by the arrival on Earth of emissary Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) a purple-skinned fellow who before expiring passes off his green ring and empowering lantern to the unsuspecting Hal. Hes a reluctant hero to be sure who after a rough training mission to Oa is only convinced to take up the cause against the imminent Parallax by the immensely impressed Carol. Not quite doing for an untested superhero what he did for James Bond in Casino Royale director Martin Campbell seems to most relish the amusing character of Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) a brilliant nerdy scientist enlisted by the government to examine Abin Surs corpse. Thrilled by the privilege he is unwittingly contaminated by the exposure and quickly transformed into a mind-reading Elephant Man lookalike with a zealous propensity for the dark side and a score to settle with his bigshot politician dad (Tim Robbins). Sarsgaard has great fun with the role in a performance that increasingly seems like a sly imitation of John Malkovich at his most arch. But the real threat is Parallax who eventually attacks Earth in the visually disarming form of a billowing shape-changing fire-breathing octopus-like brown cloud. Faced with such an opponent Hal packs away his misgivings once and for all to embrace his new powers and cleverly lure Parallax to the one place that might doom him. To be sure there is enough going on here to keep fans 3D glasses glued to their heads In Oa there is a whole new planet to explore (even if parts of it disconcertingly resemble a darker version of the ugly set for How the Grinch Stole Christmas) the actors are mostly well cast and effective enough and the action comes on frequently if not always convincingly; the heros way of rescuing a large outdoor gathering from an out-of-control helicopter looks hokey and Carols last-second saving the day in a climactic emergency is flat-out ridiculous. Now more than ever resembling the circa 1965 Warren Beatty Reynolds passes muster as a bad boy with greatness thrust upon him and future installments should they follow will not need to indulge his prolonged vacillations about accepting his new role in life. And speaking of sequels an end credits insert plainly reveals which noble character becomes a villain in the next episode.

A new threat known as the Parallax--illustrated as a constantly morphing mass of something like flesh blended with rock almost an Anselm Kiefer construction anthropomorphized--has managed to kill four members of the Corps including an arrogant purple humanoid alien who crashes on Earth and uses his last breaths to command that his ring seek out his replacement.The ring ropes in Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) a bad-boy but regular-old-human pilot given to a specific brand of cockiness that manifests itself via conspicuous self-deprecation. ""I may be a total screw-up in every other part of life but the one thing I do know how to do is fly"" he says after nearly dying in a test-flight exercise when hes suddenly distracted by an attack of convenient exposition--er that is an uncontrollable flashback to the plane-crash death of his own dad. Hal doesnt give himself enough credit He also knows how to flirt often via terrible double entendre with Carol (Blake Lively) a former girlfriend now in line to run her fathers aircraft company.Shortly after the ring finds him Hal is transported via a green energy bubble into space where he meets Lantern leader Sinestro (Mark Strong) an alien who is skeptical that a human could have the skill and intelligence to make it in the Corps. Hal ever the self-saboteur is also sure there must have been some kind of mistake and he takes the first opportunity to escape this new assignment. But then the Parallax gets its hooks into Hector (Peter Sarsgaard) a scientist creepily obsessed with Carol and from there somehow it becomes apparent that the future of the Earth is in danger so you know. . . .I could easily fill pages running down the plot obstacles that Lantern director Martin Campbell soullessly cycles through; identifying all the characters introduced by the films four screenwriters only to be easily disposed of; and ""explaining"" the complete hodgepodge of psychological cause-and-effects from the pervasive daddy issues and complete absence of mothers to the arbitrary less-than-convincing confidence issues that Hal is able to surmount as soon as it becomes clear that Carol really wants to kiss him. But the movie never bothers to suggest that any of that really matters Campbells ADD style privileges spectacle over story--so much so that the film never rewards the viewer for even trying to keep track of what is going on.So you give up and instead try to grab on to the small pleasures which momentarily distract from the fact that the narrative is nonsensical the characters so boilerplate that their every action seem preordained from the earliest frames even as the action on-screen is often incoherent. Sarsgaard with a major latex assist gives a grand camp performance only rivaled in the last 12 months by Michael Sheen in Tron Legacy. While hardly even registering as a villain the Parallax is a breathtaking visual idea--roasting its victims alive while simultaneously slurping up their flesh the entire maneuver rendered as a lacy spray of golden fire and charcoal ash.This is pure cinematic magic but the motives of the menace are muddled if not completely opaque. And while Reynolds isnt a sharp enough actor to really find the crackle in his standard-issue superhero wisecracks his body is a marvel of precision sculpting. As he breathes in and out in the skin-tight digitally enhanced Lantern suit each abdominal muscle seems to pulse independently. Its transfixing--and the closest Green Lantern gets to character detail.
