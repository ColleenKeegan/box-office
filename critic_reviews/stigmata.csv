A richly suggestive chilly fable about a lonely gentle giant struggling to deal with the consequences of blood literally pouring from his hands Adan Aliagas audacious haunting debut ""Stigmata"" reps a distinctive calling card. Largely composed of evocative spaces and silences this challenging but not too demanding item fuses a traditional morality tale with offbeat visuals redolent of early David Lynch. A solidly planted central perf from non-pro Manuel Martinez prevents the pic from slipping over into mere empty artiness. ""Stigmata"" has already left its mark on fests with further manifestations likely. Taciturn ursine Bruno (Martinez a former Spanish national shot-putter) leads a miserably isolated life working at a bar for cruel Dino (Ferran Lahoz) getting quietly smashed on red wine and visiting a sickly girl Lia (Carla Gordillo) the daughter of his only friend Rita (Lourdes Barba). After dreaming that hes uprooted a tree Bruno wakes with bleeding hands. Reactions to this range from disgust (from the bars clients) to incomprehension (from his doctor) and adoration from Rita following Lias recovery. After beating up Dino Bruno heads off to find his missing brother but instead falls in with a troupe at a fairground. Among them he meets and soon marries vivacious Lorena (Marieta Orozco) with whom he briefly finds happiness. Pic has little new to say about good and evil that a couple of millennia of Christianity have not already covered and is more interesting as a study of how even in the modern world a saint is still an outsider . Helmer does well to generate sympathy for a character who rarely speaks whose inner life remains out of reach and whose passivity sometimes frustrates. The fact that Martinez looks like a well-fed Jesus locates him interestingly somewhere between the human and comicbook worlds endowing him with a suitably otherworldly air. Pic is based on Lorenzo Mattotti and Claudio Piersantis graphic novel and has negotiated the generally tricky media transfer smoothly if slavishly closely following the originals plotline. Visually the pic retains the books striking sweeping use of crisp black-and-white. The potential excesses of such allegorical abstract material are carefully harnessed. Slow pacing over the early reels allows Aliaga to show off his talent for composing arrestingly textured tableaux. Equal attention is paid both to somewhat cliched closeups of dripping taps and to Martinezs blank but strangely fascinating face and gigantic body. Exterior shots of stunning Spanish landscapes later on are similarly well executed. Soundwork and Vincent Barrieres eerie humming score are crucial to the pics effect.

Aggressively silly this possession thriller starts out promising a good-time mix of unintentional laughs and director Rupert Wainwrights visual hyperbole. The horror genre hasnt boasted an ""Exorcist"" knockoff in some time and those whove been suffering the lack will get their fix with ""Stigmata."" Aggressively silly this possession thriller starts out promising a good-time mix of unintentional laughs and director Rupert Wainwrights visual hyperbole. Unfortunately even those guilty pleasures soon pall under the dulling effect of a murky rather uneventful scenario. Pic is unlikely to break MGMs recent string of B.O. horror disappointments (""Disturbing Behavior"" ""The Rage Carrie 2"") though its more gaga aspects make it marginally the most distinctive among a weak bunch. De rigueur Third World prologue is set in a Brazilian village where Vatican investigator Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) discovers the ""miracle"" of a blood-weeping Virgin Mary statue and other strange phenomena that have occurred since a local priest died. A thief steals a rosary from said clerics corpse; the object is purchased at market by an American tourist who mails it as a souvenir to her daughter. The recipient is Frankie (Patricia Arquette) a larky 23-year-old Pittsburgh stylist who works in a hair/manicure/piercing salon and spends most of her time out clubbing with roommate and fellow salon worker Donna (Nia Long). Soon Frankie is experiencing spooky visions and seizures that leave her mutilated with Christ-on-the-crosslike wounds. Father Kiernan is dispatched by his antagonistic superior (Jonathan Pryce) to examine her once the attacks attract media attention. Theres much somber mumbo-jumbo about a supposed ""secret gospel"" penned by Jesus Christ and its apparent cover-up by the Catholic Church. But just what power is possessing Frankie and why remains muzzy. That wouldnt be much of a loss if the script (by Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage) provided some decent twists and thrills. But momentum dissipates as little really happens beyond Frankies recurrent bloodletting fits and the rather ridiculous mutual attraction between her and Father K. (recalling another May-December horror love-match Linda Blair and Richard Burtons in the not-dissimilarly nutty ""Exorcist II""). A fiery convoluted finale fails to deliver any satisfying payoff. Pics eventual talky tedium is unfortunate because in its early going ""Stigmata"" whips up an entertaining hysteria of stylistic overkill tittersome dialogue and giddily outlandish situations. The fashion-victim hipness of Frankie and her pals combined with commercials and musicvid vet Wainwrights hyperkinetic visual design suggest this as a sort of ""Romy and Michelles Demonic Possession."" The fun doesnt last but the director (who previously helmed indie feature ""The Sadness of Sex"" and Disneys direct-to-vid ""Blank Check"") deserves credit for keeping the level of energetic if senseless ocular stimulation high. Arquette who hasnt always had the presence to fill out weightier roles for the likes of David Lynch John Boorman and Stephen Frears does just fine here as a party girl in incongruous peril. Byrne maintains an admirably straight face; other thesps get little to do. Splashy lensing and design effects conjure an atmosphere somewhere betwixt ""Batman"" Gothicism MTV and fashion layout; Billy Corgan of the alt-rock group the Smashing Pumpkins contributes with Elia Cmiral a score heavy on dance tracks. Tech package is slick. StigmataProductionAn MGM release of an FGM Entertainment production. Produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. Directed by Rupert Wainwright.

Confronted by this young woman Vatican investigator Father Andrew Kiernan (Byrne) abandons his scepticism and risks all to protect her - especially after he discovers a tangential link to a secret gospel possibly a contemporary record of Jesus own words that would undermine the worldly authority so jealously guarded by his boss the devout but devious Cardinal Houseman (Pryce). In a subtler context the fate of Arquettes confused frightened victim might have invested the conflict between individual belief and institutional power with a human quality. But her affecting vulnerability is drowned out by a head-banging visual and aural assault that tries to batter us into submission. A full-blooded horror film perhaps but a cold-blooded one too.

"Stigmata (R) Related Item ""Stigmata"" showtimes Stigmata Over-the-Top Omens By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 10 1999 Patricia Arquette endures wounds - and overwrought direction. (MGM) Director Rupert Wainwright Cast Mark Adair-Rios; Patricia Arquette; Gabriel Byrne; Tom Hodges; Nia Long; Patrick Muldoon; Jonathan Pryce; Portia de Rossi Running Time 1 hour 42 minutes Contains violence representations of stigmata bloody images partial nudity profanity and obscenity In ""Stigmata"" hairdresser Frankie Paige is not only suffering otherworldly visions. Shes having a heck of a time with exit wounds. Frankie (Patricia Arquette) a sweet-natured soul who does not believe in God has begun experiencing sacred manifestations of the stigmata - the five wounds suffered by Jesus Christ during the crucifixion. These injuries occur without apparent physical cause. One moment shes in the bath the next shes got bloody holes in her wrists. Rushed to the hospital she tries unsuccessfully to convince medical workers this was no suicide attempt. Her spontaneous wounds continue one series of them at a time. After the holes in her wrists she experiences whip marks on her back. Then thorn wounds on her face . . . Actually Frankies mother just sent her a rosary she picked up in Brazil a gift once owned by Father Paulo Alameida (Jack Donner) a priest who was on to something big before he died. Something so big in fact that one of the statues in his church has been bleeding steadily from the eyes causing huge crowds to gather. Enter Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) an emissary from the Vatican who visits that bleeding statue and believes it might be the real thing. By the way Byrnes the best-looking best-dressed priest in the movies since Montgomery Clift in ""I Confess."" Excellent haircut. Totally awesome coat. Still cant deal with being without women. One studly man of the cloth. Apparently part of the Vaticans MTV Outreach Program. When Kiernan makes his report a Vatican meanie called Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce) refuses to believe it. He tells Kiernan to forget the whole thing and investigate this Frankie Paige matter in the United States. But once again Kiernan thinks hes on to something. If this movie teaches us anything its that Rupert Wainwrights direction is far thicker than stigmatic blood. Is there an eighth deadly sin called ""narcissistic direction""? I guess it would go under ""pride."" You never saw such an orgy of overwrought stylistics. Musically the soundtrack is shrouded with pop-style doom and gloom a hipsters cacophony of rhythm and ruse. Wainwright whose head might rotate if I whispered ""subtlety"" too loudly meets nothing he cant render in a monstrous close-up or a doubled image or in extreme slow motion. Its a miracle our eyes dont bleed. When theres a possible deity in the air he cues the fluttering pigeons - or are they doves? And he seems to have studied ""The Exorcist"" a little too closely. We get fuzzy silhouettes in the murky light women speaking in nasty male tongues a priest offering himself as - all right no giveaways.

Starring Patricia Arquette Gabriel Byrne and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What is bloody and full of holes? Its ""Stigmata"" the religioso horror thriller that opens today and surely will close shortly hereafter if not in the hereafter. For a Pittsburgh hairstylist to be afflicted with the wounds of Jesus on the cross is God knows a dreadful experience but it cannot be worse than sitting through this overwrought but half-baked mess. Poor Patricia Arquette is the unfortunate hairdresser and Gabriel Byrne is a Vatican priest sent to investigate supposed miracles. Not only does Arquette come on to the priest as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened but her clients also dont want to have their hair done by someone with bloody bandages on her wrists. Ludicrous as it becomes ""Stigmata"" begins well enough at a solemnly emotional Brazilian funeral where a statue of Mary weeps blood and feathers from fluttering doves float down into it. Father Andrew (Byrne) witnesses these apparently miraculous events and back at the Vatican asks a cardinal (Jonathan Pryce) to let him conduct an investigation. The cardinal deflects him from following up and sends him to Pittsburgh instead. There the most horrific things have begun happening to stylist Frankie Paige (Arquette). She is naked in her bath when her wrists start bleeding like crucifixion wounds. Skeptical doctors believe that she has attempted suicide. Soon she is suddenly lashed by mysterious forces in a subway car and this time the doctors think she has epilepsy. Before this is over Frankie will start speaking an ancient language and madly writing strange script on her walls. Jesus suffered five wounds including one from a spear and she sees the worst coming to her. It does in frantic overblown bursts of images as the poor woman is tormented time and again. Fortunately the body has defenses against assaults like this. Im not talking about Frankie. Im talking about us. The viewers mind thankfully goes numb and blocks out such nonsense. Curiously as the story would have it Frankie feels no pain from these wounds. Even more curiously from the audiences standpoint she goes about her business apparently unaffected by the loss of gallons of blood. She does get a little pale but its overcast Pittsburgh after all. When the priest walks into the beauty salon where she works to meet her for the first time still-spunky Frankie actually asks him if he wants his nipples pierced. She asks a priest she doesnt know if he wants his nipples pierced. Shes not just stigmatic shes stupid. Later the two will have a sun- drenched I-only-have-eyes-for-you tete-a-tete surrounded by flowers. For heavens sake it looks as if theyre going to have a romance. Give me a break. Byrne walks through much of the movie enveloped in an aura of gloom. The most gawdawful things happen to Frankie before his eyes -- she ages like an opening-night society matron whose face-lift fell her bed is consumed by flames -- and he just carries on like Gloomy Gus. Whats that? The bedroom inferno is meant to be symbolic? Oh. I should have guessed but by that time we had been hit over the head by so many religious symbols that I must have been woozy. When the explanation for all this gore and galumphing finally comes its hard to pretend to have any interest although its intended to shake us to our boots. This big-budget MGM production was shot on numerous locations including Rome and Mexico standing in for Brazil. Director Rupert Wainwright is capable of occasional effective sequences including one where Frankie sees a Madonna-like figure outside the beauty-shop window. The actors too all have good track records -- Arquette was in David Lynchs ""Lost Highway"" Byrne in ""The Usual Suspects"" and Pryce was in ""Brazil"" ""Evita"" the James Bond ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" -- and will survive this train wreck. Rade Sherbedgia (""Eyes Wide Shut"") appears in the credits but does not show up until late in the movie when high-level machinations are revealed. All of this is treated with stupefying solemnity including documentary-style explanatory titles at the end just as if anybody cared. ..
