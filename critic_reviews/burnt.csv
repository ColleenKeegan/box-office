Burnt in its celebration of the artistic possibilities of food forgets its primary purpose to be eaten.

Everything per tradition is bright white. It is a uniform that is meant like all uniforms to give the illusion of order--the neat lines of the buttons the meaningful ornaments (it is said that the 100 folds in the classic toque represent the 100 ways a master chef will be able to prepare eggs)--and also in its insistent whiteness of cleanliness.Related Story Food The Newest Celebrity The chefs outfit acknowledges something else too though the messy physicalities of the professional kitchen with its open flames and sharp blades and varieties of boiling liquids and hot human bodies jockeying for extremely limited space. The buttons on the chefs coat are covered in cloth so they wont melt or scald during the hours spent hovering over stovetops. The apron serves not just as a barrier against stains to the chefs coat and pants but also as a makeshift mop. The toque is tubular so as to conduct the heat of the kitchen away from the chefs head--a design meant to minimize both sweat on the chefs forehead and in turn the dripping of perspiration into the food the chef serves to her guests.Burnt featuring Bradley Cooper in only his second-best turn as a chefbro explores the tension embodied by the toque the chefs aspirations for artistry versus the vaguely martial realities of the professional kitchen. And the chefs aspirations for commercial legitimacy as well as cultural. What does it mean to be a chef--per the words etymology a leader--at this particular point in culinary history? What does it mean at this moment to bring innovation to that most basic and also that most contentious of things nutrition?These days the closer a restaurant can be to a food truck for the most part the better. Burnt is to be clear not a good movie. It is in fact a pretty terrible movie. Its plot lacks tension its characters are underdrawn its female lead sacrifices both herself and her young daughter inexplicably to the whims of an only marginally charismatic chef. (Its entire plot revolves around the question of whether or not Adam Jones (Cooper) will earn a third Michelin star. That audiences are meant to become invested in this goal in the first place reveals a lot about its flaws.) But the film like the chefs coat is also revealing in its insistence on the purity of the culinary project Burnt in its loving celebration the art of fine dining ends up making clear how outmoded the notion of ""fine dining"" has become.Burnt comes during the time--maybe even during the height--of the celebrity chef and the Food Network and Smitten Kitchen and Instagram and ""food porn"" and Guy Fieri. It comes during a time not just of the democratization of food culture (indeed during a time when ""food culture"" as a phenomenon seems more legitimate than ever) but also of a widespread focus on the details of foods production and preparation and politics. Locavorism. ""Sourcing."" Food deserts. Farmers markets. Blue Apron. Spatchcocking and canning and pea guac and GMOs. Burnt nods in its way to those shifts We get scenes of Jones--a chef whose career was almost derailed with drugs and booze but who is staging a culinary comeback--at food stalls in markets in hole-in-the-wall dining establishments we are meant to understand as ""ethnic."" When hes feeling overwhelmed in his quest for that third Michelin star he goes to a fish market to find his peace. Which Local And soulfulFor the most part though Burnt--remarkably considering that almost all of its action takes place in a kitchen--is a celebration not of the process of cooking but of the result. Here food is presented not as much as a production the result of the messy thermodynamics of work but rather as an artistic representation that happens almost inconveniently to be edible. Food is fetishized not as nourishment but as a kind of aesthetic triumph. So while there are shots of turbot being basted in butter and of fresh linguine that flutters and falls like thick strands of hair--this is a cooking movie after all--that action crescendos with lingering shots of finished plates dainty and fastidious sauced with squeeze bottles and finished with edible flowers and generally evoking a Pollock-meets-pollock style. There is very little description of the foodstuffs actually contained within the plates displayed. And almost no attempt to describe what the food in question might actually taste like.Never mention what your favorite dessert is. Its irrelevant.What we do get though are debates about the moral vicissitudes of the sous-vide bag (is it innovation or cheating?) and glib judgments about the moral valences of food. (""Youre serving seared tuna"" Adam scoffs to a maitre d he used to work with. ""What happened to your self respect?"") And philosophy-inflected discussions of the moralities of cooking (""God gave us oysters and apples. We cant improve on them but its our job to try"") and the sensualities of pasta. We get a lot about What Food Means; we get very little about what food is.So in Burnt in other words food is an artistic endeavor and an intellectual one. The point here is Taste much more than it is taste Burnt is more interested in food as a normative thing than as a subjective one. Food in its vision is a commercial product and a form of media and a kind of intricate performance art in which improbably the food itself is largely beside the point. Burnts nearly inevitable pre-restaurant-opening montage focuses on shots of Joness gleaming kitchen and of white napkins being ironed to glistening crispness and of polished cutlery being placed around plates with the help of a ruler and of latex gloves used to handle wine glasses so as to leave no evidence of human touch. Everything is polished and pristine.This is meant to be a good thing. Burnt doesnt just revolve around the will-he-or-wont-he of Adam Joness third Michelin star; it also plays by Michelins rules. It celebrates all the old--old as in traditional and old as in antiquated--ways to make dining you know fine.Thus the ironic anachronism of a culinary movie released in 2015. It used to be that ""fine dining""--a theatrical thing as well as a gastronomic one--was as much about the ""fine"" as the ""dining"" Service and ambiance and the like were integral aspects of the whole dining experience. Many ""fine""--which is to say expensive--restaurants prided themselves on the balletic coldness of their service on their adherence to a set of codes that they themselves had determined. (Hence that (in)famous New York Times article ""100 Things Restaurant Staffers Should Never Do"" which included admonishments like ""Do not announce your name. No jokes no flirting no cuteness"" and ""Never mention what your favorite dessert is. Its irrelevant."") The politics of food--the talk of the organic and the ethical--give eating a sheen of spirituality.Now though the pageantry of the restaurant experience has shifted from a spectacle of service to a spectacle of soulfulness. The emphasis is on the back of the house rather than the front--food is the focus--and restaurants that try too hard on the ""fine"" front read as stuffy and thus outdated. In vogue now is the hipster lunch counter of Momofuku and the open kitchen of Girl amp; the Goat and approaches that emphasize a connection between chef and patron between food producer and food consumer. These days the closer a restaurant can resemble a food truck for the most part the better.All of which makes ""dining""--not just as a word but as a concept--increasingly antiquated. The fineness in food now comes not just from its artistry--its plating its ingenuity--and from its flavor but from something fuzzier too its soulfulness. The politics of food--all that attention paid to the organic and the sustainable and the ethical--have given it a sheen of spirituality. And so ""dining"" is giving way to simply eating. The pageantry of the past is being overtaken by a performance of democratization. The tagline for ""The Sporkful"" the writer and food philosopher Dan Pashmans podcast insists that the production is ""not for foodies--its for eaters."" Burnt was originally going to be called Chef before the Jon Favreau movie of the same name was released to acclaim last year. Its striking how different the two films are. Chef--which focuses on not just its eponymous cook but also on friends and family and food trucks and the drippy delights of the Cubano sandwich--celebrates the communal intimacies of food. It treats food as a means rather than an end in itself. Set largely in Miami and also in the convective heat of a truck outfitted with flattops Chef imbues food with an almost visceral warmth. Burnt too may be set for the most part in the heat of a kitchen; it is for all that noticeably cold.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Photo Credit AP / Alex Bailey advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A self-destructive chef seeks redemption in the form of a third Michelin star. Rated R (language mild violence). BOTTOM LINE A macho foodie fantasy with Cooper as a swaggering sex god in an apron. If this were a comedy it would be brilliant. CAST Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Daniel Bruhl LENGTH 140 Look out foodie cinema -- theres a new sheriff in town and his name is chef Adam Jones the swaggering hero of ""Burnt."" Played by a perfectly stubbled Bradley Cooper Adam is an attractively damaged bad boy with a motorcycle jacket and a halibut recipe that will give you ""culinary orgasms."" Hide the booze Stash your drugs And be sure to lock up your daughters because Adam is too savory for any woman to resist. ""Burnt"" is not a comedy but if Cooper were replaced by Will Ferrell it would be almost as funny as ""Anchorman."" Written like a noir by Steven Knight and directed like a moody cop show by John Wells (NBCs ""Third Watch"") ""Burnt"" takes itself so seriously that it ends up as self-parody. How else to describe a movie in which the romantic leads kiss so passionately that they fling away their shopping bags full of skinned sole? advertisement | advertise on newsday If the hero of Pixars ""Ratatouille"" was essentially Billy Elliot and the hero of Jon Favreaus ""Chef"" was Jerry Maguire then Adam is ""like the Rolling Stones"" says one awestruck character. (Hence the gritty blues by John Lee Hooker that opens the film.) Formerly the enfant terrible of Paris Adam flamed out three years ago with drugs alcohol and women. Now hes sober and living in London where he starts a bold new restaurant -- Adam Jones at the Langhorne -- with his cautiously supportive friend Tony (Daniel Bruhl). Their goal the elusive third Michelin star. ""Burnt"" strains hard to strike macho poses within its rarefied world. Sometimes it feels like ""Full Metal Michelin"" as Adam browbeats his staff and forces them to apologize to the food theyve ruined. At other times its a culinary ""Chinatown"" as pretty sous chef Helene (Sienna Miller) presses Adam for the truth of his shadowy past. Matthew Rhys plays Reece Adams only equal; the two relish their rivalry like a couple of Kung-Fu masters. Movies29 big movies in theaters this fall This inadvertently entertaining movie may be to your taste if you like your bacon extra-crispy and your French fries dark brown. Despite the presence of Mario Batali as a consultant it has to be said ""Burnt"" is overdone.

(Alex Bailey) Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt.(Alex Bailey) Burnt Unimaginative foodie drama leaves disappointing aftertaste Add to ... Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 30 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 30 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by John Wells Written by Steven Knight Starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Daniel Bruhl Classification 14A Country USA Language English We have it on good authority that the actors of Burnt - a fairly edible cast indeed - binged on Michelin-starred meals during the filming of the moody-foodie movie. The hunky Bradley Cooper enjoyed thinly sliced grilled meat the luminous Sienna Miller spooned beef sauce as if it were soup and Sam Keeley judged the turbot as ""stunning."" Well its nice that someone got fed. Because what happened between meals on the set resulted in some bad bouillabaisse indeed. Although rich in cast the bad-boy-chef dramedy Burnt is unremarkable otherwise. Lots of quick cuts and kitchen close-ups - of gas stoves buttery saucepans and stock characters concentrating preciously on haute cuisine - and lots of unmoving melodrama. ""If its not perfect you throw it away"" says Coopers plate-throwing chef Adam Jones. Pity director John Wells doesnt aspire to the same level of quality control.And pity that Cooper isnt given much to work with here. (Although arent the best chefs supposed to be able to whip up a gourmet meal with shoe leather plum sauce and one brown egg?) Where Coopers troubled lead characters in American Sniper and Silver Linings Playbook are complicated Burnts Adam Jones is just a guy in a movie Drug-free and sober for ""two years two weeks and six days"" the disgraced rock-star chef seeks rebound and redemption in England after a previous Paris meltdown - a very buttery one no doubt.Arriving in London with nothing but a set of kitchen knives and a bad reputation our cocky/jerkish American sets to assembling a crack crew of cookers. Theres a young talented but unproven Irishman (Keeley) an unrepentant ex-con (Riccardo Scamarcio) an apparently forgiving sous chef done wrong by Jones back in Paris (Omar Sy) and a talented single mother and reluctant romantic foil (an excellent bob-haired Miller). Its quite the white-smock brigade and the way chef Jones rounds them up is right out of The Dirty Dozen. Unfortunately Wells though associated with the stellar television ensemble casts of ER and The West Wing doesnt spend a lot of time on any of them except for Millers Helene.What the director busies himself with instead is an uninspired subplot complication involving a pair of French roughs who are after Jones for unpaid drug-related debts. The chef has a high-paid new gig and a well-funded friend whos willing to lend him money and yet he refuses to pay off the thugs. Why not? No reason really.The most interesting performances come from Daniel Bruhl (as proper and precise Tony a gay restaurant owner who gives his kitchen away to a chef he admires for more than his foie gras) Emma Thompson (as Joness wise therapist) and Matthew Rhys (as a competing chef whose compassion is commendable).The plot has to do with Joness single-minded pursuit of a prestigious three-star rating from the Michelin Guide an international taste-making institution. The chef throws tantrums like a tennis star and much too rarely tosses up a bon mot such as ""Apologize to the turbot because it died in vain."" (Ah fish humour we haddock coming.)Also dying in vain are the best efforts of Joness staff and would-be friends. The chef doesnt treat them well; his perfectionism does not extend to personal relationships or even common decency.And yet most of the people around the edgy kitchen general truly seem to care about him. It is doubtful audiences will warm to Coopers character or this film though. The chef stresses flashy food he hopes is so brilliantly orgasmic that diners will stop eating it in mid-chomp their taste buds tingling in astonishment. The routine Burnt will have viewers stopping all right - and sending the unimaginative serving back to the kitchen and into the dumpster where it belongs.

Credit Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company ""Burnt"" a rehabbing-chef story starring Bradley Cooper is bound to inspire headlines full of tiresome kitchen wordplay ""half-baked"" ""underdone"" ""lacks seasoning."" What it really is though is late for dinner.The film might have felt fresh and invigorating in say 1996. Thats when ""Big Night"" a much-admired foodie movie was released. In recent years though mercurial chefs photogenic plates of grub and kitchen dramatics have been everywhere especially reality television both lowbrow and high-end. The food-as-art world has become a bit tiresome except to those who live in it or can afford to eat this stuff five nights a week. Video Movie Review Burnt The Times critic Neil Genzlinger reviews ""Burnt."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date October 29 2015. Photo by Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company. Watch in Times Video >> embed And so pretty much everything in ""Burnt"" which was directed by John Wells from a screenplay by Steven Knight and a story by Michael Kalesniko is something weve seen before though perhaps not so slickly rendered. Mr. Cooper plays Adam Jones a hot chef in Paris until he flamed out thanks to a self-destructive personality abetted by substance abuse. As the story begins in earnest he has turned up in London determined to make a new start and reclaim his culinary stature.For a time the movie feels like a heist film as Adam calls his old kitchen gang together; one is even just getting out of prison. He insinuates himself into a restaurant owned by an old acquaintance (Daniel Bruhl) who in a side plot is also in love with him. And he adds some new blood to his crew most notably Helene (Sienna Miller).What follows is a decently structured story of personal demons and culinary competition with a couple of nice twists thrown in but its built with materials that at this point in the life cycle of this genre are mighty shopworn. Endless close-ups of artisanal plates of food fussily prepared. Frenetic kitchen scenes in which orders are shouted and pans sizzle. And of course frequent dish-smashing tantrums and tirades by Adam because all master chefs are petulant abusive jerks arent they? Video Trailer Burnt A chef who loses his highly rated restaurant in France tries to mount a comeback in London by re-assembling his team. By THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY on Publish Date September 30 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed The kitchen-tyrant character may have a fair number of real-life counterparts but it has become a cliche because it is practically the only version of this occupation that we ever see on television or in the movies. Surely there are some benevolent patient chefs out there and if there arent lets stop glorifying kitchen bad boys. No kitchen worker deserves to be berated over one pinch too many of some spice no matter how elegant the dish.""Burnt"" has other flaws like not giving Ms. Miller enough to do but its main one is simply that at this point its hard to care about people who mistake a third Michelin star for the most important thing in life.""Burnt"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) because when things heat up in the kitchen curse words fly. Running time 1 hour 40 minutes.

The movie opens nationwide Oct. 30. (Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company via AP) Share PhotoThe best thing going for Bradley Coopers character in ""Burnt"" are his bright blue eyes. His Adam Jones is apparently a gifted chef but with his arrogant persona and penchant for loud outbursts it hardly seems worth finding out even despite those baby blues.Jones is so unlikeable that spending 100 minutes with him on screen is as unpleasant as languishing over a bad meal -- you just want to kind of walk away and find something better. ""Burnt"" is further hampered by narrative loose ends clunky explanatory dialogue and a love interest (Siena Miller) who behaves as no real woman would.Written by Steven Knight (""Pawn Sacrifice"") and directed by John Wells (""August Osage County"") ""Burnt"" follows Jones efforts to restore his cooking career after a bout of bad behavior and return to Michelin Star status.The film opens with the embattled chef shucking oysters in New Orleans. The job is a penance Coopers Jones explains in voiceover He was once a promising young chef with the opportunity to run his mentors restaurant only to squander his future with drugs infidelity and an inflated sense of importance.Now sober and with renewed focus Jones heads to London to reconnect with former colleagues and strong-arm them into working with him.He runs into Michel (Omar Sy) who awkwardly explains to Jones exactly how he wronged him when they worked together years ago in Paris (dont they both know this already?). Jones meets up with restaurant critic Simone (Uma Thurman) who oddly tells him that she slept with him even though she is a lesbian. Again wouldnt they each already know this? Saying it aloud for the benefit of the audience feels odd and inauthentic. The performances are honest enough. Its just that people who know each other dont talk this way.Next Jones works over another former friend celebrated London maitre d Tony (Daniel Bruhl) and monopolizes his restaurant. The move seems even more egregious when it becomes clear through sessions with an unethical therapist (Emma Thompson) that Jones took advantage of Tonys romantic feelings for him.Most unrealistic though is Millers character Helene. Introduced as a talented up-and-coming chef and devoted single mother who works at a competing restaurant Helene can tell Jones is a jerk as soon as she meets him yet shes lured to his kitchen by a much bigger salary. That part makes sense. But despite Jones yelling at her belittling her skills grabbing her by her (alluringly loose) tank top and ditching her for another woman at a party he invited her to Helene suddenly forgets her parental responsibilities and falls for him. Miller plays the role sincerely but come on. Those pretty eyes arent THAT magical.Cooper does what he can with Jones but theres no saving this guy from his own miserable personality.In its favor the food looks good in ""Burnt."" The beets are bright the roe roundly appealing. A tomato salad looks like a still-life portrait. The precision and beauty of a five-star meal is an art whose creation clearly has its own rhythm and drama.But unless you also want a tremendous side of ego and hearty helping of yelling ""Burnt"" may be a dish to skip.""Burnt"" a Weinstein Company release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for language. Running time 100 minutes. One star out of four.___MPAA Definition of R Restricted.

"Review Celebrity-chef comeback film Burnt leaves a sour aftertaste - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Celebrity-chef comeback film Burnt leaves a sour aftertaste Burnt Review Alex Bailey / The Weinstein Company Bradley Cooper inthe film ""Burnt."" Bradley Cooper inthe film ""Burnt."" (Alex Bailey / The Weinstein Company) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Burnt"" is overcooked. If that sounds like a glib way to describe an entertainment about the comeback of a celebrity chef its also perfectly suited to a movie that wears its glossiness as a badge of honor.Of course being glib and glossy can be diverting in the right hands and ""Burnt"" has been concocted by experts including screenwriter Steven Knight (""Dirty Pretty Things"" ""The Hundred Foot Journey"" ""Locke"") and director John Wells who has been a force in television since the days of ""E.R."" and ""The West Wing."" And given that protagonist Adam Jones (played in classic star-vehicle style by Bradley Cooper) is an arrogant bad boy chef so full of himself he makes Donald Trump seem humble and contrite one could argue that ""Burnt"" comes by its cockiness honestly.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; But in spite of a strenuous attempt to portray Jones as the most magnetic human being on the planet so sexually attractive that lesbians sleep with him and gay men wish they could his kind of conceit does not charm us for as long as its supposed to.We dont see Jones in his bad old days when he was the talk of Paris earning two Michelin stars before throwing it all away in a haze of drug use and all-around reprehensible behavior but we hear all about them in the chefs voiceover. Burnt (Trailer) ""Burnt"" is a comedy starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Lily James Uma Thurman Emma Thompson and Alicia Vikander that follows a famous Paris chef on a quest for his third Michelin star. ""Burnt"" is a comedy starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Lily James Uma Thurman Emma Thompson and Alicia Vikander that follows a famous Paris chef on a quest for his third Michelin star. See more videos When ""Burnt"" picks up the story Jones is about to leave New Orleans where he has spent years shucking exactly 1 million oysters (he keeps a running tally) as some kind of crackpot penance for all the harm hes done.Thus cleansed Jones heads for London determined to open a restaurant and win his coveted third Michelin star. This even though in the time hes been gone high-end gourmet cooking has changed forsaking saucepans and embracing the sous vide system of encasing food in airtight plastic bags. Quelle horreur That change is the least of Jones problems. Restaurant people he burned hate him so much they chase him down the street French drug dealers will stop at nothing (nothing) to get the money he owes them and the nicest thing a top food critic (Uma Thurman) can say to him is ""one hoped you were dead."" See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Not making things easier for the chef is that not even his hard times have diminished his weakness for cutting repartee. ""My advice chef"" a former associate tells him in all seriousness ""if you want to live a long life eat your own tongue.""Undaunted Jones calls on his charisma and talent to round up a team to work with including ace maitre d Tony (Daniel Bruhl) and old Paris rival Michel (Omar Sy). But the one person hed really like up-and-coming young chef and single mother Helene (the versatile Sienna Miller) turns out to be the only person in all London who can resist his charms. Imagine that.If you think its all going to go smoothly for Jones once he has his kitchen gang assembled you underestimate screenwriter Knights gift for plot development and his ability to place an ever-increasing series of barely plausible obstacles in the chefs path.Because the main question here turns out to be not whether this culinary Rolling Stone (Knights image not mine) can get his third star. Rather its whether he can become a decent person and rejoin the human race. Thats the kind of question movies like ""Burnt"" always like to ask.As is usual in culinary cinema great care has been taken to make the food photographed by cinematographer Adriano Goldman look quite tasty and authentic even to the point of hiring celebrity chefs Marcus Wareing and Mario Batali as consultants.But neither their presence nor that of actors like Emma Thompson and Alicia Vikander in cameos can earn this film the cinematic equivalent of Michelin stars. There have been numerous superior films about food from ""Babettes Feast"" and ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" through ""Big Night"" ""The Lunchbox"" even ""Ratatouille."" ""Burnt"" is mildly diverting but its just not in their league.---------------------BurntMPAA rating R for language throughoutRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general releaseMORE MOVIE REVIEWSOur Brand Is Crisis pulls punches but Sandra Bullock is in high gearIndias Daughter traces atrocity that became a tipping point Carey Mulligan lifts Suffragette from its overly earnest leanings Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Bradley Cooper Sandra Bullock Daniel Bruhl Uma Thurman Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-burnt-review-bradley-cooper-uma-thurman-20151030-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,burnt5,burnt,latimes

Courtesy of The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of The Weinstein Company Bradley Cooper as Chef Adam Jones in a scene from Burnt. Courtesy of The Weinstein Company Like other films about food Burnt embraces the seduction of taste. It pairs extreme close-ups of sauce being spooned atop gourmet dishes with conversations about the orgasmic pleasure of a good meal and Bradley Cooper gets to conduct some of them in fluent French. The film is often sexy; they dont call it ""food porn"" for nothing. But unlike say Jon Favreaus charming Chef or Pixars lovely Ratatouille Burnt cant top off its plate with engaging characters or an exciting story. This confection fades almost immediately after its over leaving only a slight tingle on the tongue. This is the slick redemption tale of bad-boy chef Adam Jones (Cooper) one of those insufferable movie geniuses who keeps getting told what a talent he is even as he uses those closest to him for silverware target practice. A hotshot chef in Paris years ago Adam emerges in London newly clean and sober having seemingly turned over a new leaf. But one thing that remains unturned is his bruising all-American approach to the restaurant game. Become the best or its not worth it. As Adam mounts his quest for an eatery worthy of three Michelin stars other characters turn up in a pattern First we learn why they have every reason in the world to turn their backs on Adam then we see them partner with him anyway. This routine is how we meet the maitre d (Daniel Bruhl) who got the short end of Adams last venture; a new chef de partie (Coopers American Sniper costar Sienna Miller) who immediately despises him; and a sous chef Adam once betrayed (Omar Sy still deserving of much better than the English-language work hes been saddled with). All were either burned (burnt?) by Adam in the past or meet with terrible first impressions of the man yet they apron up and step into his firing line even after he explodes in Food Network fashion following a disastrous grand opening. For all the self-destructive behavior the protagonist exhibits his staff displays even more by continuing to work with him and it makes you wonder what their support group would look like. The script by Steven Knight and Michael Kalesniko is the latest example of male pattern redemption -- in Movieland an ailment far more common than male pattern baldness. Director John Wells always bends the action in Adams direction; even when hes wandering the streets looking for new tastes we rarely get a good glimpse at the people providing those tastes. Wells also produced a far more compelling story about a disturbed talent in Love amp; Mercy a Brian Wilson biopic that twisted the familiar redemptive arc and played like the best of fiction. Burnt is the opposite a work of fiction that still serves up every greatest hit on the biopic menu just because everyone always orders it. No chefs specials. What works best in Burnt is specificity the same thing that works best in any film about a trade. A fast-food joint becomes the setting for a lively discussion about French ""peasant food"" and the luxury of those who can enjoy chef-crafted delicacies as a form of high culture. (Here is where one hopes the film got its moneys worth out of chef consultants Gordon Ramsay and Marcus Wareing.) But theres a lack of payoff to early scenes like these. Would a chef this interested in the eating habits of the people really serve the kinds of dishes Adam does in such a haughty way or attack rivals for using behind-the-times trends? And if such dissonance is the point of the character why isnt the film more aware of it? Adam never actually ventures into unfamiliar territory himself. Instead he stays floating among the gastronomic elite even when hes at his lowest. His self-imposed punishment for years of substance abuse and nasty behavior is shucking oysters in New Orleans a city thats hardly the culinary backwater this movie thinks it is. When drug dealers beat him up the love interest tends to his wounds in the luxury hotel room where hes been staying on a friends good graces. Lifestyle porn like food porn is all well and good. But for a guy who loves to preach the gospel of bold flavors and the evils of consistency his foodie redemption fantasy sure tastes pretty ... safe.

Bradley Cooper is a former two-star chef bent on a comeback in ""Burnt."" Photo Alex Bailey Associated Press Burnt is yesterdays dinner warmed up in the microwave 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Timing might not be everything but its definitely something and so its no advantage that ""Burnt"" arrives in theaters as the third movie about a chef in 18 months. If this one were the best of them or if it were some completely new take on the subject it might not matter. But ""Burnt"" is the least of them with familiar scenes and ideas served up like a dish of warmed-up leftovers. And so fresh out of the microwave we get another story of a once-great chef in need of personal and professional redemption (as in Jon Favreaus ""Chef"") only this time his grand pursuit is another Michelin star (as in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey""). As in the other movies this chef is supposed to be a master but unlike the other films that assertion is hard to believe when we see whats coming out of his kitchen. The food cooked and created by the great Adam (Bradley Cooper) -- and served up to us in ""Burnt"" -- looks like the worst fancy-phony trend cuisine Two tiny pieces of fish cut into perfect rectangles served on a tiny bed of vegetables with a garnish of spring flowers. Is this food or edible sculpture? I skipped dinner to see this movie and the only time I felt a hint of missing something was during the scene when the chef slumming goes to Burger King. In a food porn movie like this if a Whopper with cheese is the most delicious thing up there theres a big problem. Whats worse (albeit appropriate) is that the food seems to suit the man. Adam is pretty much an unpleasant creep bent on impressing the world not pleasing the people around him. Hes the kind of fellow who will give employees a hard time and customers a pigeon on their plate. He would depopulate a city park of its pigeons to impress the Michelin people. Fortunately ""Burnt"" has Cooper who has a chilly appeal but an appeal nonetheless. Theres a certain preening about him an awareness of his effect on people that is present in many of his performances but theres usually a faint hint of self-disgust too which is redemptive. He makes Adam not someone likable but someone we end up caring about against our will because we see something in him or think we do. Maybe its just good looks making us want to believe. The heros backstory is sketchy so sketchy that one wonders if even the screenwriters know the details. Apparently Adam was a two-star Michelin chef in Paris who cracked up and became a drunk and a heroin addict. As the movie picks up his story he has dried out for two years and is ready to make a comeback this time in London. He goes to work for the son of an old friend -- Daniel Bruhl in a subtle sensitive performance -- and assembles a kitchen staff. With a mix of audacity and cluelessness ""Burnt"" dares to present Adam as an obnoxious jerk and yet expects him to retain audience sympathy. Early in the film he has a monstrous kitchen tirade in which he grabs little Sienna Miller by the shirt and looms over her shouting and pushing her across the room. (She plays a cook who did something slightly wrong.) He makes Michael Fassbender in ""Steve Jobs"" look like a model of sweet-natured tolerance. Behind ""Burnt"" is the suggestion of a particular world where food is supposed to be always evolving and where cooking as though it were still 2007 -- or even designing a dining room that doesnt look absolutely up to the moment -- is considered an embarrassment. Such micro-worlds are not without interest but the heart of the movie concerning Adams evolution into something resembling a human being falls flat. Part of the problem is that his evolution from a moral amoeba to a paramecium though progress of a kind is hard to celebrate without a microscope. But the real issue is that everything about Adams journey feels half digested and tossed back up. Weve seen it before. It was better the first time.

With help he cleans up and returns to London determined to redeem himself. VPCBradley Cooper stars as a former bad-boy chef determined to resurrect his life and career in John Wells film. It could have been promising but is too predictable.Bradley Cooper is a chef looking for redemption in the new kitchen drama ""Burnt.""(Photo The Weinstein Company)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2.5 stars out of 5Bradley Cooper is supposed to be abrasive but is off-puttingJohn Wells doesnt have the light touch that would have made the film more intriguing""Burnt"" the Bradley Cooper vehicle about a disgraced master chef reclaiming his life and kitchen takes intriguing ingredients and combines them in an unsatisfying way making what could have been a tasty dish a bland predictable hash.This will end the strained food metaphors.Probably.Cooper stars as Adam Jones who was the bad-boy superstar of Paris in his chef-of-the-moment days but booze drugs and women caused him to crash and burn -- and burn his bridges on the way down.After getting clean and serving a self-imposed exile shucking oysters Jones decides its time to come back. He heads to London determined to get his third Michelin star cementing his reputation as a legend -- the good kind. He wants to be famous again not infamous.AZCENTRALDaniel Bruhls film career keeps cooking with BurntThis will be a difficult task because seemingly everyone who is anyone in the world of fine dining hates him. With good reason most of them.So yes its a redemption story. Cooper is a creative inventive actor willing to make himself unlikable. Hes more than a pretty face though hes that too. Unfortunately director John Wells a veteran of television (""ER"" ""The West Wing"") doesnt possess the nuanced touch the film needs. Its heavy-handed and predictable with a talented international cast serving mostly as a punching bag for Jones outbursts which include not just the usual plate-throwing tantrums youd expect from a perfectionist chef but in a new twist (at least for me) the insistence that one of his underlings eat a spoiled scallop (though he relents and lets the poor sap secretly spit it out).AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Among the long-suffering Helene (Sienna Miller) a talented single mom who alone will stand up to Jones sometimes; Michel (Omar Sy) whose own restaurant Jones sabotaged in a wasted rage long ago but is willing to work for him; old-time and betrayed pal Tony (Daniel Bruhl) the maitre d whose restaurant Jones commandeers; Max (Riccardo Scamarcio) fresh out of prison where he served a stint for food-related violence; and David (Sam Keeley) a green young chef eager to work with a superstar. Until he actually works with the superstar.The absolute authority of the chef in the kitchen is a fascinating thing. Reality shows have taught us (or perhaps taught  the chefs themselves) that explosive behavior is as important to your reputation as a good knife and an attractive plate. But Jones single-minded in his determination to succeed is ruthless and neither Cooper nor Wells knows how to pull back. Thus Jones becomes less of a damaged talented chef and more of a first-class jerk.Thats fine too and could have made for an interesting movie. ""Burnt"" isnt it. Instead things go as you would expect. Mostly.AZCENTRALBurnt (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Steven Knight script has a couple of twists one especially satisfying. But theyre window-dressing brief distractions from the all-important mission of Jones getting his groove back. Matthew Rhys as Jones main competitor and Emma Thompson as a why-is-she-here therapist are good but not around enough.The food it must be said is beautiful. (Mario Batali and Marcus Wareing were consultants on the film.) And Cooper despite the shortcomings of the role as written goes all in. So does Miller. This should be a better movie than it is.As it stands though its merely -- sorry -- unappetizing.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

It is not a feel-good movie like Chef and its not likely to boost enrolment in cooking schools. But people-I-know-who-know tell me theres more than a bit of insanity and vanity (and even violence) in the worlds high-end kitchens. And while it doesnt go all the way Burnt is a drama that at least starts down that path - far enough to entertain anyway. Indeed as the movie begins theres more than enough bad-blood in the backstory for a couple of soap operas. Bradley Cooper stars as Adam Jones an American who has improbably become a three-star Michelin calibre chef in France (the second time this season weve heard a Hollywood star speaking French part of the time in a movie - the other being Joseph Gordon-Levitt in The Walk). Accent on ""has"" because as we meet Adam he has torched his career in an apparent drug meltdown is on the lam from criminals over drug money and is serving a penance of shucking a million oysters in New Orleans. And at the one million mark - hes headed to London to reclaim his career. Hes going to charm a restaurant owner (Daniel Bruhl) whos always loved him and had his heart broken repeatedly. Hes going to enlist the reluctant help of a young phenom Paris chef (Omar Sy) whose career he sabotaged in his drug-fury days. And hes going to steal a young hot sous-chef (Sienna Miller) whose newfangled ideas (cooking in sous-vide bags) rankle the old-school Adam even as he starts to look at the young upstart with an appreciative eye. And oh yeah he intends to say ""In your face"" to his mortal enemy and fellow three-star Michelin guy Reese (Matthew Rhys). The latter is so intimidated by the return of his enemy he trashes his own kitchen. Im not an expert but I have a feeling verisimilitude is not one of Burnts strong points. Still I find oddly appealing the idea of these scorchy gastronomic factories operating on the edge of anarchy always a hairs breadth away from breaking out into food fights. The maguffin in all this is the anticipated ""secret"" visit by the almighty Michelin tasters (the certainty that one can spot them being about as dependable as the assurance of a winning horse). In the end director John Wells (August Osage County ) has not created a ""deep"" movie missing the chance to take the movie much further into the heart of kitchen darkness. Nor does Cooper ever quite come off as the whispered-about genius were constantly assured that Adam is. But the acting is otherwise assured throughout whether its central characters like Bruhls or Millers or extraneous ones like the therapist played by Emma Thompson who is both Adams drug-tester and sounding board. If the last-act redemption is a little predictable getting there makes for engrossing viewing - food fights violence and all.

This foodie drama from screenwriter Steven Knight reheats some of the story elements from his last such enterprise The Hundred-Foot Journey theres a bitter rivalry with another restaurant and a lot of huffing and puffing about Michelin critics coming incognito to review the new place. The hero spends an inordinate amount of time screaming at his kitchen staff and hurling plates of food at the wall which is more fun to watch than the canned relationships that constitute most of the movie.

He attempts to rebuild his career in London in the hopes of returning to Paris to open a new restaurant. (The Weinstein Company) Everything you need to know about Adam Jones the difficult cooking prodigy at the center of ""Burnt"" you glean from the movies opening scenes. Adam is the kind of guy who punishes himself by taking up a seemingly impossible task shucking a million oysters. Once he has met his goal years later he bails on his boss without so much as a farewell. Would it kill him to finish his shift? He may be a man who submits to self-flagellation but hes even worse to everyone else. Viewers enjoyment of the movie will largely depend on their feelings about Bradley Cooper the Academy Award nominee who plays Adam. Clearly the character isnt easy to love. Hes a genius but no amount of artistry can compensate for how manipulative and mean he can be. (Residual goodwill from Coopers charming performance in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" can only help.) [Bradley Cooper talks temper tantrums and other heated moments.] As it turns out Adams shucking challenge was amends for abominable behavior years earlier. Adam was once the chef in a two-Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Paris but drugs and alcohol turned him into an even bigger monster than he was when sober. His decision to disappear and clean up his act has left some people assuming he had died. But now hes back to his former friends and enemies surprise descending on London with a plan to open his own restaurant and accomplish a nearly impossible feat earning his third Michelin star. In a sequence fit for a heist movie Adam recruits a team to help him do it fiery single mom Helene (Sienna Miller); a frenemy from his past life Michel (Omar Sy); violent ex-con Max (Riccardo Scamarcio); and Tony (Daniel Bruhl) a maitre d who will do anything for Adam because hes in love with the guy. Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) returns from restaurant purgatory to open his own kitchen in London in ""Burnt"" calling on old friends and enemies while trying to earn another Michelin star. (Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company) The cast is so star-studded that the first half of the movie feels like a parade of cameos. Uma Thurman drops by momentarily to play an exacting restaurant critic. Emma Thompson shows up as Adams wise therapist. Next-big-thing starlets Alicia Vikander and Lily James each make fleeting appearances. (There wasnt enough time to squeeze everyone in; ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" star Jamie Dornan also shot scenes that were cut from the film.) When the movie eventually narrows its focus to the task of actual cooking things get interesting. The behind-the-scenes glimpse of high pressure restaurant work -- informed by celebrity chef Marcus Wareing who worked as a consultant on the film -- is both fascinating and horrifying and not just because the chefs keep dipping their fingers in all the sauces. On opening night Adam has a meltdown channeling Gordon Ramsay as he throws plates at the wall roughs up Helene and berates everyone in sight. So this is how sausage gets made. Shooting inside a cramped kitchen cant have been easy but director John Wells leverages his experience on such kinetic highly choreographed shows as ""E.R."" to effectively capture the action. As the opening of ""Burnt"" proves Steven Knights script is efficient. And while some of the dialogue can be overly expository the script is also peppered with snappy exchanges. When Adam heads to lunch at the three-star restaurant run by his nemesis (well played by Matthew Rhys of ""The Americans"") he says ""A little bird told me you lost your touch. A little lobster confirmed it."" Adams disdain for seared tuna may do for the ubiquitous dish what ""Sideways"" did to Merlot. Knight also wrote the script for last years cooking movie ""The Hundred-Foot Journey."" But ""Burnt"" feels more authentic than either that film or Jon Favreaus meringue-light ""Chef."" Warm fuzzies are not on this menu. After all how often do we see chefs onscreen actually scrubbing stove tops after the dinner service has ended? Its not pretty but it captures something that few cooking movies do reality. R. At area theaters.

Because Burnt is just about the toniest movie anyone could make about a recovering junkie throwing tantrums and lobbing pots and pans at people its restaurant kitchen milieu given a culinary magazine gloss by John Wells conservative direction the egos whiffing away when they could explode into full-on grease fires. With the exception of one indelible image of meltdown--a chef trying to suffocate himself by putting a sous-vide bag over his head--that comes too late to make a difference Burnt lacks the emotional flush that would make it seem like something more than a quick competent translation of a script by Steven Knight who offers up yet another monk figure seeking redemption in the London backstreets. (See also Eastern Promises Dirty Pretty Things and uh Redemption.) This time around its Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) former American bad boy of French cooking who shows up in London after three years off the grid having sworn off drugs and women determined to finally earn a three star Michelin rating. Mind you he doesnt have a kitchen to cook in let alone a restaurant and for its opening stretch Burnt basically runs like a heist comedy with Adam assembling a team of old buddies (one of whom he actually picks up from prison) in order to strong-arm one Little Tony (Daniel Bruhl) into letting him take over the Langham Hotels restaurant and re-make it from scratch. Any movie heist needs a rookie who comes in the form of Helene (Sienna Miller) a talent scouted by Adam out of an Italian restaurant. Like a few other movies scripted by Knight Burnt feels like two acts missing a third and its small pothole of a dramatic arc isnt done any favors by Wells rushed and minimally personal approach which allows just two small flourishes (one involving the Donnie Darko score the other involving rack focus) between all the quick-cut back-and-forths and montages of modern London architecture fancy kitchenware and fancier food. Coopers charm imposing post-American Sniper physique and proficient French carry the movie propped up by a very strong supporting cast (which includes Omar Sy Emma Thompson Alicia Vikander Uma Thurman and Matthew Rhys) whose roles mostly consist of fascinated or exasperated reaction shots. It just doesnt carry the movie anywhere interesting.Gourmet restaurant kitchens--in which competitive obsessive personalities are locked in a room full of knives and open flames--are spaces of innate tension and high drama. But Burnt seems reluctant to push things too far perhaps recognizing that monsters like Adam are at their funniest and most intriguing when they have no reason to change. At the same time Burnt doesnt have the guts to just let Adam Jones be. Though its soft-hearted ending doesnt reach the Steve Jobs level of sentimental insincerity it still feels like a big wet fizzle a life lesson about teamwork learned by a character whose defining trait is the fact that hes hit rock bottom over and over and always clambered out on the strength of his own ego. Perhaps Adam is just too good an asshole to be believable as anything else.

(Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company via AP) Review Burnt is more medium than well done By Jody Mitori St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jody Mitori Oct 29 2015 (...) The Associated Press Bradley Cooper as Adam Jones in a scene from the film ""Burnt."" (Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company via AP) Like last years ""Chef"" ""Burnt"" follows a talented cook who has failed miserably and needs to find the key to rebuilding his career. In the former film Jon Favreaus title character ditched his restaurant and found the joy of cooking in a food truck with his young son. In ""Burnt"" Bradley Coopers damaged chef must learn how to let others help him make his food great.Cooper plays the swaggering Adam Jones who has burned most of his bridges with past bad behavior. Years earlier he was one of the best chefs in Paris until he destroyed his career and friendships with drugs and alcohol.But after completing his self-inflicted penance of shucking a million oysters Adam is sober and ready to return to the dining scene. With amazing ease he goes to London and visits the cooks and maitre d from his past restaurant with the plan of finding the right team. Why do they want to join the arrogant Adam? As one young cook tells his girlfriend ""To chefs he is like the Rolling Stones."" But Adam needs new blood too and he eyes Helene (Sienna Miller) a talented sous chef. She reluctantly comes on board on opening night of the new restaurant where she witnesses firsthand how volatile Adam can be in the kitchen.Adam selfish and aloof is single-minded in his goal to create a three-star Michelin restaurant. Cooper tries to make him appealing with his natural charisma and he looks comfortable in the kitchen zipping from station to station stirring and tasting stirring and tasting. The food looks pretty too with plates of halibut and beef strands of homemade pasta and a pink bouquet of a birthday cake. Director John Wells gives the cuisine a lot of screen time more than what is given to many of the supporting players in the kitchen who show such promise in the beginning of the movie. Two characters who do stand out are single mother Helene whom Miller portrays with intelligence and resolve and Paul (Daniel Bruhl) the maitre d who puts his family money into the restaurant because he cares so deeply for Adam. Matthew Rhys (TVs ""The Americans"") shows his sneering side as Adams temperamental rival. Omar Sy Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson also have brief turns in the film. As Adam predictably self-destructs ""Burnt"" veers into melodrama and then finds a tidy solution. With such a strong cast the film has the right ingredients but it doesnt quite make a perfect meal.What ""Burnt""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 147  Rating R  Content Language Jody Mitori  314-340-8240jmitori on Twitterjmitoripost-dispatch.com Tags Burnt Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Daniel Bruhl John Wells Jody Mitori Jody Mitori Jody Mitori is assistant managing editor features for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"Burnt a half-baked kitchen drama review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies Burnt a half-baked kitchen drama review Bradley Cooper stars as a rising superstar chef seeking a second chance after he flamed out with drugs booze and drama in Burnt.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 29 2015BurntStarring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Daniel Bruhl and Omar Sy. Directed by John Wells. 100 minutes. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 14AAn intense Bradley Cooper sporting just the right amount of scruffy beard muscles his way into the role of hot-tempered fallen superstar chef Adam Jones in Burnt.Having made his name as a two Michelin-starred chef in Paris then blew it with drugs booze and tantrums taking a bunch of people down with him.Article Continued BelowBradley Cooper stars as chef ADam Jones in Burnt.  (eOne Films)  After a penitent cooks tour of New Orleans (an awkward narration explaining past sins) Adam is in London his ego still intact enough to announce he can land an elusive third Michelin star. Hell do it with the help of hotel restaurant maitre d Tony (Daniel Bruhl very good here) who hasnt entirely forgiven him for past transgressions yet has a reason for granting a second chance.Adam hires a sous-chef he once wronged (Omar Sy) then boorishly bursts into another kitchen during lunch rush to strangely belittle chef Helene (Sienna Miller) expressing admiration for her food by humiliating her in her workplace. He later convinces her to join team Adam Jones because shes a single mom and Burnt screenwriter Steven Knight (Locke Eastern Promises The Hundred-Foot Journey) figures we need a romance angle down the road.Thats among the biggest disappointments of Burnt. Miller and Cooper teaming again after American Sniper have palpable onscreen chemistry (especially an amusing scene where he furiously makes her apologize to the poorly cooked turbot). Her tough-seeming Helene is underwritten and their awkward romance never feels authentic.Once in the kitchen things look deliciously realistic thanks to consulting chefs Marcus Wareing and Mario Batali. Coopers character acts like a nightmare cooks like a dream and tosses imperfect plates of food like Jose Bautistas bat.He alternates between sulks and fury alienating most of his ""yes chef""-chorusing staff. Outside work Adam is chippy in sessions with Dr. Rosshilde (Emma Thompson). Shes the restaurant-appointed psychiatrist who draws blood to check his sobriety but would rather be poking in his tormented cranium.His drive for excellence is more focused on unmasking anonymous Michelin Guide inspectors and blowing their three-star-granting minds than satisfying hungry diners. Fact is Adam is a jerk much of the time driving his kitchen to achieve perfection against the backdrop of his own emotional flaws. Despite Coopers best efforts screenwriter Knight and director John Wells (August Osage County) arent able to make a convincing argument for why we should care about Adam Jones making it difficult to feel sorry for him when he fails and worse hardly quick to root for his reinvention. Appetizer-size cameos from Uma Thurman as a fussy critic and Alicia Vikander as Adams ex add little although there are some interesting exchanges with rival chef Reese (Matthew Rhys) who presides over an all-white temple of gastronomy down the road. Theres a lot of talk of passion in Burnt yet it doesnt make the leap into the pure love of food explored in films like Chef The Big Night and Babettes Feast. These made us feel hunger as well as emotion a connection to the people who stood over the sizzling pans breath held until the first bite satisfied a longing. Burnt settles for serving up cold leftovers.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Burnt is Bradley Cooper and tantrums galore - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Burnt review Bradley Cooper serves tantrums galore Burnt (Trailer) ""Burnt"" is a comedy starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Lily James Uma Thurman Emma Thompson and Alicia Vikander that follows a famous Paris chef on a quest for his third Michelin star. ""Burnt"" is a comedy starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Lily James Uma Thurman Emma Thompson and Alicia Vikander that follows a famous Paris chef on a quest for his third Michelin star. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Slice; saute; throw plate against wall; repeat. In ""Burnt"" playing a brilliant tormented American chef clawing his way to the top of the London culinary scene Bradley Cooper throws more tantrums than a seasons worth of ""Rugrats.""The movie is devoted three ways to the characters reckless past as an apprentice in Paris drink and drugs and women strewn in his wake; to his lust for the validation of a coveted third Michelin star rating (""I want people to be sick with longing"" he says of his cooking ambitions); and to an artery-clogging number of close-ups frenetically edited by Nick Moore of the films real stars. The real stars are the potatoes and filets and mackerel sizzling in hot lakes of butter or lounging just so with just the right garnish on an obscenely well-arranged dinner plate. ""Burnt"" is sufferin followed by succotash. Since we all like to eat foodie movies can be regular gold mines. ""Burnt"" screenwriter Steven Knight recently scored a popular success with one ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" (Helen Mirren versus spice-loving interlopers in provincial France). Even so a so-so foodie movie has a way of stoking your raging class issues and questioning all the waste. In ""Burnt"" each time Adam Coopers character hurls a plate of imperfectly cooked hundred-dollar entree against a gleaming kitchen wall I felt like calling the cops or a homeless shelter or something. Then another tight shot of a prawn dancing in hot butter came along sending me into another drooly micro-reverie.Beginning in New Orleans ""Burnt"" whisks Adam to London where hes aiming to begin anew after a spectacular flameout years earlier in Paris. With the wary but adoring help of some old kitchen comrades including maitre d Tony (Daniel Bruhl pursed lips and lovelorn glances every second) and sous chef Michel (Omar Sy) Adam takes over Tonys sleepy fine-dining establishment. He staffs the newly energized and relentlessly bullied kitchen with among others the wizardly comely Helene (Sienna Miller) seduced into Adams hot-tempered universe because shes tough enough to learn from a seriously unpleasant protagonist. Part of the problem with ""Burnt"" relates to Adam as written. Hes a pill. Its easy -- too easy -- for a movie to establish a bad boys bad behavior and then for audience sympathy purposes gradually reveal his demons and vulnerabilities and turn him into a redeemable human being. Here each and every character orbiting the glorious arrogant sun that is Adam keeps finding reasons to forgive and forget which is noble but improbable. While Cooper modulates Adams mood swings as artfully as possible burying his own charm (some would say ""smarm"") under all-nighter stubble and a look of vague regret ""Burnt"" is one those character studies where character dramatic nuance doesnt actually count for much.

Acadia Ryan McCaskeys fine-dining restaurant in the South Loop was boosted to two Michelin stars and Parachute and Duseks Board amp; Beer received one star apiece as the Michelin Guide announced its star selection for Chicago restaurants Tuesday. ""McCaskeys got it all"" said Michael Ellis... (Phil Vettel) Director John Wells dices the action even the simplest conversation into five harried shots when one would suffice. The many food-prep montages are cut and paced to the same numbing rhythm. The film doesnt lack for conflict; Adam has drug dealers on his tail and an ex-lover (Alicia Vikander) who pops in from Paris. But only Emma Thompson doing what she can in a few minutes of screen time as Adams wise recovery counselor adds the ingredient ""Burnt"" otherwise lacks a human pulse. In Hollywoods high-comic heyday with an Ernst Lubitsch or a Preston Sturges in the kitchen a movie about haute cuisine egomaniacs whod kill for a Michelin star wouldnt have dared to handle its subjects quite so sanctimoniously.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Oct. 29 2015 Thursday Oct. 29 2015 Thursday Oct. 29 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The food looks fresh and gorgeous in Burnt a parade of sous-vide and sauces that will send audiences into the streets ravenous.Its the rest of the movie that feels stale. Director John Wells ( August Osage County the fantastic Company Men) goes behind the swinging kitchen door to explore the competitive world of high-end cooking but unlike his chefs doesnt come to the table with anything surprising or eye-opening.Bradley Cooper is Adam Jones a two-star Michelin chef who didnt just burn bridges at his Paris restaurant he blew them up with nuclear devices. Drug-addicted womanizing and cruel he left behind a string of enemies and bad debts before fleeing to New Orleans where he anonymously shucked oysters in a neighborhood dive and got clean.As the movie starts Jones wants his reputation back -- as well as a third Michelin star -- and has moved to London to get it.He approaches a former associate Tony (Daniel Bruhl) whos running his fathers restaurant into the ground about taking over the spot. Tony who at first is not happy Adam is back and possibly bringing anarchy into his staid life reluctantly agrees. But there is one condition Adam has to have regular drug tests and counseling from Dr. Rosshilde (Emma Thompson).Now Adam has to get his team together and that includes a few friends from his old days -- jailbird Max (Riccardo Scamarcio) and failed restaurateur Michel (Omar Sy) -- as well as some new faces including nice-guy David (Sam Keeley) and single-mom Helene (Sienna Miller) who from the start is clearly going to be heating up more than a few pots and pans in Adams life.Of course under pressure in the kitchen Adam falls back into his old bullying ways turning into a Frankenstein combo of Gordon Ramsay pre-CNN Anthony Bourdain and the music teacher from Whiplash. Curses and plates are hurled with equal ferocity.Also unhappy is a crosstown rival Reece (Matthew Rhys) who also knew Adam in his firebrand days and doesnt welcome the competition. And then those pesky Parisian drug dealers still want their money.Cooper brings a rough-hewn energy and swagger to the role and most of the supporting cast is solid as well though Uma Thurman as a restaurant critic and Alicia Vikander as an old flame dont have much to do. Thats a shame because Vikander is one of the best of todays young actresses.Everyone is hampered by the generally predictable script from Steven Knight (who penned last years amazing Locke) about a bad boy having trouble growing up. A secondary plot involving Tony is something that might have been thought of as edgy in the 80s but just seems tired now.There are inspired moments as when Adam and Helene are locked in concentration perfecting a dish and the passage of time is signified by their co-workers saying ""good morning chef"" and ""good night chef."" Wells does manage to capture the high heat and the kitchen cacophony that outsiders imagine takes place before the plate is set in front of them.Still while Burnt may not be sent back its doubtful many will want seconds.

(Alex Bailey) Movie review of ""Burnt"" Bradley Cooper stars in this charmless -- and borderline offensive -- culinary calamity. Rating 1/2 star out of 4. Share story Mario Batali and Marcus Wareing consulted on ""Burnt"" so the intricacies of a restaurant kitchen are rendered creditably unlike the rest of the bad-boy chef drama. The chef in question is played by a charmless robotic Bradley Cooper. The pat explanation for his pat past -- meteoric rise addiction downfall and cleanup for a comeback -- is ""He had a difficult childhood you know."" Now hes on a mission to get three Michelin stars one that feels like an endless storyboard meeting of Hollywoods numbest minds. The dialogue ranges from cheesy (""We should be dealing in culinary orgasms"") to nonsensical (""People eat because theyre hungry -- I want to make people stop eating""). Cardboard-cutout supporting characters include the rival (another egomaniacal plate-thrower Matthew Rhys) the love interest (a strong-willed but coincidentally super-sexy sous chef Sienna Miller) and the business partner (nemesis/best friend/its complicated Daniel Bruhl). But the films not just formulaic its also offensive. The conceit that the worlds top chefs are mercurial bullies who -- whoops -- fall into heroin-holes is only one of a full set of insulting dated stereotypes. Cooper physically assaults Miller while yelling obscenities in her face in front of the entire staff; she -- whoops -- falls in love with him anyway. Uma Thurman turns in a cameo as a food critic who slept with the putatively irresistible Cooper even though shes a lesbian. Theres even a soupcon of racism in a sabotage subplot. Movie Review 1/2   Burnt with Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller Daniel Bruhl Matthew Rhys. Directed by John Wells from a screenplay by Steven Knight. 100 minutes. Rated R for language throughout. Several theaters. For a film about a perfectionist who had a difficult childhood seeking three Michelin stars allow me to recommend ""For Grace"" the documentary about Chicago chef Curtis Duffy. Its slow in parts but offers genuine humanity hold the facile redemption. Duffy just garnered three Michelin stars for the second year. As for whether the chef in ""Burnt"" earns his in the end well what do you think? Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

All Stories >> Bradley Cooper starring as a chef in a movie about food and how it reflects life. How can it miss? Exhibit A Burnt a cheerless and unappetizing plate of piffle that deserves to be smashed against a wall or at least sent back to the kitchen. More News Bradley Cooper Pledges to Help Close Hollywood Wage Gap 20 Best Horror-Movie Sequels Are Prequels Killing Movie Franchises? All Stories >> Related Fall Movie Preview 2015 From James Bond to Star Wars From Oscar contenders to new Tarantino and Star Wars films all you need to know on the seasons big movies Director John Wells who botched August Osage County and screenwriter Stephen Knight who should know better (he wrote the brilliant Locke) cooked this mess up and they get all the ingredients wrong. On the surface Cooper seems a good fit as Adam Jones a dick-swing American expat who made his name in Paris and then let drugs bring him down. Now off the junkie train and having done penance in New Orleans by humbly shucking oysters a sober Adam picks London for a comeback and a chance to achieve his goal lead a restaurant that earns the ultimate three Michelin stars. Though hes pissed off everyone in his wake Adam persuades his old enemy Tony (Daniel Bruhl) to  turn over his own restaurant for Adams redemption. For years Tony has long yearned to get into Adams pants a fact redundantly spelled out by Adams therapist (a wasted Emma Thompson). Anyway Chef Adam builds his crew including one woman sous chef  Helene (Sienna Miller) a single mom with no real purpose as a character except to give Adam a shot a true love. Cooper and Miller so fine in American Sniper are here just dots to be connected in a script off a moldy menu of cliches about relapse and recovery. Cooper has been advised to ape the mannerisms of reality-show chef Gordon Ramsey yelling throwing things and ending every sentence with a nasty rhetorical ""yeah."" As in ""Youre an idiot yeah?"" or ""Get out of my face yeah?"" This is one stupid soggy movie yeah? Adam is such a loathsome self-pitying human being that you almost root for him to fail Worse Burnt gets the food sinfully wrong. The whole premise of this sinking cinematic souffle is that Adam is an artist with gastronomy. But we never know what goes into his art. We see plates fly by skillfully arranged turbot scallops and filets edited in such a manic blur by Nick Moore that we never get a good look at anything much less what it tells us about Adam. Jon Favreaus underrated Chef made food a representation of the chefs soul. The same goes for Ratatouille Babettes Feast and the classic Big Night. God really is there in the details. The unsavory truth about Burnt is that there is no there there. Adams dishes have no personality no passion no reason for being -- just like this movie. Its a recipe for cinematic indigestion.

Photo Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW Burnt Running time 100 minutes. Rated R (profanity drug references). The chef protagonist of ""Burnt"" Adam Jones is compared to Mozart Obi-Wan Kenobi and sex. Often he is the one making these comparisons because otherwise we might forget about the transcendent historical importance of a guy whose world is a plate of scallops. It would be hard to name a class of men characterized by a higher ratio of bombast to achievement than chefs Gentlemen youre not Navy SEALs you make mayonnaise. Shouting ""F - - k you"" at the saucier and throwing plates on the floor does not make you a tough guy just a jerk. Bradley Cooper and Sienna MillerPhoto Weinstein Company So Bradley Cooper who plays Jones is essentially the opposite of his ""American Sniper"" character a man who speaks loudly and carries a spatula. His crises are manufactured and internal yet he cant stop talking about what a tortured artiste he is. When he puts a plastic bag over his head youll be rooting for the bag. And look theres Sienna Miller on his arm again This time shes his pathetic assistant hash slinger who after being chastised and manhandled by him just cant help falling in love with this arrogant blowhard. ""Burnt"" is the tale of how Jones after quitting a fancy Paris restaurant then kicking booze and drugs in New Orleans rebounds in London where the restaurant of a friend (Daniel Bruhl) needs fresh ideas. Jones goal is to earn himself a third Michelin star at the restaurant but if the guy was a semisuicidal heroin addict as a 2-star chef is a third star really going to change anything? Yet the shrink in his life (Emma Thompson) doesnt seem to figure this out. The film doesnt even tell us much of anything about how top kitchens work except that theres lots of yelling and bitchy quips like ""Your look is very Paris-in-2007."" Jones seems baffled by sous vide cooking -- Ive heard of that and I dine at Subway. ""Burnt"" is directed by ""ER"" producer John Wells as though he was working from a ""Storytelling for Idiots"" manual Characters walk onto the set to announce who they are and what their history with Jones is. Uma Thurman for instance is the snooty Brit food critic (if its possible to be snooty when you work for the freebie the Evening Standard) who seems to promise bedevilment but instead just disappears as does Alicia Vikander who pops in and virtually says ""Hi Adam remember me the daughter of your old mentor and fellow drug addict?"" About that manual It must have been missing Chapter 1 the bit where it warns that you must make the audience care about the hero and his quest. Instead both Adam and the stakes are so low its like watching 100 minutes of a slug trying to crawl over a twig.

He showed it off as far as back as 2005 when he played a bad-boy top chef based on Anthony Bourdain in a short-lived Fox comedy titled Kitchen Confidential. PHOTOS Bradleys love life A decade and three Oscar nominations later hes got the knives out again for a new foodie-themed project. And without him in the starring role this sour-tasting film would be toast. (Food metaphors are fun More to come) Hes Adam Jones the former enfant terrible of the culinary world. A self-destructive junkie with a short temper he got blasted out of his former job at a Paris eatery and did penance by shucking a million oysters at a New Orleans dive bar. We learn via voice-over that hes clean and sober now and ready for his careers second act -- but its obvious hes retained his edge. You know because he has a five-oclock shadow and wears a leather jacket. Adam moves to London where conveniently all his former cohorts now reside. Youd think these talents would take one good look at this good-looking jerk and run back to Paris. Yet after he takes over an upscale eatery almost all of them return to work for him. He also ropes in a few newcomers including his sous chef -- a sharp-tongued single mom named Helene (Sienna Miller). Keep an eye on Omar Sys Michel by the way. He owns the best and most unexpected scene in the film. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt Alex Bailey/Weinstein PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Adams goal to glean a better perspective on life outside the restaurant bubble and become a more decent human being. Just kidding. He wants to earn himself the oh-so-coveted third Michelin star. (It sounds familiar because this was also a plot point in 2014s lovelier The 100-Foot Journey.) He doesnt care how he treats his staff to get it. And apparently the feeling is mutual. Though Adam makes Gordon Ramsay seem like Big Bird one in-awe newbie raves that hes like a Rolling Stone in the chef realm. In many respects this is a delectable part for Cooper. Speaking impressive fluent French at times he gets to break rules break plates and break hearts. (Only one is in the literal sense). For all his general boorishness there is admittedly something sexy about his rock-star swagger in the kitchen. Thats really Cooper doing the slicing and dicing and his colorful plates are true works of art. (Mario Batali served as a consultant.) Aside from those mouthwatering entrees though not much else is cooking here. Overstuffed with characters and subplots the frenetically paced drama bites off way more than it can chew. Its not enough for Adam to chase after that third star; he must also reacquaint himself with a food critic/former fling (Uma Thurman in a role almost completely left on the kitchen floor) and have wistful talks with the daughter of his mentor and yet another former fling (Alicia Vikander). Emma Thompson also shows up as a counselor who administers his drug tests and longs for him to open up to her. Mercifully he did not or does not romantically pursue her as well. PHOTOS Stars who love to cook But he does romance Helene -- and disappointingly she reciprocates. This is a guy who shoves her and insults her in the kitchen on opening night. There are witnesses. He has a history of drug problems and an ego bigger than the size of London itself. He wont even let her take an afternoon off to plan her daughters birthday for crying out loud. She makes out with him anyway. Miller played Coopers wife last year in American Sniper a movie in which she conveyed significantly more backbone and tough love. Needless to say a diva chef is no Navy Seal hero. The inherent problem in Michelin-minded movies is that the average moviegoer doesnt give a fork about the high stakes high cuisine drama. It comes off annoyingly pretentious and self-important. Thats why its crucial to feature characters worth caring for. Alas when the chef in charge is a narcissistic hothead. . . well its time to get out of the kitchen.

If food is better than sex as some folks insist there is no better proof imaginable than Burnt a mildly entertaining but well acted sumptuously photographed and smartly written comedy with dark undertones about culinary addiction that can only be called ""delicious."" See it and then check your cholesterol. BURNT  (3/4 stars) Written by John Wells Directed by Steven Knight Starring Bradley Cooper Sienna Miller and Daniel Bruhl Running time 100 min. Fatally addicted to gastronomy Bradley Cooper takes on a deft role that is totally different from anything hes ever done before. Washed up in Paris as one of the worlds greatest chefs after winning two coveted Michelin stars Adam Jones disappears addicted to drugs and alcohol and ends up in New Orleans shucking oysters. After his one-millionth shell and no pearl he walks out and starts over in London determined to take over the great gourmet restaurant owned by his late mentors partner Tony (Daniel Bruhl). Distrustful because of his past reputation and afraid hell destroy his restaurant in the distinguished Langham Hotel in the process Tony reluctantly surrenders because he needs a rock star chef who will generate publicity. Hes also in love with Adam who will do anything and use anybody to get his third Michelin star. In the ruthless odyssey from sleeping on the floor to hypnotizing Londons culinary aristocracy Adam is arrogant heartless unscrupulous immoral and utterly without guile as he goes about hiring the best staff ever assembled composed of criminals enemies and past betrayals--all of whom know exactly how to fillet a turbot and create miracles with a pad of butter and a wad of tarragon. He also gives up booze drugs and women in an effort to clean up his act and make amends for destroying so many people in his salad days in Paris. He isnt always successful but first and foremost he turns the cuisine into Technicolor enchantment. You watch Bradley Cooper work his own miracles too as he dissects a pigeon reduces a sauce and wins over the toughest food critics while the camera roots around through prime cuts of sirloin sublime cherry tomatoes and ripe figs like a pig searching for truffles. You also watch him raging and bullying his kitchen staff smashing glasses measuring the potato slices timing the halibut and dumping out entire meals that fail to meet his standards. Hes a precious monster so mean-spirited and self-centered that it takes a long time to warm up to his explosive personality and despite Mr. Coopers energetic and bombastic performance a little of Chef Adam goes a long way. Hes passionate about food to the point of madness. He doesnt want reviews that call his restaurant ""interesting."" He equates food with orgasms. Hes also taking daily injections for an illness that is never properly explained but mysteriously related to his former life of excess debauchery. After his doctor (an efficient matronly Emma Thompson) tells him theres nothing wrong with needing others and prescribes a hug he turns soft in the center like a profiterole and falls for a lady chef with a child to raise who prefers Burger King to beef bourguignon. This preposterous romance leads to a Love Conquers All finale which throws the movie a curve ball I could do without despite the fully assured contribution of Sienna Miller as the girl. (Uma Thurman also makes a brief but amusing appearance as a tough lesbian food critic.) But the big question remains Does Adam get his third Michelin star? Ill never tell. Wittily written by Steven Knight and directed by John Wells (the disastrous August Osage County) at a pace fast enough to deglaze a pan Burnt is elaborately photographed and you get a gastronomic tour of the kitchen at the Langham where I have dined many times to beatific delight and can testify to the quality. You also get to pick over the asparagus in the Billingsgate Market Londons equivalent to Les Halles. The movie is slight and blunted but you go away stuffed.

I blame Anthony Bourdain. Ever since the biker-jacketed gastronome published his best-selling 2000 memoir Kitchen Confidential weve been inundated with tattooed rebels trying to convince us that theyre Jimmy Page with a zester. Now into this pop culture culinary milieu comes Burnt. Its a movie that not only feels about 10 years too late its message is basically that in order to be a great chef you have to be an arrogant jerk who treats everyone in the galley like crap. How else will they know youre a genius? Of course theres room for redemption -- in the movies theres always room for redemption -- but only after youve pissed off everyone around you because they just dont get your alpha-dog artistry your golden-god greatness and your obsessive Arthurian quest for (cue the heavenly choir) a third Michelin star. I think you can probably tell that I didnt care for Burnt. Or at least the first half which is so stuffed with bad-boy cliches and arias of egomania it felt like a MAD magazine parody of Top Chef season 6. I almost felt bad for Bradley Cooper who plays Adam Jones -- a once-hot chef who was more or less expelled from Paris after snorting too many drugs and screwing over too many people (basically the same character he played on the short-lived 2005 TV version of Kitchen Confidential). As penance Adam went to New Orleans and shucked a million oysters. Now hes back on the scene in London trying to resurrect his career by earning that third star. He goes one by one to his old crew (Daniel Bruhl Omar Sy Riccardo Scamarcio) and makes amends -- or as much amends as his vanity will allow. He also takes on some rising hotshots like Sienna Millers feisty single mom Helene. Apparently the bigger a chefs sense of self-importance the stronger the gravitational pull. All of this is pretty predictable hash. And if theres a sense of deja vu with Adams Michelin pursuit it might be because screenwriter Steven Knight also wrote last years Michelin-themed comfort-food film The Hundred-Foot Journey. But just when you think you know where Burnt is headed theres an underhanded twist about halfway in. And its almost enough to set the movie right. It doesnt hurt that Knight and director John Wells have Bradley Cooper behind the burner. Hes one of the few actors who can convincingly play unlikable a-holes in the first act and end up earning your sympathy by the third -- even if his hands are as tied as a Christmas roast as they are here. In one of the films many rapturous speeches about cooking Adam says ""I want to make food that makes people stop eating."" In the moment it sounds poetic almost profound. But much like Burnt the more you think about it the less sense it makes.

The book was eye-opening if true and a rambunctious vicarious pleasure even if only semi-true. But although it eventually made Bourdain a TV star it surprisingly didnt spawn a legion of movies set in restaurant kitchens. There have been a few like Scott Hickss tepid 2007 No Reservations (with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart). But John Wellss Burnt is the first mainstream picture to attempt to serve up the full Bourdainian-bacchanalian experience even though Bourdain has no involvement in the film.The result is an overflowing oddly seasoned plate. Bradley Cooper -- who actually did play a version of Bourdain in a 2005 TV series based on Kitchen Confidential -- plays Adam Jones formerly a star chef at a hugely successful Paris restaurant. Drink drugs and other crazy stuff got the better of him and he dropped out and got clean As the film opens hes serving a self-imposed sentence doing the lowliest of tasks shucking oysters. But even if his liver is a shambles his ego is fully intact. He launches a plan to restart his career in London persuading an old associate Tony Balerdi (Daniel Bruhl) to take a chance on partnering with him. Tony reluctantly agrees and Jones proceeds to be his obsessed perfectionist self throwing tantrums in the kitchen every five minutes often for no discernible reason. Plates fly against the wall and pan lids get dashed to the floor where they spin and clatter like wayward symphony cymbals.Film Details Burnt RatingR GenreComedy Running Time100 min. More Info Trailer You might need all that noise to keep you awake. Wells (director most recently of August Osage County) and screenwriters Steven Knight and Michael Kalesniko pack as much stuffing as possible into this rubbery squid of a film -- and then jam in yet more and the movie gets duller and less focused as it wears on. Jones has a sous-chef love interest (Sienna Miller charming in her no-fuss bobbed blond hair) and a sultry ex (Alicia Vikander who graces just a scene or two with her Mona Lisa smile). Uma Thurman shows up as a tough-ass lesbian restaurant critic When she takes a bite of the meal Jones has prepared for her the cartoonish glow of ecstasy that crosses her face wouldnt be out of place in a lo-cal-pudding commercial aimed at beleaguered housewives. Have I mentioned that Tony also happens to be in love with Jones? In one scene hes given the opportunity to gaze with lovesick longing at this asshole chefs shirtless form though the movie treats his feelings as a tossed-off joke.But wait theres more Omar Sy plays a struggling chef bent on avenging a past wrong Matthew Rhys is a rival chef who cuts Jones down every chance he gets and Emma Thompson is a well-heeled psychiatrist sporting an unflattering assortment of tent dresses and brogues. A kid gets into the act too Millers single mom has an adorable moppet of a daughter one who appears to have emerged from the womb with the sophisticated palate of a 50-year-old Le Meurice habitue. (She is pretty cute and shes played by Lexi Benbow-Hart.)What figurative sauce seasoning condiment or rare truffle oil doesnt find its way into Burnt? English chef Marcus Wareing and New York fixture Mario Batali served as consultants on the film and though I cant really say if its a realistic depiction of behind-the-scenes restaurant action the actual cooking looks rather convincing. Theres lots of shouting and chaos and shaking of pans though the picture isnt as food-porny as you might expect Wells gives us quick close-ups of prawns being bathed in butter and chunks of meat sizzling away but never time enough to ogle any of this rather ravishingly styled food.We are expected of course to ogle Coopers Jones looking surly and scruffy and bedroom-ready even when -- maybe especially when -- hes toiling in the kitchen. His arrogance is presented as swoon-worthy swagger. He doesnt really sweat; he merely gets dewy. But when hes finally humbled -- as all alpha antiheroes inevitably must be -- hes actually less appealing than when he was a full-on jerk. Overcharred on the outside and soggy in the middle Burnt just cant get it right. Back to the kitchen with it.Burnt Directed by John Wells The Weinstein Company Opens October 30 Directed by John Wells. Written by Steven Knight and Michael Kalesniko.

Wandering through each scene with a steely-eyed gaze and unkempt facial hair Cooper is like the Guy Fieri recipe for Anthony Bourdain an enticing surface with no substance much like the movie itself. While technically directed by John Wells ""Burnt"" has little cinematic identity beyond the occasional luscious images of food that grace the screen in hunger-inducing close-ups. To that end the real star of the show may be cinematographer Adriano Goldman though in an era of ubiquitous reality cooking shows that feat alone can hardly carry a feature-length narrative. And the one that ""Burnt"" offers up runs thin early on. When Adam Jones (Cooper) resurfaces on the London scene with intentions of launching a new restaurant hes got a lot of burnt bridges worth patching up. At first he gains some momentum thanks to his formerly prestigious reputation (""Hes like the Mick Jagger of the cooking world"" explains one adoring fan) and manages to set up shop while rankling his local competition at an upscale eatery run by the pouty Reece (Matthew Rhys). They exchange terse and vulgar words about Adams ambition as the stage is set for a showdown. But ""Burnt"" never gets there instead drifting through a series of set-ups that fail to reach any satisfactory outcome. With longtime managerial partner Tony (Daniel Bruhl) in tow Adam builds a close-knit team of talented chefs repairing a relationship with one former colleague (Omar Sy) and building a new one with a hardworking single mother (Sienna Miller) he plucks from a kitchen across town. The ensuing odyssey finds Adam barking orders at his kitchen staff Gordon Ramsay-style ultimately alienating everyone after his opening night turns sour. In the meantime he dodges the advances of drug dealers to whom he owes a debt. This cycle of ambition failure and fuck ups continues a few times throughout the movie until it basically fizzles in a stew of half-baked ideas. Having gone through a few title changes frantic re-edits and last-minute release date shifts ""Burnt"" also bears the mark of too many cooks in the kitchen. Theres little in the way of cohesion to the screenplay -- by the prolific Steven Knight no less who might be better off developing his directorial career (his captivating 2014 feature ""Locke"" set within the confines of a car makes you wonder if ""Burnt"" might have worked better set within the confines of a kitchen). Strangely the movie dwells more on Adams burly mannerisms than his actual cooking which makes it hard to invest in his struggles. Goldmans swirling camera does a capable job of capturing the chaos of the kitchen but the food rarely gets its due. Dishes of scrumptious pasta fish and various sauces look divine but they never receive enough of a showcase to provide insight into Adams bonafide skill. The best gag that ""Burnt"" offers up involves Adams recurring disgust over the use of ""food condoms"" to contain the flavor of his dishes but he barely explains his own approach. Taking that skill for granted ""Burnt"" shortchanges its most intriguing ingredient the possibility that in spite of his hard-partying antics Adam harbors world-class abilities. ""Burnt"" takes their existence for granted. That shortcoming is additionally hampered by the underdeveloped world surrounding him. ""Burnt"" veers from random cameos by Uma Thurman and Alicia Vikander as women that Adam bedded to one-note characters designed to support Adams mission. Bruhls one-note helping hand who harbors a longtime crush on Adam and fights to keep him stable borders on homophobic parody; while Sy does his part to deepen his part the story wastes him on a cheap plot twist. As Adams eventual love interest Miller stands out -- though theres something dispiriting about the way she simply melts into our heros arms like butter in a sizzling pan. These two actors do their best to generate legitimate romantic chemistry with underwhelming material but ""Burnt"" gives them little to chew on aside from the usual scraps of undercooked material (and plenty of excuses for bad puns). Veering from one underwhelming conflict to the next the bland nature of the drama speaks to the diminishing returns of Wells film career. Together with ""The Company Men"" and ""August Osage County"" the new movie suggests this once-thriving television producer remains tethered to his roots. Rather than baking the movie in an engaging atmosphere or developing any real intrigue he piles up one subplot after another in search of any ingredient that might stick. Worst of all ""Burnt"" treads on far too familiar territory. Jon Favreaus 2014 comedy ""Chef"" in which he played a disgraced cook forced to start his career from scratch was a cheekily amusing portrait of the risk and bravado afflicting the competitive food business. In ""Burnt"" Cooper plays another formerly popular culinary maven recovering from his fall from grace but trades the cheekiness of Favreaus movie for self-serious prattle about Adams mounting midlife crisis. No matter how zany his exploits -- crashing with one of his young chefs taking blows from thugs in dark alleys -- ""Burnt"" never has fun with its scenario. Suffering through the mashup of delicious visuals and lame narrative viewers may find themselves hankering for Michael Winterbottoms ""The Trip"" a delightful two-hander featuring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon that nimbly shifts between food porn the characters goofy impersonations that they offer up during meals and their genuine personal hangups. Of course ""Burnt"" focuses more on the cooks than their clients but that material has also received better scrutiny elsewhere. Mario Batali served as a consultant here but he actually cameos in ""Bitter Feast"" Joe Maggios 2010 satire that transforms the extreme pettiness of the restaurant business into a wonderfully deranged black comedy. Above all the high water mark of passionate cooking movies is ""Ratatouille"" which illustrates the magical qualities of culinary experimentation for those obsessed with perfecting the process. By contrast ""Burnt"" deals less with the food itself than the way it drives Adam to the brink of insanity. Yet it falls short of generating any real urgency surrounding that situation. Adams search for success is particularly irksome in the context of a movie riddled by the same lost cause. Grade C- ""Burnt"" opens nationwide on November 30.

TWITTER Bradley Cooper stars as a bad-boy chef out for redemption (and a third Michelin star) in John Wells drama. Burnt may be about haute cuisine but the movie is fast food all the way. Culinary metaphors aside John Wells entry in the feel-good foodie film subgenre is neither as cloying as last years The Hundred-Foot Journey (featuring Helen Mirren in full French drag) nor as scruffily likeable as Jon Favreaus Chef. Glib sloppy and shamelessly cliched its a middling vehicle for its charismatic leading man Bradley Cooper who sweats and swears up a storm as a disgraced chef orchestrating a comeback. Cooper can do this kind of arrogant-but-irresistible golden boy shtick in his sleep but that doesnt make it any less pleasurable to watch. Flashing his baby blues and a fiery temper the actor gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes us want to forgive the movies laziness. Almost. Burnt opens with Adam Jones (Cooper) moving from New Orleans to London where he plots his return to the world of big white plates and tiny artfully assembled piles of food. Once a revered two-Michelin-starred chef in Paris Jones suffered a spectacular drug- and alcohol-fueled fall from grace. Now hes back on the old continent and on the hunt for a new kitchen in which to pursue that elusive third star. Complicating his quest is the fact that well hes kind of an asshole. Via some clunky expository dialogue Burnt fills us in on Adams past sins which include planting rats in his friend/rival Michels restaurant and then calling the health department. Thanks to our protagonists powers of persuasion -- who could resist that million-dollar smile? -- Michel (Omar Sy) forgives Adam and agrees to work for him when he lands a gig as head chef at a fancy joint run by another old frenemy Tony (a fine Daniel Bruhl). Also recruited to toil under Adam in his new kitchen is talented sous chef Helene (Sienna Miller). Burnt gives Helene multiple ear piercings and a hipsterish undercut to you know signify her spunk and independent spirit; the movie also makes her a single mom so that shes a viable love interest for Adam. Miller is terrific -- unfussy charming all coiled energy in the cooking scenes -- and its nice to hear her native accent after her back-to-back Middle American wives in Foxcatcher and American Sniper (in which she costarred with Cooper). She and Cooper spark off one another nicely here their combativeness carrying a charge of hostility more compelling than the coy romantic tension studio movies usually feed us when two attractive performers share the screen. Read more Bradley Cooper in Talks to Voice A Dogs Purpose Alas Burnt being a pure Hollywood product Helene is destined to fall for Adam -- again that million-dollar smile -- and soon enough her spiky resistance to his bullying has transformed into essentially uncomplicated affection and attraction. At least shes allowed a bit of lucidity; ""Its a stupid idea"" Helene whispers as they lean in for their first kiss and you may feel like shouting your agreement. Helene isnt the only one whose distaste for Adam gives way to ardent devotion. The screenplay by Steven Knight (who also penned The Hundred-Foot Journey) indeed settles into a tiresome pattern of people telling Adam off and then marveling at his genius a few scenes later. We get it -- hes at once loved and loathed the Steve Jobs of the culinary world. But Knight is no Aaron Sorkin and while there are a handful of clever lines (of a rivals sterile-looking restaurant Adam says ""Its the perfect place to stone an infidel"") there are also a surfeit of platitudinous groaners (""The kitchen is the only place Ive ever felt I belonged"" Adam confides to Helene who counsels ""You cant do it alone -- no one can."") Unsurprisingly Burnt is most alive in the workplace where Wells -- aided by DP Adriano Goldman and a number of trained chefs cast as extras -- capably conjures the chaos pressure noise and heat of a world-class kitchen. Marcus Wareing and Mario Batali are listed as ""consultants"" and Cooper and Miller look credible chopping tasting and stirring with athletic intensity. But at this point feverish montages showing dainty slabs of pink lamb and alabaster turbot being drizzled with sauce sprinkled with spice or poked for firmness are nothing new; it would have been nice to see someone in Burnt preparing something for more than five seconds at a time. Read more John Wells TV Land Prepping Comedy Based on Life of Real Housewives Star Kyle Richards The movies climax comes when Adam and his staff scramble to send out two perfect dishes to a pair of diners they believe are Michelin judges. The scene is inevitably tense as Cooper hovers over the plates like a nervous parent tending to a newborn. Whats missing though is a sense of genuine connection between chef and food. Theres nothing approaching the fetishistic reverence with which the brothers played by Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub greet the timpano in Big Night (a film Burnt cribs from in one scene) or the fiercely contained emotion that the titular French cook in Babettes Feast pours into her multi-course extravaganza to cite two examples. Of course food culture has changed since those movies came out. But beyond Adams exacting standards and barely explained contempt for the latest poaching techniques we never grasp his identity as a chef let alone what makes him the visionary everyone keeps going on about. Wells is a competent if not very imaginative craftsman though his work here feels choppier and more strenuously spliced together than in his previous big-screen directorial efforts (2010s The Company Men and 2013s August Osage County). Blink and youll miss Uma Thurman as a snooty restaurant critic and a poorly served Alicia Vikander has only a few disposable scenes as Adams ex. Meanwhile following her thankless role in A Walk in the Woods Emma Thompson appears as another concerned woman catering to a difficult man; she plays Adams doctor. Rob Simonsens score is restrained and while the arc of Adams redemption tale is yawningly familiar the film doesnt pluck too insistently at your heartstrings. But thats damning with faint praise. Burnt isnt burnt; on the contrary its -- forgive me -- half-baked.

During the worst of his many plate-smashing temper tantrums Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) self-styled bad boy of the London culinary world scolds his fellow chefs for not meeting his brutally exacting standards ""If its not perfect you throw it away"" Applying that logic we would have to dispense entirely with ""Burnt"" a moody-foodie therapy session that follows an increasingly tidy narrative recipe as it sets this one-man kitchen nightmare on a long road to redemption. Although John Wells dramedy is energized by its mouth-watering montages and an unsurprisingly fierce lead turn from Cooper Steven Knights script pours on the acid but holds the depth forcing its fine actors (including Sienna Miller and Daniel Bruhl) to function less as an ensemble than as a motley sort of intervention group. Unlikely to capitalize on its once-rumored awards prospects or match ""Chefs"" indie-breakout status the Weinstein Co.s Oct. 30 release might still stir up a favorable arthouse and VOD response. Even as hes begun directing his own scripts (""Locke"" ""Redemption"") Knight remains one of the busiest screenwriters on either side of the Pond and here working from a story by Michael Kalesniko (""Iron Sky"") he brings a brisk professionalism to his latest movie about a mans quest for three Michelin stars (following last years ""The Hundred-Foot Journey""). Still theres something a bit too slick and breezy about the way were introduced to Adam an American expat who became one of the worlds greatest chefs by toiling in one of Paris greatest kitchens and is now one of cinemas greatest a-holes seeking to redeem himself and his career after the skirt-chasing substance-abusing meltdown that led to the restaurants permanent closure. Years after that spectacular flameout Adam has dried out and done his penance in a New Orleans oyster bar though he still acts like a guy who doesnt give a shuck as he swaggers into London determined to take the citys restaurant scene by storm. But first hell need the help of his trusty old maitre d Tony (Bruhl) who reluctantly hands over his present fine-dining establishment to Adam though their rocky past still looms over them. Tony is hardly unique in that respect. As he builds up his kitchen dream team Adam keeps running into old friends and enemies who make annoyingly cryptic references to ""what happened in Paris"" without ever spelling out exactly what happened in Paris. The returning old-timers include Michel (Omar Sy ""The Intouchables"") a sous chef whos willing to let bygones be bygones if he can get in on Adams new venture and Italian ex-con Max (Riccardo Scamarcio) whose ill-tempered perfectionism rivals the bosss own. Also on hand is an old nemesis Reece (Matthew Rhys) who now has his own comfortable three-star perch though hes aware that its only a matter of time before the more talented Adam returns to the top (assuming he can get out of his own way). Adam taps a few new recruits as well including David (Sam Keeley) a nervous but talented up-and-comer and Helene (Miller) a strong-willed chef de partie who gets a Gordon Ramsay-worthy tirade from Adam on the night of the restaurants not-so-grand reopening. Naturally its only a matter of time before they kiss and make up and soon their colleagues are placing bets on how long it will take Adam to bed his one and only female hire. If that quasi-romantic thread and the tough-customer kitchen dynamics seem to nod in the direction of ""Ratatouille"" -- theres even an all-powerful restaurant critic (played by Uma Thurman in a two-scene cameo) though shes mainly on hand to set the plot in motion -- the comparisons end there. Far from being a glorious portrait of the artist as a young cook ""Burnt"" devolves into an angst-ridden melodrama of relapse and recovery where no amount of gastronomical window dressing can disguise the familiar spectacle of one very gifted man behaving very badly. Not that theres anything wrong with gastronomical window dressing and what we see here is certainly choice a casual breakfast of tea-smoked mackerel and bouillabaisse a childs birthday cake dappled with pink rosettes an unidentifiable green amuse-bouche that has ""too much tarragon"" and looks no less slurpable for it. (Celebrity chefs Marcus Wareing and Mario Batali served as consultants on the film.) Wells a longtime TV director who proved himself an able big-screen craftsman on ""The Company Men"" and ""August Osage County"" captures the culinary milieu as well as its underlying energy The dishes are shot in tantalizing closeups by d.p. Adriano Goldman and spliced into fluid delectable sequences by editor Nick Moore whose cutting mimics the swift furious movements of an expertly wielded blade. Knights script too supplies sharp glancing insights into this ultra-competitive environment and the killer instinct it takes to succeed even turning the Michelin quest into a sort of heist caper that continually places Adam and his team (which he models on the warriors from ""Seven Samurai"") on high alert. The pressure takes a toll on Helene who finds herself spending less time with her young daughter (Lexi Benbow-Hart). It also weighs on Adam who yearns to turn a decent meal into something truly memorable even mind-blowing at a time when sous vide machines are all the rage and his venerable tradition of cooking seems increasingly a thing of the past. Unfortunately ""Burnt"" never rises to the level of its characters ambition and with the exception of one smart unpredictable twist the story increasingly bogs down in perfunctory subplots including a brief run-in with a mysterious ex-lover (a lovely fleeting Alicia Vikander) and the thugs who routinely turn up to shake Adam down for drug money. The script treats even the more essential characters not as individuals so much as well ingredients -- perhaps none more insultingly than Bruhls Tony whose longtime unrequited crush on Adam is resolved with a cheap punchline. All the supporting players in the end are forced to serve a basically therapeutic purpose trying to show Adam that his extreme perfectionism is destroying his capacity for functional human relationships -- which makes even the never-unwelcome Emma Thompson seem pretty redundant in the role of an actual therapist. Cooper who has played mentally distressed characters with virtuoso intensity (""Silver Linings Playbook"") as well as tactful restraint (""American Sniper"") combines a deft vigorous physicality in the kitchen with a tightly wound verbal dexterity He knows exactly how to sell an acerbic one-liner like ""Apologize to the turbot because it died in vain"" but also a dreamy sentiment like ""I want to make food that makes people stop eating."" You believe him and much of the frantic human activity swirling around him without ever quite believing the movie that Wells and Knight have cooked up.

Cordell auto says March 31 2016 at 244 am Just WOW Reply Victoria says December 7 2015 at 257 pm Just saw it today. Cooper was AWFUL. Superficial no emotional depth. Reply Roger Stambaugh says November 3 2015 at 909 pm Loved the film. Critics opinions aside (I have been in that kitchen doing that) this is as an a authentic film about modern cuisine competition as I have every seen. Great casting even better acting. This will be a classic under ground in the culinary world. Dr Roger Stambaugh Reply Bobbi says October 21 2015 at 823 pm Unfortunately Jamie Dornans ""backstory"" appearance was cut from Burnt. It happens often when someones part no matter who they are isnt significant to the overall outcome of a movie. I get that however; him not being on screen gives me cause to pass on seeing Burnt. Im not into any movie show or series that features food -cooking baking BBQing just isnt entertaining to me. I love Bradley but Jamie and Bradley together on screen wouldve been killer...Im thinking theres probably 100 million Jamie fans world wide that agree. We wait WAY too long between performances and it wouldve been nice to get a little Jamie fix Reply Marie says October 22 2015 at 152 am Calm down its not that serious. Reply Bobbi says October 22 2015 at 744 am Youre correct Marie that was my point... LauraABarron says October 21 2015 at 630 pm ""`See Here Now...my friends step-aunt makes 65 /hour on the laptop "".. She has been out of a job for six months but last month her payment was 18767 just working on the laptop for a few hours. check out the post right here> Go~To~This~Page Reply cadavra says October 21 2015 at 519 pm And of course Cooper previously played a tight-assed chef in the sadly short-lived Fox series ""Kitchen Confidential."" Though this plot also bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Le Chef"" the Jean Reno comedy of last year. Hmmm... Reply mikechinea says October 21 2015 at 1151 am I liked the movie. While I was drooling over the food for the first 10 minutes of the movie my wife was drooling over Bradley for all the movie. A great look at what happens behind the scenes in the high end culinary world. Not one bad performance the A-List brought their A game. Thats my opinion and your mileage may vary.

In the last few years hes given us the glorious Tom-Hardy-in-a-car drama ""Locke"" not to mention the fiendishly entertaining ""Peaky Blinders"" but put Knight behind a stove and you get ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" and now ""Burnt."" Both movies deal with the obsessive pursuit of a Michelin star rating and both are the kind of foodie fables that get so precious that you want to spend the rest of your life eating take-out. (""Burnt"" has a speech devoted to how Burger King is the contemporary equivalent of the much-adored French peasant cuisine but its just there so the movie can sprinkle little blue flowers all over its entrees without being accused of classism.) See Video Bradley Cooper Cooks Up Culinary Orgasms in New Burnt Trailer What we get here is ""White Jerk Gets a Second Chance"" but since the jerk in question is played by Bradley Cooper and since his culinary creations have been lovingly prepared for the camera by Mario Batali and Marcus Wareing were clearly meant to be charmed. Neither Cooper Knight nor director John Wells (""August Osage County"") unfortunately has figured out how to make this rock star chef protagonist anything but insufferable. In a movie about redemption we shouldnt be rooting for the evil French drug dealers owed money by the hero to break his cream-whipping wrist. Adam Jones (Cooper) was the toast of Paris until too many substances and too many burnt bridges destroyed his promising career as a restaurateur. After doing penance -- shucking one million oysters at a New Orleans dive -- he heads to London to revive his career. Seemingly all of his old Paris cohorts are there including maitre d Tony (Daniel Bruhl) whos nursed a long-standing crush on Adam; sous chef Michel (Omar Sy) who seems ready to give the chef a second chance despite having been done wrong by him; and frenemy Reece (Matthew Rhys) now the citys hottest chef since Adams absence from the scene. Also Read Sienna Miller Poses Topless Admits I Burnt a Lot of Bridges Pulling together a crew of both familiar faces and new ones including pasta whiz Helene (Sienna Miller) Adam sets about creating a namesake restaurant that will win him the coveted third Michelin star. Ghosts from the past -- namely those drug dealers along with Anne Marie (a little-utilized Alicia Vikander) Adams ex and the daughter of his one-time mentor -- keep popping up and his backers insist that Adam get a weekly drug test from psychiatrist Dr. Rosshilde (Emma Thompson) whos just dying to get this brash young chef to open up to her about whats really bugging him. That doctors first appearance telegraphs Adams eventual emotional unburdening and Knights screenplay comes loaded with characters and lines of dialogue that are either fraught with clumsy exposition (""When I was your sous chef ..."") obvious foreshadowing or outright emotional billboarding. (Adam actually utters the line ""A kitchens the only place I ever felt I really belonged."") One might think that having played a similar chef-on-the-mend in the TV series ""Kitchen Confidential"" would put Cooper on familiar ground here but while the actor nails the prickly-diva-in-an-apron scenes (he screams at his staff like a drill sergeant) hes less successful at bringing this touchy pain in the rump around to being a balanced human being. When Helene falls for him we question why shes attracted to someone so volatile and obnoxious to say nothing of the fact that hes also her boss. See Video Bradley Cooper Defends Jennifer Lawrences Attack on Hollywoods Gender Pay Gap Since almost everyone else in the movie lets Adam run roughshod over them thats somehow supposed to make us find him irresistible as well but when he says things like ""I want to make food that makes people stop eating"" he comes off like one of those gourmet bloggers who cant go a full paragraph without using the word ""reduction."" The restaurants feel alive and bustling -- Reeces is hilariously but believably minimalist -- but ""Burnt"" ultimately feels like those sous-vide bags that Adam finds so worthy of mockery trapped in plastic with the air sucked out of it.
