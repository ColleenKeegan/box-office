Russell holiday dramedy and the sales pitch is getting creaky Tis the season for an overcooked Oscar-bait family dramedy from the ""American Hustle""/""Silver Linings"" trio Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics American Hustle aol_on Bradley Cooper David O. Russell isabella rossellini Jennifer Lawrence Movie Awards Season Movies Oscars Robert De Niro Silver Linings Playbook The Fighter Entertainment News Heres the problem with the whole David O. Russell-Jennifer Lawrence-Bradley Cooper entertainment package Theres really no problem. I mean there is and there isnt. But even if you find their new movie ""Joy"" a major disappointment as I do and even if you think it exposes a hint of bogosity that has been there all along you have to face the facts. Russell is an immensely gifted filmmaker who has resurrected his career in a highly unusual manner reinventing himself as an A-list director of Oscar-bait prestige pictures after many years in the indie doghouse. He has developed a terrific rapport with two of the most charismatic movie stars of the moment who are also fine actors and have great chemistry together. So what the hell problem could I be talking about?Russells previous two films with Cooper and Lawrence ""American Hustle"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" were lovingly crafted hits loaded with charm and style. They featured memorable production design and cinematography along with a colorful cast of characters pushed right to the edge of caricature but not over it. They were aimed at holiday-season adult and family audiences they mixed comedy and drama and delivered happy endings without condescension and they attracted scads of award nominations including Lawrences best-actress Oscar (for ""Silver Linings Playbook"") in 2013. Again no visible problem. Or not really.But here comes ""Joy"" and Im afraid the game is up. This is the third film in the Russell-Lawrence-Cooper cycle of whimsical American morality fables and by far the least of the three. (You cant quite count ""The Fighter"" Russells 2010 comeback vehicle because Cooper and Lawrence arent in it and it wasnt a big hit. Its more like the preface to the trilogy and in retrospect it looks more and more like Russells best film.) ""Joy"" is certainly not a terrible movie by Hollywood standards and lots of viewers will enjoy it just fine. It starts out with much the same zany freewheeling energy found in ""Silver Linings"" and ""American Hustle"" -- its almost like a mashup of those movies -- before collapsing in the oven like a failed souffle. While the classic three-act structure of mainstream film often produces the symptoms of Perfunctory Ending Disorder or PED in this case the effects are devastating and the patient does not survive.Its probably fair to say that Russells artistic self-reinvention has involved considerable strategy and calculation and theres no shame in that for Gods sake. Beginning with ""The Fighter"" and even more so with ""Silver Linings"" he has deliberately avoided pushing his stories beyond certain parameters into ambitious or confrontational territory. You get the feeling he believes he has worked out the precise dimensions of the mainstream audiences comfort zone. The problem -- again if there even is one -- lies in the fact that the level of calculation in those movies was just slightly too close to the surface and that each was an assemblage of super-fun ingredients that added up to somewhat less than the sum of their parts.For fans of ""American Hustle"" including a whole bunch of movie critics it was pretty close to a contemporary classic an old-time Hollywood caper film based on a real-life 70s political scandal and delivered with the verve of mid-period Martin Scorsese. Its always a mistake to give Oscar voters credit for artistic insight but why did that film get 10 nominations from the Academy and win exactly nothing which is a highly unusual outcome? To some extent the answer lies in its pretty-close-ness in the way it imitated a bunch of other things without synthesizing them or the way it simulated a great movie without quite being one. Im reaching for a quality here that may have a name in German but doesnt in English -- NotQuiteAsGoodAsItShouldBe-ness or InfinitesimalTouchOfPhoniness -- in order to throw subtle shade on a highly successful filmmaker and his unusual career narrative. Critics You Might Also Like Anyway ""Joy."" This movie has different roots from the previous two entries but recognizably takes place in the same universe. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was adapted from a bestselling novel and ""American Hustle"" was an original screenplay drawing on historical events. This one is the fictionalized story of Joy Mangano a single mom from Long Island who invented a self-squeezing mop -- a work of genius quite honestly -- and who rose from near-poverty to become a QVC superstar and the head of a marketing and merchandising empire. Russell wrote the screenplay based on an original story co-written with Annie Mumolo. (He transplants the Mangano family from the Island to suburban Boston a favored Russell locale.)So heres Jennifer Lawrence as a scrappy working-class woman from a massively screwed-up family who reinvents herself and repeatedly risks disaster and wont settle for less than total victory. And heres Bradley Cooper as a charming but slightly sleazy dude with bad hair and an ingenious plan. (One of the movies issues inescapably is that Coopers TV executive is essentially a minor supporting character not a romantic lead.) Over here we have Robert De Niro playing a feckless failed father who possesses a deeply unwarranted self-confidence and is way too eager to offer his loudmouth delusional opinions. Stop me if any of this sounds familiar will you? OK you stopped me. From a narrative and cinematic point of view the problem with ""Joy"" is simple. Russell is almost totally uninterested in the story of how Joy Mangano explored a bizarre and unknown new business model and became its first self-made tycoon and as a result we arent interested either. He wants to tell a David O. Russell story about how Joys deadbeat dad (De Niro) and her would-be lounge singer ex-husband (the terrific Edgar Ramirez) wound up as odd-couple roommates in her basement. And then about Dads romance with a rich Italian widow (Isabella Rossellini) and the vastly more improbable love affair that finally pulls Joys massively depressed and anxious mother (Virginia Madsen) out of her TV-watching agoraphobic stupor.All that stuff is terrific hilarious and pathetic and keenly observed but never flat-out cruel. Of course were delighted to watch Lawrence do her plucky-outsider bit as long as she wants to. Whatever you want to call her strange star quality its irresistible. She stands there looking worried and launching wisecracks for like five seconds and were all in. Russell coasts on the coattails of Lawrences appeal here in a way he never has before riding the crazy-family story as long as he can and then ditching it in a blurry boring fast-forward toward a supposedly happy ending that feels more like an ellipsis. The problem with the Russell-Lawrence-Cooper entertainment package is that the packaging has become more important than the contents. And that considering the talent level involved the ""entertainment"" feels a little cheaply bought. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

If anything shes so poised that its hard to believe this is the Oscar winners first non-Hunger Games leading role in five years. (Truth. Think about it.)And if Katniss Everdeen was the one who launched arrows in order to achieve personal freedom the inspirational and dynamic Joy was the one who did all the heavy lifting.The literal rags-to-riches story is loosely based on real-life entrepreneur Joy Mangano the mega-successful inventor of everything from the Miracle Mop to those godsend velvet stackable hangers. (Her last name is never uttered in the movie. Weird.) Celebrity Hunks Cry Movies That Make Them Sad Spoiler She had to work her way to the top. The blue-collar daughter of a self-involved soap-opera addict (Virginia Madsen) and a vaguely chauvinistic garage-shop owner (Robert De Niro) she spent her youth in the suburbs of New Yorks Long Island creating products in her room while her parents bickered. In one foreshadow-y scene -- which is manipulative yet effective -- she implores her best friend that she doesnt need a boy to make her dreams come true. By the mid-90s shes already been married to a lounge singer (Edgar Ramirez) had two kids and divorced. She houses her entire immediate family (ex included) and uses her income working at an airport to keep them afloat. Utterly exhausted Joy falls asleep on the stairs. But one day she cuts her hands maneuvering an old-fashioned mop to clean up broken glass. Immediately the light bulb goes off in her head With her daughters crayons she sketches out a unique mop -- one that self-wrings and features hundreds of thick consecutive loops. Yes that just might work. But designing it is the easy part. Jennifer Lawrences 10 Best Hunger Games Premiere Looks of All Time Two years after Lawrence appeared in David O. Russells American Hustle she gets to show some. Fiercely determined she asks her dads new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) for a loan so she can find a distributor to make the products. Then she figures out how to wow the new honcho (Bradley Cooper) of a fledging home shopping network called QVC. As she demonstrates the wondrous mop the laughter in the room doesnt deter her. Nor does Coopers reticence. Her true grit alone makes this film required viewing for all aspiring businesswomen. In case you havent been counting this is the fourth Lawrence/Cooper collaboration -- and their onscreen chemistry continues to evolve to interesting new directions. No surprise their scenes which primarily take place on the chaotic set of the network electrify. You want some hyper-surrealism along with your biopic? Try Cooper schooling Lawrence on the history of QVC and how to launch a product (use your hands) on TV. And look Theres Queen of QVC Joan Rivers played by her daughter Melissa Rivers advising Lawrence to go on-air in a skirt so she can show off her nice long legs. This is where Russells stylish directing flourishes. 5 Last-Minute Ugly Christmas Sweaters To Wear for the Holidays Alas he sells Joys journey a bit short. In the directors recent triple whammy of The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle he illustrated a wonderful knack for melding glossy filmmaking with spitfire dialogue. Nobody can write a family feud like him. He cant overcome the slapdash storytelling here. Joys extreme highs and lows fly by in a topsy-turvy whiplash-inducing whirl First shes a QVC phenom. Then her wicked half-sister (Elizabeth Rohm) sells her out. Then shes arrested. Then she makes mafia-style deals. Then she lives in a mansion wearing expensive jewelry. The rushed rhythm leaves you feeling slightly unfulfilled -- and somewhat distrustful about whats unfolding on screen. As ORussell cuts some narrative corners who knows whats fact or fiction or a sly combination of both. (The disastrous first QVC presentation of the Miracle Mop for example results in exactly zero sells. Come on.) We want to linger on Joys journey and feel every moment of triumph with her. No need for a deceased character to narrate and summarize from beyond the grave.Maybe its telling that for all the films en-joy-able moments you get the sense the heroine could single-handedly fix all the problems herself.

"Joy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; joy ) Joy (United States 2015) December 25 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Director David O. Russell doesnt believe in resting on his laurels. Despite bringing back cast members Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro Joy isnt an attempt to remake Silver Linings Playbook. In fact the two films arent close. Joy is as different from Silver Linings as it is from last years American Hustle. Its tough to find a recent analog for this movie - the story of a committed passionate inventor who endures personal and financial hardship on the road to making and marketing her device. The story is quirky and offbeat but the dialogue and acting set Joy up as an engaging late-year repast. Joy is another in this years large crop of ""based on a true story"" films. The subject is Joy Mangano (Lawrence) the Long Island-based entrepreneur who designed and self-manufactured the self-wringing Miracle Mop in the early 1990s. Despite skepticism from her father Rudy (Robert DeNiro) and sister Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm) Joy raises enough money to make 100 mops which she sells locally. When her friend and ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) secures her an interview with QVC executive Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) shes given an opportunity to sell the Miracle Mop on TV. Although initial sales are poor Joy persuades Neil to allow her to replace the ""professional"" presenter; her appearance is a success. The mop sells more than 18000 units and Joy appears to be on her way. But questions about ownership threaten to derail everything and throw Joy into bankruptcy. Joy can be viewed as a modern day rags-to-riches fairytale. Its Cinderella without the prince. In a way thats part of the films charm. Imagine a story about a self-sufficient woman who doesnt need a man as a savior or for fulfillment. Whats more theres not a whiff of romance to be found. With three young children and a housebound mother (Virginia Madsen) to care for and the demands of the Miracle Mop Joy doesnt have the time for dalliances. This therefore becomes Russells first film in which sex is a non-issue. Its quite a departure for a man who began his career with the tantalizingly titled Spanking the Monkey. Although Joy isnt all about process - it balances the creation of the Miracle Mop with the personal life of its creator - it works best when providing viewers a peek behind the curtain. Perhaps the most fascinating scenes are those at QVC where we see what goes on behind the camera. (Melissa Rivers provides an eerie portrayal of her late mother a frequent QVC on-air celebrity spokesperson during this pre-Internet era.) Things like funding models intellectual property squabbles and production delays might not sound like fertile material for a movie but the breezy quasi-comedic screenplay livens them up. Joy is David vs. Goliath with the underdog overcoming. For a film script this isnt that unusual. What makes it different is that David is an inventor. More than that David is a she. How many movies have been about female inventors?  This is as much a reflection of Hollywoods male-oriented culture as it is the limited number of women in the science amp; engineering fields. There are a lot more real life Joys than there are motion picture Joys. Jennifer Lawrence could be in line for another Oscar nomination although Joys limited availability to critics and Academy members could be a culprit if shes passed over. Her performance is workmanlike. She captures Joys spirit and determination and successfully navigates Russells minefield of entwined comedy and drama but Joy lacks the kind of big showy scene that Oscar voters love. Shes consistent and credible which is all a viewer needs. Bradley Cooper doesnt have much screen time and although he and Lawrence evidence an easygoing chemistry theres nothing romantic about their interaction.  Robert DeNiro plays perhaps the most annoyingly oblivious character he has ever attempted. Hollywood veterans Isabella Rosellini and Diane Ladd have roles as Rudys girlfriend and Joys grandmother respectively. And Russell has some fun by casting a few real-life soap opera stars (Susan Lucci Maurice Benard Laura Wright) in a fake soap opera watched by many of the films characters. Joy isnt likely to win Russell the same degree of critical acclaim he received for either Silver Linings Playbook or American Hustle. Its a more sedate less stylish production. Also since the subject matter is abstruse box office expectations should perhaps be tempered. Nevertheless in part because the movie is so different from most of what comes out of Hollywood I found Joy to be a refreshing change-of-pace. Its well acted the central character is effectively defined and portrayed and it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Joy (United States 2015) Director David O.

Russell serves notice that there have always been multi-generational stories of strong women who figure out how to make their way in a so-called mans world -- on television soap operas. He even helpfully opens this (based-on-a-true) story of one womans (Jennifer Lawrence) struggle to become the inventor/CEO of her childhood dreams on the set of the soap that Mama watches instead of you know living a life. Perhaps less helpfully he soaps up the movie itself something fierce with weird results. The battle against a naysaying world is far-fetched overblown and melodramatic but still okay because its basically fun. (Schematics in crayon? A secret passage onto the factory floor? Sure why not?) The intrafamilial stuff however feels like a fever-dream of impersonal intimacies. (Hey lets talk business graveside) By the time Dad (Robert De Niro) starts apologizing for ever helping Joy to believe in herself its clear that the point here isnt people its payoff emotional and otherwise. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 24 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday Dec. 23 2015 123PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by David O. Russell Written by David O. Russell and Annie Mumolo Starring Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Virginia Madsen Bradley Cooper Classification PG Genre biopic Year 2015 Country USA Language English Watching the last five minutes of Joy I finally realized this drama was supposed to be a biopic about some woman who made a gazillion dollars selling stuff on The Shopping Channel. And here I was thinking it was a movie about a mop.And while I could think of instances in which a mop might make quite a good protagonist - perhaps in an animated childrens feature or in an in-depth doc about the tortures of the patent process - this limp and erratic family drama was certainly not one of them. Every time working-class heroine Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) defies another doubter or makes another sale you find yourself saying ""Umm yeah but thats just a mop."" I have no idea what David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook American Hustle) thinks he is doing here but a director has really screwed up when an attentive viewer cant tell a movies subject from its object.Joy is being billed as a movie about a family business dynasty but Russell begins by mocking that family. The hard-working Joy supports a big and unhappy crowd whose most dysfunctional member is her mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) a damaged divorcee who never leaves the bedroom where she watches her soaps. (Sometimes the movie includes melodramatic scenes from the soaps as a joke; this is a bad idea because by comparison Joy is not much better.)Anyway there in the comedy bedroom Madsen is doing quite an amusing job playing the wacky TV addict. (The half star is for her.) As her obnoxious ex-husband Rudy that late-blooming comic Robert De Niro seems all set to join her and in the role of his wealthy girlfriend Isabella Rossellini looks like she too would happily move in and make funny. But then Russell puts on the brakes and swerves across the road in an attempt to make his exit for an inspiring drama about the American dream.If his direction is erratic the script he wrote with Annie Mumolo (Bridesmaids) has gaps you could drive a truck through and dialogue filled with painfully obvious exposition of plot motive and theme. Every time anyone says anything important they repeat it just in case you missed the point. The whole thing is narrated by Joys grandmother except - stop reading now if you think you might actually pay money to see this trainwreck - she dies halfway through so I guess shes narrating from beyond the grave.Meanwhile Lawrence soldiers away making speeches about the land of opportunity and the importance of being able to toss a mop head straight in the wash as though she were Norma Rae and this was a cure for cancer.So eventually Joy gets her mop on TV and begins a belated but meteoric rise to business stardom. (Cue an appearance from Bradley Cooper as the slick exec who gives her a break; he seems uncertain as to whether hes a bad guy or a good guy.)When Joy runs into a bankrupting roadblock Rudy says his mistake was to ever let her think she was more than a bored housewife peddling her wares to other bored housewives. Its a pretty insulting thing to say to an adult daughter who seems to be one of few family members to hold down a job.Maybe the geniuses who produced this thing (a long list that includes Mangano herself) thought they could sell her story to the same ""bored housewives"" who buy her stuff. Perhaps people who make gazillions selling housewares on The Shopping Channel deserve to be honoured; if they do Joy is not a fitting tribute to Mangano - nor to the mop.

Russell (""Silver Linings Playbook"" ""American Hustle"") has set the bar pretty high for himself in recent outings but here he lowers it just a bit telling (with co-writer Annie Mumolo) the semi-true story of Joy Mangano a harried Long Island mother (Jennifer Lawrence) who invents what comes to be known as the Miracle Mop and goes on to huge success.But not without clearing a number of hurdles not the least of which is her own family. Russell delights in messy dysfunctional family dynamics and Joy aside from three kids has to take care of a mother (Virginia Madsen) who lives all day in her bedroom watching soap operas an ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) who lives in the basement her cranky father (Robert De Niro) who also lives in the basement as well as a pushy sister (Elisabeth Rohm).Joy is the glue that holds them together even if the bills are overdue. Then one day she stumbles on the idea for a new kind of mop. Borrowing money from her fathers new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) she actually gets the mop made. The problem is no one wants to sell it. Until she meets Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) an exec at a new home shopping TV network. Problem solved right? Yes and no; problems keep coming.And the steely Joy keeps beating them down. Unlike Russells other recent films this one -- as delicious as the ensemble is -- is full-on focused on one character. Its all about Joy overcoming obstacles on her way to the American Dream and Lawrence imbues her with strength and resolve. The result is joyous indeed.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongJoyGRADE B+Rated PG-13 for brief strong languageRunning time 124 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1YFC2p8 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/25/movie-review-joy-story-woman-mop-dream/77900798/,200,joy6,joy,detroitnews

Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in a scene from Joy. Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox The business of America is business to paraphrase a line delivered by Calvin Coolidge four years before 1929s version of The Big Short. But Hollywood no small industry itself rarely tells the stories of people like Joy Mangano inventor of the Miracle Mop and the inspiration for David O. Russells Joy. The Miracle Mop wasnt as fashionable as the iPhone but it turns out that Joy like the oft-biopic-ed Steve Jobs was part of a media revolution. She became successful by selling her self-cleaning product on QVC the then-new cable shopping channel. Perhaps thats why Russell decided to immortalize her. Then again maybe not. One of the many things Joy never makes clear is exactly what the writer-director finds interesting about his protagonist who isnt identified as Mangano. The movie lurches from event to event and tone to tone without articulating a reason to exist. That Russell actually wants to say something about American commerce is suggested by I Heart Huckabees his largely forgotten 2004 comedy about a Wal-Mart-like retailer. But that movie soon lost interest in its big-box tale and was pulled every which way by a large cast that never became an ensemble. Whats changed for Russell since then? Mostly Jennifer Lawrence the spark plug of the directors American Hustle (even though she had a subsidiary role) and Silver Linings Playbook. As Joy Lawrence is at the center of this story and manages to carry it without much help. But its a role that principally requires stamina and pluck -- more Katniss Everdeen than her daffy Playbook and Hustle characters. The movie opens in a soap-opera universe soon revealed to be the only world thats real to Joys reclusive mother Carrie (Virginia Madsen). Our heroines parents have long been divorced but Carrie and Rudy (Robert De Niro) still agree about one thing Joy should accept her pink-collar status. Only her grandmother (Diane Ladd) and childhood best friend (Dascha Polanco) encourage Joy to pursue her dream of being an inventor. The divorced mom of two small children Joy takes care of everyone -- even her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) a Venezuelan-born would-be lounge singer who still lives in the basement. Hapless womanizer Rudy sometimes bunks there too before he meets a wealthy widow Trudy (Isabella Rossellini). Its Trudy who bankrolls Joys innovative mop although shes not the best possible partner. Neither are small-minded Rudy and Joys jealous half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) whose assistance ranges from useless to actually destructive. But Joy whose theme songs include Creams ""I Feel Free"" and Buffalo Springfields ""Expecting to Fly"" is unsinkable. She makes her way to QVC whose secrets are happily divulged by an executive whos played distractingly by Bradley Cooper Lawrences Playbook and Hustle co-star. Here Russell inserts another weird showbiz aside Melissa Rivers plays her mother Joan once a QVC pitchwoman. Rudy owns a garage where Peggy and Joy both work sometimes but the movies suburban working-class milieu is no more plausible than Carries favorite soap opera -- which curiously seems to be broadcast 24 hours a day. Joys potential entry to the wonderland of QVC-enabled riches might seem empowering if the life she seeks to escape felt authentic. But its no more credible than such absurd sequences as the moment that inspires the breakthrough mop or Joys showdown with a patent swindler. Joy is an odd product -- contrived when it means to be gritty and prosaic when it attempts magical realism. Hollywood may think it can peddle it but QVC probably would have known better.

EntertainmentMovies Struggling through Joy Jennifer Lawrence is miscast in this story that fails to follow through Originally published December 24 2015 at 1000 am Updated December 24 2015 at 1054 am Jennifer Lawrence plays the title character in ""Joy"" loosely based on the woman who invented the Miracle Mop. (Photo credit Courtesy Twentieth/Courtesy Twentieth Century Fox) ""Joy"" Jennifer Lawrence plays a mop mogul in a film that never quite fulfills its promise. 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Filmmaker David O. Russell is in a bit of a rut. ""Joy"" a vaguely fact-based dramedy about the woman who invents the ""self-wringing"" Miracle Mop is his third film in a row to star Jennifer Lawrence (following ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle""). And while the perpetually charming Lawrence isnt the worst habit a filmmaker can develop shes valiantly miscast here in a story that never quite hits its mark. Joy Mangano (Lawrence) is one of those people on whom the world depends Shes the pulled-in-all-directions center of an eccentric family that includes her divorced father (Robert De Niro basically reprising his ""Silver Linings Playbook"" role) soap-opera-obsessed mother (Virginia Madsen) supportive grandmother (Diane Ladd) semi-stepmother (Isabella Rossellini) and ex-husband (edgar Ramirez) who lives in Joys basement and dreams of being the next Tom Jones. (He just might rate his own movie.) Juggling the needs of all of these people plus small children plus a dead-end job has Joy as frayed as the end of her mop. But gazing mopward one day she hits on an idea -- one that just might make enough money to change the lives of all of those she loves. Lawrence as always throws herself into the role like a kid diving into a swimming hole and her wide-open determined vibrancy almost makes you forget that shes too young for it. Her charm almost distracts but not quite from a significant problem in the script The films all lead-up and no follow-through. Which essentially means that poor Joy who we like very much flails and struggles for nearly two hours in that trademark slightly-over-the-top-David-O.-Russell way and when she finally succeeds walking away from a confrontation with an agreeably badass lilt to her step its almost credits time. Were the oddly brief late scenes with an older Joy running her empire trimmed for time? Was it just not believable to present the mid-20s Lawrence as a forty-something mogul? Or did Russell just think it didnt matter? In any case Lawrence is a joy but the movie sadly isnt. Movie Review 1/2   Joy with Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro edgar Ramirez Diane Ladd Virginia Madsen Isabella Rossellini Dascha Polanco Elisabeth Rohm Bradley Cooper.

"Review Joy has too many distractions to mop up - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Joy has too many distractions to mop up Joy has too many distractions to mop up 20th Century Fox Jennifer Lawrence is flanked by Edgar Ramirez left and Robert De Niro in ""Joy."" Jennifer Lawrence is flanked by Edgar Ramirez left and Robert De Niro in ""Joy."" (20th Century Fox) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter What makes writer-director David O. Russells best work films such as ""The Fighter"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"" so thrilling is that each is a high-wire act that runs the moment-to-moment risk of tumbling to the ground. In ""Joy"" his latest Russell has more trouble than usual keeping his balance.Like some of those earlier films ""Joy"" is based albeit loosely on a real story. That would be the life of Joy Mangano an entrepreneur inventor and QVC shopping network star with the mega-selling Miracle Mop and numerous other patented items to her name. And like ""Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"" ""Joy"" stars three actors -- Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro -- who are so on the directors wavelength that theyve formed a de facto David O. Russell Repertory Company.See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt; Joy teaser trailer Watch the trailer for the film ""Joy"" starring Jennifer Lawrence. Watch the trailer for the film ""Joy"" starring Jennifer Lawrence. See more videos Lawrence who plays Joy and appears in almost every scene especially thrives here but even her skill and determination cant stabilize a film that goes off in any number of directions and rarely feels confident about the kind of story it wants to be telling.""Joy"" apparently started life as a very different film a more conventional biopic with a script by Annie Mumolo (who shares story credit with Russell). When the writer-director came on board he broadened the narrative to include among other things ideas brought to mind by other remarkable women hed known leading to ""Joys"" opening declaration that it is ""Inspired by the true stories of daring women. One in particular.""While theres nothing wrong with any of this in theory in practice whats resulted is not as it should be. Despite some quite engaging sections ""Joy"" is unlike previous Russell films dragged down more than it is inspired by its chaotic ambience a film whose variations in tone cant be overcome.If ""Joys"" theme is how much courage and tenacity it took for its heroine to climb out of a toxic personal situation it unfortunately starts off on the wrong foot with uninvolving depictions of her woeful background that last way too long. Except for grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd) Joy is presented as pretty much the only sane person in her extended family the one who holds it together and gets stuff done amid relatives who give new meaning to the word dysfunctional.Joys mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) is addicted to TV soap operas (""All My Children"" mainstay Susan Lucci has a cameo) and fearful of leaving the house while father Rudy proprietor of Rudys Truck amp; Auto Body is a feckless romantic who leaves home too often and soon becomes involved with wealthy widow Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) who likes to begin sentences with a nod to ""my late husband Morris.""As if this werent enough Joys ex-husband and striving musician Tony (Edgar Ramirez) is still living in the basement and half sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) sabotages her sibling every chance she gets. Not only are these characters more tedious than they may sound they monopolize ""Joys"" first 45 minutes.Then Joy who has always enjoyed doing things with her hands has a eureka moment while no surprise cleaning up someone elses mess. She envisions a mop made of 300 feet of continuous cotton loops a mop that you could wring out without it ever touching your hands the last mop beleaguered housewives would ever need. Sounds like ... a miracle. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The creation and manufacture of the Miracle Mop not only revitalizes Joys life it brings welcome life and interest to the film. Things get even better when Joy hears about something new a televised way to sell products and makes a connection with Neil Walker (Cooper) a top executive with the QVC (as in Quality Value Convenience) cable network.Cooper like Lawrence is a past master of bringing energy and pizazz to Russells situation and the vivid heart of ""Joy"" is in the scenes where the two of them jointly discover the Miracle Mops QVC potential (not to mention hanging out with Joan Rivers played by daughter Melissa).But after these high points ""Joy"" does not go from strength to strength; it sinks into a morass of a different kind as its protagonist faces so many irritating obstacles to inevitable success we get as frustrated as she does. Joy the person may be able to surmount all barriers; the film with her name on it is not so fortunate.Twitter KennethTuran------------JoyMPAA rating PG-13 for brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 4 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on December 25 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Messy `Joy needs a mop-up - Star power alone cant rescue the film from peripheral distractions and a lack of focus. - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Movies Joy David O.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan December 24 2015 Jennifer Lawrence plays the titular character in ""Joy."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Jennifer Lawrence delivers a tough engaging performance in ""Joy"" a dramedy by director David O. Russell loosely based on the life of inventor and home-shopping pioneer Joy Mangano. In the title role of the infectiously plucky entrepreneur -- who parlayed a gig hawking home-care products on QVC into the job of president of a multimillion- dollar company -- Lawrence makes for a can-do heroine as incandescently watchable as Katniss Everdeen of ""The Hunger Games"" but with a Miracle Mop in her hands instead of a bow and arrow. If only the movie were as mesmerizing as its star. ""Joy"" is based on the true story of Joy Mangano a single mother of three children as she builds her business empire after creating the Miracle Mop and becomes the president of Ingenious Designs LLC. (  / 20th Century Fox) The film reunites Lawrence with her ""Silver Linings Playbook"" co-stars Bradley Cooper playing a QVC executive and mentor to Joy and Robert De Niro as Joys cranky (and mostly unlikable) father. Written by Russell and Annie Mumolo ""Joy"" lacks that 2012 films fizzy effervescence settling instead for a veneer of self-conscious kookiness that does little to elevate the narrative beyond a made-for- cable rags-to-riches tale. [Steve Carell hopes you want to throw up after seeing The Big Short] Like Russells last collaboration with Cooper and Lawrence the Oscar-nominated ""American Hustle"" ""Joy"" plays a little fast and loose with the facts that inspired Russell and Mumolo (""Bridesmaids""). The real Joy Manganos loyal ex-husband for instance who is played by Edgar Ramirez in the film was not a Venezuelan singer although he really did stand by her through thick and thin as he does in Russells film. ""Joy"" reunites Jennifer Lawrence (right) with her ""Silver Linings Playbook"" co-stars Robert De Niro (left) and Bradley Cooper (center). (Merie Weismiller Wallace/Twentieth Century Fox) The story itself however is more character sketch than movie lacking the thematic gristle that gave ""Hustle"" audiences something to chew on while watching the action. Based on the Abscam sting operation of the late 1970s that film used plot to explore a grand theme the notion of truth and falsehood and our American propensity to confuse the two. ""Joy"" which is narrated by the title characters dead grandmother (Diane Ladd) -- a technical cheat thats more irritating than inspired -- makes a similar effort touching on the nature of time itself and the unpredictability of life. But those ideas feel like an afterthought something spooned over the story like sauce after its been brought to the table rather than juices rendered by the narrative meat. Part of the problem is undercooking. ""Joy"" is an inspirational tale no doubt introducing us to Joy when she is a frustrated divorcee looking back on a promising life that has been squandered in dead-end jobs and looking after her seemingly agoraphobic mother (Virginia Madsen). Always a can-do kid Joy never pursued her dreams until she hits upon an idea for a new- fangled easy-wring mop after wrestling with one that she uses to clean up spilled wine cutting her hands on the broken glass. (If this doesnt seem like a life-changing idea you havent watched Joy sell it. Lawrence appears to believe in the product as much as Mangano must have.) But that hardly seems like enough to hang a David O. Russell movie on. True to form the film is filled with great over-ripe performances particularly from Isabella Rossellini who plays the supremely self-confident well-to-do girlfriend of Joys father and one of Joys early financial backers. But a quirky supporting cast and a modern-day Horatio Alger story arent enough. Even Lawrence in the end is a letdown. As entertaining and committed as she is -- and shes easily the best thing about ""Joy"" -- the actress ultimately cant sell a souffle thats half baked. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains brief crude language. 124 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Russells Joy This bio-drama is no ""Hunger Games"" but Lawrence kicks plenty of butt.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 24 2015 -- 1010pm 20th Century Fox In her third collaboration with filmmaker David O. Russell Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy Mangano the tough single mom and entrepreneur who brought us the Miracle Mop. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Who needs plots? Lately some of the most alert polished films have been ones moving in random eccentric directions. In fact several of them have come from writer/director David O. Russell whose sixth sense for what audiences will enjoy brought us ""The Fighter"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle."" His trademark point and counterpoint stories offer a screwball sitcom a fairy tale with social asides and a feel-good salute to middle-class American moral fiber all at the same time. ""Joy"" the third collaboration from Russell and his ensemble players Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro is his usual good mix of fluff and melodrama and then some. Full of shaggy-dog charm its an easy film to like. Here he presents a somewhat true bio-drama about Joy Mangano a pink-collar single mom who made a tough unsteady rise to success as the inventor of the self-wringing Miracle Mop. It makes sense that she would see the potential value of a plastic-handled cleanup gadget because much of her own life was messy and full of stains especially the parts connected to marriage. We meet Joy as a winsome gradeschooler inventively folding construction paper dream homes where she will live happily ever after. Then the giddy sensuousness of her teens (from which point she is played by the sublime Lawrence) makes her fall in love with a rakish Latino singer (Edgar Ramirez). After a rocky relationship he transitions from husband to live-in ex occupying the basement of Joys ramshackle Long Island home and co-raising the couples two children. Joys difficult divorced parents multiply the difficulties further. Apathetic mom (Virginia Madsen) lives with her camped out in a bed near the entrance watching trashy soap operas all day long as if lifes vexations made her a shut-in invalid. Joys grumpy garage owner dad (De Niro) knocks on the door for refuge when his latest wife en route to divorce court drops him at the household as damaged goods. 20th Century Fox Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. Now barely solvent Joy has two immature bozos living in the basement another glued to the TV and a pair of real children needing attention too. Its all handled with low-key humor yet there are sharp stabs of honest pain. Whenever Joy tries to kick her porchs broken down wooden pillar back together its a jolt of humiliation. In a scene just this side of devastating Joy tells her best friend just how scary the knife edge of disappointment is feeling. When her daughter asks for some school help to learn about cicadas the bugs 17-year underground life cycle parallels the decades that Joy has been buried far from the happiness she once imagined. While a standard womens film would move ahead with new love blossoming and the wheels grinding loudly to a happy ending ""Joy"" avoids stereotypes. Rather than yearning for rescue from a new suitor our plucky heroine becomes her own knight in dented armor. Her bumpy quest toward the American dream involves unending difficulties some serious some funny each one testing Joys limits. The film wisely doesnt present her as a glorified angel but as a smart ambitious ordinary woman. Much of Joys story gets narrated remembrances from her devoted grandmother (a nice return to the screen for the long-absent Diane Ladd). While others lay blame on Joy for all that goes wrong Grandma sees Joy not as a stubborn screw-up but the only person who could possibly pull each needy generation of her family ahead. As we follow Joys frustrating journey the dependably wonderful Lawrence delivers each scene like a champ. She portrays every feeling written into the script -- and a lot more -- with dramatic intelligence and force. Its hard not to admire her grit as she sets up her own low-rent factory staffed with her ex-husbands Latin American church members or battles patent thieves or wrestles with the home shopping channel that offers her a chance to sell her products. You share her exhilaration when long-awaited successes begin to pile up and admire her courage when the breakneck roller coaster heads down again. The film is not stressing just her rise as an entrepreneur but her surprisingly touching development as an independent woman. colin.covertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

PG""The world doesnt owe you a thing"" Jennifer Lawrences feisty title character offers as life advice in Joy and the same might be said of filmmaker David O. Russell.After three films in quick succession -- American Hustle Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter -- where he reinvented himself as a writer/director of renown a stumble now is forgivable. He owes us nothing.Article Continued BelowJoy is a fun but untidy muddle a mess that even the self-wringing mop of its central metaphor cant easily clean up. Its loaded with great characters and moments and it makes canny use of pop songs as David O. Russell movies usually do but it all doesnt add up to much. Reports that Russell struggled in the editing room to ""find"" his picture are entirely believable.Jennifer Lawrence gleams in Joy along with well-cast costars Robert De Niro and Edgar Ramirez.  (Merie Weismiller Wallace / 20th Century Fox)  But his casting remains as impeccable as always. He was smart enough to retain and elevate Jennifer Lawrence his main spark from American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook. He supports her with such other Russell film stalwarts as Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper and adds Edgar Ramirez Isabella Rossellini and Virginia Madsen for good measure.Lawrence is a superb actress adept at both comedy and drama. She mightily draws upon these skills to sweep us through this sloppy biopic of Joy Mangano the inventor and hustler of the Miracle Mop who navigated family setbacks and industry sharks to successfully sell stuff on TV.Joy wont mop up at the Oscars in other words.

Russells new film is a machine with too many moving parts + READ ARTICLE The best most radiant moment in David O. Russells Joy is the one you see captured in the ads for the movie showing Jennifer Lawrence--as inventor single mom and almost-failed entrepreneur Joy Mangano--with her head thrown back gazing skyward at some falling snow her eyes both protected and hidden by tinted aviator shades. If youve seen the poster you almost dont need to see the movie Its practically a visual summary of Russells relatively uncomplicated ""strong woman triumphs over adversity"" thesis. Strong women dont necessarily make great characters--often theyre not required to be anything but symbols which are the most boring things to play and to watch. But to skip Joy would be to miss the pleasure of watching Lawrence--not because this is a particularly rich role for her but because its fascinating to see what she does with a fairly undistinguished one. The performance focused where it needs to be but largely just enjoyably freewheeling is a reminder that Lawrence only 25 doesnt yet need to be great. Sometimes especially for such a young performer its enough to be casual. Russell--who also wrote the screenplay from a story he co-wrote with Annie Mumolo--begins Joy as a stylized fairytale complete with a fairy godmother who just happens to be Joys grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd) is the one person who believes in her capabilities from childhood right into adulthood. Its Joys mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) who holds her back She spends her days lounging on her bed like a cartoon movie star gorging on over-the-top Dynasty-style soap operas as a substitute for doing the work of living. Russell gives us a thumbnail sense of what Joy was like as a girl--she builds mini kingdoms for herself out of paper asserting to her less-imaginative half-sister Peggy that she has special powers that obviate the need for ""a prince."" We also get a glimpse of her dangling a small dog precariously yet gently from its collar; later well learn that in high school she actually invented a self-releasing dog collar which her mother failed to patent for her. Joy is liveliest when Russell is setting the scene for his heroines later success as well as her trials By the time shes in her 20s Joy already has two kids and an ex-husband a not-so-successful Latin singer (played by the alluring Edgar Ramirez star of Olivier Assayas 2010 bracing TV mini-series-turned-movie Carlos) who will remain her friend and supporter long after the couples split. When Joy hatches an idea for a self-wringing mop--the notion comes to her after she cuts her hands while cleaning up after a broken-glass disaster--her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) an absentee dad through most of her youth helps her get seed money from his rich girlfriend Trudy (played by an imperious Isabella Rossellini). Rudy Trudy and Peggy (the pleasantly sinister Elisabeth Rohm) give the appearance of helping Joy in her business endeavors when in reality their motives are much more complex. Her relationship with Neil Walker (a peanut-butter smooth Bradley Cooper) the QVC shopping-network honcho who gives her her first break in the 1990s is more constructive but no less fraught. This movie is a machine with lots of moving parts Joy is constantly coming up with half-wild half-practical ideas only to be thwarted by some bully who stands in her path--sometimes its a man but not always. The problem isnt that the scenario is unrealistic Everything that happens in Joy is believable. But Russell fails in the subtlety department. You can hear the gears grinding away every minute This story of the woman who invented the Miracle Mop Huggable Hangers and lots of other awesome stuff will inspire you or else. What is it about inspiration that so often fails to inspire? Russell closes the movie with a scene that saps all the juice from his lead character At her best Joy is a hustler and a dreamer in equal measure. By the end shes just a role model--her success has calcified into a kind of passive grandeur and Lawrence doesnt know how to play that. But thats to her credit. Lawrence is better at playing a fighter than a great lady worthy of our admiration--shes an action verb in action. When we see her trying to hawk her newly invented mop in a K-Mart parking lot--some ladies stop to look but eventually move on and thats before the cops show up--desperation clashes with determination. Lawrence is wonderful at playing both Her smallish piercing eyes can show guardedness or heart-stopping openness and she can shift from one to the other imperceptibly. Its no surprise when Joy becomes a home-shopping success--we always knew she had that potential kickboxing its way out. No wonder the phones start ringing off the hook. In the end Joy is more slender and inconsequential than Russell probably intends it to be--it wears its ideas rather than embodying them. But Lawrence keeps the channels of communication open every minute with the audience. Joy is proof that she can sell us anything. Operators are standing by. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Inspired by the story of the woman who invented the Miracle Mop and then scads of other things its a serviceable movie but not much more.Except for Lawrence who seems at this point capable of taking on any job and making something of it no matter what the role asks of her.AZCENTRALYear in Review 2015 Goodykoontzs top 10 moviesHere she plays Joy Mangano a single mom working at an airline counter supporting a funhouse family of misfits. Her mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) lies in bed watching the same soap opera (which Russell recreates). Her father Rudy (De Niro) moved back in after his girlfriend dumped him; hes living in the basement with Joys ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) who wants to be a singer. The two men hate each other naturally. Her bitter jealous half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) floats in and out talking a good game about how important she is but offering little evidence.Only her Aunt Mimi (Diane Ladd) sees the spark in Joy. She has had big ideas since she was a girl but life with this bunch has just about beaten it out of her. Its when her dad starts dating a wealthy widow Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) that the spark returns.Jennifer Lawrence re-teams with Bradley Cooper in ""Joy."" (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Though not directly. Someone spills wine and mopping it up proves a finger-cutting chore. Thats when Joy gets the idea for the Miracle Mop extra absorbent and self-wringing. She asks Trudy for an investment. (Rossellini does a nice job portraying someone who didnt make the money she has but isnt shy about telling everyone else how theyre going about it the wrong way.)Long story short The mop is a flop. But a new channel called QVC is struggling to get off the ground. Joy gives it a shot meeting Neil Walker (Cooper) who is running it with big talk and bigger dreams as if it were a movie studio. From here Joy will succeed struggle succeed struggle the usual.Yes it is infuriating when lawyers and charlatans take advantage of her and even more so when her family belittles her dreams when they are so obviously one of the detriments to her achieving them. But Russells screenplay doesnt do anything to make anyones behavior particularly believable much less compelling. His films are typically a marvel of ensemble acting and there is nothing wrong with him turning the focus on Lawrence. Who wouldnt?AZCENTRALJoy (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBut the supporting characters arent tended to with the care were used to in a Russell film. Cooper in particular is wasted showing up later in the film and while his character is crucial to Joys business life he doesnt really have anything to do beyond that.The script feels not half-finished but maybe three-quarters. Lawrence does what she can to make up the missing 25 percent but even she cant perform miracles.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Entertainment Jennifer Lawrences New Movie Is Basically Just A Bunch Of GIFs Of Her In Search Of A Movie David O. Russells new movie panders when it wants to empower. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jennifer Lawrence in Joy. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 7629518 Over the weekend Victor Frankenstein screenwriter Max Landis caused a mini Twitter flurry by calling Daisy Ridleys Star Wars The Force Awakens character Rey a ""Mary Sue"" a fan fiction term for an idealized overly capable original character inserted into an existing universe. In other words according to Landis Rey is fan wish fulfillment too instantly liked and too good at everything too quickly -- a strange complaint about a franchise consisting of two trilogies about two dudes who were good at everything because of the powers they were born with.But Reys a woman.The blinkered idea that when female characters are capable and lead a story its pandering is one thats been lobbed at other movies this year as well particularly Mad Max Fury Road for its introduction of Charlize Therons fabulous Imperator Furiosa. Its the howl of a small fraction of moviegoers outraged to realize they are no longer the only demographic Hollywoods catering to... except then something like Joy comes out and you wish all those grumblers cared as much about the latest David O. Russell drama as they do major franchises. Because Joy is what pandering actually looks like and its not pretty. View this image > Twentieth Century Fox ID 7630543 Well it is pretty because it stars Jennifer Lawrence Russells leading lady of choice for three movies now and because its shot by cinematographer Linus Sandgren who makes the whole thing look like a slightly faded home movie from some undetermined moment in the past. Lawrence will always be fun to watch even when shes as miscast as she is here as Joy a divorced mother of two who invents an innovative mop thats sold on the Home Shopping Network.The actor tamps down her unruly charisma to play a woman whos struggling to support not just her children but her musician ex (Edgar Ramirez) her divorced parents (Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen) and her beloved grandmother (Diane Ladd). But it doesnt matter. Despite how capable Lawrence is the 25-year-old still cant convincingly pull off the soul-deep exhaustion and panic of a woman whos spent more than a decade and a half treating her own needs as secondary to those of the people shes taking care of. When Ladds Mimi tells Joy ""You dont exactly have your whole life ahead of you but you still have a good portion of it"" its eye-rolling because plenty of people who are Lawrences age are still coming around to the idea that you have to buy toilet paper. View this image > Twentieth Century Fox ID 7630694 Lawrence has been too young for every Russell role shes had but Joy is the first movie in which that feels like an affront -- not just because shes a decade younger than the real Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano but because she seems cast in order to make the story of a single-mom-and-housewife-turned-entrepreneur into a more generic girl power tale. Mangano is an executive producer on the film but Joys title card is even weirdly vague about how much of what follows is her story ""Inspired by true stories of powerful women and one in particular"" it reads.Its ironic that a movie about a woman who has credit stolen for her work by a collection of condescending men would play coy about being based on someones real life -- that its somehow not Manganos story but that of all women. But a lot of Joys uplift is phony in the same way built on every other character being monstrous or foolish. The film which Russell wrote with a story credit for Bridesmaids scribe Annie Mumolo portrays Joys family as a collection of ungrateful parasites and undermining harpies worse somehow than the family in The Fighter.Joys father makes her cry at her wedding and favors the hostile sister (Elisabeth Rohm) whos always insulting her. Joy is also pressured into taking bad advice from her financier her fathers girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) then blamed for it. The head of HSN (Bradley Cooper) lets a man whos never held a mop in his life first demonstrate her product. Joys business partners attempt to steal her ideas then sneer in her face when she protests. View this image > Twentieth Century Fox ID 7631466 Throughout Joys lurching story the title character repeatedly shows moxie against cartoonish adversity sometimes with the help of her bestie (an underused Orange Is the New Black star Dascha Polanco) providing moments of satisfaction that dont need the context of the movie to work. Theyre actually better without it because the context is such a cardboard representation of what its like to be underestimated talked down to misunderstood and dismissed.Sure its a pleasure to watch Lawrence take her rage out at the neighboring shooting range or tell Rossellinis Trudy about how ready she is to be ruthless in business. But those scenes work better in the trailer or as a selection of convenient GIFs than they do as part of a movie that doesnt just do a disservice to its subject and its lead but to the women it attempts to speak for.

Russell feature Ive seen rehashing the sort of family backbiting he explored more profitably in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) The Fighter (2010) and Flirting With Disaster (1996). Jennifer Lawrence holds the whole thing together with her tough emotionally direct performance as the title character a divorced mother who bets everything shes got on a patented new kitchen mop she hopes to sell on the QVC channel. Making her life miserable are her jealous sister (Elisabeth Rohm) their distracted unaffectionate father (Robert De Niro) and his viperish second wife (Isabella Rossellini) who puts up money for Joys enterprise but proves anything but generous. A miscast Bradley Cooper struggles through his role as a humorless marketing executive and the plot turns lumpy as Russell seeking a big triumphant climax throws one business reversal after another at his dogged heroine.

Jennifer Lawrence (left) as Joy Robert De Niro as her father and Edgar Ramirez as her ex-husband. Photo Merie Weismiller Wallace Associated Press Joy is a joyless exercise 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Like ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" ""Joy"" is a David O. Russell film about a person struggling to find happiness while burdened by a large demanding family. In ""Joy"" Russell once again presents a family in a spirit of warmth mixed with distance and acceptance mixed with satire. But this time it all feels wrong. ""Joy"" is a Cinderella tale but not only in the sense that it follows its heroine from rags to riches. Its a Cinderella tale in that its about a womans triumph over the terrible people she lives with. Her family is downright horrible -- an undermining soul-killing collective monster -- and Russell shows us enough to let us recognize that but not enough to show that he knows it. The result is a peculiar disturbing movie somewhere between a drama without impact and a feel-bad comedy. The film is based on the life of Joy Mangano the single mom from Long Island who invented the Miracle Mop and went on to create a business empire based on her talent for thinking up useful products. Hers is a story worth telling and a straight treatment of her life or a documentary about her would be fascinating. But ""Joy"" is something else a fictionalized version of an actual persons life so fictionalized in fact that the name ""Mangano"" is never spoken. Thus despite some overlap between fact and fantasy its probably smartest to approach ""Joy"" as a complete fiction. When we meet Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) she is a young woman supporting an extended family of selfish deadbeats. Already in her early 30s her life is close to hopeless. She has two children by a former marriage. She has her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) living in the basement. She has a (nice) grandmother (Diane Ladd) also on the premises as well as a useless mother (Virginia Madsen) who lies in bed all day watching soap operas. And every one of them needs to be catered to. Then the father shows up needing a place to live while he goes through yet another breakup. As played by Robert De Niro the father is a subtly repellent figure who manipulates Joy with affection while chipping away at her self-image in order to make her pliant and emotionally dependent. Theirs is a hideous dynamic presented here in enough detail for us to perceive it and yet offered by Russell without comment. Its strange. In a completely fact-based movie a directors willingness to go easy on the characters might be understandable -- real people can be hurt after all. But ""Joy"" is a fiction that shows a family of bloodsuckers without judgment as though they were fun lovable characters. Its enough to make viewers wonder. Is Russell simply miscalculating botching the tone of his film by assuming his characters are engaging when they are not? Or is this a conscious experiment in comedy an attempt to see how funny it might be to throw contemptible characters into a frustrating story in which theres nothing to laugh at? Id prefer to think Russell did everything intentionally because that would at least have the advantage of being weird. But intentional or accidental the effect is the same a movie that feels off. The opening is funny with Russell staging a scene from the soap opera that Joys mother watches every day. He uses soap opera stars including the most famous one of all Susan Lucci. But the movie soon shifts into a more somber mode as it tells Joys story. She was a smart girl and an innovative thinker who passed up a chance to go to college because she felt her mother needed her at home. She still has dreams and still gets great ideas but she has no time to work on them and gets no encouragement except from her grandmother. Joy is everyones meal ticket and its more convenient for everyone if she remain in a state of servitude. If ""Joy"" is indeed a comedy no one told Jennifer Lawrence who is utterly affecting as a woman of quality being suffocated by her mental and moral inferiors. Its probably more a matter of essence than performance but Lawrence makes us believe in Joy and care about her. Perhaps she makes us care too much because it becomes impossible to see Joys family as anything less than poisonous when their every move serves to smother her spark. Russell comes close to saying something daring in ""Joy"" that despite all the sentimentality surrounding family families are often just factories for neurosis things best escaped than honored. But he pulls his punches; in fact he might not be punching at all. Bradley Cooper a familiar face in the Russell universe plays an executive with a home shopping network. Its a fairly brief part but everything connected with the network and how it goes about launching and selling projects is interesting as a glimpse behind the scenes. It also must be admitted that Lawrence remains a sympathetic focus throughout and ""Joy"" never completely loses its way. But it almost does and it never quite arrives.

Russells latest madcap collaboration with Jennifer Lawrence (and Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro) announces itself as ""inspired by true stories of daring women."" Then the title card adds ""One in particular."" Video Trailer Joy More about Joy >> That particular woman is Joy Mangano who in the late 1980s started peddling her homemade invention a self-wringing mop in supermarket parking lots and - breakthrough moment - on the QVC cable shopping channel. The Miracle Mop took off to say the least but as Russells screenplay tells it it was anything but a smooth launch. Joys entry into the world of entrepreneurship has the crazy trajectory of a rocket gone haywire and Russells movie is kind of haywire too. On the heels of Russells head-spinning and wonderful Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle in which Lawrence proved her mettle and proved she could spar with the best of them Joy gives the actress her own story to run with. Its not a love story not a story of political corruption scammery and greed but the story of a girl from Long Island sprung from a dizzyingly dysfunctional family who in the wake of a divorce with two kids and a history of frustrating jobs finds her true calling making stuff and selling the hell out of it. Lawrence burns with intensity here so much so that you can almost see the brushfires shes leaving behind on the trail. Shoulders slung back eyes fierce the actress is never less than riveting. But for the first time in a long time (maybe 2004s messy loony I Heart Huckabees) its Russell who seems not altogether sure how to proceed. The director working with a big cast and a multigenerational yarn - the grandmom (Diane Ladd) the mom (Virginia Madsen) the dad (De Niro) the dads new gal (Isabella Rossellini) the two-bit lounge singer spouse (Edgar Ramirez) - toggles around throwing a parallel black-and-white soap-opera scenario and several slam-bang blowups into the mix. By the time Joy arrives at the QVC studios for her tryout shes out of breath figuratively speaking. Its at the home-shopping facility in West Chester Pa. that Coopers Neil Walker works running the studios and making sure folks like Joan Rivers rack up the big sales. Still even ADD Russell is more entertaining more engrossing than most of the movies out there. The guy knows how to match the right (period) tune with the right dramatic moment (the Bee Gees the Rolling Stones Ella Fitzgerald) and he knows how to give his actors room to improvise to find those moments of exhilarating alchemy. A kind of fractured fairy tale with a feminist ethic Joy is a great story great fun.

Joy (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Joy (PG-13) Jennifer Lawrence and director David O. Russell reunite for this comedy about the woman who invented the Miracle Mop. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com12/23/2015 Editor rating 2.5 On the surface Joy is a classic underdog tale based on the true story of a divorced mother of two who had a smart useful idea and parlayed it into transcendent business success. But what the film truly reveals is something else entirely how Jennifer Lawrence can elevate any material any time even middle-of-the-pack fare like this. Fresh off her final installment of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games series Lawrence has worked with director/screenwriter David O. Russell before (in the hilarious American Hustle and the inexplicably overpraised Silver Linings Playbook). This time Lawrence gets a less cartoony role which is a plus since shes got to carry this chaotic script and wrench some well-earned empathy out of the audience amid the sort of exhausting cinematic pandemonium that Russell favors. We view Joy through the loving eyes (and voiceover) of her grandmother (Diane Ladd) who marvels over her granddaughters talent and gumption. As the film opens though Joy (Lawrence) has been beaten down by an unrewarding job debt two kids a dead marriage and a quirky deeply annoying family. Her ex-husband (Edgar Martinez) lives in the basement. Her mother (Virginia Madsen) watches bad soaps all day and wont leave her bed. Her father (Robert De Niro doing his usual Robert De Niro schtick) has been booted out by his girlfriend and has to move back into the familys house. Eventually he starts dating a wealthy widow (Isabella Rossellini) whose money is welcome but only adds to the family discord. Amid this tiresome cast of characters -- you can almost feel Russell beaming at the idiosyncratic cacophony they create -- Joy always an innovator hits on an idea for a dream mop (naturally when shes wiping up someone elses clumsy mistake). The film finds its legs once the business side of the story takes off as Joy tries to market and patent her invention and is rebuffed led astray and frustrated at every turn. She finally gets a chance to show off her product on the new and successful QVC thanks to Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper another Russell alum) who knows a good product when he sees one. Their chemistry -- purely of the amiable-but-practical business sort -- comes as a gentle relief after all the histrionics of her family. There are other nice touches in the film Melissa Rivers playing her mother Joan and Susan Lucci of All My Children showing up as a character on the dreadful serial to which Joys mom is addicted. But Russell draws his characters as broadly as those soap opera stick figures hes so eager to mock and though Joy at least tries to break the standard biopic formula its only partially successful at reconstructing an interesting life. Cast Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Bradley Cooper Edgar Ramirez Diane Ladd Virginia Madsen Isabella Rossellini Dascha Polanco. Director David O. Russell. Screenwriters David O. Russell Annie Mumalo. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 124 minutes. Brief strong language. Opens Dec. 25 at area theaters.

Russell likes making movies about broken people - dysfunctional families full of bitter divorces emotionally disturbed relatives irrational behavior and frequent shouting matches. His consistent moral - in ""The Fighter"" in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" even in ""American Hustle"" - is that whatever their problems these people still love each other. And clearly he loves them too. Me Im not so won over. In ""Joy"" its title character is a twenty-something housewife with a talent for inventing things but nothing to show for it. And even as she struggles to pay the bills the rest of the family - her elderly grandmother her emotionally ill mother her no-account ex her bombastic father - depend on her to keep them fed housed and happy. The expenses are mounting and her nerves are fraying. Until one day Joy invents a mop and makes a fortune - and creates an entire new set of problems for herself. In some ways ""Joy"" is Russells salute to struggling women everywhere -- and considering that his movies usually revolve around men and his controversial debut ""Spanking the Monkey"" was about a woman who seduced her own son its a declaration of feminism that feels overdue. Also calculated and somewhat insincere. Joy herself is so special so resilient so good - and almost everyone around her so dreadful - the movie is unreal from the beginning. Its faked not felt. (The film is ""inspired by"" but in no way truly based on the story of an inventor from Long Island.) I know some critics have reacted to the film positively - finally a story about a woman triumphing. But to me ""Joy"" (unlike say ""Suffragette"") played more like pandering - creating a role-model ""survivor"" rather than a truly whole and complicated person elevating one character only by tearing down everyone else. Joys father played by Robert De Niro? An abusive soul-crusher. Her ex as played by Edgar Ramirez? A basically sweet but feckless loser. Even dreamily eyed Bradley Cooper as a mostly nice shopping-channel innovator hangs her out to dry. Its not just the men though. Her mother (who seems to have wondered in from a low-rent ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") is a soap-opera addict in love with the Haitian plumber. Her step-sister is a bitter witch. Her fathers new wife would scare Cinderellas stepmother. Its not hard to make your protagonist seem like a dream when everyone else feels like a nightmare. Well Im not buying it although Jennifer Lawrence as usual completely commits to the part giving a lovely slowly arcing performance - from doormat daughter to independent businesswomen. And Russell works overtime stylistically providing narration an eclectic soundtrack and omniscient flash-forwards. In between he cuts back to the soap opera Joys mother so obsesses over which not only provides him the chance for some easy smirking at bad acting and shot-on-video aesthetics but an escape hatch. You think ""Joy"" is overdone exaggerated melodramatic? Hey thats because its a real-life soap opera. We all live in real-life soap operas. But you know? Sometimes youre better off watching a real one. Ratings note The film contains strong language. Joy (PG-13) Fox (124 min.) Directed by David O. Russell.

Russell offers dull look at Miracle Mop creator Joy does not live up to its title BY Gersh Kuntzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 23 2015 400 AM facebook Tweet email One laugh-out-loud moment comes when Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) gets so angry that she just has to fire off something. Fortunately she works next door to a shooting range. But there are too few of such moments. (20th Century Fox) BY Gersh Kuntzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 23 2015 400 AM Title Joy Film Info With Jennifer Lawrence Robert DeNiro Bradley Cooper. A woman invents a mop that changes the world...and her life. Director David O. Russell. (204). Rated PG-13 for brief strong language. Area theaters. ""Joy"" is joyless. David O. Russells new film is meant to celebrate a struggling single moms escape from family drudgery after inventing an innovative household product. But the director wastes outstanding performances by Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper Robert DeNiro and newcomer Edgar Ramirez with a dull script and an uncharacteristic plodding style. THE REVENANT IS A GRIPPING WESTERN Lawrence plays Joy Mangano the real life inventor of the Miracle Mop -- the handy dandy instrument for cleaning floors that turned its creator into an overnight sensation just as home shopping programming and reality TV were emerging. Russell could have used that only-in-the-80s-America moment as the setting for a madcap comedy or an ""Argo""-style corporate caper -- approaches he has used in far superior works such as ""American Hustle"" and ""Three Kings."" CONCUSSION IS A POWERFUL TALE OF THE NFLS NIGHTMARE Jennifer Lawrence (with Robert DeNiro and Edgar Ramirez) gives a great performance in the otherwise dour ""Joy."" (20th Century Fox) Instead the pace is leaden. Joy first struggles with her dysfunctional family -- a bed-bound mom an emotionally abusive dad a jealous half-sister and a divorced hubby living in the basement -- but even as her successes start adding up the tone of the movie never shifts. And the key scene when Joy confronts the shyster who is trying to steal her idea is handled poorly. Instead of a confrontation the scene just fizzles out and the cheat admits to everything quickly and without drama. DADDYS HOME IS A FAIRLY WEAK WILL FERRELL COMEDY Russell also makes the mistake of having Joys grandmother -- who has been watching her since she was a creative loving child -- narrate the story. The narration only underscores how little action is happening on screen. And at one point the grandmother dies yet her narration continues -- a strategy that made little sense. There are certainly touching moments when Joys dad tries and fails to make up for decades of bad parenting or when her ex-husband turns out to be a real best friend. But the story is ultimately empty because nothing is at stake. A woman invented a mop. She made millions with it. She became a Home Shopping Network star. Is this all there is?

Russells Joy will be in theaters this Christmas and stars Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. 20th Century FoxJennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper co-star again in David O. Russells Joy.(Photo 20th Century Fox)Theres a Miracle Mop at the heart of Joy though the movie is such a mess that even it would have a hard time cleaning up.Jennifer Lawrence gives a remarkable effort in the story of one womans persistent quest to make something of herself though director David O. Russells drama ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens nationwide Christmas Day) isnt that strong on the whole.Joy is ""inspired by daring women"" but its based on one in particular Joy Mangano whose Miracle Mop became a QVC hit in the 1990s. Lawrence stars as Joy nicknamed ""Joy the Doer"" for childhood inventions such as a fluorescent flea collar for her dog.Real life gets in the way of her journey toward adult entrepreneurship. Shes got kids to take care of her mom (Virginia Madsen) does nothing but watch soap operas her encouraging grandma (Diane Ladd) lives upstairs her crooner ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) lives in the basement and her crotchety dad (Robert De Niro) arrives too when hes kicked out of the house by his latest wife. It certainly gets in the way of Joy actually doing anything innovative.USA TODAYTrumbo Idris Elba emerge 5 takeaways from the SAG Awards nominationsHowever a bolt of creative energy hits her after a bad experience cleaning up broken glass and she embarks on a mission to get her Miracle Mop to the people. There are many ups and downs and her luck starts to finally change when Neil (Bradley Cooper) the head of QVC gives her a shot at plugging her wares on live television.Its a straightforward and sometimes funny tale that Russell complicates with musical interludes flashbacks and flash-forwards and they never come together in winning fashion. Plus for as many travails as Joy goes through -- and there are a bunch -- a quick fix is always at hand. Having a bad day? Nothing that going outside and shooting a rifle cant alleviate.Joys best work is with scenes of simple emotion -- for example Joys dad interrupting the already-unstable household (which includes a great war of words between De Niro and Madsen) and the moment when Joy is about to go on air with the rotating TV stage serving as a visual metaphor for her life.USA TODAYCarol Big Short lead Golden Globes field Cooper and Lawrence dont have quite the same chemistry as they had in Russells brilliant Silver Linings Playbook -- like their characters its a more workman-like appeal with these two though there are some sparks of magic when Neil sees Joys mettle.She has been in bigger movies lately with X-Men and Hunger Games but Lawrences best performance since her Oscar-winning Playbook reminds us what a stunning actress she can be with the right director and material. She bestows every bit of Joy with nuance from the doting mom who does her own plumbing to the spitfire professional woman who refuses to give up her dream. (And anyone with concerns about Lawrence being too young to play a self-made millionaire mom need not worry. She pulls it off well and with confidence.)Things might be untidy around her but she is the real Joy to behold here. 27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1YzAq0b",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/22/joy-movie-review-jennifer-lawrence-david-o-russell/77704232/,200,joy24,joy,usatoday

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Joy Running time 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 (brief profanity). An exuberant and grittily determined Jennifer Lawrence hoists David O. Russells ""Joy"" a manically screwball-ish comedy-drama loosely based on the struggles of Joy Mangano the housewife who invented the Miracle Mop and became a home-shopping superstar. Lawrence who at 25 is about a decade too young for the role gives the kind of big Golden Age-movie-star performance rarely seen these days. Her decisive portrait of female empowerment cuts through narrative bloat and fussy direction as if they were so much waxy buildup. Though Mangano is credited as an associate producer neither her last name nor the name of the product is ever mentioned in the movie which saddles its Job-like Joy (Lawrence) with a wildly dysfunctional extended family straight out of Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook."" A divorced mother of three young children living in a generic American suburb (Mangano is a Long Islander but the film was shot near Boston) in the early 1990s Joy struggles to support a house full of freeloading relatives while working a series of dreary jobs. Among those living with her and the kids are Joys divorced mother (Virginia Madsen) who spends her days in bed watching soap operas and Joys ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) an aspiring musician. Hes sharing the basement with the newest arrival Joys neer-do-well father Rudy (Robert De Niro) whose latest wife has sent him packing. Jennifer Lawrence (from left) Robert De Niro and Edgar Ramirez in ""Joy.""Photo Merie Weismiller Wallace/Twentieth Century Fox It seems highly doubtful that the real Joy Mangano -- who had a degree in business administration from Pace University -- would have been foolish enough to wring out a mop full of glass shards with her bare hands as happens in the movies most ridiculous scene. But that inspires the movie Joy to invent the (unnamed) Miracle Mop -- super-absorbent with a detachable self-wringing head that can be cleaned in the washing machine. She manufactures the mops with the backing of Rudys new girlfriend a wealthy widow named Trudy (a hilarious Isabella Rossellini) but no distributor will touch the product. Joy lands a spot for her mop on the nascent QVC network -- where it flops at least until Joy talks a producer into letting her personally pitch the product. Shes a natural. The producer -- a composite character who turns up halfway through the movie -- is played by Bradley Cooper who demonstrated his palpable chemistry with Lawrence in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Coopers role is far smaller than Ramirezs Tony -- and theres no romance this time -- but he energizes the movie just when its starting to flag. Then after about 20 minutes he disappears until the final scene. Mostly its up to Lawrence to wring all the drama and pathos she can out of a battle over patent rights that pushes Joy to the brink of bankruptcy. No surprise that her mettle cleans up all the messiness in ""Joy.""

Russell who co-wrote the story with Annie Mumolo gets off to a wobbly start builds to a wonderfully satirical middle and ends with a whimper. So should you see Joy? Id give it a shot. The invigorating talent of the man behind The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle still shines even in this uneven muddle.

The 25-year-old supernova again proves she can do anything moving from comic to tragic without missing a beat. Her job isnt easy. Russell has fictionalized the life of Joy Mangano the Long Island mother whose design for the self-wringing mop made her millions. Russell sees her as Everywoman a paragon who spends four decades fighting her way out of the male shadow. Joys dad (a splendidly obtuse Robert De Niro) doesnt believe in her though he lives in her basement with her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) while her mom (Virginia Madsen) stays in the upstairs bedroom glued to TV soaps that Russell parodies to scant effect. This despite the presence of such daytime luminaries as Susan Lucci and Maurice Benard. The film is narrated by Joys proud grandmother (Diane Ladd) which only further gilds the lily of Joys unceasing virtue. The film catches fire when Joy borrows seed money from dads stingy new lady (the ever-marvelous Isabella Rossellini) which leads to a QVC exec (a fine focused Bradley Cooper) putting her on the air to sell her mop and herself. Its brings out the best in Russell and Lawrence to show Joy fighting to retain her humor and humanity in a world of crass commercialism. But theres no teeth in Russells bite this time. His admiration for Joy has blurred his vision. And he lets the climactic scenes of empire building drown the film in a sea of cliches. Sadly Russells movie is not a joy forever. Happily Lawrence is.

"David O. Russell movie Joy starring Jennifer Lawrence reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up David O. Russell Fails to Deliver Joy David O. Russell Fails to Deliver Joy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 22 2015 945 AM Joy Want to see Jennifer Lawrence haggle over industrial parts? This is the movie for you Otherwise ... By Dana Stevens Jennifer Lawrence in Joy. Courtesy of 2015 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation David O. Russells Joy a shambolic biopic of real-life homemaker-turned-businesswoman Joy Mangano is an unabashed valentine to Jennifer Lawrence who served as the volatile directors muse in his last three sprawling ensemble comedies (and who won a best actress Oscar in 2012 for the strongest film of the trio Silver Linings Playbook). But not every filmmaker-to-actor valentine heartfelt though it may be is something the outside world needs to see. Joy contains moments of delight humor inspiration and heartbreak--many of its individual scenes cut loose of their context could stand alone as successful mini-movies. But Russells method of barely controlled chaos--his tendency to keep subplots boiling on multiple burners as he rushes from one seriocomic setup to the next--doesnt serve the final product well in this case. Joy which was co-written by Russell and Bridesmaids scribe Annie Mumolo went through four editors in the course of post-production and the seams show in the form of shifts to the films pacing and tone that feel too abrupt and jarring to be deliberate. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. For the first 20 minutes of its running time Joy appears to be a dysfunctional-family comedy a la Silver Linings Playbook with Robert De Niro once again in the role of well-meaning but hapless paterfamilias. As Rudy Mangano he runs a semi-successful car-repair business managed by his older daughter the officious Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm). But its Peggys put-upon half-sister Joy (Lawrence) an unemployed and divorced mother who holds this barely solvent and even less sane family together. Joys mother (an almost unrecognizable Virginia Madsen) long since divorced from Rudy spends her days in bed watching soap operas (affectionately pastiched by Russell using such daytime-TV legends as Susan Lucci and Laura Wright). Joys ex-husband and the father of her children a charming but perpetually broke Venezuelan musician (Edgar Ramirez) is currently crashing in the family basement. When De Niros Rudy is thrown out of the house by his current wife he takes up residence in the same basement as his former son-in-law making for a full loud and argumentative household. Advertisement It isnt long before Rudy who cant stand to be alone meets a new lady friend through an online dating site. Trudy (Isabella Rossellini giving a very funny performance as a would-be grande dame) is a well-off widow given to speaking in lugubrious tones of her dearly departed husband Morris. During an awkward family outing on Morris swanky yacht Joy finds herself tasked with a particularly nasty cleanup job swabbing the deck after a spill involving red wine and broken glass. And with that scene Joy swerves unexpectedly into a completely different narrative zone. No longer a freewheeling comedy about a nutty extended family it becomes for its middle section at least a single-minded portrait of one woman and her mop. The not-yet-existent mop of her dreams that is After slicing her hands on glass shards in that unfortunate deck-swabbing incident Joy who since childhood has dreamed of becoming an inventor becomes obsessed with the idea of designing a more convenient floor-cleaning tool. What if a mop could be wrung dry without having to reach down and touch the disgusting mop-head itself? What if said disgusting mop-head could be easily removed thrown in the wash and reattached ready to clean anew? If you own a mop that performs these functions--a Miracle Mop as it was originally known when it was introduced in the early 90s--you have the real-life Ms. Mangano to thank for your gunk-free hands. But Joys path to entrepreneurial success wasnt easy as Russell spends the second act of the film somewhat laboriously demonstrating. Based on a series of sketches made with her daughters crayons Joy convinces a skeptical Trudy to sponsor her first run of custom-manufactured mops. But no store is willing to take a chance on this unfamiliar new product which at 19.95 is priced higher than any other mop on the market. It isnt until Joy is introduced to the QVC executive Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) that her fortunes begin to turn. Weve seen Cooper and Lawrence strike sparks off each other before in a David O. Russell joint--Silver Linings Playbook where they played a pair of mentally unstable but curiously meant-for-each-other lovers. Here their characters connection is professional rather than romantic but the energy that flows between them is just as crackling. With the appearance of Cooper about two-thirds of the way in Joy becomes yet a third kind of movie--neither a screwball family comedy nor a portrait of the artist as monomaniacal entrepreneur but the story of a business partnership made in heaven. After her first attempt to peddle her invention on the shopping channel ends in disaster Joy on the brink of filing for bankruptcy decides to strong-arm the practical-minded Neil into giving her one more shot. In a scene thats one of the films highlights Joy overcomes her terror of appearing on live TV and addressing the audience as the regular-gal homemaker she is proudly demonstrates the various convenient features of her humble invention. The connection is made the QVC phones start ringing and a housewares empire is born--but not until after more plot complications involving patent fraud dishonest parts manufacturers and passive-aggressive attempts at sabotage by members of Joys family. If like Russell youre a big enough J-Law fan to enjoy the spectacle of this smart charismatic performer doing pretty much anything--including fixing plumbing haggling over the pricing of plastic injection molds or wringing out a grubby pre-Miracle mop with bare bleeding hands--Joy may bring you the joy its director seems intent on delivering. But as likeable as its enterprising heroine may be (and as well-supported as Lawrence is by a plethora of fine performances including Diane Ladd as Joys forbearing grandmother and Dascha Polanco as her unsinkably optimistic best friend) Joy the movie never cohered for me into a story with forward motion. The minute the film begins to find its footing in one tonal register it switches to another and none of the most interesting relationships--particularly Joys push-and-pull power games with Coopers smooth corporate exec--are allowed enough onscreen time to be satisfyingly explored. The films final image of Joy striding triumphantly down the street after besting a sneaky corporate rival invites the viewer to share a sense of closure that doesnt feel earned by the wildly scattered movie weve just watched. Dare I end a review of a movie about innovations in mop technology with the observation that Russell hasnt wrung his heroines story for everything it has to offer?

Russell has assembled boisterous buoyant casts. His manic ensemble players like those in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and American Hustle (2013) carom off one another their high-pitched energy keeping the movies bustling and busy. Plenty of characters still crowd the frame and clamorously vie for our attention in Joy Russells latest loosely based on the life of Joy Mangano the now 59-year-old inventor of the Miracle Mop. But the director whose previous works bear the stamp of 1930s madcap masters such as Gregory La Cava and New American Cinema avatars like Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman here seems to be trying to emulate what used to be called the ""womans picture"" a genre exemplified by Mildred Pierce (1945) another tale (though fictional) of a female entrepreneur. Russell has built the film around his regular troupe member Jennifer Lawrence -- who is burdened by the banalities littering Joys script.Many of the movies platitudes revolve around family Joy which follows its Long Island-born heroine from her early twenties to roughly her mid-forties with the occasional flashback to her grade-school years thrown in devotes much of its running time to illustrating the shopworn idea that our closest kin can be our stealthiest saboteurs. Joy still lives in her childhood home a two-story structure crowded with three generations including her beloved grandmother (Diane Ladd who also narrates) and her own two tiny kids. These cramped quarters seem even more claustrophobic owing to the outsize needs of mom Terry (Virginia Madsen) a shut-in who hasnt left her bedroom -- or ""comfort nest"" as Ma prefers -- in years glued to a soap opera that Russell milks for clumsy meta-commentary. The dwelling becomes nearly uninhabitable with the return of stormy patriarch Rudy (Robert De Niro) deposited at the doorstep by the latest of his ex-wives; Joy installs Dad in the basement already occupied by her former spouse Tony (Edgar Ramirez) who aspires to be the next Tom Jones.Film Details Joy RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time124 min. More Info Trailer ""I dont want to end up like my family"" Joy laments her declaration echoing the theme explored in The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook (if not the words of probably every person whos ever sat in a therapists office). Those earlier films though elevated -- or at least enlivened -- that truism via the sheer outrageousness of many of the players the septet of sisters in The Fighter those Southie-accented Furies or Pat Sr. the magical-thinking Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father in Silver Linings Playbook. That football fanatic was played by De Niro who in Joy doesnt really deviate from Pat Sr.s exaggerated gesticulations and grumpy outbursts the semaphores that signal moviedoms idea of an aggrieved ineffectual Italian-American paterfamilias. That De Niro seems to be simply repeating a prior performance further highlights the sense that Russell has run out of ways to illuminate fractious clans.Related StoriesAmerican Hustle Is a Con to Fall ForLawrence and The Hunger Games Transcend the BlockbusterRussell enthusiasts -- and I consider myself one -- often applaud the directors abiding interest in the messiness of his characters lives most vividly on display in American Hustle a movie animated by flamboyant dissemblers and depressives. But the disorder found in Joy is a reflection not of any quicksilver dynamics among the actors but of the odd tonal shifts in the film itself. So much of Joy which was written by Russell -- though Annie Mumolo who co-scripted Bridesmaids with Kristen Wiig is given a story credit -- seems provisional a clumsy first-draft attempt at making an unconventional movie about a woman who earned millions from the most pedestrian of objects.In addition to that unsuccessful soap opera framing device the films misfires include the bromides delivered by Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper another Russell regular) an executive at QVC where Joy learns to become a successful pitchwoman. ""In America the ordinary meets the extraordinary every single day"" the suit tells the ambitious inventor a fatuous philosophy that the film celebrates as self-evident truth without ever offering much to demonstrate it.Joy is not without its pleasures On that QVC set we are treated to the bizarre sight of Joan Rivers as embodied by her daughter Melissa. This uncanny tribute suggests the odder detours that the movie might have more fruitfully explored -- possibilities that are inevitably thwarted by Joys investment in timeworn concepts about dysfunctional relationships. Among the extended supporting cast Dascha Polanco as Joys best friend and Isabella Rossellini playing Rudys latest inamorata invigorate any of their too-few scenes.For her part Lawrence so tonic and mesmerizing in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle valiantly tries to bring to life a heroine who is both underwritten and overdetermined. Joy always scans as a composite -- not only of those self-abnegating martyrs of classic Hollywood like Mildred Pierce but also of Russells thinly conceived ideas about lower-middle-class strivers. ""I wear a blouse and I wear pants. Thats how I look"" Joy tells Neil before stepping in front of the QVC cameras for the first time. Russells movie cloaks her in an even more unvarying uniform.Joy Directed by David O. Russell 20th Century Fox Opens December 25 Written and directed by David O. Russell.

"Review Joy lacks spark despite solid Jennifer Lawrence performance - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Joy lacks spark despite solid Jennifer Lawrence performanceBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 12/18/2015 041807 PM PSTUpdated 12/23/2015 045636 PM PST Reliability can be tough to come by during the overstuffed holiday film season if serious sometimes bleak dramas dominate the screen. So its comforting as a warm blanket to find filmmaker David O. Russell slipping ""Joy"" under the holiday movie tree this season. Russell in fact has made a tradition this time of year of delivering films about the foibles of flawed but endearingly quirky humans including the spry and goofy ""American Hustle"" in 2013 and the sweet-and-sour romantic dramedy ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in 2012. But with ""Joy"" Russell futzes with his patented kooky blueprint ditching romance in favor of a feminist-powered fictionalized take on the Miracle Mop inventor and her highly dysfunctional family. Even with frequent Russell players Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro onboard ""Joy"" ranks third when stacked up to the teams other collaborations. (L-R) Jennifer Lawrence as Joy Mangano and Bradley Cooper as Neil in Joy. (Twentieth Century Fox) Russells detractors many of whom think he could be a tidier storyteller will find a lot of fault with it. But for those of us who find his rambling nature endearing theres enough to like just not enough to love. ""Joy"" is a messy film that feels rushed in some parts and not fully developed in others. What makes it work is Lawrence as Joy Mangano a determined stressed-out Long Island entrepreneur who has a knack for creating products but lacks the time and money to kick ideas out of the planning stage. Its not Lawrences best performance but it is a solid one.Advertisement As the film begins we meet a woman who clearly lacks joy in her life. Shes got a job at an airline counter dealing with snarky customers and lives claustrophobically with her two kids as well as her ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez); her loyal grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd); and her shut-in mother Carrie (Virginia Madsen). Eventually her newly single dad Rudy (De Niro) moves into the basement with her ex which makes for a full house loaded with unresolved issues and ongoing feuds. Making Joys life even more miserable is her jealous needy and rather vicious sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm). The only ones who have her back are her ex and her childhood friend Jackie (Dascha Polanco from ""Orange Is the New Black"").Joys idea for the Miracle Mop emerges in the 90s as she is sailing with her dads wealthy widowed girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini). After spilling red wine on the deck and injuring herself mopping it up Joy gets a gleam in her eye and seeks the funding and the place -- her dads mechanics shop -- to make her Miracle Mop idea a reality.A great pitch lands her invention on the QVC shopping network where executive Neil Walker (Cooper) takes notice of her moxie and appreciates what an innovator she is.Its curious material yet Lawrence sells it. Even though the accent she adopts sometimes disappears she doesnt overplay a part that requires her to age over the course of decades. Shes tough but vulnerable especially in scenes when her dad sides with her sister and laments his daughters lack of business acumen.Nearly all of the other nutty characters are delightful. Ramirez charms as Joys ex who is still trying to make it as a singer while Cooper does the most with his small but essential role. Rossellini provides comic relief as the backer who helps finance the mop.The problematic character is Joys mom cloistered in her upstairs room endlessly watching a soap opera (brought to life by real soap opera stars including Susan Lucci and Donna Mills). Madsens poorly delineated character comes across as a caricature. When the screenplay by Russell and Annie Mumolo summons up a flirtation for her its a relationship that feels forced. So does the time spent on the fantasy world of the soap opera which opens the film. Its an apt metaphor that gets tiresome from repetition.Despite these script problems Lawrence does keep us interested as we watch her fall down get back up again and stumble some more. And while ""Joy"" isnt a smooth ride it is an interesting one taking us to some unexpected places while giving us an entertaining portrait of a female entrepreneur. Maybe next holiday season director Russell will present us with a gift that lives up to the expectations he has created for us.JOY   1/2Rating PG-13 (for brief strong language)Cast Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Edgar Ramirez Bradley Cooper Isabella Rossellini Virginia Madsen Diane LaddDirector and co-screenwriter David O.

Russell brings his Joy to the world with a wonky sense of humour and the genius of young actress Jennifer Lawrence. Their latest collaboration -- following in the footsteps of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle -- is a biographical picture about the life and times of Joy Mangano. In real life Mangano is the Long Island housewife and inventor who became famous and eventually rich after bouts of near-bankruptcy by creating and marketing her Miracle Mop. She did this on QVC a home shopping TV network in the early 1990s. This was before she hooked up with the giant Home Shopping Network becoming their most effective pitch person and eventually selling her parent company Ingenious Designs to HSN. Mangano remains a home shopping guru. In the film Lawrences Mangano is a colourful character a single mom with a unique relationship and friendship with her ex-husband and an enterprising woman who parlays her creativity into an incredibly successful business. In that sense Joy the film is a post-feminist metaphor for femme empowerment. Because that power is embodied in Lawrences stunningly complex performance as Mangano the metaphor is always convincing. This is true even when the film tilts off its rocker with a bit of Russell-esque madness built into the screenplay and with the director failing to always keep the energy going. Russell wrote Joy after taking over the project from other filmmakers. Joy Mangano is a curious protagonist for a major motion picture. Yet the sly comedy and the slight shift to the 1990s as the primary period for the drama gives Joy a slightly surreal atmosphere. That is appropriate for a film that does not want to just give us a routine cradle-to-the-grave biopic. For one thing Manganos childhood is not that interesting for a film despite some flashbacks to her as a youngster (when she is played by 10-year-old Isabella Cramp who does actually look like we imagine Lawrence could have at the same age). And of course the grave ending would be a lie Mangano is very much alive at the age of 59 still inventing still pitching products still a superstar of the American home shopping universe. Some critics are down on Joy perhaps tiring of Russells familiar ensembles. Not only does Lawrence return so does Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro both of them co-stars of Silver Linings Playbook (although De Niros contribution to American Hustle was strictly a cameo albeit it one that sizzled). In the new film De Niro plays Lawrences eccentric father after playing Coopers dad in Silver Linings Playbook. As for Cooper he is now portraying the home shopping wizard who gets involved with Mangano with the Miracle Mop action. There is no romantic frisson this time as there was in both Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle. As an overall film Russells Joy ranks as a lesser piece to the earlier collaborations with Lawrence Cooper and De Niro. That does not make it a throwaway film. Feminine empowerment can fuel a comedic drama such as Joy. Critically Russells sense of wonder and beauty turns elegiac moments -- especially when Joy Mangano becomes fully realized as a woman and as a business executive -- into scenes of great beauty. At no time more so than in the snow-in-Texas scene that gave the distributors its movie poster image. Meanwhile as he always does Russell populates the screen with interesting support players to his main stars. The cast includes Edgar Ramirez Diane Ladd Virginia Madsen Isabella Rossellini Susan Lucci (in a mock TV soap opera that gives Joy some of its silliness) and even Melissa Rivers as her late mother Joan Rivers. The end result? Russells Joy will offer you some of that joyous sensation when it opens in theatres Christmas Day.

Russells latest continues the writer-directors post-comeback run of movies about dreamers and go-getters thwarted by doofus relations though it cant seem to make heads or tails of its headstrong heroine. With the exception of Three Kings Russells movies have never been that focused on plot sometimes coming across as though they were figuring themselves out as they go along part and parcel to the filmmakers habit of making script changes on the fly and his longstanding preoccupation with self-actualization and therapy. But Joy lacks the crucial epiphany point and ends up feeling incomplete--and not in the manner of say a work of art denying closure. Rough even by Russells standards this grab bag of dropped plot points visual metaphors and theatrical cues looks like the underdrawing of a comic drama only half covered in bright impasto strokes.The thing about Russell (Silver Linings Playbook American Hustle) is that hes always put rough edges front and center and can make messiness fun to watch. But the real draw of his offbeat off-center direction is in those moments when it abruptly pulls itself together and that happens only once in Joy at around the midway point. This is the sequence where Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) goes to pitch her invention to the home-shopping channel QVC with the help of ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) a failed lounge singer who is somehow the most clear-headed and dependable member of her cartoonish Long Island family. Playing off that accidental surrealism thats innate to so much thats American the movie follows her to a super-modern TV studio cube located smack dab in the middle of Amish country through lobbies as humbling as cathedral pews and then into a pitch meeting in a glass box culminating in a tour of the main studio floor a rotating set with mock-ups of kitchens and living rooms with an audience of call operators arranged in a grid.Here it feels as though all of the movies motifs are coming to a head. Opening with a confrontation from a cheesy black-and-white soap opera (returned to throughout the movie fashions and over-the-top plot lines updated accordingly) Joy loads itself up with stylized depictions of home and business all meant as commentary on its heroines messy real life paper houses blueprints a model train village a community-theater musical that QVC set dream sequences set within the reality of the soap opera. (Also featured cicadas whose life cycle lines up with the 17 years Joy has spent putting her future on hold.) Working an airline-ticket counter to support two kids Joy is literally the only thing keeping her household from falling apart paying bills and fixing pipes while doing what she can for TV-addicted mom Terry (Virginia Madsen in oversized drop-temple glasses) blue-collar dad Rudy (Robert De Niro) and Tony the ex whos still living in the basement when Rudys latest ex-wife-to-be comes to return him to the family as defective. Joy always has a stain on her blouse and shes always falling asleep in weird places (couch staircase etc.) which in a movie where domestic and interior life stand in for each other means that shes always having weird dreams. What she wants to do is manufacture patent and market a self-wringing mop with a removable head sewn out of a continuous loop of thread. Joy is like a portfolio of different movie pitches that all share the same premise one of them being a dysfunctional family comedy about a clan of fuck-ups who turn against the one member whos been keeping them solvent once she voices a dream of her own. (Its been said that a director gives everything away in their debut feature and then learns to shade it over time; Russells was about incest.) Its also a low-stakes send-up of corporate thrillers and a half-hearted media satire and a drama about a lower-middle-class woman in some indeterminate part of the 1980s and its full of zoomed-in slowed-down and mismatched shots and weird needle drops (including a snippet of the score to Dario Argentos Trauma) and audible camera noise. In one extended scene the background bends with the side effects of warp stabilizer used to digitally erase handheld motion. In other words Joy is its very own decrepit household of failures and deferred promises except that it lacks the figure that would keep it together which would be Joy herself. Lawrence is a compelling enough actor that it doesnt matter for a minute that shes a decade too young for the part but shes still playing what feels like a preliminary sketch. Perhaps gender has something to do with it; Russell writes stubborn and independent women but all of his completed features up to now have centered on neurotic men. (Nailed the other Russell project with a female lead was never completed by the director; left unfinished in 2008 it was released earlier this year as Accidental Love without his name or input.) From the opening title card to the narration by Joys grandmother (Diane Ladd) Joy never stops pointing out the fact that its a movie about a woman and that its specifically about a woman who doesnt need men to get things done even though its only in her one-on-one scenes with men that the movie is able to draw anything out of Joys character beyond an aura of being the only grown-up in a house supposedly packed with them. And in that scene in the QVC studio--which sometimes feels like Russell giving his take on 1960s Billy Wilder--Joy isnt alone. Theres a man there an executive named Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) who only appears in a handful of scenes but at this moment seems like hes giving voice to everything our heroine wants--that crass urge to sell and succeed and get high off the rush of watching the numbers roll in and seeing the suckers at home get hooked by phony call-ins. Joy could be about this just as it positions itself to be about plenty of other things. It has the expected grace notes namely Russells knack for getting actors in the zone and the fact that hes willing to move the camera harder than most of his contemporaries even if the reasons why it moves are mostly murky. But in the end as the abrupt epilogue (running through an entire movies worth of sidelined plot) jumps back to fake snow falling on a Texas sidewalk the lasting impression is of a movie that isnt about much aside from what it could have been. And for a film about dormant potential that seems almost poetically apt though ultimately unsatisfying. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Bradley Cooper David O.

Russells boisterous comic view--based on a true story--of an entrepreneurs conflict-riddled rise to success. Jennifer Lawrence stars as a divorced young mother on Long Island whos in a rut. Smart creative and handy she works at an airport counter and copes with her divorced parents (Virginia Madsen and Robert De Niro) her fathers new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) her bitter half-sister (Elisabeth Rohm) her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) and her supportive but ailing grandmother (Diane Ladd). Overwhelmed by a Cinderella-like burden of chores Joy designs a new kind of mop finds an investor and is thrust into the predatory world of attorneys and executives. Russell who wrote the script and co-wrote the story with Annie Mumolo captures the magical moment when Joys private inspiration finds public expression; the movies best scene features Bradley Cooper as a TV executive who shows Joy the ropes. The core of the film is Joys mastery of the killer instinct her deft plotting of bold confrontations. Russells portrait of Joy stints on intimacy but her self-realization in response to crises is thrilling.

Photo Courtesy Twentieth Century Fox In the raucous comedyA JoyA the writer-director David O. Russell breaks with his habit of spreading the love among many characters and actors and concentrates on trying to build a pedestal to his frequent leading lady Jennifer Lawrence. This works well until the pedestal is completed and looks dismayingly like ... a pedestal. Russell is meant for more ramshackle precarious structures. As American cinemas foremost poet of disequilibrium he has a gift for fusing psychodrama and screwball keeping most of the formers bite while letting the latter dance. At first Joy seems to be the perfect milieu for him. The title character has gone from a young girl whose mind was teeming with ideas for inventions to a bedraggled single mom living with a glazed mother (Virginia Madsen) who wont leave her bedroom and is glued to a peculiarly repetitious soap opera thats an absurdist cartoon of the movies main drama. Her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) has never moved out -- he lives in the basement -- and her father (Robert De Niro) moves back in after hes dumped by his second wife. The only balm in her existence is her grandma (Diane Ladd) who narrates the film and longs for Joy to free herself from this domestic morass. Related Stories Will Joyas Mixed Reviews Hurt Jennifer Lawrenceas Oscar Chances? New Joy TV Spot Jennifer Lawrence Still Lives With Her Parents Theres a wonderful three-ring-circus quality to life in the house but its also corrosive to the soul. It makes Joy forget who she was who she is. Driven to re-create herself she devises a mop with a handy squeeze mechanism; pleads (and pleads) for start-up cash from her fathers new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) a wealthy but irritatingly smug widow; and talks her way into the headquarters of the burgeoning QVC network persuading a sympathetic (but all business) executive (Bradley Cooper) to give her mop a shot. Watching Lawrence trip over one obstacle after another and pick herself back up reminds you why shes such a marvelous comic and dramatic actress She can illuminate the struggle amid chaos to cultivate an inner stillness. This makes her the perfect muse for Russell a director famous for flying off the handle and then ostentatiously meditating -- a Buddha with a hair trigger. Its his life quest to find the signal in the noise but fortunately for us the noise holds its own. Joy finds its rhythm when the desperate Joy becomes the on-air salesperson for her own invention managing to exploit the brand of capitalism that previously held her back -- and loses it shortly thereafter when the movie becomes the story of all the crooks and parasites who take advantage of or cheat her. It hits its low point in a long scene in which her family (including a shrewishly undermining half-sister) take her apart so relentlessly that they seem demonic. She becomes a fighter -- and then a saint of capitalism. I dont think Russell has ever directed a scene as phony as the one in Joys office where she shows her abiding beneficence to a sweet young African-American couple. Equilibrium makes Russell a dull boy. A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Joy. Directed by David O. Russell. Fox. PG-13. This article appears in the December 14 2015 issue ofA New YorkA Magazine.

Russell in theaters Dec. 25. Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The sort-of life-story of Long Island inventor Joy Mangano creator of the Miracle Mop.CAST Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper Edgar RamirezRATED PG-13LENGTH 204BOTTOM LINE Fact and fiction mix with uneven but entertaining results in the latest from the ""Silver Linings Playbook"" crew. ""Joy"" is an ode to the American dream and more important the American housewife starring a dependably steely Jennifer Lawrence as a version of Joy Mangano the Long Island mother of three whose design for the self-wringing Miracle Mop turned her into a multimillionaire. Unlike Manganos invention ""Joy"" is a bit unwieldy and hard to get a handle on. At its best though its a smart funny sensitive portrait of the kind of woman whose role in both film and life is often ignored. Directed by David O. Russell who co-wrote with Annie Mumolo (""Bridesmaids"") ""Joy"" introduces its heroine as a woman stumbling on lifes treadmill. Shes a dutiful daughter to her semi-lunatic parents (Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen both terrific) and breadwinner for her children and rather likable ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez). Grandma Mimi (Diane Ladd) provides unnecessary narration but the films early scenes vividly illustrate Joys exhausting existence. ""Im just going to close my eyes for a bit"" she says then sinks into the comatose sleep of the woman who does it all. Even playing a doormat though Lawrence conveys Joys inner toughness; we know well see it soon enough. advertisement | advertise on newsday Using her daughters crayons Joy (no relation to Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano) designs her now-famous mop then hits up her fathers girlfriend (a beguilingly strange Isabella Rossellini) for seed money. The growth of Joys homespun business a mess of patent laws and shady manufacturers is fitfully entertaining but ""Joy"" hits its stride with the arrival of Neil Walker an executive at the fledgling home-shopping channel QVC who gives Joy her life-changing chance. Walker a blue-eyed true believer in capitalism played by a compelling Bradley Cooper vocalizes some interesting ideas about American democracy commerce and social mobility.

The film has its laughs but none come at Joys expense. Lawrence plays her with grit and mettle something shes famous for both on-screen (""The Hunger Games"") and off (as a proponent of equitable pay for women in Hollywood). Although ""Joy"" cant quite decide what it wants to be -- the studio insists its not a biopic though clearly its not not one -- we never doubt the determination and inner strength of Joy herself.

"Joy doesnt clean up well despite Jennifer Lawrence - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Joy review Miracle Mop drama doesnt clean up well despite Jennifer Lawrence Joy Twentieth Century Fox Jennifer Lawrence in ""Joy."" Jennifer Lawrence in ""Joy."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Joy stumbles even with Jennifer Lawrence directed by David O. Russell The marketing campaign for the new David O. Russell film ""Joy"" starring Jennifer Lawrence has been extremely nervous about bringing down the party with the word ""mop."" Mops traditionally do not sell at the multiplex. Mops traditionally are what clean up the multiplex.But mops are central to the narrative in ""Joy"" and theres no way around it. Miracle Mop inventor and entrepreneur Joy Mangano a working-class Long Island striver whos now a multimillionaire in the realm of Home Shopping Network infomercials serves as the subject of Russells ninth feature (if you count the long-shelved ""Accidental Love""). Russells previous three pictures ""The Fighter"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"" constitute a remarkable string of films that were A) popular; B) competitive in the awards season; and C) really good. ""Joy"" breaks the streak unfortunately though by now writer-director Russell has earned the right and the privilege to stumble and then go on making unconventional mainstream movies with terrific actors.This ones an uncertainly stylized success fable narrated by Joys grandmother (Diane Ladd) revealing in its hectic early scenes a young girl (Isabella Crovetti-Cramp plays the young Joy) determined to construct things and make her mark without becoming the woman on some mans arm. ""I didnt need a prince"" she tells us. She just needed her chance. After inventing a retractable dog collar only to see the Hartz version zoom on the sales charts instead Joy vows to retain control of her creations. Years later bingo the retractable self-wringing mop made of sturdy plastic and far less icky to use than mops that came before it. This mop becomes the means to a happy end. Bradley Cooper plays the QVC executive who backs her then becomes her business adversary. Robert De Niro is Joys dad whose auto body shop is converted into a makeshift factory. Isabella Rossellini is the De Niro characters paramour and Joys backer. Joy trailer The trailer for ""Joy"" starring Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper.

Then the movie hacks its way through backstage dramas involving patent controversy unscrupulous business partners and impediments to Joys destiny. Edgar Ramirez portrays Joys ex-husband and near-constant friend and supporter. Virginia Madsen has too little to do as Joys wreck of a mother obsessed with the soaps worried about everything.""Joy"" does play like a movie of the moment Its about a woman who deals with a massive wall of male skepticism and derision and takes care of business. Lawrence is very good in the role as far as the role goes. But the script never jells; the comedy feels forced and mechanically boisterous particularly in the crucial early passages. And in the final 30 minutes its a dangling mess. If only 1980-era Jonathan Demme the Demme of ""Melvin and Howard"" had gotten hold of this story Then again at his best Russell is his own kind of ensemble wizard. This movie feels as if it got away from him. Audiences may buy it anyway; Lawrences extraordinary ease and skill never hurt. Im not sure if hiding what the movies actually about in the trailers was the smartest idea. On the other hand an affordable and cleverly designed mop will never be an easy sell in a universe where ""Star Wars"" is batting cleanup.

Russell breaks down the new Joy trailer Jennifer Lawrence on the Joy of working with David O. Russell David O. Russells films are filled with seekers and strivers and lovable misfits--American hustlers working hard to carve out their own oddball corner of the dream. Even for them though a movie about a mop might feel a little quixotic. Working once again with muse Jennifer Lawrence Russell aims to adapt the real-life tale of Joy Mangano a plucky but overwhelmed single mother whose falling-down house can barely contain her dysfunctional family. Her curdled Casanova of a father (Robert DeNiro) grudgingly shares the basement with her unemployed ex (Edgar Ramirez) while her catatonic mother (Virginia Madsen) loses herself in daytime soaps and her hostile half-sister (Elisabeth Rohm) seethes in various corners. But Joy has ideas you see; shes always been a smart girl and a messy incident on the sailboat belonging to her fathers latest paramour leads to a Eureka moment A highly absorbent hands-free Miracle Mop designed to liberate housewives like her from linoleum drudgery. Cue the rocky but triumphant climb from double-mortgage penury to TV stardom on the then-nascent QVC. (Thats where Bradley Cooper fairly uselessly comes in.) If only Russell trusted Manganos true story. Instead hes turned her life into a over-staged mess of awkward exposition contrived dialogue and characters so willfully unreal they feel acrylic. Lawrence is once again ridiculously young for the role (Mangano was nearly a decade older at the time) but also much better and more natural than the noteless part shes forced to play. She cant save a turkey though; in a season rich with cinematic options--Star Wars Sisters The Revenant--this is not the joy youre looking for.

Russell on Set of Joy First Look at Robert De Niro as Zac Efrons Dirty Grandpa (Photo) Hollywood Star Power Fizzles With Sandra Bullock Vin Diesel Bradley Cooper Box Office Bombs Peter Jackson to Direct Dr. Who Watch Announcement Starring His Daughter His Oscars and Peter Capaldi (Video) Actress third collaboration with David O. Russell has the ambition of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"" but is undone by script and tone problems For fans of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"" part of what made those David O. Russell films so thrilling was the bravado of the writer-directors storytelling skill. As the plots made bold shifts in tone and the characters uttered stylized yet thoroughly quotable dialogue audiences often held their breath to see if the auteur could get to the finish line without having these brilliantly fragile creations collapse. Russell hopes for a Jennifer Lawrence hat trick with ""Joy"" but unfortunately this time his delicate balloon pops. Its a movie about a harried single mother rediscovering her creativity and about the birth of QVC as the ultimate melding of retail and show biz and about one brave persons fight not to be exploited by the world of commerce but Russell (who shares story credit with ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo) doesnt quite figure out how to tell these stories concurrently or even consecutively resulting in a pile-up of characters and incidents and emotions that never satisfyingly coheres. See Video Jennifer Lawrence Is More Than Just an Unemployed Housewife in New Joy Trailer ""Joy"" is a biopic but not in that ""you wouldnt believe this if it werent true"" way as much as in a ""no writer would jam together these events if they hadnt actually transpired in some similar fashion"" way. Its the kind of movie where a narrator dies but still keeps narrating. One where pointless characters turn up to do and say the exact same thing in multiple scenes while other characters are established only to be jettisoned. And one where it means nothing that our heroine hits rock bottom because she fixes everything in the very next scene. Lawrence stars as Joy Mangano the inventor and entrepreneur whose gadgets and products are credited with putting home-shopping channels like QVC and HSN on the map. Hers is a quintessentially American success story; we first see her as a young girl creating fanciful worlds out of nothing but paper as her grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd) tells little Joy that she is destined to do great things. Also Read Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper Unveil Joy to Oscar Buzz But then 17 years transpire in which dad Rudy (Robert De Niro) leaves the family for another woman and mom Carrie (Virginia Madsen) takes to her bed and her soap operas. Despite being valedictorian of her high school class Joy skips college to help her fathers sheet-metal business as an accountant and she winds up marrying would-be singer Tony (Edgar Ramirez ""Zero Dark Thirty"") with whom she later has two kids. On her very last nerve -- Joys household contains the children Carrie Rudy (who moves back in after his girlfriend kicks him out) and Tony (still living in the basement after their divorce) -- a mopping accident inspires Joy to invent the worlds first wring-less mop. Its a great idea but every step toward getting it produced and marketed is a hassle from having to borrow money from Rudys new girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) to enduring the haranguing of Joys bitter half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm ""American Hustle""). See Video Bradley Cooper Doesnt Know Anything About Guardians of the Galaxy or If He Just Spoiled the Sequel A glimmer of hope comes when Joy meets QVC chief Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) who imagines himself a mogul along the lines of David Selznick or Louis B. Mayer. The channels first presentation of Joys Miracle Mop flops when the on-air host doesnt know how to use it but after she convinces Walker to let her go on camera herself to demonstrate and sell the product sales go through the roof. More money means more problems of course as much for ""Joy"" as for Joy. When the character transitions from put-upon mom and daughter to determined entrepreneur and beyond you can feel Russell grinding the gears. Its only Lawrences massive charisma and empathy that makes this fictionalized version of Mangano seem real and relatable. Certainly few other actresses could bridge two consecutive scenes where Joy first breaks down and decides that all her dreams were a waste of time only to then the next day outsmart her competitor and strut down the street like the queen of the universe. (Whatever emotional transition Joy has here is reduced to an apparently empowering self-haircut.) This hairpin turn is just one example of Russell zooming from one idea to the next in a way that reduces pretty much everyone in the movie -- all of whom are based on real people mind you -- into bizarre ciphers who exist only to move the plot along. We spend several scenes getting to know Walker for instance only to have him abruptly disappear until the end of the movie and we know that Tony has transitioned from selfish jerk to steadfast supporter only because the narrator tells us. Also Read How Jennifer Lawrence Prepped for Chris Pratt Sex Scene I Got Really Really Drunk Russell and his art direction team present a more realistically subdued version of the 1970s and 80s than the glorious caricatures of ""American Hustle"" -- which makes sense since these are working-class folk -- but they do get to go wild with Carries soaps starring some familiar faces sporting wildly ""Dynasty""-esque gowns. This is a rare misstep for Russell who in the past has sold us on all kinds of stories whether theyre as indescribable as ""I Heart Huckabees"" or as traditional as ""The Fighter."" Unlike his indefatigable heroine however Russell just cant seem to close the deal on ""Joy.""

TWITTER 12/25/2015 David O. Russells decades-spanning comedy stars Jennifer Lawrence as Joy Mangano who invented and personally marketed the Miracle Mop. For sheer wackiness and functional dysfunctionalism the family in the venerable farce You Cant Take It With You is given a good run for its money by the clan at the center of Joy. David O. Russells third film in a row to have the good fortune of starring Jennifer Lawrence is nominally a story of perseverance and tenacity over ridiculous odds but spends much of its time examining the paralysis caused by the myriad vicissitudes and irrationalities of its madly neurotic self-involved characters. That the film itself is nearly as chaotic as the clan it examines can either be regarded as an admirable artistic correlative or a crippling defect but the splendidly dexterous cast ensures that this goofy success story which could just easily be titled American Hustle 2 keeps firing on all cylinders in the manner of the writer-directors previous few outings. When a movie runs through four credited editors its usually a sign that somethings amiss be it in pacing narrative coherence tonal control and/or balance among diverse elements. All of these issues apply here but the combined energy determination and talent of Russell and his actors blast through the underbrush of unlikely plotting far-fetched coincidence and abrupt personality about-faces to keep the audience on the high road of willing disbelief that all this could be happening (it is based on a true story). Read more Roundtable Jennifer Lawrence Cate Blanchett and Six More Top Actresses The spirit of the great writer-director Preston Sturges and his both jaundiced and appreciative view of the extreme fluidity of American success and failure seems to hover over Russells shoulder as he lays out the roller-coaster life of Joy Mangano (Lawrence) across four tumultuous decades. The big turning point in Joys life and her major claim to fame is her invention of the self-wringing Miracle Mop which she launched and personally hawked on the QVC telesales network in the 1990s. Many if not most filmmakers (Sturges included) would have had great satiric fun with this but for Russell her achievement is as legitimate and challenging as any other in life -- including one might propose making a film; the same degree of tenacity and belief in oneself is involved. The outer trappings of Joys life could easily have been the stuff of pure farce but Russell more maturely and ambitiously pushes his enterprise in the direction of human comedy. Life as its always portrayed in his films is messy and complicated and rarely more so than with Joy. A hard-driving mother of two she resolutely presides over a family that includes two men her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) a hard-headed old-timer who runs a garage and ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) a Venezuelan would-be Tom Jones-style singer both of whom now live in the basement of a modest home that also includes grandma Mimi (Diane Ladd) in whose eyes Joy can do no wrong mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) a princess who has retreated into a non-stop emotional addiction to daytime television soap operas and sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) whose aggressive negativism casts a pall on all of Joys ideas. Joining the mix before too long is an Italian woman of means Trudi (Isabella Rossellini) who takes up with lifelong romantic Rudy and provides a welcome addition of grace and propriety. As the pic flashes back and jumps around in time Joy is established as a doer and creator who fills any vacuum created by others inaction a necessary trait if anything is to get done in this otherwise short-falling family. ""I dont need a prince"" she insists at a young age and indeed she gets along with Tony famously once she gives up expecting anything of him as a husband. At a certain point however after one too many setbacks and disappointments Joy momentarily collapses in apparent defeat. ""What happened to us?"" she pleads. ""I feel like our dreams are getting farther and farther away."" Read more Will Joy Return Jennifer Lawrence to the Best Actress Circle? Only from this low point can Russell start to burrow into his favorite theme and begin to construct another of his tales of self-reinvention. Once Joy fashions her homemade mop a simple device with the key component of a 300-foot cotton loop thats easily wrung out without a watery mess she obsessively but rationally pursues her goal of marketing it. Kicking her men out of the basement she makes her prototype asks Trudi to invest (a very fine scene) hires a small army of Latinas to assemble the product and begins her sales efforts by demonstrating them in a Kmart parking lot which doesnt last long. More productively she worms her way in to see QVC executive Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) who amusingly tells of having been hired by Barry Diller to build the business provides a nifty inside view of what the networks protocols are and ends by unexpectedly asking Joy the question she couldnt have even dreamed of hearing ""Can you make 50000 of these mops by next week?"" Although this may seem like the end of the rainbow to Joy its actually the dark side of the moon as myriad new obstacles are shoved in her path to success and self-vindication. The developments in the second half begin to illuminate what ultimately make the film seem somewhat arch and artificial which is that things keep bouncing from the highest highs to the lowest lows with little in between. And it happens across the board Both of Joys parents flip from utter misanthropy and negativity to the vicinity of bliss on the basis of new and highly unlikely romantic entanglements Neil shuttles between being hero and villain and a mystery man toward the end similarly exists only in extremes. Life may be a roller-coaster but the repeated sudden changes in fortune that repeatedly turn lives upside down in both directions come to feel increasingly artificial in the telling. As is always the case with Russells films the actors are all wired completely on their games. Once again Lawrence rises to the occasion and takes charge bringing to life a character who fights the fight for several decades and comes out on top. She reliably brings grit and conviction to her characterization but whats missing is the illumination of an inner emotional life even if it were just the acknowledgment that Joy has put a hold on romantic fulfillment. Both of her parents have been accorded this dimension credibly and even touchingly in the case of Rudy and very amusingly if not entirely convincingly with Terry. If Joy has ruled out amorous prospects it would be good to know more about her attitude. Read More Jennifer Lawrence on Her First Sex Scene ""That Was The Most Vulnerable Ive Ever Been"" De Niro moves beyond caricature to provide a full-bodied portrait of a skeptical man whose one great strength is an inextinguishable romanticism. Hes wonderfully matched by Rossellini who has seldom been this warm appealing and self-possessed onscreen. Both Madsen and Ladd are a hoot as distinctively eccentric women and Rohm is unsettling as a reliable purveyor of negativism. Ramirez engagingly reveals his limited characters sweet heart and soul while Cooper smoothly handles his quicksilver corporate showbiz character. West Dylan Thordson and David Campbells punchy score is complemented by some sharply chosen musical samplings which only partially papers over the pics many jumpy and abrupt transitions as it lurches through the years and the characters wildly changing life circumstances.

Russells Latest | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Joy Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 20 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of 20th Century Fox December 7 2015 | 0600AM PT The mop is miraculous. David O. Russells latest movie not so much. After wholeheartedly embracing the art of the con in ""American Hustle"" David O. Russell shifts gears and celebrates the virtues of honesty grit and can-do spirit with ""Joy"" a more constrained and significantly less inspired seriocomic romp cobbled together from the life of Joy Mangano the woman who invented the Miracle Mop and turned it into a home-shopping phenomenon. If a ""Eureka"" moment in the history of the household cleaning industry seems a less-than-intuitive premise for a mainstream feature film rest assured that Russell has stretched this heavily fictionalized material about as far as it could go though he stops well short of the screwball delirium and emotional liftoff he achieved in his recent string of triumphs. Despite another solid performance from Jennifer Lawrence anchoring Russells sincerely felt tribute to the power of a womans resolve in a mans world its hard not to wish ""Joy"" were better -- that its various winsome parts added up to more than a flyweight product that still feels stuck in the development stage. Much has already been made about the fact that Russell -- always a fan of sharply written exuberantly played female characters going back to ""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Flirting With Disaster"" -- has now written and directed his first picture centered wholly around a woman. Even in a year that has seen a refreshing uptick in distaff-centric Hollywood narratives (in front of the camera anyway) that virtue that should lend ""Joy"" some counter-programming heft opposite the more male-skewing likes of ""The Revenant"" and ""The Hateful Eight"" both also opening Christmas Day. And Lawrence presently sitting atop the box office in the fourth and final installment of the ""Hunger Games"" franchise should drive curious audiences toward this welcome alternative showcase for her ever-expanding range as an actress. Theres a touch of ""Erin Brockovich"" and a smattering of ""Mildred Pierce"" in the story (credited to Russell and Annie Mumolo) of a smart resourceful working-class single mom defying considerable odds to seize her entrepreneurial moment and meeting with shaky support and stubborn resistance from her family and outsiders in the process. And Russell unspooling this rags-to-riches fable in a tone of mocking affection riffs on two of the storytelling modes that have been historically and often disparagingly reserved for women the fairy tale and the soap opera. Unfolding mainly in an unspecified Rust Belt town during the 1980s and 90s the movie frames its heroines story with an amusing sendup of a long-running daytime TV serial (populated by such game Emmy-winning icons of the medium as Susan Lucci Laura Wright and Maurice Benard) while the gentle storybook narration of Joys beloved grandmother Mimi (the great Diane Ladd another soap veteran) bobs and weaves in and out of the narrative. Mimi has long been a pillar of strength for Joy (Lawrence) and a necessary counterweight to the influence of her long-divorced parents both of whom are decidedly in their own worlds. Her shut-in mother Carrie (Virginia Madsen) spends her entire life in bed her eyes glued to the aforementioned show and her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) is a much-married blue-collar crank whos just been dumped by his latest squeeze. With nowhere else to turn Rudy moves into Joys already crowded house crashing in the basement along with Joys ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) a hunky Venezuelan singer with whom she has two young kids. In short its another of Russells classic fractious families the sort of bickersome clan that leaves the floor covered in broken crockery in the first five minutes of screen time and the movie has fun using strategically positioned dream sequences and flashbacks to illuminate how Joy got to this difficult point -- and how she might move past it. She may be the glue holding together this tangled mess of dysfunction but Joy is destined for greater things than working with her mean-spirited half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) at their dads auto shop -- something shes instinctively known since she was a young girl (played by Isabella Crovetti-Cramp) cutting and pasting together intricate paper dioramas in her bedroom. And that long-dormant creativity re-emerges when she has to mop up an unusually messy spill one afternoon handily demonstrating that necessity is the mother (rather than the father) of invention In one enchanting sequence Joy uses her daughters crayons to draw the preliminary blueprints for a plastic-handled self-wringing mop the only product of its kind that customers will ever need to buy. The words ""Miracle Mop"" -- or ""Mangano"" for that matter -- are never actually uttered here suggesting that ""Joy"" is unfolding in roughly the same realm of altered names composite characters rejiggered time frames and loosely fact-inspired truthiness that begat ""American Hustle."" Yet despite the air of lightly comic exaggeration that attends the whole enterprise theres a certain hard-edged rigor to the way Russell lays out the innumerable challenges of launching ones own business. Joy is fortunate to have a begrudging source of capital in the form of Rudys wealthy new squeeze Trudy (a delightful Isabella Rossellini) who locates a sketchy California company willing to manufacture parts on the cheap (or so they think). But then theres the problem of distribution as Kmart and other retail stores prove unwilling to devote floor space to such an expensive (19.95 a mop) and potentially game-changing product. The movie hits its stride at least temporarily when the ever-helpful Tony lands Joy a meeting with Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) an executive for the TV network QVC -- at the time a relatively new commercial phenomenon that allows celebrity sellers (including Joan Rivers played by her daughter Melissa) to bring the latest merchandise directly into their customers homes. (This subplot allows the Fox production to plunder some of the studios corporate history including references to former chief Barry Dillers acquisition of QVC.) And Cooper who achieved such arresting live-wire chemistry with Lawrence in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" downplays effectively here as a cautious mild-mannered business-first type who spends most of his screen time patiently teaching this novice the rules of the call-in commerce game. But Joys confidence ultimately persuades Neil to put not only the product but also the inventor herself on the air paving the way for a suspenseful even blissful comic payoff in which we see this hard-working self-starter come fully and radiantly into her own. These scenes find an ideal balance between self-fulfillment comic fantasy and gritty workaday realism and ""Joy"" benefits from its focus on the mundane; its a marvel how much quiet emotion Lawrence manages to wring so to speak as she speaks lovingly about her mop and its unprecedented 300 feet of super-absorbent hand-coiled cotton. But after that peak the movie begins to flatten out as Joys ever-shifting fortunes tug her this way and that while a succession of broken promises and cruel betrayals lead her from overnight sales success to the brink of bankruptcy before her eventual rebirth as a new kind of familial and corporate matriarch. The swift tidy reversals that bring the story to its fairy-tale conclusion feel unpredictable yet also somewhat arbitrary and Russell seemingly uncertain as to when to call it quits seems content to end things on an optimistic shrug. The aim seems to have been to weave various familiar Russellian elements -- offbeat comedy familial discord wheeling-and-dealing chicanery and a playful hint of make-believe -- into a loving testament to the ways in which women survive and thrive even in a world actively devoted to keeping them in their place. But at a certain point ""Joys"" grand ambitions and feminist underpinnings cant disguise the essential lack of dramatic purpose or direction at the movies core. Russell is known for finding his fast frenzied movies in the cutting room a tactic that has rarely let him down in the past but the same brilliance eludes him here. With no fewer than four editors credited you have to wonder if the continual whittling and reshaping of scenes ultimately whittled away what was most interesting about Joy Manganos story in the first place. (Mangano is credited as an exec producer here.) In ""American Hustle"" the narrative hiccups and evasions felt of a piece with the movies madly dissembling improvisatory spirit; it was a movie about the exhilaration of self-reinvention that got by on pure rambunctious rhythm and attitude. But ""Joy"" in celebrating a figure known for her gumption and perseverance feels tamer blander and less certain of its footing. The rhythms are slightly off from the start and try as he might Russell cant quite unlock either the grand human comedy or the gritty working-class melodrama within. And Lawrence such a blazing revelation in ""Hustle"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" gives a performance thats easy enough to root for but much less jagged and distinctive than her earlier work; always flinty emotionally accessible and pleasurable to watch she nevertheless seems to be embodying some vague free-floating spirit of sisterhood rather than a character we feel weve come to know intimately by movies end. In a similar vein the supporting cast doesnt have quite the same snap and cohesion weve come to expect from Russells earlier multi-Oscar-nominated ensembles. Rohm in particular has been either misdirected or miscast as the competitive older sister whose attitude toward Joy feels needlessly antagonistic and one-note. But the other actors fare better even when their various comic non sequiturs feel a bit shoehorned in; Madsen and Rossellini have endearingly loopy moments De Niro knows the lovable-curmudgeon routine inside out; Dascha Polanco steals a scene or two as Joys unswervingly loyal best friend; and Ladd simply makes you grateful to see her in her first significant big-screen appearance in years. Cooper can still generate enough of a spark with Lawrence to make you wish he had more screen time though her truer partner here is Ramirez as Charlie -- a winsome Desi to her Lucy offering genial evidence that amicable divorces make for the most enduring friendships. At the very least ""Joys"" contribution to the understaffed ranks of supportive on-screen husbands has to count as progress of a sort. Film Review JoyReviewed at Fox Studios Century City Calif.

Russells fault. Before I ever saw the film I read the 1st draft of the JOY script from 2013 written by Annie Mumolo... and it made me cry on page 80 it had everything it had a coherent story beautifully designed characters and a classic tearjerker moment or 3 and I loved it. When I screened the film I felt like I was on acid for the first 30 minutes after all how could the God we know as David O Russell (who made me cry with Silver Linings) have made a murky confused wretched story with pointless peripheral characters an idiotic and bizarre fictional soap opera thread and even coax the creepiest performance ever given by Isabella Rossellini? I must be on acid its much more plausible an explanation... I cant be seeing what Im seeing some of the best talent in Hollywood being utterly wasted as they collect big bucks to do this absolute tripe. It left me pissed off I can tell you. IF you want to see JOY and truly enjoy it you will have to see it in your head by reading the original script. For me Im just glad I read the script first before David O. got ahold of it and tried to turn it into Citizen Kane complete with the murky film noir look and even pulling Joys personal Rosebud (childhood symbol) out for the last scene. Horrendous. Lets hope he got it out of his system and next time isnt so eager to disembowel a near perfect script in favor of one he can put his own name on Heres the link to the script I read you can read it now but be warned... it will make you mad to see the film that wasnt made including a fantastic female supporting role that was cut entirely Joys friend amp; partner Ronnie and without the awful and maudlin narrative voiceover of the Grandmother who doesnt even exist in the original screenplay. To see the hatchet job David O. did on the script turned in by Mumalo you have to wonder if he thinks JLaw is the only woman who should shine in his films and that Hollywood benefits by throwing away great female roles... Ok youve been warned Reply Ray Pepi says December 25 2015 at 1103 pm I thought Justin Changs review was fair even generous but I didnt think much of the movie in spite of the obvious big effort; it pains me to imagine how much money thought and craft went into it. The problem is the story (and I am not belittling the invention of the mop); its ok for characters to be grotesque or dysfunctional but there doesnt seem to be any point and it does no justice to Joy Manganos actual achievements-whatever they might be-I learned nothing about her really. Joy (the movie) was not with fluky exceptions funny or inspiring or even campy just rather sad. The excellent cast (they should all win awards for extracting anything from such dreck) has to work with damaged material; there is a sense of isolation maybe intended but they just seem to be speaking non-sequiturs or staring at each other without any thread penetrating the awkward silences. It is cinematic elision lost meaning. The themes feel patronizing and predictable with unsatisfying foundation or development. Even the central event of Joys life invention of the mop-are we really honoring a mop sold on QVC?- the bar has officially been lowered-her grand idea just seems to pop into her brain after some bogus premise and before you know it she is unjustly man-handled by all the injustices of mean in-laws and sinister business partners its tiring; and the end (it does end) came with the predictable conquest of her adversary trivialized with some bogus legal double talk. Maybe they should have called it Misery. The best thing I can say about the movie is that I tried to fall asleep and couldnt but I want those two hours back. Reply Joy Grey says December 24 2015 at 405 pm What seemingly started as an interesting introspective review soon wound down to the boring self absorbed dribble expected from a reviewer enamored by the ""Industry"" How ""UN-refreshing"" Reply Anonymous. says December 8 2015 at 416 pm American Hustle was an overrated piece of crap of a movie. Joy looks almost no different than any of his three previous films. Also re-using the same actors over and over and over doesnt really help at this point. This needs to be the last time Russell makes a film starring Lawerence Cooper and De Niro. At the very least make the next two films with different actors for a change. Personally I think his recycling of casting members is a testament to how difficult and an asshole Russell is to work with. Reply Cecil B Devine says December 8 2015 at 820 am After Three Kings I knew Russell had a great film in him. When the hell is going to get to it? Reply alice prentiss says December 7 2015 at 725 pm The trailer is so vague and pointless rarely a good sign that the film has much to offer. Reply joblo says December 7 2015 at 454 pm Funny how most of the negative comments here are from people (ppl) who havent seen the movie. Reply Caliann says December 7 2015 at 241 pm The gazillions of women who shop QVC and LOVE Joy Mangano products will pay the big bucks to see how she did it - and how they could do it too. ""Be the next Joy"" is the only dramatic purpose this film needs. A great performance by Jennifer Lawrence - frosting on the cake Reply Books n Cheese (booksncheese) says December 7 2015 at 211 pm lets be honest who really thought a movie about the invention of a mop be interesting? even without seeing this movie yet I expect it to reek with white feminism and even backhanded misogyny like all other David O Russell films. Reply Chris says December 7 2015 at 1137 am Im was not excited for this. It looks like youre standard current-Russell fair. Lawrence was once again miscast by Russell. Reply James says December 7 2015 at 1126 am Looks like a load of pretentious rubbish. Reply tlsnyder42 says December 7 2015 at 1112 am Baloney review This is a great movie celebrating American free market capitalism. And surprise Theres hardly any foul language in a David O. Russell film. Imagine that Definitely one of the best movies of the year. Reply carterfrancis says December 17 2015 at 933 pm America isnt a free market. Reply Marie says December 8 2015 at 1056 am Its only baloney because the writer of this review doesnt agree with you. Reply stevenkovacs says December 7 2015 at 1038 am Ill be happy to see Joy on Christmas Day Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says December 7 2015 at 1016 am The premise here not the theme always seemed suspect. Some film ideas should remain an idea. The theme reminiscent of ""Winters Bone"". J.Law will do any film with Russell. Maybe she shouldnt. Critics loved ""Bone"" but its a slog. ""Joy""...? Reply tlsnyder42 says December 7 2015 at 1113 am WINTER BONE was excellent. Not a slog at all. Reply glimmer says December 7 2015 at 943 am So other than comparing it to the directors earlier films this review seems to try extraordinarily hard to find something critical to say that cannot be narrowed down. Im willing to bet the film is quite interesting if a critic has to try so hard. Reply GKN says December 7 2015 at 1043 am My impression too It sounds like there are a lot of interesting angles to this ""less-inspired romp."" Ill try to see it. Reply tlsnyder42 says December 7 2015 at 1117 am Its a feel-good movie with pro-capitalist values. Todays nihilistic grumpy excuse for a movie critic these days will hate it. Im tired of ""gritty""; todays critics love to depress moviegoers with it even destroying comic book movies with the darkness of their hearts when comic book movies should be fun first and foremost.

He could just as easily have borrowed the opening line from his last film American Hustle - Some of this actually happened. Joy is loosely based on the life of Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) the Long Island single mom who in the early 1990s invented the self-wringing Miracle Mop and became a shopping channel superstar. Cinema is full of American dreams stories of men battling to build empires. This is a film about three generations of women. It has some of the macho stuff the nostalgic voiceover Scorsese-style by Joys grandma (Diane Ladd); Creams I Feel Free blasting out; and it ends with Joy sitting behind a giant Ive-made-it desk like Don Corleone. But Russell also mixes in elements of kitsch soap opera allowing the dialogue to tip over in bigger-than-life melodrama. Only he could pull off a film with one foot in daytime TV and the other in Goodfellas. Joy is brilliantly feminist - written by Russell and based on a story by Annie Mumolo who co-wrote Bridesmaids with Kristen Wiig. We first see Joy as a little girl making a fairytale forest kingdom out of paper. All thats missing is a prince says her sister - I dont need a prince. Later Joy meets Bradley Coopers TV exec the boss of the QVC channel that will make her a star. Both their hearts skip a beat - but this woman does not have time for that. Joy is too busy building her business raising her kids and managing her outrageously misbehaving relatives. And no one does black comic family dysfunction like Russell. Joy is surrounded by a ludicrously neurotic clan. Best of all are Robert De Niro and Isabella Rossellini who make a deliriously funny double act as Joys womanising dad and his rich Italian girlfriend. But its Jennifer Lawrence who is irresistible. This is her third film with Russell (after Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle). You can imagine other Hollywood stars in the role with their slumming-it faces. But Lawrence is gritty real and totally genuine. And after Brooklyn and Carol heres another film that passes the Bechdel Test for proper female characters with flying colours.

As I general rule I like Jennifer Lawrence and I cant fault her acting skills I just found the plot corny.  Definitely a chick flick - one Im going to flick past.  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 19 2016Chlo FoTastemakerFeaturedI was reluctant to watch this film when it first came out a film about a woman who designed a mop...sounds a bit naff. How wrong I was Jennifer Lawrence perfectly assumes the role of Joy a struggling divorcee and mother who is desperate to exercise her creativity to gain a better life for her family (despite their complete lack of respect for her). Robert De Niro also does a cracking job of playing her rather kooky father. This biopic will have you going through ups and downs with Joy as we follow the story of how she created the miracle mop and became a highly successful business woman. The style of the film differs from the standard biopic format in a way that perfectly complements her story -  and while a drama its peppered with humorous quirky moments that make it genius.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 7 2016Nicky GTastemakerFeaturedJoy felt true to the story behind it - it pulled a few heartstrings it made you want to slap a few of the characters but overall it was uplifting. Id heard mixed reviews - that the ending brought the film down that the script wasnt any good - so I was pleasantly surprised by the poignancy of this film. The ad-lib-style script and documentary style cinematography really brings the realness to life and I did find myself carried up and pulled down as Joy got thrown into both success and injustice in equal measure. Dont worry if you miss it at the cinema though itd be a good film for a girls night or family night at home.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 26 2016LilliTastemakerFeaturedJoy was a good film that gives you hope empowers women and just makes you come away feeling really positive.

It evolves around Joy Mangano story about following her dreams and creating her own business. Its definitely one not to miss and that shows us that sometimes a simple idea can change our lifes.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 24 2016Sarah JtastemakerFeaturedThis was a really emotional film much more so than I expected. I assumed (perhaps wrongly) by the title that it would be inspirational and motivational. Although it was in some parts most of the storyline was quite heartbreaking as it outlined the struggles and challenges faced by the lead character Joy. Although her perseverance was encouraging - I definitely thought that this bordered on a tearjerker. As a true story - I thought it was very captivating and well done.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 16 2016Jane G.TastemakerFeaturedMost of the reviews here are good but I dont like paying to go to the cinema to watch films without something gripping about them. Nothing in this film gripped me. No action suspence romance hilarity. Just a story being told. Reminded me of when I was in the states and saw Lifetime or Hallmark movies.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 15 2016PhotosbysoozTastemakerFeaturedJoy is a fantastic biographical film with a script based on a true story and like most of this genre a heavy sprinkling of poetic license thrown in.  The story itself played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence is an inspirational one with a few girl power moments tear-jerkers and hilariously quirky scenes - mainly of her kookie family. The story itself excels because of the simplicity of the life that Joy leads of the everyday struggles of being a single-parent trying to make ends meet whilst parenting your own parents too. Add to that half-sister rivalry and a rather selfish father who clashes his ex-son in law and you have plenty of scenes to capture your attention.But the main joy in this film is the simple rise to success of the lady herself and the idea that life can really turn on its head just when you think its hit rock bottom. With the story told in a refreshing fast paced and off-beat way (the portrayal of the family reminded me very slightly of The Royal Tenenbaums - remember that?) and a wonderful behind the scenes look at QVC - which I hope is accurate - the film offers a new look on an old tale of The American Dream. Overall this thoroughly entertaining heart-warming and in some parts true story about ""a woman that made a film about a mop"" should certainly clean up some awardsHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016TowersFeaturedI really loved this film based on a true story it epitomises the strength of character and determination required to become a successful entrepreneur. I also found it inspiring to see a 1990s divorced women strive to make something of herself and provide for her children against all odds sexism family arguments unscrupulous business men failed ventures and near bankruptcy.   Awesome - a must watch - 5 STARS  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016Rosie TStaff WriterFeaturedWhen I went into the cinema to watch this film I did not know what to expect of it to be honest. I hadnt read many reviews and didnt know entirely what it was about all I remembered is that when I had seen the trailer I thought i want to watch that although couldy actually remember anything else. The film had me captured the whole way through. Lawrence is an amazing actress and until this film I hadt really noticed such how great she is. In fact the cast are genius. Brilliantly cast brilliantly written brilliantly performed  such pour brilliance is Joy. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 11 2016Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedLiked Silver Linings Playbook. Loathed American Hustle. Loved Joy. Simple as. In this the third collaboration from director David ORussell and actors Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper all aforementioned people are forgiven the hideousness that was Hustle because everything about Joy is simply wonderful. The opening sequence might make you scratch your head for a moment but stick with it because as the film moves on all becomes clear. This is a woman not to be messed with and not to dismiss and if determination were a hat Lawrence wears it sharply smartly and with a jaunty confidence that will have you wishing she was your friend as you leave the cinema.Ive not always been the eponymous J-Laws biggest fan - I love her on screen even though in reality her cool girl persona can be grating - but here she is real and believable and she plays Joy plucky creator of the Miracle Mop with ease. She never uses her mistakes as excuses but instead deals with them head on and without ever asking for our sympathy even when we as audience members give it readily and we do particularly when her family are on screen...Robert de Niro and Isabella Rossellini are especially blood boiling.A fantastic soundtrack a tight script that more than passes the Bechdel test - OITNBs Dascha Polanco is so lovely youll just want to hug her - and a great working relationship with Bradley Coopers earnest QVC executive provide able support for this gorgeously inspiring and uplifting rags-to-riches tale. I cant remember the last time I rooted for a character so much and had such a fantastic time doing it...see it when youre feeling down and come out a changed person see it when youre feeling optimistic and come out ready to rule the world. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 9 2016Amy LTastemakerFeaturedI must admit that Ive come a little late to the Jennifer Lawrence fan club. However this movie really turned my perception of her around. I expected her to play a similar character as in the Hunger Games movies however while she still plays the strong determined woman her character in this film has a lot more depth. And she does it really well. I preferred the first half to the second in this film although it could have just been me getting tired that influenced my perception. I found the first half quick funny and unpredictable and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would not having heard much about the film beforehand. I felt that in the end the resolution was a little one-dimensional and I wasnt a fan of the final scene with Joy sat behind the desk however it may please those who enjoy a feel-good ending.All in all a good film to see and an especially enjoyable film to start the new year withHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 6 2016TheMixedMedicTastemakerFeaturedIf it features Jennifer Lawrence then Im in. This was my first movie of 2016 and a sure fire way to drum up some ambition and motivation leaving you with that anything is possible feeling. Bradley Cooper fans may be left feeling a little disappointed as he only really makes quite a limited camio. I also tried to read up more about the true basis of the story but it seems that Joy Managnos (the Miracle Mop founder on whom jennifer lawrences character is based) real biography is actually rather secretive and the original script that she wrote herself was completely abandoned and redone so I would take much of that aspect of the film with a pinch of salt. However this doesnt take away from the fact that its a great movie and one of the few I have been to where viewers loudly react unanimously to the frustrations that unfold on screen. If you are having a bad day then I suggest you go and watch this movie if anything it will make you feel grateful for the situation youre in or help you to feel that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 30 2015Sarah GTastemakerFeaturedWow So pleased to have seen this today. Not quite sure how the Picturehouse group has it before the general release date but great for me as a member.Id neatly got put off by the first trailer i saw but is was a great holiday watch. A modern day rags to riches facing and overcoming adversity tale. Its advertised as a bio pic as its based on the life of joy mangano but apparently its 50% true 50% invented Whatever the star studded cast in their dysfunctional relationships amp; characters and portrayal of everyday life are funny heart breaking and very believable. Jennifer Lawrence gives a glorious performance and I was so pleased to take my 2 young daughters to film featuring such female inspiration.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/joy-2016,200,joy40,joy,timeout

Russells Least Memorable Movie Review Jennifer Lawrence Excels in Joy But Its David O. Russells Least Memorable Movie Eric Kohn Dec 7 2015 900 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk READ MORE David O. Russell Opens Up About Joy If the title ""American Hustle"" werent already applied to another David O. Russell movie it could easily work for ""Joy"" which plays like the less memorable B-side to that earlier effort. The triumphant story of American dreamer Joy Mangano whose invention of the Miracle Mop in the early nineties saved her from toiling in obscurity Russells latest distinctive comedy-drama has the usual signposts of his skill An expertly written and performed ensemble piece it moves along with the vibrantly caustic tone of the filmmakers own invention. But in this case the material never quite keeps up. Another idiosyncratic story of middle class perseverance ""Joy"" tracks Mangano from her troubled childhood to her struggles living with her divorced parents and ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) in a crowded Long Island household. Its here that the busy-minded Italian-American woman conceives of an unorthodox solution to her restrictive lifestyle. While following her father (Robert De Niro in grimacing autopilot) on a date with his newfound squeeze (a wonderfully smarmy Isabella Rossellini) a shattered wine glass leaves her with bloody hands after she mops up the mess; in the aftermath Mangano whips up the concept for a cotton-headed contraption that can be wrung out hands-free. If the concept anticipates an age of constant innovation it also sets the stage for exploring a new era of marketing tactics as Mangano fights her way for a spot on the shopping network QVC to push her new idea to the masses on her terms. The high stakes gamble of Manganos mission and the way it risks alienating her from her entire family provide just enough material for ""Joy"" to maintain palpable levels of excitement as it builds to her initial success. At the same time theres a constant under-realized quality to the proceedings as if the filmmaker lacked sufficient material and stuffed the holes with his usual routine -- crowded scenes of brawling families with a combustible energy thats always endearing to watch even if it amounts to little on its own. The actual business history of Manganos rise interests Russell the least no matter how much the story mandates its central role. Rounding out the ensemble Virginia Madsen plays Manganos dazed mother who wastes her days away watching soap operas the absurd plots of which eventually invade Manganos dreams. This device along with the recurring voiceover narration of Manganos deceased grandmother stand out as compelling attempts to complicate the narrative strategy by digging into the mythological dimensions of American life overshadowing Manganos individuality. The message comes across but its marginalized by an obvious trajectory made evident from the opening moments with a title card announcing that the movie has been ""inspired by true stories of powerful women and one in particular."" Thats all well and good but having established Manganos inevitable triumph early on Russell never generates any real sense of peril. Instead ""Joy"" is loosely threaded together with slickly rendered sequences from various key developments in its subjects life Her courtship with her sweet-natured Latin American husband supportive advice from her close pal (a sage-like Dascha Polanco) feuds with her father and various legal spats. Lawrence amping up her typically zestful screen presence provides a better glue for holding these scenes together than Russells rambling screenplay. Ultimately ""Joy"" settles into an engaging plot involving Manganos trip to QVC where she confronts a pragmatic network executive (Bradley Cooper) and talks him in to giving screen time to promote her mop. As Mangano and her would-be collaborator circle the television studio and keep their eyes on the phones the movie generates a formidable intrigue around the nature of this risky process She knows she has something good but doesnt trust the system to sell it without her involvement so she fights to get in front of the cameras. Its an ideal outlet for the unflappable liveliness that Lawrence brings to every role. Of course she doesnt exist in a vacuum. Though Coopers performance feels too suave for its own good thats part of the reason his scenes with Lawrence work as Mangano calls the businessman on his disingenuous promises and forces her own plans on to national television. The platonic alternative to the pairs charming romantic chemistry in Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" this coupling marks one of several moments when ""Joy"" hints at a much stronger movie comprised of more than a few cohesive scenes. But such engaging tidbits give way to a rushed finale. Russell has never been Americas most daring filmmaker but he has constantly refashioned classic formulas with a jubilant ironic tone to brilliant effect. ""Joy"" by contrast has been clobbered by sincerity even as it often feels as though Russell had to grit his teeth to maintain the good-natured vibe. Arriving the same year that a botched Russell project taken out of his hands and retitled ""Accidental Love"" was dumped on DVD ""Joy"" at least fits within the particular confines of this distinctive auteurs style. But it reduces them to a clutter of ingredients in need of a unifying idea. Ending with a shrug ""Joy"" gives the impression that even Russell may have lost interest after a while. A sunny ode to capitalism the movie is a coy advertisement of its own. In that context its a whole lot better than one might expect and loaded with talent unabashedly hawking their wares. Grade B- ""Joy"" opens nationwide on December 25. READ MORE David O. Russell Explains His Mental Health Advocacy This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Awards Season Roundup Awards-2 David O.

I love J-Law but that trailer looked like Lifetime movie dreck. I find ORussell to be WAAAY overrated in this stage of his career. His earlier work was funnier edgier and a lot more interesting to watch. Reply Chris May 12 2016 332 pm I agree Jake something is wrong there a B- would certainly should not be a Rotten. Rotten is like a 5 of 10 Reply Jake May 12 2016 332 pm Eric Kohn rates Joy a B- why does Rotten Tomatoes have him rating the movie ""Rotten?"" Reply Pedro May 12 2016 332 pm With such amazing female performances this year I really hope Academy to not nominate Jennifer Lawrence for this replayed-role. I hope voters to remember about Regina Case in The Second Mother Rooney Mara in Carol (LEAD) Alicia Vikander Charlize Theron...all of those actresses are more deserving to complete the line-up alongside Cate Brie Saoirse and Charlotte. Reply Em May 12 2016 332 pm Tom Im quite sure that DOR is on the other end of the political spectrum. There was no need to insert that. I am a huge fan of DOR and I can admit that he can lack focus in his plotting. I loved the first teaser trailer for Joy but the ones released after that I could tell that the movie could end up indulging in his weaker areas. I will still go out and support the film. Hopefully he comes back with better. Reply Tom Snyder May 12 2016 332 pm This is a great movie. The reviewer probably hates it because its pro-capitalist and conservative and it doesnt attack the Catholic priest character. Reply mc adams May 12 2016 332 pm What the heck? I saw the movie and it was absolutely enjoyable i have no idea what people are looking for in this movie. Reply Grego May 12 2016 332 pm Supposedly the ending during the first test screening wasnt rushed. I read that test audiences had a problem with it. I hate hearing this kind of stuff.
