Eli Reed(c)Universal Pictures By Christy Lemire AP Entertainment Writer Ron Howard finally got it right. With ""A Beautiful Mind"" Howard achieves the balance that has eluded him for years in directing sappy feel-good movies such as ""Cocoon"" and ""Parenthood."" He manages to evoke genuine emotion from the audience without schmaltz. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is Howards best movie and easily one of the best movies of the year. It also features the strongest performance weve seen yet from Russell Crowe who proves increasingly more versatile with each role he takes. As tortured math genius John Forbes Nash Jr. Crowes transformation is stunning _ reminiscent of the one he pulled off two years ago in ""The Insider"" but even more effective because Nashs story is so much more personal. Its almost too bad that he won the best-actor Oscar last year for ""Gladiator"" because he deserves the award even more for his work here. Based on the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar ""A Beautiful Mind"" follows Nash from the late 1940s at Princeton where he studied mathematics with some of the worlds greatest minds through his battle with schizophrenia and ends in 1994 when his game theory earned him the Nobel Prize. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman takes some liberties with Nashs story; he condenses several characters and omits the fact that Nash had a mistress with whom he had a child for example. But Goldsman stays true to the basic course of Nashs life. With his West Virginia drawl manic tics and standoffish demeanor Nash stands out from his peers at Princeton. Hes almost proud of being anti-social and his sly subtle put-downs dont exactly endear him to anyone. When a classmate at a party mistakes him for a waiter Nash quips ""I imagine youre getting quite used to miscalculation."" His one friend is his charismatic British roommate Charles (Paul Bettany). Nash rarely attends class instead spending his days searching frantically for one truly original idea. The theory he eventually concocts about competition contradicts a century and a half of economic thought and earns him a research and teaching spot at MIT. One day government agent William Parcher (an appropriately mysterious Ed Harris) approaches him on campus and recruits him for a top-secret code-cracking project at the height of the Cold War. Soon afterward Nash meets the other most influential person in his life Alicia Larde (Jennifer Connelly) a student who will become his wife. Shes bold and self-assured; hes instantly intrigued in his own awkward way. He cant tell Alicia what hes doing for the government spending days scouring newspapers and magazines for codes he believes the Russians have hidden for each other. The project becomes his obsession but it becomes increasingly difficult for him to discern reality from imagination. He ends up in a hospital where Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) diagnoses him with schizophrenia. The saddest part of the movie is watching Nash struggle with his own mind; once his strength its now his liability. He recognizes when hes delusional and thinks he knows how to stop it _ its just like solving a math problem he figures. Aging on screen over a period of nearly 50 years Crowe turns Nash from a swaggering genius to a shaken shell of a man and the disintegration is believable and compelling. While this is Crowes movie Connelly stands equal as his devoted wife; Alicia stays married to the man she thought she knew until he once again becomes the man she knew she loved. Connelly has always chosen unusual roles in independent films; this performance should give her the recognition shes deserved all along. James Horners score provides just the right combination of the wonder of discovery and the hint of something sinister. And the cinematography from frequent Coen brothers collaborator Roger Deakins (he also shot their stunning black-and-white noir thriller ""The Man Who Wasnt There"") gives the film a dreamlike look perfect for delving into such a complicated topic as the human mind. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is rated PG-13 for intense thematic material sexual content and a scene of violence. runs 135 minutes. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

Share Tweet As a graduate student at Princeton in the late 40s John Forbes Nash Jr. developed the mathematical principles of ""Game Theory"" a breakthrough in modern economics that would earn him the Nobel Prize more than four decades later. For much of the interim Nash suffered from paranoid schizophrenia which ruined his marriage and pushed his already unconventional approach to mathematics into outright incoherence. ""Inspired"" by Sylvia Nasars biography of the same name perhaps because ""based"" means the filmmakers couldnt fudge as many of the facts A Beautiful Mind operates under more stable economic formulae buffing out the rough edges of Nashs story into easy-to-swallow inspirational swill. It would probably take a cracked genius to elucidate the workings of Nashs mind but director Ron Howard (Apollo 13 Ransom) has always hugged the middle of the road; his method for suggesting his heros brilliance is circling the camera around his head. But as much as Howards commercial instincts prevent him from getting inside Nashs faulty wiring they also keep the film running smoothly and agreeably driven by the force of Russell Crowes eccentric and inspired lead performance. Playing a physically stout but socially awkward misfit from small-town West Virginia Crowe bottles up his raging masculinity and suggests an inner weakling who looks genuinely uncomfortable within his hulking frame. Teased relentlessly by his peers at Princeton Crowe skips class and retreats into his active imagination working to find the ""governing dynamics"" behind the seemingly random movements of a touch-football game or a flock of pigeons on the school grounds. After earning the coveted Carnegie Fellowship for his revolutionary economic theory he takes a teaching and research position at MIT where hes occasionally called up by the Pentagon for his exceptional code-breaking skills. Around the time hes courting student and future wife Jennifer Connelly Crowe gets an assignment from government agent Ed Harris to look for Communist codes in popular newspapers and magazines. By far the most compelling section of the film Crowes covert activities are intensified by his heightened creativity and Communist paranoia which in turn causes his brain to play tricks on itself. But once his schizophrenia is spelled out in unbelievably pat terms A Beautiful Mind sinks into predictably bathetic triumph-over-adversity material. Its not a crime for the script to gloss over the thornier aspects of Nashs story--his not-so-steadfast wife his child out of wedlock his arrest for indecent exposure--but the film seems totally unconvincing squeezing a real life into a formula thats simultaneously more palatable and less interesting. If Howard placed Crowe in front of a piano hed be starring in Shine.

Both actors received Oscar nominations for their work in the film with Crowe receiving a best actor nomination and Connelly getting a best supporting actress nod. The film received a total of eight nominations including best picture. (ELI REED/AP) BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday December 21 2001 1200 AM A BEAUTIFUL MIND With Russell Crowe Ed Harris Jennifer Connolly. Directed by Ron Howard. Running time 135 mins. Rated PG. 3 Stars. Genius is a tough attribute to get across on the big screen but ""A Beautiful Mind"" has married it to the charisma of its star Russell Crowe in a way that makes it happen. The result is one of the most successful attempts to make math look sexy even if the movie strays - gallops really - from the details of the actual life of Nobel Prize-winner John Forbes Nash Jr. a mathematician on the edge. The Nash you see in Ron Howards Hollywoodized vision is hardly the Nash described in Sylvia Nasars meticulous elegant biography. Although both depictions acknowledge the central role that paranoid schizophrenia has played in the life of this gifted thinker the book spoke of an arrogant loner often immature and unpleasant. Nash fathered a child out of wedlock was confused about his sexuality was arrested for indecent exposure and was unable to form social attachments of any kind despite a rocky marriage to a former student. Not so the Crowe depiction of a dashing if unconventional numbers man who hung out with his fellow Princetonians and developed his prizewinning theory about comradeship in competition while picking up girls. When Crowe finally gives his Nobel acceptance speech decades later it is delivered with all the gravitas of an Oscar lifetime-achievement award. The intriguing script by Akiva Goldsman takes exceptional liberties - many justified - to explain Nashs math and the mental illness that kept him from further accomplishments for most of his life. The way Goldsman represents Nashs schizophrenia is particularly colorful although it does not shed light on his work or even on his delusions which involved space aliens and unified world governments. In the movie Nash uses a mind-overmatter approach to his illness a good metaphor but medically misleading. The movie is fast out of the gate but because most of Nashs adult years (hes now in his 70s) were spent dealing with mental illness it devolves into a series of scenes about symptom control and settles into a recognizable movie about triumph over adversity. However director Howard employs clever ways of showing the Nash world-view as when he scribbles equations on windows through which he cant see the trees for the forest. This is another brilliant performance by Crowe who is to body language what Meryl Streep is to accents. (The West Virginia accent he adopts early in the movie takes a beating in later scenes.) As a young man Crowes Nash is a bundle of tics and gestures. But he also has a slyly winning self-knowledge and diffidence that makes it easy to see why a student like Jennifer Connolly with looks to the nth power would go after him. ""I dont like people much"" he says and yet people flock to him. Maybe its because cocktail chatter for him is along the lines of ""Adam Smith was wrong - well incomplete"" In scenes where Nash is an older man shuffling around the MIT campus Crowe gets that lower slower center of gravity while Connolly in age makeup simply looks like a young woman dusted with talcum. Ed Harris plays an insinuating government agent who feeds Nash decoding assignments in a tricky subplot. Remember this was wartime and mathematicians were in hot demand by a government looking to build bombs and quantify war-game strategy. During Nashs time math was hotly competitive - as was Princeton the perfect place to stumble upon game theory that would change the way we look at war economics and politics. ""A Beautiful Mind"" captures that real excitement even though its mostly sheer fantasy.

The bean counters are smiling -- the studios are enjoying a record-breaking year at the box office. But was anybody else happy? By consensus 2001 has been deemed the nadir of Hollywood creativity (although it was a strong year for the American independents and for foreign films ). Will the holiday season finally bring on all those great Oscar-worthy movies weve been waiting for? Truth to tell not one of the films we survey here gets our top prize of five stars. But dont despair. There are four here we smile upon and at least four more end-of-the-year worthies ""Iris"" ""Gosford Park"" ""Monsters Ball"" and ""Lantana"" -- in the wings. Roll emA Beautiful Mind (2 Stars)Dec. 21Jan. 4Director Ron Howards approach to the problem of the biopic is totally different from ""Alis"" Michael Mann. How do you make a mainstream movie out of the life of a man whose activity is almost entirely mental--the brilliant Nobel Prize-winning schizophrenic mathematician John Nash? Screenwriter Akiva Goldsmans clever solution is to turn the story of a troubled academic into a Hollywood thriller. How? He makes things up.I have to be vague here or Ill spoil the big twist of Howards movie which uses every trick in the book to keep you in your seat. It succeeds but at a cost. We meet Nash (Russell Crowe) at Princeton in 1947. ""I dont like people much and they dont like me"" he explains accurately in his deep West Virginia drawl. (The timbre of Crowes voice eerily resembles Jerry Falwells.) Hes prickly arrogant and antisocial but he happens to be a genius. His overactive mind captures the heart of his future wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) one of his students. But his life takes a dramatic turn when hes recruited by a CIA agent (Ed Harris) to do top-secret work breaking Russian codes. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Nashs increasingly dangerous cold-war adventures keep things lively but they prove to be a mere diversionary tactic. The real story is how Nashs mind is engulfed in madness and his and Alicias struggle to rebuild his shattered career. Howard knows how to make a difficult subject go down easy. Maybe too easy. Though Crowe proves again what a gifted chameleon he can be and Connelly is outstanding ""A Beautiful Mind"" is too facile to resonate deeply. Shouldnt a movie celebrating Nash give you some idea what his mathematical work is about? Fishier still is the suggestion that the cure for paranoid schizophrenia is love. Howards movie is being touted as an Oscar contender--Hollywood loves these ""triumph of the spirit"" sagas--but in ""solving"" the dilemma of the biopic its turned a fascinating life into formula.The Royal Tenenbaums (3 Stars)Dec. 28In the antic melancholy comedy ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" the singular Wes Anderson (""Rushmore"") abandons his native Texas for a storybook vision of New York. The unhappy Tenenbaum siblings owe an obvious debt to J. D. Salingers Glass family. Former child geniuses they have fallen on spiritual hard times. The widowed financial wizard Chas (Ben Stiller) is an angry fear-driven father obsessed with the safety of his two sons. Anhedonic failed playwright Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) who was adopted cheats on her husband (Bill Murray) with drug-addled Western novelist Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis champ miserably achingly in love with his sister. At the core of their problems is their long-absent rogue of a father Royal (an inspired Gene Hackman) who returns to the family brownstone feigning cancer in a duplicitous attempt to prevent his estranged wife (Anjelica Huston) from marrying the dapper family accountant (Danny Glover).Andersons style is as eccentric as his characters his unforgettable scenes unfold with the stillness and formality of tableaux. (The Tenenbaums are like colorful extinct creatures in a museum diorama.) Bursting with quirky details and unexpected detours the movie is almost too clever for its own good the whimsy can become self-admiring and the stop/start rhythm makes it feel longer than it is. ""Tenenbaums"" doesnt quite jell but its a beautiful near miss. And at the end in a poignant and funny scene of reconciliation this oddball family romance finally becomes as endearing as ones idea of it.The Shipping News (3 Stars)Dec. 25Jan. 11Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) the zhlubby browbeaten protagonist of Lasse Hallstroms affecting if somewhat ungainly version of Annie Proulxs novel isnt your typical movie hero. After the death of his brazen unfaithful wife (Cate Blanchett) this born loser sets off with his daughter and aunt (Judi Dench) to start a new life in frigid faraway Newfoundland the home of his ancestors. ""The Shipping News"" is the story of his rebirth his discovery of self-worth. Like the best of Hallstroms films ""My Life as a Dog"" and ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" it has a fresh uncondescending appreciation of the lives of people far outside the mainstream.This was not a novel screaming to be made into a movie. You can feel screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs struggling to stuff too many goodies into a short space. The seams show. But the dialogue has wit and home-cooked flavor. The characters--Denchs life-hardened Aunt Agnis Julianne Moores Wavey a widowed single mom and the cranky staff of the village newspaper where Quoyle gets work as a reporter--resist stereotype. Initially Spacey seems miscast overplaying his characters hapless naivete. But as Quoyle begins to discover his future by coming to grips with his familys dark past both Spacey and the movie hit their stride. ""The Shipping News"" has a quiet sense of community a wry unsentimental sweetness that grows on you. Its a patient movie for impatient times.Black Hawk Down (4 Stars)Dec. 28Jan. 18Imagine if the Normandy-invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" went on for a hundred minutes instead of 20 and youll have some idea of the bloody harrowing intensity of Ridley Scotts movie. As brilliantly shot as it is brutally single-minded this is a war movie shorn of all its usual accouterments the battle is the plot. Following the blow-by-blow details in journalist Mark Bowdens book Scott and writers Ken Nolan and Steve Zaillian put you in the shoes of the Rangers and Delta Force soldiers who were sent into Mogadishu in 1993 to capture the lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. What was meant to be a quick and easy strike turned into an 18-hour nightmare that left 18 American soldiers dead many more wounded and resulted in the hasty withdrawal of our troops from Somalia.You barely get to know the men Josh Hartnett Tom Sizemore Sam Shepard Eric Bana William Fichtner and the rest of the fine cast express their characters solely through their actions. The African enemy is virtually faceless. Scott isnt interested in politics or flag-waving the heroism he depicts has nothing to do with a cause and everything to do with a soldiers reflexive instinct to protect his brother in arms. Its hard not to admire Scotts uncompromising vision and the craft on display--editing cinematography production design sound--is awesome. But the relentless ferocity is punishing. You leave this long movie feeling battered drained--and thinking about the soldiers in Afghanistan whose lives are on the line right now.The Majestic (1 Star)Dec. 21Director Frank (""The Green Mile"") Darabonts ponderous attempt to make a Capra-esque fable set against the background of the McCarthy-era witch hunts is remarkably consistent theres not a spontaneous moment in it nor one that isnt inspired by another movie. Jim Carrey whos never looked so at a loss plays a blacklisted (though apolitical) screenwriter who wakes from a car crash with amnesia and wanders into a small town where hes mistaken for a war hero long thought to be dead. (Does anybody work in this town? The entire population seems to spend its time standing in the middle of Main Street alternately cheering and vilifying our hero.) Michael Sloanes secondhand screenplay--which reaches its accidentally timely climax when our Jimmy Stewart-like hero passionately defends the First Amendment--feels like a student work and Darabont makes things worse by treating the audience like infants. He. Directs. Very. Slowly. I staggered out of this shameless interminable movie feeling as if Id been force-fed a ton of mealy artificially sweetened baby food.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Pic is consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness. Few mathematics geniuses have ever served as the subject of a major motion picture so John Nash now has broken the mold both in his own profession and as the unlikely hero of ""A Beautiful Mind."" Consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness this serious-minded but lively film is distinguished by an exceptional performance by Russell Crowe as the Princeton prodigy who was beset by schizophrenia in the 1950s only to conquer the disease and win the Nobel Prize in 1994. Although the true tale has been somewhat conventionalized by very familiar ""inspirational"" storytelling techniques to the point where the picture will make Nash as much of a folk hero as ""Shine"" did of David Helfgott the films effective blend of intelligence and emotion will reach all manner of audiences spelling a beautiful B.O. future for the latest entry in Ron Howards eclectic directorial resume. Like ""Shine"" this Universal/DreamWorks co-venture with Imagine Entertainment concerns a supremely gifted eccentric who after an early run of celebrated precociousness falls off the cliff but battles his way back with the essential help of a terrific woman. The same kind of film that worked cinematically the first time does so again with Howards approach more mainstream than Scott Hicks yet paradoxically more delicate and refined. Spanning 47 years and drawn from the well-received biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar Akiva Goldsmans astute and at a couple of points terribly clever screenplay begins with Nashs arrival at Princeton from West Virginia in 1947. Hardly normal Ivy League material but the recipient of the schools top fellowship young Nash is a socially maladroit misfit and unwashed nerd who is nonetheless oddly attractive even hunky. Refusing to attend classes or read assigned books Nash is seeking ""a truly original idea"" that will mark his breakthrough contribution in his field. Urged by his hard-drinking British roommate Charles (Paul Bettany) to get out once in a while Nash receives insight and inspiration from unexpected sources the movement of pigeons and the group dynamic of his drinking buddies in a bar when confronted with a blonde they all covet. Although the film tries to ""visualize"" his insights in amusingly reductive ways its impossible to really understand what this superbrain is up to. But were told that his penetrating paper on governing dynamics or ""game theory"" boldly challenges all economic theory of the past 150 years. By 1953 Nashs brilliance has been rewarded with a top position at MIT where he is joined by former Princeton classmates Sol (Adam Goldberg) and Bender (Anthony Rapp). He is also paged by a secretive Defense Department operative William Parcher (Ed Harris) who wants Nash to apply his special abilities to break Russian codes that Parcher insists are hidden in everyday newspapers and magazines. Thus begins Nashs immersion in espionage an exercise that sees him scanning and diagramming endless pages of newsprint looking for patterns and codes to emerge then making surreptitious drops of his findings at a mysterious mansion. Simultaneously hes pursued by one of his students the dark-haired beauty Alicia Larde (Jennifer Connelly) who knows what she wants and gets it (and God knows where Nash or his wife would be today had stringent politically correct rules regarding student-teacher relationships then been in effect). So just as Nash who Parcher praises as ""the best natural code-breaker I have ever seen"" is promoted to the most rarified levels of security clearance in an effort to thwart the detonation of a suspected nuclear device smuggled by the Russians onto U.S. soil the math whiz embraces a ""normal"" life by marrying Alicia settling down and fathering a child. But just as suddenly it looks as though the gig is up Nashs drop has been compromised. He and Parcher are pursued by faceless enemies and Nash becomes so jumpy and paranoid he wants to quit which his superior will not permit. Finally Nash becomes so unhinged hes carted off by a doctor (Christopher Plummer) who Nashs old roommie Charles insists is actually a Russian agent. Shortly past pics midpoint major revelations about Nashs condition are made to both Alicia who has been unaware of his activities and the audience and Nash begins conventional insulin therapy that is eventually followed by his resolve to battle a disease normally considered incurable. Remainder of the picture follows a more predictable arc filled with tough challenges tender moments and a few remaining surprises on its way toward what is presented as the Nashes serene and content old age. But theres the added kicker of the Nobel Prize seemingly awarded for the theories Nash worked out as a student years earlier that have since per an end-credits note ""influenced global trade negotiations national labor relations and even breakthroughs in evolutionary biology."" Nice as this footnote is it would be nicer still to have a few questions answered about the nature of Nashs work and his accomplishments. Was the prize really awarded entirely for work the mathematician had done decades before? Did he in fact revolutionize economic theory? And was the doodling we see him doing during subsequent years a furthering of his prior breakthroughs or a journey in fruitful new directions? On these matters alone the filmmakers have not honored their subject preferring not to challenge the audience with things it might not completely grasp rather than to try to make the cinemagoer understand the man more fully. Not to be faulted however are the performances which make the story of these rare birds come alive most sympathetically. Physically powerful but often awkwardly out of step clear-eyed but with his head in uncharted territory bashful but capable of surprising and even lewd outbursts and gentle but containing demons and danger Crowes Nash is a complete creation a strange and complicated individual rendered palatable and fascinating by a sensationally good actor. His regional accent wobbles at times but it doesnt particularly matter and Greg Cannom who handled the thesps transforming makeup on ""The Insider"" does a smashing job here that complements Crowes understated technique to make the actor utterly convincing as the aging Nash in the scenes set in the 80s and 90s. Connelly who made a jump from longtime sexy ingenue to compelling actress in ""Requiem for a Dream"" makes another major stride here with her warm smart and confident work as Alicia whose love for Nash is stretched to the limit but never broken. Harris is appropriately mysterious and demanding as the government operative engaged in very closely guarded activities and supporting players generally convince as characters bright enough to inhabit the upper echelons of academe. Stylistically Howard and ace cinematographer Roger Deakins keep the camera nimbly on the move and close to the actors. Editing by Mike Hill and Dan Hanley makes quick even bracing transitions at times and Wynn Thomas production design and Rita Ryacks costumes offer unobtrusive contributions to the sense of passing years. Especially notable is the work of James Horner a busy composer whose scores can often sound the same but who this time introduces some complex themes and musical dynamics that instantly suggest the presence of hidden mysteries in the story and its leading character.

Comments A Beautiful Mind All biography has a complex relationship to our perception of a life and this story about 1994 Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash doesnt address that complexity simply by admitting that its semifictional. We meet the character played by Russell Crowe in 1947 as a graduate student at Princeton where in one of the movies most gimmicky--and elegant--scenes he develops a theory that will revolutionize economics. Director Ron Howards deftness in suggesting the subjective experience of Crowes character whos later diagnosed with schizophrenia makes for inspirational narrative but certain plot points are so reductive that their relationship to the facts of any real persons life--let alone that of the nominal subject--becomes one of convenience. Akiva Goldsmans screenplay was based on Sylvia Nasars biography. 129 min.

Aug. 15 705pm Based on the novel by ANNIE PROULX | Produced by IRWIN WINKLER LINDA GOLDSTEIN KNOWLTON and LESLIE HOLLERANReleased by Miramax | Selected theaters | Opens December 25""Genius does what it must"" declared the minor Victorian poet Owen Meredith. ""Talent does what it can."" Few movies demonstrate this truth more nakedly than director Ron Howards uplifting biopic A Beautiful Mind the story of Nobel Prize--winning mathematician John Nash who spent a lifetime tiptoeing along the shadow-line between genius and madness.When we first meet Nash (played by Russell Crowe) as a grad student in late-1940s Princeton he seems to have leapt full-blown from the pages of an Ayn Rand novel. A driven loner he thinks university classes a waste of time belittles his colleagues intelligence and pushes himself to come up with a ""truly original idea."" And rather quickly he does -- a huge breakthrough in game theory. Nash has an unparalleled gift for uncovering hidden patterns (the inner logic of birds movements shapes formed by the stars) and this lands him a teaching gig at MIT. Its there that hes recruited by a shadowy intelligence officer (Ed Harris) who asks him to crack Soviet espionage codes hidden in newspaper headlines and its there hes pursued inexplicably by his future wife Alicia played by the ravishing Jennifer Connelly. But then just when Nash seems to have it made the patterns start exploding inside his head plunging him into hallucinations that threaten to cost him everything -- his work his marriage and his young son.The great crisis of Nashs life is that his most inspired ideas and his wildest delusions spring from the same unconscious core -- hes being destroyed by what makes him great. At once blessed and cursed expansive of intellect and churlishly self-absorbed Nash is the sort of unruly larger-than-life role that would appeal to any actor especially one so well-practiced at churlish self-absorption. But while Crowe may bear a surprising resemblance to the actual Nash -- they have the same bullish physique the same blunt good looks -- hes not altogether convincing as a 20ish math prodigy. His fussy little hand movements feel gimmicky. But once Nash starts going mad Crowe taps into that deep current of angry self-pity that fuels nearly all of his work. His performance gets richer and more heartfelt until finally as the geriatric Nash hes uncannily convincing.Not a little driven himself Crowe would run off a cliff for a movie. I wonder how he enjoyed working for a director whos forever clutching the guardrail of conventionality. Its not that Howard is incompetent but that his competence is deadening. He smoothes away all of lifes jagged edges and no matter what the story makes a beeline for the most obvious idea or emotion. Because Nashs story is extraordinary A Beautiful Mind is watchable and sometimes touching especially when it comes to Alicias attempts to understand whats going on with her husband. Bathing her in cinematographer Roger Deakins exquisite lighting Howard gives Connelly a radiance she hasnt shown since Once Upon a Time in America (though shes grown so thin its slightly unnerving).Unfortunately he also puts Nashs sprawling contradictory life on the Procrustean bed of ""inspirational"" filmmaking. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman clearly intend to turn their heros story into the math-geek version of Shine in which brilliance leads to breakdown which leads to salvation-through-the-power-of-love. While this comforting arc will doubtless satisfy many viewers Nashs story has the potential to be far grander than any tearjerker about a schizophrenic second-rate pianist. His whole life hinges on the tug of war between genuine inspiration and insanity between uncovering real-world patterns and sliding into paranoia -- conflicts that have fired the imaginations of artists and innovators from Freud to Nabokov to Antonioni to Pynchon. Yet Howard and Goldsman dont even notice let alone explore these themes. And they run scared from the actual facts of their heros life. When I finally caught up with Sylvia Nasars prize-winning biography I was flabbergasted at how the movie had changed or expunged virtually everything that might have given us the true historical and psychological texture of Nashs life. I wouldnt expect Howard to show Nashs conversations with poet Robert Lowell when they hung out together in a Boston mental institution (though Id love to know what this odd couple had to say to each other). Still I do have to wonder how any filmmaker could choose to leave out (among other things) the fact that Nashs delusions involved space aliens not communists; that his paranoia was fed when his math mentors were hassled by McCarthyites; that he tried to renounce his U.S. citizenship; that he had several homosexual relationships but denied he was homosexual; that he had a mistress who bore him an illegitimate son; that he was arrested in Santa Monica for indecent exposure; that the loyal Alicia actually divorced him (though they remarried years later); that his legitimate son John also fell into madness; that he viewed the regaining of his sanity as something of a mixed blessing because it also diminished his genius. What a list If Ron Howard had made Ali thered be no Black Muslims or womanizing and Ali wouldve won that first fight with Joe Frazier.Early on John Nash mocks his fellow students for doing derivative work. I can only imagine what he might think of A Beautiful Mind which leaps at cliches like a porpoise grabbing the fish from its trainers hand. After Nashs breakdown hes visited by a colleague Sol and grumbles that his medication makes it hard for him to do his work.""There are other things besides work"" Sol tells him.Nash shoots back ""What are they?""Cut to a shot of his baby sons pacifier on the floor.While I dont doubt that Howards done the best he can its sad to see a beautiful mind whittled down by such a plain one.Fifteen years ago Lasse Hallstrom was directing small personal art films in Sweden most famously My Life as a Dog. Today he churns out cautionary adaptations for the Miramax Oscar machine -- last year Chocolat; the year before The Cider House Rules. Now comes The Shipping News a wan tale of redemption based on the Pulitzer Prize--winning novel by E. Annie Proulx. It stars Kevin Spacey as Quoyle a middle-aged schlub whos shattered when his brassy unfaithful wife (Cate Blanchett) dies in an auto accident. Along with his doughty aunt (Judi Dench) he and his daughter move up to the ancestral home in Newfoundland a rickety sea-cliff house thats lashed to the ground because of the winds. There among the local Newfies he writes the shipping news for the local paper the Gammy Bird and sets about rebuilding his life.Proulxs original novel is a peculiar blend of pleasing eccentricity and ""healing fiction"" banality. She writes a highly literary prose thats as oddly turned as her name (""Clock hands leapt pellucid evenings. The sky riffled like cards in a chalk-white hand"") and this odd language helps capture the crabbed sometimes magical quality of Newfoundlands landscape and people. But it also masks whats cheap and easy in the story itself. That mask is jerked off in Hallstroms flat-footed retelling and its heros journey to self-realization resembles a long night on the Lifetime channel. Quoyle gets involved with a lovely single mother (played with characteristic grace by Julianne Moore) befriends the quirky Northern Exposure--ish locals and uncovers all sorts of dark secrets -- the usual stew of incest spousal abuse and family shame seasoned with a few dashes of Newfie magical realism.I was startled when I heard that cool slippery Spacey had been cast as the guileless Quoyle a role that begs for a soft warm sweet-faced actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman comes to mind). A master of irony Spacey is terrific at playing monsters bastards and self-satisfied jerks who sometimes (as in L.A. Confidential) discover an inner vein of decency. But after winning his Oscar for American Beauty he obviously decided that he wants us to love him. Hes begun grabbing the kind of ""poor me"" roles (like the disfigured teacher in Pay It Forward) better suited to his late friend and mentor Jack Lemmon. A big mistake. As Quoyle stumbles through the Newfoundland scenery with a look of dumb wounded decency thats as annoying as it is unpersuasive his eyes let us know that hes smarter than the guy hes playing. Spacey is nobodys idea of a goodhearted innocent and I wonder why nobody has told him hell blow his career if he keeps trying to pass himself off as Mr. Sensitive. Its time to go back to playing assholes. Thats what hes good at and thats why we love him. Contact John Powers Follow L.A. Weekly L.A.

In this final column of the year heres a roundup of the movies competing for box-office glory during the remaining days of 2001. For beautifully made literature on film you cant beat the careful page-turning skill with which the fine director Lasse ( The Cider House Rules ) Hallstrom has turned E. Annie Proulxs Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Shipping News  into a movie that engrosses hypnotizes and clings to the memory long after the final frame. Kevin Spacey is back at the top of his game as a disillusioned grief-stricken burned-out case a dull ink-setter in upstate New York devastated by the death of his unfaithful wife (a great trashy performance by that lovely chameleon Cate Blanchett) in a car accident with another man who moves his troubled daughter and crusty odd no-nonsense aunt (Judi Dench) to the bleak snowy wastes of his ancestral home in Newfoundland to seek a fresh start. Landing a lowly job as a reporter covering the shipping news for the local newspaper he begins to slowly matriculate in a town forgotten by time where the people are descendants of thieves and fishermen and pirates. Rape incest two near-death boating accidents and other rich plot trajectories open his eyes and heart to the point where he does eventually recharge his batteries finding love with a single mother who runs a day-care center (the radiant Julianne Moore) unlocking the mysteries of the past and finding hope for the future through the help of a marvelously assembled cast of strange eccentric time-weathered village characters. Director Hallstrom misses nothing in the careful development of time and place. Wind-swept locations in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia; majestic cinematography by Oliver Stapleton who shot The Cider House Rules ; a distinguished script by Robert Nelson Jacobs who wrote Chocolat ; and heartbreaking performances by an exemplary cast-all inform a movie that warms the cockles like an electric blanket. A Beautiful Mind is the harrowing true story of John Nash the brilliant mathematician whose revolutionary theory of economics won the Nobel Prize in 1994 after hed already spent most of his adult life in mental hospitals. Russell Crowe plays the eccentric and controversial genius from his graduate-school days at Princeton-when the signs of his illness were already showing (staring glassily into space unable to focus; rarely attending class; exhibiting bizarre antisocial behavior)-right up to the present when hes still considered the most beloved nut case on the Princeton faculty. After his career was jump-started by his advanced theory of dynamics he became a valuable problem solver for the Defense Department and a natural code breaker for the Pentagon. As his job grew more dangerous so did his paranoia. Convinced that he was a spy caught up in a Russian conspiracy and pursued by killers waving top-secret classified espionage documents Nashs hallucinations fantasies and paranoia led him right into a straitjacket. Cleverly and sensitively directed by Ron Howard A Beautiful Mind is more than a case study. Up to the point where Nash lands in the competent hands of a humane psychiatrist (Christopher Plummer) who correctly diagnoses his schizophrenia we never know more than Mr. Crowe does at any given moment. This gives the film a sense of such immediacy that Nashs subterranean nightmare takes on the gripping elements of a psychological thriller. But its Russell Crowe a gladiator in button-down shirts whose intensity decency and strength transforms the delusions of uncontrollable madness into the triumph of a beautiful mind. Charlotte Gray provides a second welcome visit from versatile Cate Blanchett in yet another disguise-as a naive but adventurous girl during World War II who gets the kind of grim education in human suffering that they dont tell you about in the recruiting posters. Inspired by the war effort and fluent in French Ms. Gray joins British intelligence and parachutes into occupied France as a secret agent under an assumed identity to search for her missing lover (an R.A.F. pilot believed to have been shot down by the Germans) falls in love with a French resistance fighter (Billy Crudup) while trying to save the lives of two Jewish children condemned to the gas chambers and narrowly escapes death at the hands of the Nazis. Thats a lot of danger and courage for one blue-eyed blonde to muster in one film but Ms. Blanchett succeeds convincingly displaying a lot of conflicting emotion along the way with all of her juices flowing. While telling a ripping good story Charlotte Gray also touches on the London blitz the chilling anti-Semitism in the evil Vichy government of the 1940s and the sorrowful tragedies that forever changed the lives of innocent people throughout Europe. Breathtakingly photographed (almost every scene is suitable for framing) and painstakingly directed by Australian Wunderkind Gillian ( My Brilliant Career ) Armstrong this is what they used to call a real ""movie movie."" I must be losing it I have never been a Jim Carrey fan but the attractive sensible polished and foam-waxed all-American matinee idol who emerges from The Majestic is the surprise of the year. Playing a screenwriter who after battling the ignorance confusion and stupidity of Hollywood studio thinking for years finds himself on the verge of a career-making breakthrough only to be targeted for destruction in the McCarthy witch hunts in 1951 Mr. Carrey gets the best role of his own career-and plays it with tenderness valor bravery and deeply moving conviction. I find him positively captivating. Mr. Carreys character Peter Appleton is a man with taste and intelligence which makes him suspect in an industry that manipulates talent and labels human life with a negotiable price tag. Worse still hes a liberal who innocently attended a Communist cell meeting when he was attending college on the G.I. Bill because it was a swell place to pick up girls. Before he has a chance to defend himself his convertible smashes through a guard rail and Peter falls off a bridge on the Pacific Coast Highway and then washes up in a beach town where the local townspeople mistake him for a missing war hero. Before his amnesia wears off he finds a new family reopens a shuttered movie house called the Majestic revitalizes the drab lives of the towns citizens and falls in love with a beautiful lawyer who renews his faith in patriotism while searching for any little thing that will jog his memory. When the House Un-American Activities Committee finally exposes him the moment of truth arrives. Faced with lying or going to jail Peter finds his heart where he least expects it and in the films biggest scene gives a speech before Congress that teaches everyone a lesson in democracy theyll never forget. Frank Darabont director of The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption  is a man with a healthy respect for the disappearing art of telling a great story in a time-honored well-structured narrative style. With its principles values point of view and flag-waving portrait of postwar American small-town life The Majestic is a movie that would make Frank Capra beam. This is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with a new spin. Ridley Scotts noisy pointless war epic Black Hawk Down is an interminable mural of killing famine bleeding and devastation that tries to outdo Saving Private Ryan without the creative genius or historic magnitude that made that film an instant classic. Based on a massacre during the war in Somalia in which a troop of U.S. soldiers and two crashed helicopter crews fought for survival while trapped behind enemy lines for 15 hours and surrounded by armies of hostile savages the film examines the grit and heroism of boys waiting to be rescued after an idiotic military blunder. Where is the glory in all this? Somalia in 1993 was not World War II and the lives the Pentagon sacrificed there were a dishonorable waste bordering perilously close to shame. Josh Hartnett Ewan McGregor Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard are some of the actors lost in the carnage and gore. They are fine but so what? Limbs explode guts spill and blood splatters in an endurance test that is numbing but nothing new. In war there are a thousand ways to die. Ridley Scott deserves no medals for forcing us to suffer through every single one. Monsters Ball is a catalog of human misery that even the laceratingly honest warts-and-all sweat of Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton cant save from contrived incredulity. Luscious Halle stripped of all glamour and working hard for respect as a dramatic actress plays a tragic unfortunate whose obese child is killed by a hit-and-run driver after her cop-killer husband played by Sean (P. Diddy) Combs is fried in the electric chair. Versatile Billy Bob is the redneck cop who pulls the switch after which his own son (Heath Ledger) blows his brains out with a shotgun. Destitute and desperate the mother sleeps with the cop without knowing who he is and they move in together while all of Louisiana looks the other way. Everyone ends up drowning in a ton of Tide. From closeups of an execution in meticulous detail (shaving the calves tightening every screw and strap) to unbridled nudity and shockingly brutal racist dialogue theres no relief in sight from the mounting depression. The acting is superior but I didnt believe a minute of Monsters Ball . Its a sour little soaper that ends 2001 on a downbeat note of suicidal despair. See you next year. The Ten Best Films of 2001 1.

The beefy Gladiator star seems to have diminished in size and has lost the fierce physicality of his Oscar-winning Roman warrior. Instead his energy is all nervous interior twitchy.Playing John Forbes Nash Jr. the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and fixture - since the late 40s - on the Princeton University campus Crowe projects a keen hyperactive intelligence. Its a performance that holds together even as A Beautiful Mind - directed by Ron Howard and adapted in part from the Nash biography by Sylvia Nasar - falls apart in a crescendo of hokey triumph-over-tragedy validation. Hokey and it should be noted largely fictional The filmmakers have taken great liberties and imaginative leaps with Nashs history.Nash who arrived at Princeton from West Virginia wearing dorky bow ties (at least in the Crowe version) and an air of profound arrogance was a young brainiac whose upstart ""game theory"" rocked the math world and the economics world and even had an impact on evolutionary hypotheses. (Dont ask me to explain it. In Howards film Nashs Great Idea seems to have its origins in a bar and has something to do with how to pick up girls.) But with the early recognition came great pressure. All that time spent inside his own head led to a kind of psychotic break and Nashs world fell apart.For a while in this handsome film (the great Roger Deakins is cinematographer) Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman go at Nashs mental illness - it was labeled paranoid schizophrenia - from a purely subjective vantage. What seems real to Nash seems real to the audience His recruitment by a shadowy G-man (Ed Harris) and his immersion into a world of code-breaking and espionage are filtered through the protagonists point of view.This conceit works well to a point but in A Beautiful Minds second half it becomes a narrative burden. The films inventiveness and invention sets the audience up for a letdown as things assume a more predictable course.What is handled well is the relationship between Nash and the woman who would become his wife Alicia Larde a Princeton physics student who comes on all sparkling and seductive and when things get rocky takes on the hard job of keeping Nash anchored in the real world. Jennifer Connelly looking smashing gives a portrayal that is certainly the most vibrant and vital of her career. The actress who turned in interesting work in last years indies Pollock and Requiem for a Dream doesnt let the role become an easy study of saintliness and self-sacrifice. There is hurt there and sadness and a kind of selfish daring; Connellys portrayal of Alicia is exhilarating.Think of the bogus sentimentality of a film like Mr. Hollands Opus and you have a good idea of how awful the ending of A Beautiful Mind is. (Also awful the old-age makeup applied to its two leads.) What began as a bold and thrilling story descends into Hollywood clichA. But Crowe and Connellys work rises above the mush. They make A Beautiful Mind go.A Beautiful Mind Produced by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard directed by Howard written by Akiva Goldsman photography by Roger Deakins music by James Horner distributed by Universal Pictures.Running time 2 hours 14 mins.John Nash. . .

"Film Gifts Under The Tree - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Jennifer Connelly Film Gifts Under The TreeMOVIE REVIEW - `A Beautiful Mind -     (out of five)3 Movies With Visions Of Oscar Dancing In Their Heads Open Today. Heres A Look At The Trappings Behind The Wrappings.Crowes Clever Portrayal Of Genius Plays On The `MindDecember 25 2001|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticNever has the line between genius and madness seemed thinner than it does in A Beautiful Mind.The new Russell Crowe movie inspired by the life of John Forbes Nash Jr. is the story of a Nobel Prize-winning theorist and a paranoid schizophrenic who happen to be the same person.Directed by Ron Howard this often-moving film dances along that delicate line beginning with Nashs arrival as a dazzling mathematics student at Princeton University in 1947. It ends nearly a half-century later with Nash winning the big prize.What we see on the screen is sometimes real and sometimes a function of Nashs mental illness. (To say which is which would be to say too much; anything here about the plot should be taken with a grain of salt.)At its best the film is a showcase for Crowe who grabs the role of Nash and plays it for all hes worth. Not only does he morph convincingly from college boy to senior citizen he charts Nashs descent into dementia and attempt to struggle back.Nash arrives at the university fresh from West Virginia and rough around the edges. Crowe has fun with the young mans social awkwardness and with his characters near-indifference to his classmates reactions to it.""Im here to work"" he announces to his fun-loving English-major roommate. Nashs risky method is to skip class whenever possible all the while searching for ""a truly original idea"" with which to ""distinguish"" himself.We follow his saga as he graduates begins teaching gets married and secretly goes to work for our government as a Cold War code-breaker.All the while his brilliant but unstable mind gets sicker.Director Howard who last year gave us Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas doesnt really have the command of style to create a multilayered movie like this one a movie that drifts in and out of delusion along with its hero. (Frankly he didnt really have the style for Grinch although he got by without it.)But Howard gives Crowe the space he needs to build a memorable character. And he surrounds his star with supporting players who truly do lend support such as Ed Harris as a mysterious government agent.But other than Crowe the most memorable performer in A Beautiful Mind is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly (Requiem for a Dream) whom Howard positions dresses and lights as if she were a glamorous star of the 40s. In this film she plays Nashs ever-loyal wife.Akiva Goldsmans script is essentially a series of vignettes. And Howards ease with the actors keeps most of these pieces involving.One of the best concerns a get-together at a bar in which Nash and his male classmates notice an attractive woman across the room.Its Nashs observation of the other guys behaviors that gives him the idea for a bold new theory about the mathematics of competition. The scene is presented so cleverly that the sophisticated theory ought to be clear enough to you even if you cant balance your checkbook.And speaking of calculations one way to think of A Beautiful Mind is as an equation One great performance plus several very good ones plus one serviceable script minus one uncertain style equals one entertaining if flawed motion picture.Go ahead You do the math.

Heck lets go out on a limb and declare that it IS the best movie ever made about a brilliant schizophrenic Nobel Prize-winning mathematician from West Virginia. Its a fairly narrow field but that only means its got novelty on its side. Its also got Russell Crowe. Maybe too much Russell Crowe. Director Ron Howard goes overboard with the close-ups. He has a way of isolating Crowe in a shot and lighting him so that his face and figure stand in stark relief against dimly lit backgrounds. People who consider Crowe some kind of sex symbol and cant get enough of him will probably love having him shoved in their faces. The rest of us even those who like his acting might want to sit far from the screen to get air to breathe. Crowe portrays John Forbes Nash Jr. playing him from his days as a competitive but socially awkward graduate student at Princeton in the 1940s to old age. Somewhere in between Nash is diagnosed with schizophrenia. Before this occurs he distinguishes himself at Princeton gets a research job at MIT marries a beautiful student (played alluringly by Jennifer Connelly with habitually parted lips) and has a child. He also is recruited by a shadowy government agent (Ed Harris) for a top-secret assignment as a code breaker during the Cold War. This leads to some dicey moments when enemy agents get wind of Nashs work. He endures the danger -- even being chased and shot at -- because his work is important. Then one day mysterious figures show up and hospitalize Nash contending he is delusional. Is this all some elaborate communist plot? Or has our hero gone off the deep end? There comes a point in the story when the audience has to consider the possibility that some of what transpired on screen occurred only in Nashs mind. A Beautiful Mind is an unusual biopic in that at this point the movie confounds our expectations. We expect these kinds of movies to be about the triumph of the underdog but this looks like the poignant chronicle of a potentially great mans fall. His once-brilliant mind dulled by medication Nash cant work. His wife has to support the family. He loses interest in sex. Then there are bouts when his illness returns; he may be a danger to his wife and child. Only a saintly woman could stick with him through this and his wife emerges as a hero in her own right. His downward spiral cant go on forever however. Remember Nash won the Nobel Prize. This happened in 1994 well after the most dramatic events related in the movie. So it is a triumphant tale after all. Despite a shaky West Virginia accent Crowe does exemplary work here his best since The Insider. Its just too bad Howard was so blatant about positioning his star as an Oscar contender.

Directed by Ron Howard from a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman. 129 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material sexual content and a scene of violence. Pacific Place II. E-mail this article Print this article What strikes you from the opening moments of Ron Howards ""A Beautiful Mind"" -- dusty light wood-paneled academia sweepy music -- is how very old-fashioned it feels. Thats not necessarily bad The Grinch notwithstanding Howard can do this sort of thing as well as anyone (particularly ""Apollo 13"") and while theres nothing innovative or eyebrow-raising here much of the film is very appealing as a soft-pedaled story of triumph over adversity. Russell Crowe again demonstrates his ability to disappear into a character as John Nash a Princeton mathematician whose career encompassed early fame decades of struggle with schizophrenia and ultimate glory (Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994). Crowe played a man of science in 1999s ""The Insider"" but here hes doing something different Nash speaks in halting half-swallowed words as if afraid of them. Crowe doesnt overdo Nashs nervous tics -- squinting rubbing his forehead -- but makes them an integral part of a complex troubled man. As Nashs supportive wife Alicia the beautiful Jennifer Connelly glows with goodness. (Will ""Mind"" finally make her a star?) Ed Harris in a black fedora is poised and mysterious as government agent William Parcher and Paul Brittany who lit up ""A Knights Tale"" is irresistibly relaxed as Nashs Princeton roommate. Roger Deakins handsome cinematography (he recently shot ""The Man Who Wasnt There"") gives the film the look of a leather-bound classic. What keeps ""Mind"" from greatness though is some awkwardness in the screenplay and the films odd relationship with the true story of John Nash. Those whove read Sylvia Nasars acclaimed biography of Nash also called ""A Beautiful Mind"" (credited here as ""based on the book by"") will find little similarity to Akiva Goldsmans screenplay. Goldsman files down all rough edges and inconvenient facts (among them Nash and Alicias eventual divorce) giving a more camera-ready depiction of mental illness and a life story that fits more neatly into the standard inspirational-drama template. In principle theres nothing wrong with this approach; the filmmakers are upfront that their story is ""inspired by"" Nashs life and the credits note that some characters are invented and a number of events fictionalized. But ""Mind"" in losing the asymmetrical messiness of Nashs story feels a little too tidy a little too simple -- something that Nashs life most definitely was not.

Starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris. Directed by Ron Howard. Written by Akiva Goldsman. (PG-13. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Hollywood mental illness is typically portrayed in one of two ways either as a crippling affliction that makes the patient shuffle and drool or as a state of airy enchantment -- a privileged place like childhood that the rest of us overcivilized drones should aspire to. ""A Beautiful Mind"" remarkably takes neither road. Adapted from a biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar this is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr. the mathematics genius who formulated the concept of game theory which became a foundation for contemporary economics. During the Cold War Nash developed schizophrenia and became delusional and paranoid but recovered and won a 1994 Nobel Prize. Starring Russell Crowe who executes an Olympian leap from his last role in ""Gladiator"" and directed by Ron Howard this is an unusually thoughtful look at mental illness and its disabling power. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman tell the story from Nashs Related Stories Crowes brilliant Mind / Story of a genius with mental illness point of view so that often we cant separate the real from the delusional. From the beginning Nash was a man apart awkward and internal. A mystery. The movie opens in 1948 when he arrives at Princeton University a West Virginia native with no family money or prep school background. Shy and fidgety he has trouble looking people in the eye. In his bow tie and baggy suit he looks like the nebbishy actor Wally Cox. A total bust at social interaction Nash flubs a conversation with a flirtatious woman in a bar (""essentially were talking about fluid exchange"" he says) and admits that he doesnt like people or they him. ""Im quite well balanced"" he tells his roommate. ""I have a chip on both shoulders."" Crowe beefy and solid isnt the first actor one might imagine in the part of a world-class math nerd but his intensity is such and his talent so large that he pulls us into Nashs world. Theres only one moment when Nash lectures in his undershirt and Crowes physique seems totally out of place that the actor and the part diverge. At first we dont notice that Nash is slipping into madness -- only that hes become obsessive in the competitive academic environment. He spends days on end in the campus library works out dense calculations on the leaded-glass windows of his dorm room and dismisses classroom instructions as ""the findings of lesser mortals."" Howard doesnt try to explain math theory but focuses instead on the emotional drives that fueled Nash. James Horners score clearly borrowing from Philip Glass has an urgent propulsive quality that gives a tingling adrenalized sense of excitement to academic work. Fixated on his search for ""an original idea"" Nash separates himself from people further. Later after hes married a gorgeous physics student (Jennifer Connelly) and taken a research and teaching position at MIT Nash is approached by a government recruiter (Ed Harris) who persuades him to work as an enemy code-breaker. At some point Nash realizes that a split has occurred that what seems real to him is not. The mind that served him so well and so brilliantly is now betraying him. ""A Beautiful Mind"" does a wonderful job of dramatizing that split making schizophrenia visible and suggesting that those who suffer from it are not unlike the rest of us. It also makes us wonder whether Nash through his intense study might have precipitated or hastened a condition that was already inevitable. By embracing creative thought the film asks does one relinquish conventional thinking and with it ones grasp on stability? Once that door to altered thinking is opened are will and sanity potentially sacrificed? In fact Nash fought his way back and found a way to do his work to be a husband and to function somewhat normally even though his delusions never disappeared. ""A Beautiful Mind"" dramatizes that struggle and makes compelling the most mysterious and intangible of crises. ""A Beautiful Mind"" was nicely filmed by Roger Deakins (""The Man Who Wasnt There"") and magnificently performed by Crowe who never fails to surprise and Connelly as the wife who always forgave always encouraged and ultimately brought her husband back to life. Inspiring and largely unsentimental this is as much a love story as a tale of courage. Advisory This movie contains adult themes and sexual references.

And so the less said the better about the methods he uses to penetrate the schizophrenic mind of John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe) the real-life Princeton mathematician who won a Nobel Prize in 1994. Crowe an Oscar winner last year for Gladiator rises to the challenge of the role with fearless integrity. Hes electrifying. Points too for Jennifer Connelly luminous and touching as Nashs long-suffering wife; Paul Bettany as his Princeton roommate; and Ed Harris as a CIA operative. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman juggling the facts in search of a more elusive truth maps a harrowing journey for the audience.

Running time 129 minutes. Rated R (adult themes). At the Lincoln Square the Union Square. A Beautiful Mind"" is an unlikely triumph. Just by itself the subject of this movie - a celebrated (real-life) mathematician battling schizophrenia - sounds like a recipe for the most repellently heart-tugging Oscar bait. Add cheerfully inclined director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman responsible for mediocre Hollywood generica like ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Practical Magic"" and you can almost be sure that the end product will be in the ghastly tradition of films like ""Shine"" ""Nell"" and ""Patch Adams"" with their bogus sympathy and showboating lead performances. But ""A Beautiful Mind"" turns out to be quite a different beast and one entirely bereft of any twinkly-eyed gruff-but-caring shrinks. Gripping smart and moving without falling prey to sentimentality it shows what can be achieved when mainstream filmmakers like Howard and Goldsman are genuinely inspired and determined to be honest. It also boasts what is unquestionably the outstanding performance of the year in Russell Crowes portrayal of John Forbes Nash Jr. You first see Nash arriving in Princeton in 1947 a shy young man from West Virginia who is surprisingly articulate and cultured for a math prodigy. Hes in an extremely competitive program and he soon becomes dependent for encouragement on his roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany from ""A Knights Tale""). While still an undergraduate Nash writes a revolutionary paper that basically gives birth to a whole new field game theory. It makes him an academic superstar and wins him a top research and teaching position at MIT. There he becomes involved with Alicia a beautiful physics student (Jennifer Connelly) and is recruited into a top-secret espionage agency by the shadowy William Parcher (Ed Harris). Nash and Alicia marry. But the strain of his secret work for Parcher begins to take a heavy psychological toll. Eventually Nash is committed to an institution by the sinister-seeming Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer). Crowes accent is at times ragged but its hard to imagine a more convincing portrayal of intelligence compromised by delusions and drugs Hes particularly good at capturing the clouded robotic effect of a patient on Thorazine. Connelly is an intelligent accomplished but consistently underrated actress (perhaps because of her astonishing good looks). As Alicia she more than holds her own opposite Crowe and if theres justice in Hollywood this role should catapult her career. Howard also elicits fine performances from a supporting cast that includes Judd Hirsch Josh Lucas (""The Deep End"") and Adam Goldberg. If you have ever known anyone who suffers from schizophrenia - and suffered through its on-screen depictions - youll probably be amazed by the rare honesty of ""A Beautiful Mind."" To the enormous credit of Goldsman and Howard their film avoids the twin stereotypes of the schizophrenic as either a monstrous psycho killer or an oracle with much to teach the rest of us and all the other movieland cliches in between. Theres absolutely no pretense that Nashs paranoid schizophrenia is in any way cute that it represents a refusal to live by societys crazy rules that people who suffer from it are blessed with any special wisdom - or that it can be cured. To the extent that this movie offers hope - and it is a moving but never a depressing film - its within the realm of possibility.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 21 2001 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 13 2014 1212PM EST Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English A Beautiful Mind Directed by Ron Howard Written by Akiva Goldsman Starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Ed Harris Classification PG Rating 1/2Memo from the Department of Damning with Faint Praise A Beautiful Mind is not a wholly unattractive film. But an uncommon man like John Nash deserves much more than a common movie like this. Nash is a mathematics genius whose innovative theories earned him a Nobel Prize; hes also a diagnosed schizophrenic burdened by acute paranoid delusions. In the hands of a better director than Ron Howard such a protean mix of reason and madness could have made for a tale of Shakespearean complexity. Instead all we get is a feel-good flick. Happily its graced by the presence of Russell Crowe who seizes the chance to put the upper-case in ACTING fleshing out the title character over a time span of nearly half a century. The early frames by far the best pick up Nash as a Princeton grad student circa 1947. There like many a budding Einstein hes an academic flop (""Classes will dull your mind"") and a social misfit (""I dont like people much and they dont like me""). Instead his considerable smarts are focused on the task of discovering a ""true original idea"" at least when his fun-loving roommate (Paul Bettany) isnt winning him over to the more plebeian pursuits available at the campus bar.This first act is the basic stuff of your standard inspirational biopic -- the phase where we wait for the talent to display itself for the gifted one to have his eureka moment. Its always fun to see how a film chooses to dramatize the epiphany. In this case the moment arrives in the aforementioned bar with our boy observing a gaggle of guys all competing for the attention of the same alluring blonde. Presto -- seems his ""theory of non-co-operative games"" which proved Adam Smith wrong and overturned 150 years of economic thought was conceived in a hotbed of horniness.Here and throughout Crowe plays the role with a slight downward tilt of the head as if sagging under the weight of his formidable cranium then looking up and out to deliver his lines with a true believers conviction. The effect is to blend shyness with arrogance and it works nicely at this stage. However as the disease sets in Crowe succumbs to the Dustin-Hoffman-in- Rain Man syndrome. That is its a good performance that never quite loses the aspect of being a performance. Crowes acting machine is well-oiled but you can see the gears turning.Anyway the narrative skips ahead to the fifties where a now-eminent Nash dabbles in the spy game recruited by a shadowy Washington official (Ed Harris) to crack intricate Soviet codes. Enter the inner demons of his schizophrenia closely followed by the lovely woman of his dreams. The latter is dark-eyed Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) one of his eager students but soon to become his faithful wife. Apparently shes smitten -- who other than a gal deeply in love would accept a marriage proposal that includes the phrase ""verifiable data.""As for Nashs equally faithful demons they take the form of recurring hallucinations. Actually Akiva Goldsmans script (very loosely based on Sylvia Nasars biography) plays a neat confidence trick on the audience. I cant give it away but the result is to lure us into a false set of assumptions all based on blurring the boundaries between the political paranoia rampant in the Cold War and the psychological paranoia inside Nashs mind. The trick succeeds and makes a sharp thematic point in the process.Unfortunately its the last success the film enjoys. As the hero begins to unravel so does the rest of the picture. Howard completely loses the thread during a risible chase sequence that has Nash literally run down by a gang of excited shrinks (led by Christopher Plummer no less). Meant to be real this scene is so badly constructed as to seem delusional -- an unfortunate confusion given the subject matter.The uplifting resolution is no better simplifying as it does both the nature of the illness and the manner of Nashs self-treatment. If A Beautiful Mind is to be believed a schizophrenic is best advised to deal with his phantoms as he would uninvited guests to a private party -- merely ignoring them if theyre quiet bouncing them forcefully if they act up. And that tidy little notion pretty much sums up the whole movie -- sublimely well-meaning in theory suspiciously mundane in execution.

But in the hands of director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"" 1995) screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (""The Client"" 1994) and Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"" 2000) ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an intensely human drama revolving around the grand themes of great triumph over intense adversity and the power of unwavering love. Based on the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr. (who is still alive) this heartfelt journey of the mind will undoubtedly bring Crowe a third consecutive Oscar nomination. The story begins with Nash a mysterious young genius from West Virginia entering Princeton University in 1947 and climaxes with his acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. Nashs innate brilliance was only surpassed by his lack of social skills and his intolerance towards the structure of an Ivy League education. Nash was obsessed with discovering an original idea believed that was the only way his life would ever matter. His only emotional support during his days at Princeton came from his roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany ""A Knights Tale"" 2001) VIDEO A Beautiful Mind Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) MORE REVIEWS Van Wilder High Crimes Big Trouble Panic Room Blade II Ice Age Showtime Time Machine We Were Soldiers Queen of the Damned Dragonfly Iris John Q Big Fat Liar Collateral Damage Monsters Ball Slackers Birthday Girl Monte Cristo Mothman Orange County Charlotte Gray I Am Sam Gosford Park Black Hawk Down Ali Kate amp; Leopold Shipping News Jimmy Neutron Joe Somebody Beautiful Mind The Majestic The Lord of the Rings Lantana The Royal Tenenbaums Vanilla Sky No Mans Land Affair of the Necklace Enemy Lines In the Bedroom Spy Game Sidewalks Harry Potter Shallow Hal Man Who Wasnt There Heist Amelie Focus Domestic Disturbance Tape Monsters Inc.

A Beautiful Mind Movie Review (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-beautiful-mind-2001,200,abeautifulmind25,abeautifulmind,rogerebert
"A Perplexing Equation - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A Perplexing EquationThe sparkling lead performances in A Beautiful Mind are set against Ron Howards tidy directing tendencies.December 21 2001|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Recoveries from affliction life-affirming triumphs of the human spirit are catnip for Hollywood and few stories fit that model as cozily as the life of mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr.As detailed in the Sylvia Nasar biography that gives ""A Beautiful Mind"" its title Nash was a brilliant mathematician a handsome solver of impossible problems who was one of his generations towering theoretical figures.Then began a catastrophic 30-year interlude of intense paranoid schizophrenia that ended even more astonishingly with a remission that was capped by a share of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics.Although it would be satisfying to report that ""A Beautiful Mind"" which stars Russell Crowe as the mathematician and Jennifer Connelly in a career-best performance as his beleaguered wife also beat the Hollywood odds and is a potent treatment of a serious adult theme the reality is not that clear-cut.There is more to admire in ""A Beautiful Mind"" than you might suspect but less than its creators believe. When the film does succeed it almost seems to do so despite itself at those moments when the power of the underlying story structure and the strength of the actors overcome the films inevitable weakness for hitting things too much on the nose.This is probably the most successfully serious film director Ron Howard has ever done but at the end of the day its still too much a too-tidy Ron Howard project and it is in the space between those two statements that this pictures true nature lies.Interestingly ""A Beautiful Minds"" relation to Nashs story is also more complex than it might appear. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and director Howard are candid about the way their film is what biographer Nasar describes as ""a highly stylized dramatization rather than a literal retelling"" of those events in which everything from the nature of Nashs incapacitating delusions to the shape of his marriage has been changed for dramatic effect.This typical have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too attitude is not a problem in and of itself but it at times fosters the films unfortunate tendency to repackage an unusual story as a standard brand.Certainly there is nothing standard about young Nash when he begins his mathematical graduate studies at Princeton in 1947. Known almost immediately as ""the mysterious West Virginia genius"" Nash is simultaneously arrogant and shy cocky and tongue-tied. ""I dont like people much and they dont much like me"" is his accurate self-description. In fact the only friend he makes is the roommate he doesnt expect to have Charles Herman (Paul Bettany Chaucer in ""A Knights Tale"") a heavy-drinking fan of D.H. Lawrence.If Nash has no time for small talk or social graces its because he lives and breathes math scribbling equations on windows and oozing determination to make a mark for himself to come up with a truly original idea. Even at this early stage he is wound too tight but it all seems worthwhile when he comes up with a game theory formulation known as the Nash Equilibrium. He does this in a typical show-biz touch while trying to figure out the best way for a group of friends to pick up women in a bar.Its six years later with Nash established at MITs prestigious Wheeler Defense Lab that he makes two connections that determine the shape of the rest of his life. First is the sinister William Parcher (Ed Harris) a black-hatted government intelligence operative straight out of Gang Busters who involves the mathematician in top-secret security work that could have monumental implications.On the more humane side there is one of Nashs students Alicia Larde the bright and beautiful young woman he marries who seems more amused than unhorsed by Nashs prickly uncompromising mental powers. This relationship parallels and draws its strength from the byplay between Crowe and Connelly an interaction that is one of the films strongest points.Crowe is an actor capable of conveying simultaneous arrogance and diffidence and even though his West Virginia accent seems like a bit of a stunt he is someone we always want to watch a forceful performer whose strength has regularly blown co-stars off the screen.Connelly however doing easily her most confident and impressive work ever is completely his match here just as Alicia is Johns in life. Theres an intelligence and a tartness to her performance an ability to be energized rather than fazed or intimidated by her co-stars powers that leads to a noticeable on-screen sizzle between them.Screenwriter Goldsman whose credits include two Batman movies and ""Lost in Space"" had a special reason to be drawn to this film. According to the press notes his parents had ""founded one of Americas first group homes for emotionally disturbed children."" With that experience to draw on Goldsman came up with a different and effective technique for conveying Nashs schizophrenia that is the films most interesting aspect.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA beautiful mind made for our complicated timesMay 11 2003Beautiful Minds Minus Hollywood GlamourMarch 22 2002Life Should Imitate the Art of A Beautiful MindFebruary 16 2002Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/21/entertainment/et-turan21,200,abeautifulmind26,abeautifulmind,latimes

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film for everyone who longs to see Russell Crowe in ""Flowers for Algernon."" Its a tortured-genius movie and Crowe lives down to the conception with a performance that is possibly the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year. When actors take on the role of a genius or a crazy person or a mentally handicapped person theyre practically inviting temptation. Theres no way of knowing what goes on in the mind of a genius and its damnably hard to find a way to make sense of a schizophrenics view of the world. So actors often resort to impersonations ladling on odd eccentric mannerisms because they cant get inside the characters. (Thats what Dustin Hoffman did in ""Rain Man."") In the case of genius roles the most common method performers adopt is to writhe under the burden of the greatness theyre trying to extract from their outsize brains. Some actors get to do both Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"" for one and Russell Crowe here. John Nash the MIT mathematician who won a 1994 Nobel Prize in economics after emerging from years of schizophrenia is both a genius and a crazy person. And Crowe sniffing out an opportunity the way a hound scents a hare sets off. Watching his performance is like going to some dog track where the mechanical rabbit has been replaced by an Oscar. Crowe doesnt miss a tic. He clumps along in big boxy suits like someone whos just learned to walk; he shifts from side to side; he mutters to himself or speaks in a husky vaguely courtly Southern accent; he keeps his head down when talking to others as if he could will his whole cranium to disappear into his chin dimple like smoke into a genies lamp. And thats just in the opening scenes at Princeton. When Nash starts to come apart Crowe gets to sweat and gibber and cower and drool and pop his eyes he gets to flip his body like an electrified fish as Nash is institutionalized and given insulin shock treatments. Its a prodigious display -- the Stations of the Cross as an acting decathlon. Its a performance I would have thought Crowe incapable of giving. Through it all theres no sense of whats going on inside Nash. Crowe has made the classic mistake of acting emotions (or mannerisms) instead of objectives. The performance is conceived in terms of a show rather than an exploration. Nash was a particularly driven man. He disliked reading feeling that it stifled creativity. In her biography of Nash (also titled ""A Beautiful Mind"") Sylvia Nasar relates that as a first-year grad student at Princeton he was coming up with a series of complex and important mathematical ideas. These ideas had already been elucidated by other mathematicians; amazingly Nash had come up with them with no knowledge of his predecessors work. And so Nash became more determined to come up with an idea that was all his. But Crowe doesnt play Nash as a man trying to prove himself an original thinker so he can win the attention that his withdrawal keeps him from finding socially. He plays the desperation that arises from that desire. In other words hes put the cart before the horse. But hes right in tune with the movie that director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have conceived. Its not particularly dishonest that Goldsmans screenplay allegedly based on Nasars book telescopes Nashs various stays in mental hospitals most of them involuntary into one incarceration. It might grow wearying (and dramatically inert) to watch a character being repeatedly committed. But the movies contention that Nash chose to suffer bravely so he could continue his work rather than be incapacitated by medication and shock treatment converts his eventual emergence from schizophrenia (a mystery for which no one seems to have any certain explanation and a very real and hard-won triumph) into a movie cliche about the unconditional indomitability of the human spirit. In 1996 Nash who has found it difficult to work since his recovery was introduced to an audience of psychiatrists in Madrid as ""a symbol of hope."" He told them ""To recover rationality after being irrational to recover a normal life is a great thing But maybe it is not such a great thing. Suppose you have an artist. Hes rational. But suppose he cannot paint. He can function normally. Is it really a cure? Is it really a salvation? ... I feel I am not a good example of a person who recovered unless I can do some good work although I am rather old."" Goldsman and Howard are like two members of the audience who heard the introduction and proceeded to ignore everything Nash had to say. In this type of inspirational moviemaking a conditional triumph is no triumph at all and a complex or unlikable hero is unthinkable. Goldsman and Howard have expurgated everything about Nashs bisexuality and the fact that he fathered a child out of wedlock. His wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) stays faithfully by his side in the movie. We arent told that though Alicia did shelter him and though they are still together she divorced him in 1963. We arent told that their son also a gifted mathematician and also schizophrenic has suffered as his father did living a life often divided between rootless wandering and institutionalization. And there is nothing of Nashs plain unpleasantness his racism his snobbery his history of violent behavior toward others. Of course none of these things lessens Nashs accomplishment diminishes the originality of his ideas or makes his emergence from mental illness any less remarkable. But by omitting them the moviemakers are signaling that think they do. And theyre implicitly saying to the audience that we cant be addressed as grown-ups. You Might Also Like That seems to be why Goldsman has come up with a spectacularly dumb device to tell the story of Nashs descent into madness. (If youre not familiar with Nashs story you may want to stop reading here.) One of the first manifestations of Nashs schizophrenia was his belief that aliens were sending him secret coded messages through the New York Times and over radio stations. (He also at other times attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship and traveled to Europe believing he was a secret religious figure chosen to be the Prince of Peace.) In the movie Nash is contacted by a shadowy government agent (Ed Harris dressed up like Dick Tracy) who tells him the Soviets have planted sleeper agents throughout America and that the agents are receiving coded messages in various periodicals instructing them on destroying the U.S. in a nuclear holocaust. Its the setup for a ""Sixth Sense""-style switcheroo; Harris and the messages Nash circles obsessively in newspapers and magazines are all part of his hallucination. (Ron Howard must have amazing powers of persuasion. Id love to have been in on the negotiations where he convinced an actor of Ed Harris stature to play a hallucination.) Before we learn that Howard gets to stage a car chase and shootout with Harris and Crowe being pursued by foreign agents. Were Howard and Goldsman afraid that without this cheap espionage subplot to snooker the audience Nashs story wouldnt be interesting? Essentially they pass up the chance to delineate how the workings of John Nashs mind were bent toward a schizophrenic delusion in favor of providing some easy thrills for the audience. And if youre going to have someone stoop that low but still maintain the air of a holiday prestige release then Ron Howards your man. He directs in his usual impersonal ""important"" style substituting the surge of big emotional moments for any sense of storytelling coherence or rhythm. ""A Beautiful Mind"" throws you into the story before giving you your bearings and expects you to immediately start reacting to the buttons Howard pushes. Nashs eager young Princeton classmates assembled in the universitys wood-paneled walls are meant to evoke eager youthful ambition no matter that Howard barely distinguishes one from the other. We read Nashs decline from the fact that he stops shaving and the surroundings get shabbier. The movie tells us nothing about Nashs work (were just meant to see hes brilliant) or his influential refocusing of game theory on the individual rather than the group. Nasar writes that Nash introduced the concept of mutual gain into game theory hypothesizing that ""the game would be solved when every player independently chose his best response to the other players best strategies."" Its clear why that theory has had so many ramifications in economics which is subject to a multitude of players and factors. Perhaps the filmmakers surmised it would be too difficult for audiences to grasp. And truth be told we wouldnt have to know anything about Nashs work to be moved by his story. But couldnt Goldsman at least have included a short speech or even a few lines about Nashs great accomplishment? Its hard to credit Nashs reemergence when we havent been given an idea of whats been lost. There is one genuine reemergence in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and thats Jennifer Connelly who is touching as Nashs doggedly faithful wife Alicia. After being relegated to junk movie roles Connelly has been doing good work for a few years now in ""Waking the Dead"" and in last years ""Requiem for a Dream."" This though is her reentry into the mainstream and it deserves to be the start of wonderful things for her. Connelly has a knack for responding to a moment with all her emotions while retaining some semblance of composure (the same way she seems on her guard when Nash is wooing her) and that contrast provides the only honest emotion in the movie. It takes a great deal of talent to seem real in a movie as fundamentally dishonest as this one. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a typical example of Hollywoods chickening out on chancy material softening the edges of a story and characters and shoehorning things into a tidy inspirational package. And its the type of movie that invariably gets people who dont respond to it accused of being heartless. But before the usual charges of cynicism get hurled Id just ask that one thing be kept in mind. Unlike ""Flowers for Algernon"" or ""Rain Man"" this isnt some concoction. Its the story of a mans life. Its not just our emotions that are being played on here its not just our intelligence being insulted because of Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsmans presumption that we wont have any interest in a character whom its not always possible to like. Its John Nashs life being turned into an Oscar machine and an easy way to jerk tears. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger. More Charles Taylor.

That said this is one inspiring movie despite extremely tricky subject matter -- better than Shine and among the most affecting ever made about co-existing with mental demons. Itll soon be very clear that when Russell Crowe won the Oscar for Gladiator he got it for the wrong movie. Playing a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic described early on as having ""two helpings of brain and half a helping of heart"" Crowe somehow makes himself -- through personality and especially body language -- a viable screen hero even though his lack of social graces often puts him on the outs with his crowd. If theres no logical reason why any woman particularly if shes played by Jennifer Connelly should be crazy about this guy from almost the moment she meets him dynamic performances and extraordinary actor chemistry make us buy it. We even buy it during the storys stormy years which follow MIT instructor Nashs marriage to a back-row physics student before undertaking undercover Cold War work for the government. As Nashs murky government contact Ed Harris at first seems too much the prototypical mystery-man-in-a-fedora to be fully convincing. Later though we see that his characterization is a creative device used by director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman who also found a clever way (it involves a blonde in a barroom) to explain Nashs Nobel-celebrated game theory. If they still dont quite succeed in making the theory clear to a brain-dead math dunce like me ... well Nasar didnt either. Nashs real life is full of byways the movie doesnt address such as his apparent bisexuality and an out-of-wedlock child he fathered before meeting his wife. But whereas most biopics trip over bulging plot as they try to jam in every key detail this one maintains dramatic focus for more than two hours by in part jettisoning messy baggage the filmmakers were probably happy to ignore. Though the pre-Ransom rap on Howard was that he wasnt edgy enough this movie (despite its gloss-overs) gets harrowing before its deservedly upbeat finale; imagine what youd feel for Jack Nicholsons character in The Shining if you felt sorry for his predicament instead of reveling in it. Beautiful Mind is Howards best movie after Apollo 13 and it immediately follows his charmless -- though commercially successful -- childrens movie from a year ago. To adult moviegoers at least the Grinch has given Christmas back.

"Beautiful Mind A Terrible Thing to Waste washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Beautiful Mind A Terrible Thing to Waste Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 21 2001 ""A BEAUTIFUL Mind"" based on the life of mathematician and Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. is about the beauty of thinking outside the box. Follow the content of the movie which includes a strong performance by Russell Crowe and you might enjoy this picture all the way. But director Ron Howard fails to apply the outside-the-box approach to his own movie. Instead of an originally conceived movie that reflects Nashs troubled but brilliant mind we have one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies - the kind that seem exclusively designed for Best Picture nominations. Nash a West Virginia man with no elite education finds himself among the Haves at Princeton. To his colleagues hes a social misfit a hick without a clue. But they underestimate his brain power and his will. Nash who seeks out original ideas rather than waste time attending classes hits upon his Eureka one night at a bar. When Nash and his fellow scholars all have designs on the same woman he contemplates the situation. If everyone wants the same thing and only one person benefits how to find a solution for everyone? Nashs napkin-written formula it turns out not only solves the immediate quandary it applies to similar situations in economics business and other sciences. On top of that Nash gets the girl - the brilliant beautiful Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Nashs formula impresses his academic superiors and eventually leads to a powerful job at MIT. His uncanny ability to crack codes brings him into contact with shadowy government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris) who enlists him to help fight the Cold War. Then comes the real battle. Nash discovers the mental anguish hes suffered from most of his life is paranoid schizophrenia. For all his intellectual abilities hes a prisoner of his mind. Its a great idea for a film based on a compelling character. Nash whose theories have influenced global trade negotiations national labor relations and evolutionary biology still works as a professor at Princeton. And theres no end to the skilled maneuvering from Howard screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and Crowe whos often superb as Nash. But the movies all formula formula formula. Hellbent on masticating everything - no matter how elusive and original - into easily digestible user-friendly pulp the filmmakers render Nash into mash. And if Nash were a screenwriter rather than a mathematician I dare say he might even agree that the movie no matter how well intentioned remains a mediocre rendition of his great mind.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 19 2001 201 PM Rings Cycle The Fellowship of the Ring is astonishing--even if you havent read the book. By David Edelstein After the lumbering The Phantom Menace the strenuously synthetic The Mummy and its sequel and the bland-o-rama Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone its thrilling indeed to sit through a mega-budget blockbuster sword-and-sorcery picture thats the work of a genuine filmmaker--that has passion and urgency that has characters who are (whatever their stature or alien protuberances) dramatically compelling that is more than the sum of the scores (hundreds?) of millions that have been thrown at it. Advertisement Its true that the first installment of The Lord of theRings trilogy The Fellowship of the Ring (New Line) is basically a lot of people running away from special effects. But what volcanic special effects What otherworldly settings through which to run What magnificent music to run to What illustrious actors doing the running Peter Jackson the youngish New Zealand director was weaned on both J.R.R. Tolkien and genre flicks and the world that he and his wizardly designers have contrived evokes the lore that fed Tolkien and the lore that Tolkien fed Celtic myths Norse gods and goddesses Dante Richard Wagner Viking epics Kurosawa Star Wars Harry Potter Harryhausen Hammer horror Hong Kong martial-arts ghost pictures classic shockers like Curse of the Demon and Tombs of the Blind Dead. Fashioned by a buff The Lord of the Rings is a banquet for the buff in us all. I left exhausted happy intoxicated. ... and in no hurry to read Tolkien. Before I burble on an admission I have friends whove plowed through TheLord of the Rings as many as seven times in its entirety whereas Ive never made it past Page 5 of The Hobbit. It must be genetic--I see the words ""Bilbo Baggins of Bag End"" and my eyelids begin to droop. I tried again last month determined to battle my way through The Fellowship of the Ring but before Id even reached Bilbos eleventy-first birthday the words had begun to swim. This is not a proud confession Better minds than mine have luxuriated in Tolkiens epic an adolescents coming-of-age odyssey that is also thanks to its length and breadth an adolescent readers coming-of-age odyssey. Its merely a way of saying that Ive no idea whether Jackson has been faithful to the canons of Middle-earth. I gather that the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler) isnt an action hero in the book Here she charges ahead of the thunderous Ringwraiths with a wounded Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) in tow. And its Frodo not Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who guesses the meaning of the riddle at the entrance to the mines of Moria. But lets move on shall we? Myriad Tolkienites are already enumerating the eleventy-odd other alterations. The Fellowship of the Ring opens with flashbacks to the last installment which of course doesnt exist. That means a lot of exposition in little time how the Ring of Power was forged by the evil Sauron; how it was won in battle by a brave warrior who subsequently fell under its wicked spell and refused to destroy it in Mordor the only place where it can be destroyed; how it wound up with Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) in his homey little Hobbit-Shire. (Im leaving stuff out or this would come to a few hundred pages.) The opening act in the Shire is a wee bit snoozy but once Frodo has been entrusted with the ring and Gandalf has gone to enlist the aid of his old friend Saruman (Christopher Lee) its bat-out-of-hell time. Why a smart wizard like Gandalf couldnt guess that Sa ruman and Sa uron would have more than a passing acquaintance isnt clear but one look at the great totemic Lee--a snowy-white incarnation of his Hammer Rasputin with a beak like a fish hook--ought to have sent him skittering back to Bag End. The two hoary English actors have a splendid wand-off smiting and spinning each other around the great hall. McKellen rasps his disbelief; Lee hurls mighty imprecations in those supernatural bass tones. Its a voice that sounds credible conjuring demons from the peaceable soil of Middle-earth commanding his hellish minions to rrrrrrip the trees out of the soil sending fire bolts from the sky and bringing boulders crashing down mountainsides. Advertisement This is not a film for small children. The long black Ringwraiths that swoop down on Frodo and his friends are shudderingly scary creations They natter to themselves in gnarled whispers and their horses shriek; their presence brings forth centipedes and spiders from the ground. A battle with a clay monster in the mines of Moria is the blood wedding of Kurosawa and Harryhausen--nightmarishly kinetic like the Seven Samuraiof Sinbad. The ultimate hell-spew the Balrog is not an anti-climax King Kong would turn tail; Godzilla would whimper and excuse himself. This might be the most terrifying creature ever committed to celluloid. Director Jackson loves the shots of Sarumans infernal machines violating the earth. The abysses in this movie are truly abysmal; the towers stratospheric. The bad guys and their castles are sharply elongated their turrets stretching to the heavens; the good guys are softer and more rounded with startling blue eyes. Cate Blanchett all but floats into the frame an unbearably beautiful diaphanous goddess the anti-Balrog. Blue-eyed princess Liv slings blue-eyed soft-faced Wood over her horse and says ""If I can get across the river the power of my people will protect him"" and cleft-chinned Viggo Mortensen as Strider meets Livs blue eyes with a pair of his own and says ""Ride hard."" Even McKellen has blue eyes and a big rounded nose that makes him seem almost a hobbit on stilts. The exchanges among the loyal band--hobbits dwarves elves even men--that cleaves to Frodo on his voyage to the Land of Shadow are by necessity terse but Sean Bean manages to make Boromir a febrile movingly conflicted warrior. He thinks he can harness the power of the ring to save his benighted kingdom--and its in his shifty yet longing eyes that its powerful allure is most clearly reflected. Howard Shores orchestrations Celtic-tinged alternately wistful and pounding abet these battles of the heart and sword superbly It isnt Wagner but it isnt Williams either. Peter Jackson has always grooved on passionate excess. His first big hit Dead Alive (1992) is about a nice young man whose overbearing mother becomes a flesh-eating zombie; to keep her from eating his girlfriend he has to chainsaw through about a hundred demons in the last 10 minutes. Its the ultimate Freudian splatter picture. Heavenly Creatures (1994) doesnt just portray the folie a deux of two young girls who decide to commit murder--it plunges headlong into their fantasy lives. The Frighteners (1996) begins as a spook comedy but develops a dark and crazed momentum that tears it loose (unpleasantly loose) from its genre moorings. Now in The Lord of the Rings Jackson has brought a primal intensity to the struggle between good and evil that makes the stiff well-mannered drones of George Lucas look like denizens of a bad Saturday-morning cartoon. Will the millions who embrace Lucas holograms be able to handle sword-and-sorcery with real blood and guts? Advertisement Russell Crowe does the Rain Man thing in A Beautiful Mind (Universal Pictures) He plays a mentally ill tic-ridden genius who stays stubbornly on his own wavelength. In his first scenes when hes a graduate student in mathematics at Princeton in the early 50s Crowe seems a shade external as if hes trotting out all these sundry mannerisms as a means of willing his way into the head of the character John Nash. But as Nash gets closer to Crowes own age (and level of dissipation) the performance settles down and becomes first credible and then overwhelming. There are few actors alive who could have brought this part off--you need just the right blend of artistry and insanity. The brooding tightly wound Crowe is somehow able to show Nashs cerebral convolutions on his face while his eyes become increasingly--desperately--forlorn. This is a stupendous piece of acting. I didnt expect to respond to A Beautiful Mind--the names Ron Howard (director) Akiva Goldsman (writer) James Horner (composer) and Charlotte Church (vocalist) do little to inspire faith. But even beyond Crowe this is a pretty good tear-jerker. Given the nature of Nashs illness Howard can have fun with the Cold War culture of the 50s--to show the ways in which it invades Nashs psyche and empowers his delusions. He and Goldsman smartly save the inspirational schlock for the last 20 minutes by which time theyve snared you. More than anything you want to see Crowe with his potency back--not a shrinking slope-shouldered mental patient but a swashbuckling super-cogitator. In the final scenes the portrait of delusional schizophrenia seems rather clean the line between reality and fantasy too clearly demarcated. (Ive known a few schizophrenics and none of them ever learned to isolate the figments of their imagination.) The real Nash apparently had a more complicated relationship with the Pentagon and his own sexuality but the changes here are closer to Hollywood-cosmetic then they are to the overriding lies of say Blow. As Nashs suffering spouse Jennifer Connelly almost gets gummed up by a couple of embarrassing speeches toward the end but shes an elegant actress--she rides them out. An old college friend of mine--like Nash an eccentric West Virginian hobbled by inner demons--died recently in willed obscurity which might account for how hard I cried at the end of A Beautiful Mind. Crowes performance brought it all back to me the mixture of mulishness and vulnerability that is not a design for living but that makes some souls for a while burn so bright.

(Geoffrey Rush + Shine = Oscar; Angelina Jolie + Girl Interrupted = Oscar.) Yet in A Beautiful Mind Russell Crowe sometimes summons up one of the most powerful depictions of mental illness I have ever seen with barely an eyelid flicker separating manifestations of sickness from utterly sane displays of creative concentration. Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr. a brilliant real-life mathematician and Nobel Prize winner now in his 70s whos also a real-life schizophrenic. But when we first meet him as a Princeton graduate student hes just another eccentric genius a loner obsessed with finding a truly original idea. (He does; he writes a revolutionary paper on game theory.) Director Ron Howard working from an inventive script by Akiva Goldsman that makes use in turn of Sylvia Nasars biography does a crucial and crucially understated job of establishing the physical reality of Nashs world--the campus his classmates his high-spirited roommate (Paul Bettany)--with such authority that we feel we can taste the chalk dust on the blackboard. (Cinematographer Roger Deakins work is as integral here as it is to the telling of The Man Who Wasnt There.) This tangibility is Beautiful Minds beautiful achievement the elegant solution to the problem of how to turn the biography of a mans head into an absorbing movie. And especially coming from Howard a director renowned (and sometimes critically reprimanded) for pumping big gusts of inspirational wind through pictures from Cocoon to Apollo 13 this is news. Inspired perhaps by the existence of an actual living Nash as well as by Crowes superior bull-free talent director and screenwriter have found a way to convey the sensation of schizophrenia from the inside out not with a big raving and waving of hands but with a waiving of reality. To say more about how is unwise but I do want to say that Crowe ages as Nash ages. The academic geek who did so poorly with girls meets the beautiful student who will become his wife (Jennifer Connelly) at about the same time he meets the compelling government agent (Ed Harris) who recruits the professor to break codes. Its only long after Nashs schizophrenic break--after he has struggled with treatment that dulls his thoughts and deadens his marriage and after he has struggled to live with his illness on his own terms--that this Mind gets foggy with uplift too. Still by then the important movie work has been done A Beautiful Mind has distinguished itself and enlightened its audience. No final speechifying and shots of Mrs. Nashs tear-glistened eyes can take away the remembered image of Crowe as a young Nash solving equations on a windowpane aflame with an inspiration very close to madness.

"Genius in chaos - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Genius in chaosRussell Crowe shines in this real-life story about a gifted mathematician with schizophreniaA BEAUTIFUL MIND (star)(star)(star)1/2December 21 2001|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.In ""A Beautiful Mind"" Russell Crowe plays a schizophrenic Nobel Prize-winning mathematician -- and though the role might seem a real stretch for an actor who just won an Oscar for his Charlton Heston turn as Maximus in ""Gladiator"" he and the movie ace the test.Crowe is eerily touchingly convincing as John Forbes Nash a real-life mathematics genius who made a revolutionary breakthrough in game theory as a Princeton student but later suffered a violent breakdown derailing his brilliant career and making chaos of his marriage and life.The movie directed by Ron Howard -- in a real turnabout from last years ""Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" -- is unsparing and exhaustive in its dramatization of Nashs rise fall and rise. Spanning almost 50 years it shows Nashs early triumphs his descent into a delusional hell and his inspiring recovery; it begins with his arrival at Princeton as a cocky West Virginia math whiz in 1947 and climaxes with his 1994 Nobel Prize.During that half-century journey we meet Nashs fellow students rivals and friends stalwart Sol (Adam Goldberg) and his bizarre mercurial roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany). We meet his mentor Prof. Helinger (Judd Hirsch) his doctor Rosen (Christopher Plummer) as well as mysterious tight-lipped government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris). Most affectingly we come to know his gutsy wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) a brainy campus belle forced to go into the fire with her tortured husband.Playing this demanding part Crowe gives an amazingly complete performance. He convinces us that hes an arrogant young genius and hes also believable as a melancholy vulnerable old man shambling across the campus trying to keep his demons at bay. The movie is surprisingly scary in its evocation of Nashs private terrors and its very moving when it shows us his bonds with Alicia and his battles to hold onto his disintegrating life. But its not especially accurate in its rendering of his life -- even though Sylvia Nasars book ""A Beautiful Mind"" is the ostensible source.Writer Akiva Goldsman alters events and Nashs character. And then he concentrates instead on taking us inside the fictionalized Nashs mind as he falls apart; Goldsman charts the nightmares that the rest of the world cant see or understand. The movie contains some startling jolting visualizations of madness -- moments of extreme disorientation and swimming horror.But thanks to Crowe and Howard the picture has both edge and human feeling tension and warm veins of sympathy. This is Howards best film since ""Apollo 13"" and its a subject ideal for his major virtues his rigorous organization and unforced compassion his ability to draw believable communities. As for Crowe this is a role like Jeffrey Wigand in ""The Insider"" that confirms his dedication as an actor his willingness to take large risks and deliver on them.Crowe compels us initially with his trademark glowering intensity his brash actors narcissism -- because those qualities mesh with Nashs swagger as a young egotistical academic star.But as Nash falls prey to his inner torments -- as Harris bullying agent Parcher intrudes more and more into his life and Nash breaks down trying to satisfy his demands -- Crowe gentles the character cracks his armor. Like the FBI agents in the current Frank Darabont-Jim Carrey blacklist film ""The Majestic"" Parcher comes to symbolize the paranoia of the Cold War years. In a way hes a nightmare manifestation of the entire countrys madness as well as key agent of the movies most stunning surprise. In succumbing to Parcher Nash is tapping into the terror of the times -- and Harris infuses the role with quiet menace and demonic intensity.A very savvy Hollywood publicist surprised me 10 years ago by arguing that the two best 90s American filmmakers were Ron Howard and Rob Reiner two TV actors-turned-movie directors who regularly field compliments for making each others films. That confusion probably stems from the similarity of their ""invisible"" styles and their worldviews liberal humane humorous keyed around groups and families under pressure. The publicist exaggerated (as publicists do) -- but ""A Beautiful Mind"" proves that we tend to underrate Howard. Its a movie that gets its emotional effects effortlessly an intelligent drama imbued with the classic craftsmanship engrossing narrative and smooth ""finish"" of the better Golden Age studio products.It may even have a personal vein as well. Wouldnt a prodigious young child actor like Ronny Howard of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" have been familiar with the perils of early fame and brilliance of being ""different?"" Didnt he like Nash have to somehow create or retreat into worlds of his own? Howard actually may have a unique take on one of the movies principal themes the sometimes terrifying workings of imagination.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles`A Beautiful Mind Profiles A Schizophrenic And...June 7 1998By Sylvia Nasar Simon...March 21 1999Adventures Of The MindSeptember 6 1998Reel Life Vs Real LifeFebruary 3 200257th Street Books 1301 E. 57th St. 773-684-1300...February 10 2002Find More Stories AboutReal LifeGeniusTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-21/entertainment/0112210375_1_john-forbes-nash-sylvia-nasar-real-life,200,abeautifulmind32,abeautifulmind,chicagotribune
"Beautiful Mind A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; beautiful-mind-a ) Beautiful Mind A (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli A Beautiful Mind is a beautifully written effectively acted and meticulously crafted effort that is likely to remind many viewers of a simple axiom a movie doesnt have to be groundbreaking to be compelling. Originality is a prized commodity because there is so little of it in Hollywood these days but when filmmakers do such a skillful job with familiar elements their efforts should be acknowledged. Affecting without being overtly manipulative A Beautiful Mind tells the life story of John Nash a Nobel prize winner who struggled through most of his adult life with schizophrenia. As directed by Ron Howard this becomes a tale not only of one mans battle to overcome his own disability but of the overreaching power of love - a theme that has been embraced by films as diverse as Its a Wonderful Life and Rocky. A Beautiful Mind may have been developed to be a crowd-pleaser as well as a tear-jerker but genuine craft is evident in the way the pieces were assembled. The movie never becomes cloying nor does it threaten to drown us beneath an outpouring of false sentiment. This is no Patch Adams filled with saccharine-coated artificiality. The characters are effectively drawn and their plight touches an emotional chord. A Beautiful Mind offers a catharsis without insulting the intelligence. Sadly too few movies these days can make a similar claim. This film argues that there are still instances when Hollywood-produced big budget movies are worth a viewers investment of time and money. A Beautiful Mind purports to tell the true story of Professor John Nash (Russell Crowe) but while the gross facts may be accurate one must expect embellishment of the details. Narrative features are not constrained by the same rules that limit documentaries. We first meet Nash as a student at Princeton in 1947. He is brilliant but erratic - a mathematical genius who lacks social skills. He is aided in making it through those difficult years by his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany). Years later following an astounding breakthrough that revolutionizes economics John is teaching at M.I.T. and doing code-breaking work for a shady government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris). Its at this time that John meets falls in love with and marries Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). But his happy world soon starts to crumble. John is afflicted with paranoid hallucinations; by the time he is taken to a mental hospital under the care of the mysterious Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) he is diagnosed as having an advanced case of schizophrenia. For Russell Crowe the winner of last years Best Actor Oscar this is another opportunity to broaden his range. Crowe successfully buries his personality beneath Nashs allowing the character to come to the fore (a necessity considering the actors current load of off-screen baggage). Much as he did in The Insider Crowe shows no difficulty inhabiting the skin of a real-life individual who has a stronger intellect than physique. And when it comes to the sequences depicting Nash battling his demons Crowes performance is utterly convincing. Meanwhile Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia. Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe it is Connellys complex work depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man that elevates the film to a higher level. The actress was unjustly overlooked for Requiem for a Dream; hopefully the Academy will not repeat that mistake. Solid support is provided by Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer. A viewer certainly doesnt have to be a mathematical expert to appreciate what A Beautiful Mind offers although those with a strong left-brain component may relate better to John Nash than right-brainers. The movie tosses mathematical theories and theorems in the audiences direction but explains them simply and lucidly; no one is going to become lost or bored. A Beautiful Mind isnt about mathematics except as a symbol. Its about human frailty and the ability to triumph over it. Nash could just as easily be a doctor a lawyer or a construction worker and the essence of the story would not change. The strength of the writing and production values elevate A Beautiful Mind far above ""disease of the week movie"" quality. At the core of the picture lies the relationship between John and Alicia and the tribulations that the strength of their bond allows them to overcome. On one occasion a friend asks Alicia how she can continue to stay with her stricken husband and she replies with a succinct explanation that everyone who has ever been in love will understand. A Beautiful Mind defies the conventional Hollywood wisdom that love is passion and romance. For John and Alicia it is painful heartbreaking work. And while hearts and flowers are great for a fantasy this is the kind of expression of emotion that touches a deeper chord.
