He follows his Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 remake with this much better action flick showcasing an even bigger hunk of rolling stock. After a snarl-up at the yard this half-mile-long freight-hauling baby starts trundling along the rails on its own gathering momentum through leafy Pennsylvania towards a dangerous curve where its payload of explosive chemicals promise a preview of the apocalypse. On the same tracks a bunch of kiddies on a school trip and another shunting engine where wily old engineer Denzel Washington is showing hot-shit new-boy Chris Pine the ropes. Theyll all be Jello if they get in the way but letting the beast through is no solution either...Youll look in vain for the metaphysical overlay Akira Kurosawa and Andrey Konchalovsky brought to a not dissimilar set-up in Runaway Train (1985) but this is nuts-and-bolts suspense cinema at its slickest. Scott his multi-camera crew and gifted editor dont need 3D or even much CGI to convince us of the destructive potential of this big bad boy and sustain the tension effectively as fearful controller Rosario Dawson and unfolding TV news coverage fill in the necessary exposition. If youre nit-picking the personal issues batted between Washington and Pine in the cab feel decidedly formulaic and the movie does peak in intensity around the two-thirds mark. Yet ultimately the pleasure is boyishly simple very big train hits stuff. Bish bash bosh. Job done. Great fun.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED November 10 2010 at 1123 am | UPDATED May 5 2016 at 613 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Consider the entertaining movie ""Unstoppable"" a tonic of a particular Hollywood variety for what is lacking in its cineplex peer ""For Colored Girls"" a man to admire. The man here is Frank Barnes. Hes a father a husband a train-engineering veteran facing a very bad day on the rails. Hes also portrayed by Denzel Washington who teams up with his go-to director Tony Scott for an action flick without an enemy at least not a gun-toting ideology-wielding foe. Instead the adversary is a behemoth of a train let loose on the rails by accident. ""Unstoppable"" is not the ""The Taking of Pelham 123 Two."" Theres no malice involved. This is Washington and Scotts fifth outing. Each half of the duo clearly digs what the other affords him. For Scott this means directing a pro with sure and agile instincts. For Washington it means a star turn in a movie unburdened by too much zeitgeist baggage. ""Unstoppable"" is an adrenaline-spiked ode to the American worker. You know who we mean; you may be that guy or gal. Frank is believably worn dedicated decent. He is proxy for the best sort of working stiff. Colorado native T.J. Miller portrays one of two railyard rubes who put train 777 and its 39 cars in motion carrying volatile materials and headed for a tight curve in a blue-collar Pennsylvania town. Screenwriter Mark Bomback took his cue from a 2001 incident in which an unmanned freight train made its menacing way though Ohio. Chris Pine portrays Will Colson Franks much younger much greener much better- connected counterpart. Hes the son of railroad muckety-mucks and his privileged position rankles some. A subplot has Wills marriage veering off the rails. Back where the train became a threat are railyard supervisor Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) and safety inspector Werner (Kevin Corrigan). As Frank and Will figure out a way to slow the monster Connie and Werner face an uglier nemesis. As Galvin Kevin Dunn portrays the sort of executive movies love to hate. Hes arrogant dismissive. He cant quite help putting company cost-risk assessments over public safety. Will the 777 take out another locomotive carrying kids on a train-safety excursion? Will the ""missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" (as Connie describes it) slam into a hardscrabble burg? This isnt groundbreaking fare mind you. But ""Unstoppable"" muscles through its story of peril with crafted intensity and a few well-placed grins. Character actor Lew Temple provides a nice kick as a welder game for the challenge of stopping 777. As they head toward a train rattling with fury and the spooky sounds of too much speed Frank and Will prove a pair worthy of our concern. ""UNSTOPPABLE. PG-13 for sequences of action and peril and some language. 1 hour 40 minutes. Directed by Tony Scott; written by Mark Bomback; photography by Ben Seresin; starring Denzel Washington Chris Pine Rosario Dawson Kevin Dunn Ethan Suplee Kevin Corrigan Lew Temple Kevin Chapman T.J.

(AP) Denzel Washington surfs a runaway train in a scene from Unstoppable.(AP) Movie review Unstoppable Like derivatives trading this train is out of control Add to ... The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Though not to be confused with latest CD from the country band Rascal Flatts the new movie Unstoppable aims for a similarly blue-collar demographic. This is the second collaboration between director Tony Scott and actor Denzel Washington that lets them play with a big train set. Their first attempt at choo-choo thrillers last years remake of The Taking of Pelham 123 never really picked up steam but the current effort - a tale of working-class heroes and big fast machines - has the greasy punch of a three-minute heavy-metal guitar solo. And Scotts arsenal of jumpy edits and quick changes pushes the pressure gauge into the red. Movies Unstoppable The official trailer Its the human side of the movie that sputters with barely functional back-stories and power-jostling dialogue that attach a patina of human drama to the locomotive action. Chris Pine plays Will a rookie conductor whose wife has a restraining order against him (a silly misunderstanding about a gun on the dashboard). Frank (Washington) a widower and veteran engineer faces forced retirement while trying to help his two daughters both Hooters waitresses through college. Initially suspicious of one another the men bond in their mission to stop a runaway train full of toxic gunk from turning southern Pennsylvania into even more of an industrial wasteland. Though inspired by a real incident the movie is an opportunistic political allegory about an economy thats out of control and industries that are weakened by layoffs under-staffing and corporate callousness. In case we miss the point Fox News choppers hover overhead throughout ready to turn these ordinary chumps into folk heroes. Unstoppable Directed by Tony Scott Written by Mark Bomback Starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine OTHER CHOO-CHOO DISASTER FLICKS Terror on a Train (1953) Theres a bomb on a British train threatening not only the passengers by a nearby naval shipyard. A demolitions expert (Glenn Ford) has to work quickly in this 72-minute film. Its one of four films that Quebec City-born Ford made that year including Fritz Langs film noir The Big Heat. The Cassandra Crossing (1976) In this seventies disaster pic with a mega-cast (Sophia Loren Lee Strasberg Richard Harris Martin Sheen O.J. Simpson Ava Gardener and Burt Lancaster) a terrorist carries a deadly plague onto a train travelling from Geneva to Stockholm. A heartless U.S. colonel (Lancaster) decides to seal the train and send it to a former Nazi concentration camp by way of rickety bridge Runaway Train (1985) The bad cargo this time is human - a couple of escaped prisoners (Jon Voight and Eric Roberts) who along with a sleeping train employee (Rebecca de Mornay) are racing through Alaska without an engineer. As with Unstoppable theres a tight curve and a chemical plant ahead. The script is based on an original screenplay by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa. Atomic Train (1999) In this two-part NBC mini-series a careless waste-disposal company decides to ship a nuclear bomb along with a trainload of explosive chemicals. When the trains brakes fail it turns into a runaway missile headed for Denver. The cast includes Rob Lowe Kristin Davis and Mena Suvari.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 12 2010 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox Denzel Washington is shown in a scene from ""Unstoppable."" Robert Zuckerman/AP Photo/20th Century Fox          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you are a filmmaker a movie about a runaway train must be an easy sell. Whatever human drama you try to pump into the plotline whatever grand statement you are attempting to make about the state of the Union the fact remains - a runaway train is a runaway train. Of course not all runaway train (or bus or subway car) movies are created equal. The best one was probably ""Runaway Train"" starring Jon Voight and Eric Roberts. (It should have been called ""Runaway Performance."") The first ""Speed"" was pretty good. One of the lesser entries was Tony Scotts recent remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Still feeling the need for speed Scott is back with the aptly named and much improved ""Unstoppable.""Scott isnt exactly Ingmar Bergman when it comes to delineating interpersonal relationships and the dialogue from writer Mark Bomback sounds as if it was devised by a computer program for beginning screenwriters. No matter. The real star here is the big unmanned freight train sparking through Pennsylvania at 70 m.p.h. while carrying hazardous cargo. Best of all the train doesnt have any dialogue. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The films ostensible stars are Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as the two railroad heroes who attempt to stop the unguided missile when all else fails. Washingtons Frank is a hardened veteran resentful of Pines Will a newbie who not only got his job through family connections but is also having marital problems. Single dad Frank meantime has two unruly daughters to fret over. (They both waitress at Hooters.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? All this backstory and more emerges while the two guys manning another train attempt a hyper-dangerous hookup with the locomotive. Its comforting to know that under such straitened circumstances its still possible to conduct a bond-a-thon.The rumbly action sequences are to my eye blessedly free of CGI effects. What you see is what you get. The kinetic energy of these scenes not to mention the stuntwork is amazing. Its easy to dispel the silliness that surrounds them - like the way Scott tries to turn ""Unstoppable"" into a tidy parable about recession-era inequities. (The rail company CEO informed during his country club golf game that the locomotive could kill thousands of people frets about the companys stock price.)Like it or not there are some things that movies do best. Movies do not generally do a great job with anything involving heavy-duty cogitation but when it comes to runaway trains the medium is peerless. All aboard Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and peril and some language.)----------More Monitor movie reviews For Colored GirlsMorning Glory127 Hours Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Unstoppable amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Morning Glory The Next Three Days >> Unstoppable Heres what a train can do hurtle down a fixed course very very fast. Heres what it cant do think scheme or gloat about being the 70-mile-an-hour villain in Tony Scotts thriller about a runaway coaster packed with chemicals thats as rail yard staffer Rosario Dawson yelps ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" There are no bad guys just bad engineering and bad PR (and of course bad luck underscored by the trains slot machine name 777.) Not that Tony Scott doesnt sweat for extra drama--under his throttle the train roars and hisses like a killer dinosaur who as its powered by fossil fuels could have its DNA pumping through the engine. Speaking of dinosaurs here comes Denzel Washington as a three-decade vet of the tracks sniping at newbie Chris Pine for general asshattery. They their 25-car train the murder train and the movie are all on a fixed course and the best thing about Scott and screenwriter Mark Bombacks popcorn flick is that it chugs away as though it never notices the whole premise (and solution) is goofy and predictable. You can practically hear the editor huff ""I think I can I think I can"" as he cranks up the suspenseful cuts and layers on loud manic music. And it works well enough thanks to a love of number-crunching that makes the audience feel engaged in a deadly algebra problem. Four miles 2000 feet Population 780000 At the same breath Scott makes fun of the heavy-panting local news and uses them to amp up the danger say with their flash animation of just what would happen if the train fell off a bridge and onto a field of oil drums. Unstoppable efficiently trucks down the tracks and if you dont have a better place to be for two hours you could do worse than spend it with Washington and Pines all-American heroes who hop off the train as if theyre just waiting for Norman Rockwell to make them famous.

Robert Zuckerman In this film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox Chris Pine left and Denzel Washington are shown in a scene from ""Unstoppable."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Robert Zuckerman) In the 20th century America built things and the landscape in places like Pennsylvania was dotted with smokestacks. A relic of that era is Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) a locomotive engineer who knows every engine on every train. So when a careless brakeman powers a trainload of hazardous materials toward a populated area with no driver on board Frank is the man to stop it.Directed by Tony Scott (""Deja Vu"") who has forged a working relationship with Washington like brother Ridleys with Russell Crowe ""Unstoppable"" is a sensational no-frills thriller with a confident star at the helm. Although its loosely based on true events the script is loaded with outrageous cliches -- which work like a gold pocket watch. Old-timer Frank is facing a layoff and has to mentor young replacement Will Colson (Chris Pine) the working-class outcast in a railroad dynasty. The skeptical veteran and the headstrong rookie are executing a routine run through steel-mill territory when the runaway train barrels past them.After a helicoptered hotshot fails to board the train Frank knows he has to throw his own train into reverse and couple with the careening time bomb before it reaches a dangerous curve in a big city. Guiding him is rail yard dispatcher Connie Hawkins (Rosario Dawson) the lone woman in a testicular operation that includes a creep at corporate headquarters (Kevin Dunn) who wants to derail the train in the boonies.Using countless cameras and points of view including news-crew reports from the route of the runaway train Scott ensures that we are always aware of the peril. That includes the personal as represented by Franks teen daughters who work at Hooters and watch the clamorous conclusion as it unfolds on television.In the midst of hard times ""Unstoppable"" is a welcome reminder that America builds at least one thing better than any other country action movies.

(20 Cent Fox/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday November 12 2010 400 AM Title Unstoppable It takes a little while to pick up speed but once Tony Scotts ""Unstoppable"" starts moving it becomes a lean efficient action flick.Though it reportedly cost 100 million the film will disappoint those looking for big-budget pyrotechnics. Despite some nice stunt work this is the couldnt-be-simpler story of two guys and a train.Denzel Washington is Frank the experienced engineer about to face forced retirement. Chris Pine is Will the arrogant young conductor whos got something to prove. He gets his chance one cold Pennsylvania morning when a slacker colleague (Ethan Suplee) neglects to secure the brakes on a freight train carrying toxic materials. Soon the train is cruising down the tracks unmanned picking up speed at an alarming pace. If no one stops it the inevitable crash will kill thousands.Enter our working-class heroes who happen to be aboard a train heading directly toward the runaway. While company honchos (Rosario Dawson Kevin Dunn) debate increasingly far-fetched strategies Frank thinks he and Will can stop the racing locomotive. Granted his plan could kill them both. But no ones got a better idea.Though the movie is loosely based in truth theres not much plot to work with. So writer Mark Bomback makes a half-hearted attempt at a back-story Frank has two teenage daughters Will is fighting a restraining order that keeps him from his family. But Scott has made enough action movies to know where to focus. (His collaborations with Washington include ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" ""Man on Fire"" and ""Crimson Tide."")Soon enough his camera is locked on above and beneath the trains capturing the screeches and roars the sparking brakes the just-hugged track curves. Even the leads defer to their mechanical co-stars though all do excellent work fleshing out barely sketched characters.With its limited scope and minimal distractions this probably isnt a trip youll remember in the long run.But if youre looking for some popcorn thrills on an otherwise dull Friday night itll definitely get you where you need to go.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Denzel Washington in ""Unstoppable."" ( ) When I heard ""Unstoppable"" featured an object going 70 mph the wrong way I assumed it was about the US economy. But this meaty manly metallurgical actioner -- forged in Vulcans furnace and starring Capt. Kirk -- more than lives up to its title. Get popcorn and flex your chomping muscles. The movie is set in ""Deer Hunter"" Pennsylvania a land of hard men and heavy work. On his first day on the job error-prone newbie train driver Will (the prodigiously bland Chris Pine of ""Star Trek"") butts heads with his veteran counterpart Frank (Denzel Washington) a guy who boasts ""28 years of railroadin."" Meanwhile nearby a simple oversight leads to a freight train trundling out of the yard at 10 mph. No big deal. Except its throttle is open its half a mile long and its pouring on speed as it heads for a certain and explosive derailment in the nearest city. Starting with the workaday routine of ordinary slobs (this is the kind of movie where a fat guy with glasses equals menace to society) director Tony Scott assembles a thrilling max-velocity disaster flick all moaning molten steel roaring choppers and 500-ton cars getting crushed like so many Pringles. Soon cops are trying to shoot the runaway trains emergency brake button (located next to the fuel tank) one bravo is trying to leap aboard from a speeding pickup truck and another seeks to Spider-Man his way down to the loco locomotive with a rappelling rope from a helicopter. Forget all that fellas The obvious solution is for Frank and Will to ignore orders from HQ back their engine car up to the runaways tail at 70 mph hook up and slam on the brakes. ""Were gonna run this bitch down"" The downside is a slight risk of being turned into man-lasagna while say joining cables between cars or standing atop this ""missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" with arms raised in defiance of the gods a la Jon Voight at the end of ""Runaway Train."" I cant decide whether Scott (""Top Gun"" ""Deja Vu"" and last years trainiac flick ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"") is the best of the bad directors or the worst of the good ones. Its useless to point out his penchant for cliche; he lives in Formulatown and hes happy there. With Scott its always go time. Bring it on and step on it and in case you miss the urgency everyone is constantly saying its go time bring it on and step on it. Capitalist goons in boardrooms (and on the golf course) do cold cost-benefit analysis. Theyre willing to risk a BP-on-rails if the alternative is a 30 percent drop in the stock price and the exasperated rail yard chief (Rosario Dawson who seems to be sitting at the same blinking-lights console Denzel used in ""Pelham"") cant talk them into the common-sense alternative of intentionally derailing the juggernaut. Scott is a manic camera-swooper; even when two guys are just sitting down having a conversation the frame is zinging around like a mosquito on Red Bull at a blood bank. Nor does anyone ever have to tell Scott to raise the stakes. Of course the wayward iron monster is loaded with enough toxins to turn the entire East Coast into a Superfund site of course its headed around a tight turn where huge fuel tanks have also been strategically placed of course it threatens to smash into another train loaded with schoolchildren. I was disappointed that Scott didnt also put the train on a collision course with the White House the Vatican and Buckingham Palace but you have to save something for the sequel. ""The pin didnt fall"" ""Hold that dynamic at four"" ""Hit that independent as hard as you can"" I have no idea what any of this means but it certainly sounds like someone did their homework and this too is pure Scott. ""Unstoppable"" is a crazy train not a lazy train. Scott masters details because authenticity frees him to be ridiculous. And he hurls himself into each new adventure as if on a mission to spare you a moments boredom. I wouldnt want to see five movies like this one each week but its a cheeky madcap joyride. ""Unstoppable"" among recent action flicks -- as Lisa Simpson once told Ralph Wiggum -- I choo-choo-choose you. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Munsters actor Butch Patrick checks into rehab for 40-ye...

"All aboard for Denzel Washington and Unstoppable - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs A seasoned train engineer (Denzel Washington) and a upstart conductor (Chris Pine) race against time to stop a half-mile-long locomotive carrying liquid explosives before it can decimate an entire city. All aboard for Denzel Washington and Unstoppable Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge 20th Century Fox How do you stop this thing? Thats what Denzel Washington an ordinary railman with an out-of-control deadly cargo on his hands needs to know. ABOUT THE MOVIEUnstoppable   (out of four) Stars Denzel Washington Chris Pine Rosario DawsonDirector Tony ScottDistributor 20th Century FoxRated PG-13 for sequence of action and peril and some language Running time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Unstoppable doesnt quite live up to its name but it clicks along briskly enough to keep you on board for an hour and a half. And ignore that sense of deja vu The last time director Tony Scott and star Denzel Washington worked together they were chasing another runaway locomotive in The Taking of Pelham 123. (Noodle this Before that they made the flop Deja Vu). But where Pelham buckled beneath the weight of a contrived plot -- and the shadow of the Walter Matthau original -- Scott has righted himself to direct one of the falls best action films. TRAILER Watch the preview If youve seen the trailers you know exactly where this film is headed. If you havent youll know its destination about five minutes in. Still with the recent dearth of good action flicks Unstoppable gathers steam with a plot thats predictable but plausible and a few old-school-filmmaking flourishes that churn the picture forward. Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine) are blue-collar railmen chasing an unmanned train that is hauling toxic chemicals and hurtling to the heart of a small Pennsylvania town. Inspired by the real story of a 47-car train that barreled through Ohio without a conductor in 2001 the film benefits from plausibility. And given the 2008 rail crash in Los Angeles that left 25 dead the mistake that slingshots Unstoppables freight is chillingly believable. Thankfully Scott and screenwriter Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard) dont settle for context. Scott is a director who loves movement and he cant help but jostle the camera even in close-up shots of the stars. But when the locomotive gathers momentum so does the picture and Scott clearly is in his element. In one scene Scott lays the camera between rail ties allowing the locomotive to grind above. The shrill gnashing of gears and metal gives the scene like many of the movies 70s-styled stunts a raw punch. Unstoppable also benefits from well-drawn characters. Pines Will is the wide-eyed neophyte a son with the bosss name if not his temperament. Washington like Jack Nicholson has gotten too big to play anything but himself confident clever always in control -- exactly what the film needs from its reluctant protagonist. Rosario Dawson is solid as the rail employee who believes in Washington and Kevin Dunn has just enough slime as an executive. The film derails briefly with some disposable plotlines including a custody battle between Will and his wife. But those stories crumble beneath the rumble of Unstoppables true star a locomotive that serves as a cast-iron missile. Scott paces the film like its mechanized star deliberately and ultimately with enough speed to keep its passengers satisfied.

"Movie review Unstoppable - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review UnstoppableDirector Tony Scott and a top-flight cast take audiences on a heart-stopping thrill ride.November 12 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Unstoppable"" is as good as its name. A runaway train drama that never slows down it fashions familiarity into a virtue and shows why old-school professionalism never goes out of style. With action auteur Tony Scott directing ""Unstoppable"" certainly features a lot that weve seen before from its vehicle-from-hell format to its venerable advertising line ""1000000 Tons 100000 Lives 100 Minutes."" Yes they still do make them that way. This is also the second straight Scott film (after the underappreciated ""The Taking of Pelham 123"") involving a train and the sixth of his career to star Denzel Washington here sharing the screen with ""Star Treks"" Chris Pine and one very out of control locomotive. But while continually doing the same kind of movie might anesthetize some directors it energizes Scott who has gotten better and better at building and sustaining traditional kinds of tension. Working with veteran colleagues like production designer Chris Seagers and editor Chris Lebenzon (who shares credit with Robert Duffy) and new teammates like cinematographer Ben Seresin Scott likes nothing better than filling the screen with movement whether it be darting helicopters police cruisers with sirens flashing or trains with minds of their own. More than that in an age when CGI images are second nature Scott prefers practical effects. He clearly enjoys having real people involved in real stunts and crashes even getting Washington and Pine to put in some time on the top of that moving locomotive (though the heaviest lifting was done by expert stuntmen Clay Donahue Fontenot and Daniel Stevens). Scott and company have also made that runaway train AWVR locomotive 777 look and sound as fearsome as one of those dinosaurs from "" Jurassic Park."" Painted bright red with an electric yellow stripe and a yellow and black cowcatcher in front this is one formidable locomotive. Written by Mark Bomback with a fine sense of potential mayhem around the next curve ""Unstoppable"" is obviously not the place to go for Oscar-winning drama but by casting top-flight performers across the board the film gets the most out of the ""inspired by true events"" pandemonium it creates. Before we so much as see a train we meet Will Colson (Pine) a young man in a Pennsylvania town unhappily sleeping on his brothers sofa because of some unspecified marital difficulties we will learn all about before the final credits roll. Colson is a newly minted conductor with four months experience on the AWVR railway and his arrival on the job is viewed with suspicion by older heads. However Colsons partner for the day veteran ""28 years on the line"" engineer Frank Barnes (Washington) may be hard but hes fair. ""I only have one rule"" Barnes says. ""Do it right and if you dont know ask."" (OK thats two rules but whos quibbling?) Barnes also believes ""if you make a mistake in training they give you an F out here you get killed"" which is a difficult argument to refute. These men try to establish a working relationship in their cab while dealing with personal issues (Colson is concerned with his estranged wife Barnes with a pair of feisty grown daughters) the scene shifts to another train yard elsewhere in Pennsylvania. There an overweight slovenly sort named Dewey (a dead-on Ethan Suplee) a guy who screams ineptitude the moment he walks on the scene screws up in a major way. Attempting to cut corners while moving engine 777 and its 39 cars he leaves the train unattended and watches in slacker horror as the beast picks up speed and heads on down the track. Even more upset than Dewey is Connie Hooper. Well-played by Rosario Dawson Hooper is the no-sense individual who runs the rail yard and shes not happy to discover what she thinks is ""a coaster"" a train without power heading out of her area. As if. It turns out that the beastly 777 is not only gearing up for a full-power speed its chock full of some of the most toxic chemicals known to man ""a missile the size of the Chrysler building"" someone hyperbolically insists that just happens to be headed toward the kind of highly populated areas it would be a shame to decimate. Most of ""Unstoppable"" involves attempts by various railroad personnel to make a liar out of the title and stop the train. There are waves of crucial split-second decisions tense moments without number and even a handful of non-catastrophic collisions calculated to keep us in our seats until Colson and Barnes decide that hey maybe we can stop this thing. Once upon a time movies like this highly professional entertainments made with enough substance to keep adults involved were a staple of the studio system but the relative lack of interest in ""Pelham 123"" has brought that into question. Old fashioned action epics like ""Unstoppable"" may not be the future of the movie business but it would be a shame if they were no more than its storied past. kenneth.turanlatimes.comlt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe evolution of The CroodsMarch 20 2013Oceanside getaway Surf seafood and the blare of train...October 24 2010Movie Review How to Train Your DragonMarch 26 2010How to Train Your Dragon and a baptism of fireMarch 14 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentLocomotiveRunaway TrainCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-unstoppable-20101112,0,2423786.story",200,unstoppable13,unstoppable,latimes

What else is there to say about a runaway train movie? It either functions or it doesnt. It either barrels ahead or derails. Fewer movie genres are simpler less forgiving or more inherently phallic; go ahead and gasp at the sight of a streamlined locomotive thrusting toward its goal with brute linear dynamism. It goes. Unstoppable is exactly that. Once it gets rolling it doesnt pause for breath and its safe to say you wont either. Just a few minutes into it after just a few scenes of blah-blah scene-setting and character introduction an idiot engineer in northern Pennsylvania accidentally sends an unmanned train barreling south on a northbound track. And then were off hurtling straight forward on uncut cinematic adrenaline. Now there are runaway trains and there are runaway trains. This one is loaded with toxic chemicals pushing 70 toward a densely populated region and -- oh yeah -- brakeless. Observes a spunky rail dispatcher played by Rosario Dawson ""Were not just talking about a train. Were talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" To make matters worse a second train full of chatty school children is headed directly for it. Fortunately (for them and for us) a third train is out on the tracks and its manned by two grinning embodiments of masculine American can-doism Chris Pine as a wet-behind-the-ears conductor and Denzel Washington as a grizzled veteran engineer. They chug along oblivious and unhurried until fate requires them to intervene at high speed. Unstoppablewas directed by testosterone merchant Tony Scott - taking a second crack at a Denzel train movie after last years overcooked underwhelmingThe Taking of Pelham 123. This is better. Leaner. It forsakes unnecessary details like say a psychologically warped villain with a handlebar mustache for an uncomplicated narrative that pits an unthinking machine versus human ingenuity and guts. Scotts usual visual tics (quick cuts hyperactive cameras superzoom close-ups) enhance the action for a change ramping up the tension as the out-of-control locomotive screams toward disaster. The film is blessedly short on CGI using actual trains on actual tracks for actual action sequences; in this over-pixelated age its an invigorating jolt to the system. At the start were informed that Unstoppable (written by Live Free or Die Hards Mark Bomback) is based on true events and it is sort of - except the events occurred in Ohio not Pennsylvania and the train never topped 47 miles per hour. But it was indeed hauling a load of toxic chemicals. It was indeed unmanned. And sometimes Hollywoods knack for exaggeration can be a gift for audiences in the market for a good-old-fashioned thrill ride something that blurs the scenery and whips us around the bend. So call it what you will. Call it Speed on a railbed or Runaway Train without the fugitives. Whatever it is its a kick in the pants. It goes. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Nike Mens Prime Hype DF II Basketball Shoes for 30 + free...

Talk about well-kept-- and welcome--surprises. Tony Scotts latest thriller turns out to be pure cinema in the classic sense of the term. Its a motion picture about motion an action symphony that gives new meaning to the notion of a one-track mind. Denzel Washington and and Chris Pine race to stop a locamotive loaded with toxic cargo in this action movie directed by Tony Scott. The premise is simple to the point of primal--a runaway freight train hurtling through Pennsylvania with a load of lethal chemicals and no one in the locomotive. On the same track heading toward it is another freight train pulled by a locomotive with the movies co-stars at the controls Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the rookie conductor. (Oh yes the runaway freight train which weighs a million tons also threatens to collide with a passenger train full of children on a school outing.) Sure the details seem absurd and the premise sounds familiar; there was even a film--an impressive achievement in its own right--called ""Runaway Train"" 25 years ago. But youve got to see this new one to appreciate how full fresh smart terse funny genuinely thrilling and ultimately original it is. More Speakeasy Interview with Unstoppable Director Tony Scott And how beautiful. One stunning image outdoes another in the hurtling circling swooping cinematography of Ben Seresin a New Zealander whose palette is restrained but never suppressed. (The imagery as a whole evokes the railroad photography of the 1930s and 1940s even though the story is set in the present or Margaret Bourke-Whites industrial photos for Life magazine.) ENLARGE Denzel Washington in the middle of the action in Unstoppable. Twentieth Century Fox And how loud. Much of the movies thunderous effect depends on subwoofers those enormously powerful speakers that can shake a theater from its floor to its rafters. Ive been a chronic complainer about assaultive sound levels in multiplex auditoriums. Action directors--including Mr. Scott--have become subwoofer junkies. They have used and abused audio technology in order to elevate countless car crashes and other collisions to pseudo-epic status. The difference here is that the films sonic underpinnings--basso signatures of gigantic machines--are justified by a drama that truly does have an epic feel. One of the movies many distinctions is an almost uncanny combination of pounding pace and carefully regulated narrative development. The catastrophe-to-be is quickly set in motion by a succession of small screw-ups each depicted concisely. Its Murphys law playing out at breathtaking speed; the only certainty is that more things will go wrong and thats the essence of suspenseful uncertainty. While the pace of events accelerates the movie keeps turning to unhurried vignettes of its main characters Mr. Pines cocky newcomer Will Colson and Mr. Washingtons vastly knowledgeable Frank Barnes. (Nearly half of the 100-minute running time flies by before they tackle their fateful task of averting catastrophe.) Here again the rookie-veteran formula is familiar yet the script a work of minimalist art by Mark Bomback turns it into something new. ""Unstoppable"" is not only a prodigy of kinetic energy but an eloquently understated tribute to working men and women who do their jobs well despite callous or incompetent managers and to older workers with irreplaceable experience--Frank Barnes being a perfect example--who face the corporate lunacy of forced retirement. The film is a celebration of expertise and in more ways than one given the example of its director. Mr. Scott has been making movies for four decades (this is his fifth with Mr. Washington) though his commercial breakthrough didnt come until ""Top Gun"" in 1986. I have long admired his technical skill and his gift for working with actors but have often recoiled from what Ive seen as frenetic style in the service of shamelessly manipulative substance. He ""holds his audience hostage to runaway technique"" I wrote last year on the occasion of his previous film which was oddly enough a hyperactive remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Its odd because ""Pelham"" was also a train movie--a hijacked-subway train movie with Mr. Washington as a Transit Authority dispatcher rather than an engineer. Yet its also fascinating because many of the same techniques that Mr. Scott has wielded with such flamboyance in the past--and with such hollow results in ""Pelham""-- come together as never before in ""Unstoppable."" His new movie has it all--a compelling idea on a par with the premise of ""Speed""; a screenplay that will resonate just as deeply as those subwoofers with a wide range of moviegoers; the romance of old-fashioned transportation; the excitement of older-fashioned special effects (live action and meticulous model work have reduced computer-generated trickery to an invisible minimum) a canvas as big as all outdoors (in contrast to the claustrophobic ""Pelham"") and a steadfast sense of reality including over-the-top TV news coverage portrayed with under-the-top authenticity--even though the movies zestful spirit leads to ever more extravagant action. (In a single dazzling scene the screen is filled with an onrushing train scores of emergency vehicles a flock of TV choppers in an azure sky and in the foreground the gyrating bodies of terrified horses.) Mr. Washington has never been more likable or convincingly heroic. Sometimes hes simultaneously intense and self-effacing proof of his own expertise in the tricky profession of being a star. ""Unstoppable"" will be a turning point in Mr. Pines career; he gives a star performance that is notable for its subtlety simplicity and unforced strength. Thanks to the bond between them the movie more than gets away with conversational interludes in which Will and Frank discuss life and love. In an exceptional cast Rosario Dawson is Connie a yardmaster who knows her stuff and has the courage to insist on it; Kevin Corrigan is an intelligent and intuitive federal safety inspector; Ethan Suplee is a dim-bulb threat to safety in the marshaling yard; Kevin Dunn is an invincibly dense manager and Lew Temple is a welder who seizes the limelight. The production was designed by Chris Seagers. Harry Gregson-Williams did the original music. The film was edited--brilliantly--by Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon. Client 9 The Rise And Fall of Eliot Spitzer This documentary explores the rise and fall of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. Say what you will about Eliot Spitzer hes a marvelous subject for a documentary and Alex Gibney has made a film worthy of him; it goes into national release Friday. The first part of the title explains itself although it may be news to you as it was to me that the high-end hookers of the Emperors Club VIP were ranked by diamonds instead of stars and just like any consumer product on Amazon.com rated by user reviews. (The client number was revealed by a federal affidavit in the case against the club.) The titles second part is obvious too though no rise in contemporary politics was ever swifter and no fall more ignominious. The surprises in Mr. Gibneys movie are its subjects candor limited mainly by the rigidity of his personality and the strength of its contention that Mr. Spitzer was brought down not only by his sexual follies but by the formidable enemies he made on the way up. ENLARGE Silda Spitzer and her embattled husband Eliot in Client 9. Magnolia Pictures For anyone interested in those follies--that means pretty much everyone doesnt it?--""Client 9"" offers a dramatized reading of an account provided by the hooker he favored not Ashley Dupre who has made a media career out of a one-night stand but a woman who called herself Angelina during the time the former Sheriff of Wall Street was governor of New York. Since Angelina declined to be on camera her words are performed by a bright and attractive actress (Wrenn Schmidt) who may have made her real-life character a bit too bright though maybe not; Angelinas physical allure is never at issue. For those interested in high-end politics a sport that makes professional football look polite the film offers an incomparable gallery of rogues knaves and self-styled knights. At center stage is Mr. Spitzer of course managing to be marginally less off-putting than you might imagine. We also meet Joe Bruno a former majority leader of the New York State Senate; Hank Greenberg the former head of AIG; Ken Langone a billionaire businessman and a former director of the New York Stock Exchange and the political consultant and dirty trickster Roger Stone. Men like these the movie shows must not be taken on lightly. Morning Glory Rachel McAdams Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford star in ""Morning Glory"" a comedy about the cast of a struggling television morning show. In this silly comedy which was directed by Roger Michell from a scatterbrained script by Aline Brosh McKenna a spunky young TV producer persuades a grumpy living legend to co-anchor an early-morning talk show. The producer Becky is played by Rachel McAdams whos perfectly lovely when shes allowed to be calm. Unfortunately she doesnt get her allowance until the very end when all is lost. The living legend a cross between Edward R. Murrow and Mike Wallace is played by Harrison Ford whose grumpiness seems hermetic and complete; did no one tell him it was OK to be a tiny bit likable? (Jeff Goldblum as an executive at Beckys failing network plays morose by looking morose.) This production is a mess for many reasons most of them having to do with its frantic efforts to be funny. And Ms. McAdams isnt the only offender on this count Diane Keatons longtime morning host is frantic too. The most basic of the movies problems though is its confusion about who Becky is. The heroine as presented is an entry-level monster a younger version of the network executive played by Faye Dunaway in ""Network."" Beckys ambition knows no bounds; neither does her appetite for trivial programming. Yet the writer and director seem to think that shes mostly adorable and pull her back from the brink of self-knowledge. ""Morning Glory"" turns the dubious trick of trivializing trivialization. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com. DVD FOCUS Man on Fire (2004) ENLARGE Tony Scott directed this revenge fantasy from a sharp-witted script by Brian Helgeland. Denzel Washington is Creasy a has-been assassin who hires on in Mexico City as the bodyguard of a precocious 9-year-old named Pita (Dakota Fanning). The first part deals affectingly with a growing bond between the child and her protector. The second sparked by Pitas kidnapping and apparent death at the hands of her abductors is a long blast of brutal energy. Mr. Scotts game here is high-intensity manipulation. You may not like it but you know youve seen action after hes finished working you over. Star Trek (2009) Chris Pine plays the young James Kirk in J.J. Abramss elegant return to the legends beginnings. Each of the now-iconic members of the USS Enterprises crew gets rising-star treatment but in the best of the productions bold strokes Leonard Nimoy closes the circle by giving a lovely layered performance in the role he said hed never play again. Thanks to the intricate manipulation of time (which is as always barely fathomable) the elder Spock dubbed Spock Prime does not merely come on board but serves as the movies heart and soul. The Notebook (2004) Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are passionate young lovers Allie and Noah while Gena Rowlands and James Garner are the elders they become. (Theyre near the end of their days and her memory is almost gone.) Ripe with feeling and lush with physical beauty this love story swings confidently between age and youth--though youth is its main focus--and avoids every trap along the way. Nick Cassavetes directed impeccably from an adaptation by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi of a novel by Nicholas Sparks. Robert Fraisse was the cinematographer. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Unstoppable in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers."" The selling points here are jolts. And this movie delivers so hard it shoots off sparks. Washington ignites as Frank Barnes a veteran engineer with two college-age daughters (the sweeties work Hooters to help defray tuition costs) and an attitude toward his mouthy new conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) also with temper issues at home. Washington and Pine go way beyond white-knuckle duty goading each other with tasty humor and unexpected feeling. But the focus is on a freight train carrying toxic chemicals. The train is unmanned on the loose and gaining speed. If it jumps the rails the population of Stanton Pennsylvania is roadkill including cute little tykes. The Twelve Must-See Fall Movies Peter Travers runs down a golden dozen -- and five flicks to skip. Does the script really stoop that low to build tension? Duh. Yardmaster Connie Hooper (a fierce first-rate Rosario Dawson) must figure out what to do just like Washington did in Pelham. Every movie junkie knows the answer. Get Washington and Pine on board the runaway train and let Scott run every trick in his stunt arsenal until they save the day. Unstoppable is a bang-up ride that means to wring you out.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The last time action director Tony Scott focused on rail transportation the result was the botched subway thriller ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" In ""Unstoppable"" hes back on the right track and running at full throttle. This is a terrific sweaty men-on-a-mission adventure with heroic blue-collar railwaymen pencil-pushing bureaucrats and hotheads in the head office battling to halt an unmanned runaway train. Its based on an actual event in 2001 a 47-car CSX train with a cargo of toxic chemicals -- but no engineer in the locomotive -- careened across three counties in Ohio before it was brought under control. ""Unstoppable"" ups the ante with spectacular car wrecks a derailment and helicopter stunts yet its filmed with a great sense of authenticity. Scotts film is a superb blend of crowd-pleasing hokum and tense realism. The vibrations and noise and chaos of the collisions are the real McCoy. Scott mostly avoided computer-generated effects in favor of shooting real vehicular carnage. Its crash-tastic. Screenwriter Mark Bomback paces the tale well establishing the setting and characters vividly before increasing the momentum. The movie starts small with an engineer jumping out of his cab to throw a switch as Engine 777 coasts through the rail yard. When he stumbles trying to re-enter the locomotive his fellow engineers have a horse laugh. Its embarrassing for the hapless driver but the trains safety devices will kick in and bring 777 to a halt. Only they dont. Through a perfect alignment of human and mechanical failures the train jogs across northern Pennsylvania then races then rockets. When a fathead executive pooh-poohs the seriousness of the situation dispatcher Rosario Dawson bellows ""Its not a train; its a missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" Like last summers ""Unleash the Kraken"" this is a movie quote destined for immortality as a singles bar pickup line. Apart from a couple of shameless sequences using a trainload full of schoolchildren and a horse trailer stuck on the tracks to generate cheap suspense ""Unstoppable"" is a solid believable story. UNSTOPPABLE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of action and peril and some language. The plots few stumbles are balanced by the scope and skill of the whole thing. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are solid as ticked-off railroad men. Washington is being pushed into early retirement so that younger cheaper conductors like the inexperienced Pine can take over. They dont much like each other but when their milk run puts them near the cannonballing 777 they ride off to face destiny. The actors are fantastic at creating empathy for what could have been a couple of stock working stiffs. As usual Washington is Mr. Composure cool in the face of impending catastrophe. What the hell his girls are grown his wife is gone and now his career is over. His eerie got-nothing-to-lose calm freaks out greenhorn Pine who was sort of hoping to live long enough to reconcile with his own estranged wife. The two do a bit of manly bonding as they put themselves in harms way. Hashing out their personal subplots doesnt give the story scope; its the weakest element of a taut yarn. The film cant stay lost in the weeds for long though; theres a zillion gallons of chemical doom hurtling toward Dead Mans Curve on sparking squealing steel wheels. Pine and Washington both get big hero moments filmed with kinesthetic impact; when they braced to leap between boxcars I felt the tendons in my legs tighten. Along with the drama and visual excitement theres an undercurrent of working-class resentment percolating through the film. The villain of the tale is the train a destructive unfeeling beast that becomes as much a character as the shark in ""Jaws."" But the secondary bad guy is the incompetent executive overseeing the crisis. He sees the emergency more as a matter of potential stock devaluation than a disaster in the making. Next to halting the train we want to see him get his comeuppance and Scott delivers. The real heroes here are the bullheaded grunts who appear as liabilities on his balance sheet. Theyre unstoppable.

Before you can yelp ""Yo moron"" the train has started rolling away. And its picking up speed.Toss in 150 school kids on a field trip to learn about rail safety (ha) a deadly curve of elevated track in the bustling burg of Stanton a CEO looking to cut budgets and a bunch of state troopers in fierce (and futile) pursuit and you have the makings of a real crisis.To wit Ms. Dawson in a role requiring much knitting of brow and pulling back of hair ""Were not just talking about a train here. Were talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler building bound for highly populated areas""Luckily theres veteran train man Frank Barnes (Washington) who thinks he might be able to chase down the runaway skyscraper I mean locomotive link up to it from the rear apply the brakes and slow the thing down. His reluctant partner in this heroic enterprise is Will Colson (Chris Pine) a rookie conductor with a messy personal life.It takes awhile for the old man and the novice to come to terms - generational friction dueling work ethics general grousing. But by the end the two are a virtual daredevil team hopping cars and couplings at 60 m.p.h. risking life and limb to stop the train while its still on the rails.Scott shoots and edits Unstoppable with roller-coaster momentum and an eye (and ear) on that roaring tonnage of steel. There are fast jerky cuts thundering sound effects angles that play up the trains size and speed. An old hand at TV commercials Scott digs into his kit bag and comes up with enough visual and aural tricks to keep audiences attention as Mark Bombacks thoroughly unsurprising script plays itself out.Although Unstoppable was made well before Deepwater Horizon went kablooey in the gulf its hard not to see parallels between the out-of-control oil rig and the out-of-control train lax oversight cost-cutting numskulls with their hands on the switch (or not on the switch).So where were Denzel Washington and Tony Scott when we really needed them?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

All it means is that movies should move and that when all is said and done we pay our five cents or 10 dollars to be transported by the illusion of objects hurtling through space. This is why there are so many trains in movies from 1903s ""The Great Train Robbery on and this is why ""Unstoppable whose sole premise is right there in the title works like a well-oiled charm. Theres a train. It cant be stopped. What else do you really need to know?Just to gild the lily this runaway train is carrying 39 cars of toxic goo straight across the countryside toward a nasty curve at the bridge in Stanton Pa. pop. 10000 or so. The throttle is stuck wide open and the air brakes have malfunctioned. Oh and theres a trainload of 150 schoolchildren up ahead. How the filmmakers resisted hiring Taylor Swift for a cameo as a cancer patient tied to the tracks is beyond me.Instead weve got Denzel Washington -- in his fifth film for director Tony Scott and his second on a train after last years ""The Taking of Pelham 123 -- as Frank Barnes an engineer with 28 years on the job. Of course hes about to retire. Of course hes stuck with a hotheaded rookie partner in Will Colson (Chris Pine of ""Star Trek). And of course theyre the only ones out there on the line with the know-how and guts to save central Pennsylvania from atomization (or a nasty cough; its never quite clear).This is a preposterous story line pure B-movie junk food and the fact that it actually happened -- in 2001 in Ohio -- is frosting on an already tasty Ring Ding. Scott and screenwriter Mark Bomback dig into that heartland realism The characters are all working stiffs from the lazy rail yard schmoe (Ethan Suplee) who sets the catastrophe in motion to the companys designated troubleshooter Ned (Lew Temple) a mouthy sparkplug whose haircut announces that the 1970s never ended. Even the movies villain a high-up suit at headquarters (Kevin Dunn) used to be a yardman.True in no possible universe would a railway nerve-center dispatcher look like Rosario Dawson an actress about whom your reviewer cannot be nor ever has been objective. Her character Connie is the one who has to stand in front of all those blinking maps and shout things at Frank and Will over the radio. Shes capable and believably stressed; youre glad shes there even if shes the movies one concession to glamour.Otherwise ""Unstoppable is exactly the kind of movie Tony Scott should make more often an unabashed genre flick with a job to do and characters bent on doing it. No time for speechifying or macho heroics This ones simply about a group of underappreciated professionals taking care of business at 70 miles per hour. Frank and Will arent superhuman but flawed and stubborn men; in character terms theyre the little engines that could.Still two guys versus a train -- how exciting is that? Surprisingly very. Scott calls in his skills as a meat-and-potatoes moviemaker and ""Unstoppable is edited for maximum impact without showboating. The central situation sustains the drama and the way its filmed and when that situation is over sos the movie. More films should be this enjoyably functional.Taking a page from Steven Spielbergs ""Duel ""Unstoppable anthropomorphizes the runaway train where it can using camera angles and the sound mix to create the ""character of an arrogant fume-belching behemoth that bisects all the human busy-ness -- news copters and cop cars and our heroes driving backward as fast as they can -- in a clean and vicious line.The runaways assigned number? 777 as close to the devil as you can get without giving away the game. ""Unstoppable gives that devil its due.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Embellished on a true story Tony Scotts Unstoppable has the fundamental elements of a good meat-and-potatoes thriller a runaway freight train careening down the main line a couple of likeable blue-collar types tasked with stopping it and a tight 90-plus minutes to get the job done. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine have a nice low-key rapport as a veteran engineer and a neophyte conductor thrown into danger on their first day working with each other and the film slowly skillfully builds tension on a steady escalation of mishaps. Yet Scott who never met a movie he couldnt overstylize has trouble staying out of his own way and his screenwriter Mark Bomback keeps adding stock situations and dumbed-down language to steer the drama toward bland convention. Its an unnecessary struggle between the streamlined punchy movie it should be and the more slovenly indulgent movie it is. The early scenes are promising as employees at a Pennsylvania train yard go about their daily business speaking in a lingo a general audience will understand without necessarily knowing the specific words. (This as opposed to later when an unmanned train carrying toxic chemicals is likened to ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building."") Pine plays the new kid on the job a conductor four months off training who draws suspicion because of family connections. Close to being forced into early retirement without full benefits Washington has every reason to resent the new kid but the two settle into a tense but productive working relationship. When low-level ineptitude at a northern train yard sends an unmanned train in their direction and every attempt to stop it fails Pine and Washington carry out a high-risk plan to keep disaster from striking. As long as Unstoppable stays on the train its queasily effective. Washington and Pine have a strong often funny chemistry the dramatic stakes are raised incrementally and the interplay between the two leads and the professionals on the other end (played by Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan) feels authentic. But Scott and Bomback have both men hauling needless personal baggage (Pines marriage is on the rocks Washington flaked on his daughters birthday). They use local news coverage as plain-language exposition and have two full cheering sections (including one at a Hooters) to root the rescuers on. In a taut thriller like Unstoppable any additions are a subtraction.

"Unstoppable Bullet train | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUnstoppable Bullet trainUnstoppable reunites director Tony Scott and actor Denzel Washington for their fifth adventure a runaway train thriller that never leaves the track.Denzel Washingtons grace under pressure serves him well in the kinetic Unstoppable.  (Robert Zuckerman / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 11 2010 Unstoppable (out of 4) Starring Denzel Washington Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Tony Scott. At major theatres. 98 minutes. PG Back away from the keyboard and put your hands where I can see them. You dont want to be Googling the ""inspired by real events"" story behind Unstoppable a runaway train thriller starring Denzel Washington Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson that has momentum to spare. The plot can be described in short whistle blasts -- Must Stop Train -- and you dont want to risk ruining the superb suspense by finding out what actually happened in the spring of 2001. Thats when an unmanned freight train later known as ""Crazy Eights"" (because of its 8888 numerical designation) left a rail yard in Toledo Ohio and barreled 106 kilometres south pulling thousands of gallons of highly toxic molten phenol acid. Derailment = catastrophe. Unstoppable gooses the story -- the speed and distance travelled are greater the risks more terrifying the heroism more heroic -- but the script by Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard) sticks to the blunt facts. Director Tony Scott shoots much of the film as a series of television news reports which makes it feel at times that were watching live TV complete with a CNN-style thunder score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Washington teams with Scott for the fifth time the second in a row with a railway terror theme (after last years The Taking of Pelham 123 remake). The two dont always strike gold together but this time they certainly have harnessing Scotts kinetic filmmaking with Washingtons laconic grace under pressure. Theres no mustache-twirling villain in Unstoppable but there are a series of jackasses and weasels who allow a single mistake to escalate into rolling Armageddon. It begins when portly engineer Dewey (Ethan Suplee) accidentally puts his locomotive into full throttle before foolishly leaping out of the cab to flip a track switch. He watches helplessly as the driverless train escapes him and the yard but observant yardmaster Connie Hooper (Dawson) assures him the ""coaster"" will soon be stopped. She couldnt be more wrong but she proves to be a dab hand at colour commentary describing the loco locomotive as ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building."" That aint no coaster after all. Meanwhile on another train on the same track veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Washington) is gruffly showing the ropes to recent locomotive school grad Will Colson (Pine) and the sparks are flying. Know-it-all Barnes resents his impending early retirement after 28 years on the rails. At least his daughters are doing him proud by holding down steady jobs at that all-American emporium known as Hooters. Cant-tell-me Colson resents being patronized by an oldtimer while at the same time being victimized by the justice system (for a family melodrama that plays wanly in the background). Speaking of victims the films central metaphor about a downsized America and out-of-control capitalism is laughingly underscored by Kevin Dunns corporate apparatchik Galvin who worries more about his rolling stock than he does about peoples lives. For shame None of this can match the rush of that train just ripping through the Pennsylvania countryside heading towards certain oblivion once it reaches the tangled tracks of civilization. That is unless cranky Frank and uppity Will can find a way to stop it with or without management approval. Being an explosive personality himself Scott really knows how to ratchet up the tension with lots of fast cuts and relentless action. He puts innocent schoolchildren frightened horses and brave railway men in jeopardy all down the line but the sadism is forgivable. You cant stop runaway adrenaline.

Comments Unstoppable Recommended Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2010 After human error sends a 39-car freight train unmanned and loaded with toxic chemicals racing through southern Pennsylvania a couple of working stiffs--longtime train engineer Denzel Washington and new political hire Chris Pine--valiantly set off in hot pursuit. This hard-charging action thriller is based on a 2001 incident that took place in Ohio and the story gives action director Tony Scott (Domino Man on Fire The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3) a chance to show his stuff without endless bullets and blood; in fact the only shots fired in the entire movie are from marksmen trying to hit a trip switch on the passing train. Screenwriter Mark Bomback doesnt do much with the backstory scenes linking Pine and Washington to their worried families but the main story is gripping flawlessly paced and nicely grounded in operational detail.

"Unstoppable review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The runaway train that could Michael PhillipsTribune movie critic No matter how blue-collar or red-meat the story director Tony Scotts movies revel in his luxe glossy yet easily distracted technique that ensures every shot is trailer-ready and every fractured moment strives for maximum coolness. Hes an old-school cliche-hugger with a determined set of tricks that generally work for him chief among them close-ups so close you feel like a dermatologist looking for warning signs.The runaway train thriller ""Unstoppable"" is one of his better films. Even if you resist Scotts brand of visual storytelling proudly and persistently derived from TV commercials this one charges down the track merrily unburdened by exposition. Unmanned freight trains loose. Must be stopped. Veteran train engineer Denzel Washington and newbie Chris Pine are on the job. Questions? I cant believe we wasted even that much time on the plot. Scotts previous film was the remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" The train in that film mostly stayed still. The train in ""Unstoppable"" does not. For the most part -- spoiler alert -- it cannot be stopped not even by Scotts insatiable lust for telephoto lensing an approach that mashes whatevers on screen at the moment (and ""a moment"" is the average shot length) into a dense pile-up of faces machines movement and smoky menace.The faces and the machines kill the 99 minutes nicely thanks. In a Pennsylvania rail yard human error ( Ethan Suplee plays the railroad schmo who causes the problems) sends a 39-car freight train loaded with ""very toxic highly combustible"" chemicals on its way flying through crossings (170 crossings make for a lot of potential carnage) grunting and wailing in its amped-up snarly-beast sound effects like a mechanical Kraken. (Ken J. Johnson provided ""additional train sounds."") Only way to stop the unstoppable with an odd-couple pair of Bickersons ready for a road trip by train. Washingtons character has a couple of daughters who work at Hooters. Why is this? Because if he didnt ""Unstoppable"" would be mostly shots of trains or of Rosario Dawson talking tough as the yardmaster. Once the railroad company executives (shown golfing in carefree plutocratic manner) realize they may have some trouble on their hands they attempt a planned derailment. Frank played by Washington knows this wont cut it. Most of ""Unstoppable"" has Frank and Pines moody cuss named Will going rogue and whizzing along in a locomotive in reverse trying to catch up with the runaway and bring it to heel.Why does the film work? Simplicity. In its slicked-up way ""Unstoppable"" likely will find favor with diversion-seekers (and train buffs) of various ages and political persuasions. The threats of unemployment the roiling discontent with the recession a hint of Tea Party-stained rage The movie written by Mark Bomback in yellow highlighter catches a distinct nervous breeze while (rightly) offering up its working-class heroes as well heroes. Washington couldnt hit a false note if he tried; Pine whose character is trying to get his marriage back together keeps up solidly and Dawsons dispatcher brooks no weaselly nonsense from the company overlord played as a walking sneer (but subtly) by Kevin Dunn.The real-life incident that inspired the film? In May 2001 a CSX Transportation locomotive chugged across 66 miles worth of northwest Ohio with no one at the controls. Top speed 47 mph. No injuries. Well. We knew that would never hold for the movie version.mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of action and peril and some language)Cast Denzel Washington (Frank); Chris Pine (Will); Rosario Dawson (Connie); Ethan Suplee (Dewey); Kevin Dunn (Galvin); Kevin Corrigan (Inspector Werner); Lew Temple (Ned)Credits Directed by Tony Scott; written by Mark Bomback; produced by Julie Yorn T Scott Mimi Rogers Eric McLeod and Alex Young.

Unstoppable Good Director Tony Scott. Cast Denzel Washington Chris Pine Rosario Dawson. Rating PG-13 for sequences of action and peril and some language. Spotlight Denzel Washington Qamp;A Chris Pine | Tony Scott Thats good news for audiences if bad news for the characters who are trying to stop an unmanned runaway train hurtling through central Pennsylvania. It weighs a million tons its the length of a skyscraper and its carrying material hazardous enough to wipe out a goodly chunk of any heavily populated area it derails in. It is essentially as one character says a missile and its heading for disaster. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are the only hope of stopping it. Its always helpful to have a couple of movie stars on hand. Essentially thats it. But director Tony Scott working from a script by Mark Bomback throws in just enough about the lives of the people working to stop the train to flesh out the story. Its not exactly an intellectual exercise but ""Unstoppable"" is a hoot. Frank (Washington) is an old hand a veteran engineer whose co-workers dont think much of Will (Pine) whose family has long worked for the railway. Frank and his pals smell nepotism and Wills cavalier attitude toward the job doesnt do much to change their view of him. Will is assigned to work with Frank on a routine run. Meanwhile thanks to the spectacular sloth and ineptitude of Dewey (Ethan Suplee) an engineer a train gets away from the yard without anyone on board. Normally this wouldnt be a big deal - if Dewey had bothered to connect the air brakes. Connie (Rosario Dawson) the yardmaster quickly runs out of ideas and options as the train gathers speed. Naturally a train full of schoolkids is farther down the track but thats a bit of a red herring. More dramatic is the tug of war between Connie and her boss Galvin (Kevin Dunn) a typical corporate blowhard who measures impending disaster in terms of dollar signs not lives lost. Enter Frank and Will who have spent the morning trying each others patience as Frank tries to break in his young charge who isnt much interested in hearing any advice. It becomes clear - later than it might and despite the asinine objections of Galvin - that Franks experience and Wills moxie combined with Connies coolness under pressure are all that stands in the way of a major tragedy. Scott makes liberal use of television news coverage - its a 20th Century Fox film so naturally Fox News is on the case - to frame the story. (A spectacular attempt at getting a former Marine on board the train by helicopter is especially thrilling.) But he also supplies Frank and Will with enough of a back story consisting mostly of complicated family lives to make them more than the stock figures that Dewey and Galvin are. People care about them; by extension so do we. Dawson is as good as shes ever been as Connie the fiery calm in the center of the storm. Washington and Pine meanwhile have a nice chemistry; its probably not reading too much into things to imagine that Franks firm but friendly tutelage doubles for the actors experience in making the film. Washington has settled into a bemused comfort that serves him well in this role (and most others as well). ""Unstoppable"" is inspired by actual events so if you care to look it up you can figure out how it ends. You can probably figure it out if you dont look it up too. With a movie like this trying to guess how it ends isnt the point. Enjoying the ride is and on that front ""Unstoppable"" delivers. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Unstoppable (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Unstoppable (PG-13) Thriller never picks up any real speed Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/10/2010 Editor rating 2 An action thriller seriously devoid of action or thrills the curiously sluggish Unstoppable is the slowest talkiest movie youll ever see about a runaway freight train loaded with toxic chemicals. Screenwriter Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard) loosely based his premise on a true incident In 2001 an unmanned train carrying harmful dyes and paints thundered at full throttle through 66 miles of Ohio track before it was successfully stopped. Director Tony Scott toning down the seizure-inducing camera swirls and machine-gun edits of Domino and Man on Fire focuses on three protagonists while recreating the scenario Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) a veteran train-yard worker with more than 20 years on the job; Will Colson (Chris Pine) a rookie whose newbie status earns him much mockery and many jabs and Connie Hopper (Rosario Dawson) a train-traffic controller who oversees the various engines and track lines. Washington and Pine are kept off-screen for large chunks of the first half of Unstoppable their characters unaware of the unfolding crisis -- or that their train happens to be headed for a collision with the run-amok juggernaut. The actors get a lot more to do in the admittedly brisk second half of Unstoppable but the filmmakers come up with a surprisingly small number of cliffhanger scenarios involving the speeding locomotive 1985s Runaway Train although a dramatically different picture did infinitely more exciting things with its premise. Unstoppable picks up some speed as it hurtles toward its predictable conclusion but the acceleration comes too late. No matter how many times Scott has his cameras circle his actors to lend the film a sense of barreling motion you rarely feel as if this train has even left the station.

Its all speed sound and fury -- and in that Tony Scott is the right man for the job. During conversations or straightforward exposition Scotts camera bounces and jostles impatiently like an overactive child but once the story accelerates to full throttle his frenetic style fits well as the cuts per minute ratchet up along with the miles per hour. The characters are types if ones relevant to the current economy. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine play working-class heroes thrown together to halt the renegade freight Ones a railway veteran forced into retirement the others a rookie from a family of means trading in his blue blood for a blue collar. And the only real villain besides physics is corporate hubris. But these recession-resonant touches zoom by as fast as the scenery; there isnt time for much commentary in a movie so high-velocity.

"Unstoppable | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unstoppable ) Unstoppable (United States 2010) November 10 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Unstoppable a 95-minute thrill ride from director Tony Scott delivers the right level of adrenaline. Unfortunately the sheer exhilaration is dampened somewhat by an overreliance upon action/thriller stock situations and characters. When the production concentrates on the action which includes dangerous activities and a race against time Unstoppable delivers. However the incorporation of clichA(c)d back stories for key characters a fractious relationship between the protagonists and an unnecessary villain - all elements lifted from the Screenwriters Handbook - provide moments of unwelcome and unnecessary annoyance. Its a difficult thing to craft a motion picture in which the bad guy is a runaway train. Theres no way to put a human face on the antagonist - its soulless and uncaring. The central struggle is therefore more impersonal. Some movies of this ilk are assembled better than others but the crutches filmmakers rely upon in these circumstances are often not as effective as they might wish. Unstoppable reminds me of Twister although its fractionally more suspenseful and considerably less cheesy. Still it employs a contrived conflict between the protagonists and throws in a human opponent (in this case a petty bureaucrat) rather than having faith that the story stripped to its essentials can stand on its own. We dont need to know that Will Colson (Chris Pine) is fighting a restraining order filed by his wife in order to appreciate the chances he takes. We dont need to understand that the love of his two daughters is what motivates Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) to risk his life. The initial bickering between the two characters does not make their eventual cooperation more meaningful. And as villains go Kevin Dunn is reduced to irrelevancy by a very big very fast-moving train. Unstoppable is ""inspired by true events"" which is a technically accurate statement although considerable license has been taken to amplify the tension and make the situation more cinematic. The historical basis for Unstoppable is a May 15 2001 incident in which an unmanned CSX train became a runaway covering 66 miles in Ohio in under two hours before being stopped in a manner similar (albeit less dramatic) to what is depicted in the movie. Many of the specifics - how the train ended up under power without anyone on board how the police reacted and what the railway operators did to minimize injuries and damage - reflect what happened in the real world. The characters however are completely made-up. Will is a rookie and Frank is a veteran and therein lies the kernel of their mutual disdain. Will doesnt like being looked down upon for his inexperience; Frank is annoyed because the company is bringing on board low-paid inexperienced workers to replace lifers like him. While these two are in the ""getting to know you"" phase of their relationship bad things are happening elsewhere on the main line a series of mishaps and errors results in an unmanned train leaving its station and accelerating to an alarming speed. At first its thought to be a ""coaster"" that can be easily overtaken and stopped. It doesnt take long however for train dispatcher Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) to realize the train is not only under power but is rushing headlong into a heavily populated area - and (of course to up the ante) that several of the cars are filled with toxic flammable chemicals. Will and Frank are on a collision course with the train and if they can survive their game of chicken they may be the only hope of stopping it before it heads for certain derailment in the midst of a Pennsylvania city with a population of 750000. Tony Scott who is arguably one of the most uneven action/thriller directors working today is at the top of his game for this movie. He keeps the visual flourishes to a minimum and relies sparingly on handheld shots. The films look is clean and almost classical with well framed shots and not a lot of quick cutting. Some visual variety is provided by incorporating local ""newscast footage."" Scott frequently films the train from in front and below enhancing its menace and the sound effects make it sound like an angry beast as it roars past. The situation is carefully explained so it becomes clear theres more at stake than the lives of two men. At times Unstoppable plays like an inverted Speed with the mandate of getting the trains speed below a threshold to avoid disaster. Its almost impossible to write about a runaway train movie without mentioning Andrei Konchalovskys 1985 thriller Runaway Train. The two films are actually quite different with Runaway Train focusing on escaping an impending disaster while this one is about averting it. Nevertheless the clock is ticking in both narratives and the level of suspense ramps up the closer things come to the point of no return. Scott smartly keeps the running time short and avoids spending too much time on the distracting made-up back stories and character interaction. Unstoppable is about racing to cheat disaster and for the most part thats where the filmmakers keep the focus. The goal is to elevate the heart rate and produce a few nail marks on armrests. Because it achieves that its easy to forgive the occasional detour to the cinematic scrap pile of stock parts to plug certain narrative holes. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are confident and relaxed in these roles embodying all thats necessary for a working class hero. Name recognition is an important reason for their casting but their presence aids in identification with the characters. Ultimately in the face of the awesome power of a half-mile long train barreling along at 70 mph the efforts of two men seems a paltry thing and its the combined sense of heroism and desperation with high stakes that offers Unstoppable at least a chance of fulfilling the promise of its name at the box office.

As the driverless locomotive begins gathering speed across rural Pennsylvania bedecked with autumn leaves it crosses through blue-collar hamlets full of hard-working men and women loyal dogs and fresh-cut grass. And it is from those plain-spoken beer-drinking family-loving folk that two heroic railway workers shall break the rules and pursue that runaway train with their own locomotive while the FOX News TV choppers whirl admiringly overhead.Two heroes one young and white (Chris Pine) the other mature and black (Denzel Washington). Two heroes Will unhappily separated from his wife and son; and Frank a widower forced into early retirement by his employer of 28 years. But still they go after the errant train because its the right thing to do. They dont need elitists or big government or special interests to provide orders or advice. Enough with this talk of physics and math and timetables--lets go get that trainOh do you need to be told this is a Tony Scott film? Last year the hectic action auteur did subways in his The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 remake; this year hes aboveground. Train movies are as old as the movies themselves and its almost impossible to make a boring railroad flick. We expect--and Scott duly delivers--scenes of trains smashing through cars trains smacking into other trains and people trying to jump aboard moving trains from helicopters trucks and other moving trains. When stalled on the tracks a trailer full of thoroughbreds has to be pulled whinnying out of harms way only then does the otherwise obvious Unstoppable miss an obvious rail/pursuit combination Denzel Washington on a horseSadly this is not to be though Frank eventually ends up on top of the train leaping manfully from one boxcar to the next just as we expect. And the rest of the story (written by Mark Bomback) proceeds just as we expect too. Its like a mashup of classic commercials for Ford pickup trucks Bud Lite and Hooters (where God help us Franks daughters are working their way through college). Franks credo is ""If ya gonna do something do it right."" Wills motivation is to keep the train from derailing in his hometown where his estranged wife and child lie innocently sleeping next to a fuel depot. And yes since you ask There is a train full of schoolchildren on the same track headed right toward the runaway train (Still I was disappointed that Scott didnt also add a caboose full of adorable puppies. Michael Bay wouldve added puppies.)Pine away from the helm of the USS Enterprise adequately conveys a sense of tetchy insecurity as the junior partner in the chase. (Wills union connections got him the initial railroad job and he isnt sure he deserved it.) Oscar on the mantel Washington coasts comfortably in his role. His attitude of ""You damn runaway trains get offa my law"" is a lot less grouchy than say Harrison Ford at the same point in his career. Frank just smiles at his inept railroad bosses and gets the job done.And apart from one sympathetic manager (Rosario Dawson) the suits are corporate weasels who--no surprise--value profits over people. Still Scott doesnt exactly take them to task A CEO is briefly glimpsed on a golf course muttering into a cell phone about a potential 100 million loss and diminished share prices but hes never seen again never held accountable.In Unstoppable cheerful can-do populists save the day but its also the little guy whom the movie ultimately blames for the mishap. A preview audience hoorayed at the postscript stating how the dumb doughy culprit was fired and today works in fast food. Never mind how thats the only alternative to a blue-collar job in some parts of the country. Never mind how a culture of cost-cutting has contributed to several rail-freight accidents in the last two decades--including the actual CSX near-disaster that inspired this movie. A Pennsylvania toxic-waste derailment occurred six months before that event then again six months later in New York during which time CSX reported record profits and its CEO went to work in the regulation-averse Bush administration.

TWITTER Director Tony Scott may have missed his mark by a bit on his last cinematic train ride with ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" but he hits his target dead-on in ""Unstoppable."" The best blue collar action movie in who knows how long this tense narrowly focused thriller about a runaway freight train has a lean and pure simplicity to it that is satisfying in and of itself. But in its incidental portrait of discontented and discounted working stiffs who live marginal lives on societys sidings and are angry to varying degrees the film carries an unexpected weight and could connect with Middle American audiences in a big way. Arriving so soon after the Nov. 2 elections Unstoppable would seem to uncannily embody the mood reflected in the results; life seems fractured and out of joint theres a testiness in the way people relate to one another friction between classes is worse than before and the future looks bleak. And yet one senses an innate underlying optimism; perhaps the nation is down but it should never be counted out with the film suggesting that the common people can deliver the goods as they always have. None of this was likely intended as the raison detre of Mark Bombacks screenplay but it massively strengthens the film Scott has made for anyone who cares to notice. First and foremost however its a crackling rip-snorter in which the moans groans sparking metal and sheer force of the train produce an intense visceral reaction for nearly the full 99-minute running time. Inspired by a real story from 2001 of a 47-car train carrying toxic molten phenol acid that left the yard without an engineer on board and charged through Ohio for more than two hours before it was boarded and brought under control the script features working class characters who are uniformly pissed off and carry their bad attitudes to work. On this given day in central Pennsylvania Will (Chris Pine) a young man whose wife has obtained a restraining order against him is assigned as conductor on a freight run with veteran engineer Frank (Denzel Washington) whose college-age daughters work at Hooters but who otherwise keeps his problems to himself. Wills youth and family political connections do nothing to endear him to Franks circle of grizzled veterans at the train yard where morale seems very low indeed. In fact it is incompetence and a cavalier ""whatever"" attitude that triggers the crisis when a slovenly overweight engineer (Ethan Suplee) hops off his cab to reset a switch and then cant catch up as his train (on which the air brakes also happen to be disconnected) rolls out of the yard. Theres a bit of cheap suspense as the ""coaster"" as the runaway is initially called is on a collision course with a trainload of school children but once thats averted the suspense and excitement build without distraction or pause. Under full power the hard-charging train becomes ""a missile"" in the words of train traffic manager Connie (Rosario Dawson) who tries to keep track of where the train is and how catastrophe can be avoided in the short term. Her boss Galvin (Kevin Dunn) must ultimately decide on whether or not to derail the train but its headed to more populated areas where the explosion of toxic cargo could prove devastating. Before long the incident is picked up by TV news (Fox of course) and police choppers fly overhead. On their run in the vicinity Frank and Will become involved in the pursuit and various schemes are tried Putting engines in front of the runaway to gradually slow it down then pulling an engine up from behind to connect so as to drag the long train to slower speeds. But the most breathtaking sequence involves attempting to lower a Marine from a helicopter by cable down onto the runaway while both are doing 75 mph. Just when you think things might be okay theyre not and the train -- and the film -- keep charging ahead to the outstanding finale. Scott doesnt show any moves that he hasnt used before; the desaturated images jumpy camerawork abrupt cuts spare and jokey dialogue exchanges and relentless forward movement are all things hes done for years. But here everything is stripped down to its essence and placed in the service of creating a piece thats virtually wall-to-wall action with no distraction. Adding to the films effectiveness is the essential credibility of both the mechanics and the setting. No matter how many or how few visual effects were used whats onscreen all looks absolutely real giving the appearance of actual trains running on actual tracks and causing actual mayhem on assorted gritty locations throughout Pennsylvania and Ohio that provide a vivid extensive look at Americas Rust Belt. In the staging shooting and editing this is a superbly orchestrated movie. Even though they are only sketched in with the quickest of brush strokes the sadness and limitations of the characters lives are made indelibly clear. Underlying everything is an anger and frustration born of neglect and a sense of the world passing these people by. For those disposed to looking for metaphors and hidden sociological content in overtly commercial cinema Unstoppable provides a term papers worth of content; the characters here dont know how to articulate it but theres a rage that seems prone to one day express itself by throwing over the oppressive ill-run apparatus that governs so much of their lives (management government judges you name it). You can take it or leave it but this stuff is here. Only somewhat more central to the action than the other actors Washington and Pine spar with enjoyable attitude and humor and character actors like Suplee Galvin David Warshofsky (as Franks seasoned colleague) and Lew Temple wonderful as a hopped-up rail employe bent on saving the day bring plentiful color to this brawny bruising ride that lives up to its title by accelerating from the very beginning and not letting up until the very end.

Fox release should see solid earnings unobstructed well into the holidays. Pop quiz hotshot If an unmanned freight train loaded with hazardous cargo leaves the station heading south at 70 mph and another train departs half an hour later in the opposite direction with Denzel Washington and Chris Pine aboard how long until the movie stars save the day? Answer Nearly half of Tony Scotts refreshingly lucid ""Unstoppable"" unfolds without the leads realizing whats at stake but as soon as theyre thrust into the path of a runaway train things hit white-knuckle intensity in a hurry. This gripping brink-of-disaster ride from Fox should see solid earnings unobstructed well into the holidays. ""Unstoppable"" is a curious kind of action movie one that tells its nail-biting story largely through the lens of Fox News and several local TV affiliates. While Washington and Pine play blue-collar heroes on the track news choppers follow the action from the air stoking the excitement with footage formatted to fit the widescreen and then downgraded to look as though it were broadcast via less-than-hi-def monitors. Corporate agenda aside the frequent use of news cameras is just the latest tool in Scotts move toward camera ubiquity a stylistic preference that favors alternating between as many angles as possible over trying to get a single defining point of view on a scene. Without sacrificing an ounce of energy Scotts approach is actually more restrained than in recent Washington collaborations; this is his fifth film with the star and it feels downright classical when compared with the semi-delirious flurries that were ""Deja Vu"" and ""Man on Fire."" Opening with the words ""inspired by true events"" ""Unstoppable"" may strain plausibility but is considerably more realistic than say the hysterical 1999 NBC mini ""Atomic Train"" which ended with the nuclear destruction of Denver or even Scotts recent ""Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" remake. Screenwriter Mark Bomback (""Live Free or Die Hard"") lifts the setup from the 2001 ""Crazy Eights"" case in which a train traveled 66 miles from Toledo Ohio without anyone aboard. Then without introducing something so artificial as a terrorist plot or a ""Speed""-style villain Bomback ups the stakes by doubling the velocity and including eight cars of highly flammable hazardous material. The culprit is an engineer (played by ""My Name Is Earls"" Ethan Suplee) who mistakenly puts the locomotive in full throttle before climbing out of the cab only to watch the ""coaster"" gain speed as it leaves the station. ""This kind of thing happens"" yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) cool-headedly explains restoring exactly no ones confidence in railroad safety especially as Scott gooses the over-the-top scenario with explosions and various obstacles on the track. But Hoopers a pro. The lone woman in a testosterone-driven work environment shes doing her best to manage the situation from the confines of a control booth while grizzled old-timer Frank Barnes (Washington) and fresh-from-training young turk Will Colson (Pine) leisurely spar in the field. If theres one person who can wring drama from a disconnected nerve center its Scott who puts Hooper in the eye of a perfect storm involving corporate pressures (embodied by Kevin Dunn as the ass-covering boss who begs to be overruled) a visiting federal safety inspector (Kevin Corrigan) and a gaggle of elementary school children positioned directly in the path of the oncoming train. Given the linear one-track nature of the plot Scott and Bomback prove surprisingly effective at delivering a well-rounded experience going out of their way to fill in the personalities of their two leads. Like Oliver Stones ""World Trade Center"" ""Unstoppable"" serves as a testament to hard-working Americans and poses the rescue efforts as something of a suicide mission undertaken by imperfect family men willing to risk their own lives to prevent the train from jumping the rails in densely populated Stanton Pa. Their only hope is to climb aboard the locomotive and cut the power but before that can happen they first have to slow it down. The title refers to not only the high-speed threat but also the hardheaded heroes who harness it and the action really kicks into gear once Washington and Pine (who get to flex their dramatic muscles a bit as married fathers with complicated family lives) set out to chase down the train. Until then only Hooper and the aforementioned news orgs seem to have a handle on things. Though its easy to imagine Fox and friends seeing this as a big story the sheer logistical manpower required to cover it is staggering encompassing animated worst-case-scenario diagrams instant replay capabilities and a fleet of helicopters. The latter makes for the films most dramatic footage (overseen by aerial d.p. David B. Nowell) allowing anchors to talk auds through the more intense moments. Even Harry Gregson-Williams score sounds like something designed for the evening news while dramatic sound design lends rumbling menace to otherwise silly shots of the empty million-ton train.
