Watch Ice Age Collison Course and see how you feel. The fifth entry in the Ice Age series is a loud lazy laugh-starved cash grab that cynically exploits its target audience (I use the term advisedly) by serving them scraps and calling it yummy. Even two-year-olds can see through the hustle. Related 40 Greatest Animated Movies Ever From Pixar landmarks to cyberpunk anime and stop-motion indies -- our top non-live-action films and toons of all time You cant blame the animators who do what they can to spark the visuals. But screenwriters Michael Wilson Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner are running on less than empty. The script is basically fumes though no one can top these guys for finding words that rhyme with ""duty"" or ""poop"" or ""butt"" or ""penis."" Things started going south for this once clever series with 2012s Ice Age Continental Drift which now seems Pixar-level inspired compared to this one. Every gag feels recycled. Even Scrat the squirrel the most popular character in the franchise wears out his welcome. And the plot? Would you believe that Manny the woolly mammoth voiced by Ray Romano has forgotten his wedding anniversary. Boy is his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) mad. Neither one likes the loser (Adam Devine) their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) is dating. And oh yeah a meteor shower is headed to earth to kill them all including Sal the sloth (John Leguizamo) his sass-talkin Granny (Wanda Sykes) sabertooths Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) and a new character a dino-bird voiced the great Nick Offerman who I once believed could not make a false move. I was wrong. After five minutes of this candy-colored swill youll be cheering the meteor on and fighting the urge to projectile vomit.

Wilson Micheal Berg Yoni Brenner Starring Voices of Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo Classification G Country USA Language English Who made this thing Wile E. Coyote? Ice Age Collision Course the fifth instalment in the 3-D computer-animated franchise for kids is an incomprehensible ordeal of slapstick gags wacky animals and poopy humour. It just seem to be an excuse to have various varmints squeezed squashed and twisted out of shape. The gist of it has to do with an acorn-obsessed squirrel whose accidental spaceship piloting causes a chain reaction that sends a giant asteroid hurtling toward a doomed planet of hockey-playing wooly mammoths and other oddballs. Fine so far right? But then a one-eyed weasel comes across a prophecy and the flying dinosaurs hope to foil the plans of saving the world and why does that spiritual-guru llama have a pair of ram horns? At one point Ray Romano (who musters all the enthusiasm you would expect from an actor voicing an extinct mammal in a scientifically misleading series for 15 years) cries ""Whats happening? Did I hit my head?"" He speaks for this reviewer. Toddlers will dig the shenanigans but bewildered adults should root for the annihilation of this tapped-out series.

Scrat the squirrel who is the series mascot is still trying to capture that elusive acorn and as long as the series creators can find new ways to keep it just out of his reach this series will keep rolling until the next ice age.""Ice Age Collision Course"" is part family adventure part science lesson. The humor is quick and clever and the animation is sharp and the pop culture references are witty enough to score. (The movie takes several pauses so a weasel voiced by Neil deGrasse Tyson -- his name is Neil deBuck Weasel -- can explain the science behind whats going on.)Ray Romanos Manny the mammoth once again leads the prehistoric posse that includes his family (Queen Latifah and Keke Palmer voice his wife and daughter respectively) a crusty saber tooth tiger (Denis Leary) an overly nervous sloth (John Leguizamo) and so on. Not only is an asteroid rocketing toward them but Manny is learning to deal with his daughters new boyfriend (Adam DeVine playing a sort of bro mammoth) and he must learn to work with him in order to save the day.""Collision Course"" wont alter the trajectory of history but as an entertaining diversion it does its job.

"The fifth Ice Age cometh but feel free to misseth - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The fifth Ice Age cometh but feel free to misseth ""Ice Age Collision Course"" 20th Century Fox The acorn-obsessed saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat in a scene from the animated movie ""Ice Age Collision Course."" The acorn-obsessed saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat in a scene from the animated movie ""Ice Age Collision Course."" (20th Century Fox) Katie Walsh Fourteen years after the first ""Ice Age"" animated film was a hit the fifth installment in the franchise ""Ice Age Collision Course"" rolls into theaters. Is it inevitable? Yes 2012s ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" was the highest-grossing animated film that year. Is it necessary? Absolutely not. ""Collision Course"" is simply a perfunctory watered-down entry in the series that feels like it should have been released on home video.In this world of ancient animals -- woolly mammoths saber-toothed tigers flying dino-birds -- facing apocalyptic era-shifting asteroid-borne problems it feels profoundly odd that the emotional stakes of the film are centered on the wedding of Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellies (Queen Latifah) daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). Not to get too nitpicky about a fantastical film for children where a group of animals blow up a bunch of crystals in a volcano to set an asteroid off course but the concept of marriage is decidedly anachronistic here. Also theyre animals. When anythings possible centering a story on something as mundanely hetero-normative as a wedding feels wildly unimaginative. Romanos Manny remains the heart of the group but the writing and the chemistry among the characters is profoundly lacking. Its almost as if they were on separate equally underdeveloped story lines. The most time is given to Mannys issues with his immature future son-in-law Julian (Adam Devine) who plans to move away with Peaches after their wedding in a sort of ""Father of the Bride""-style story line. The other characters are granted tossed-off story scraps as they are led on a hunt for magnetic crystals by the swashbuckling Buck (Simon Pegg).Theres an oddly grotesque style to some of the character design including the popeyed sloths as well as the high jinks of the single-minded and physically elastic squirrel Scrat. In chasing an acorn Scrat ends up on a spaceship that sets off the whole asteroid debacle. Theres a certain amount of visual-comedy fun to be had with simpleton Scrat but his adventures in space take an extreme physical toll on the rodent. The laser focus on something as innocuous as a mammoth wedding sends the story stakes in the wrong direction -- away from the actual world-ending part of the tale which you would assume would take precedence. All the apocalyptic stuff feels so very slapdash and silly particularly a sojourn to Geodetopia an opportunity to pillory yoga-practicing crystal-loving hippies (much in the same way ""Zootopia"" already did this year).Nothing comes together in ""Ice Age Collision Course"" which feels like the franchise grinding to a disappointing halt. Despite all the star power involved the voice acting performances dont inspire the visuals are basic -- and in 3-D dark and dim. This would work much better as weekend background home entertainment where the patchwork story and humdrum design can be easily looked over. This is one installment that didnt need to be made and in a summer of fine animated fare ""Ice Age Collision Course"" is only for the die-hard fans and franchise completists.-------------Ice Age Collision CourseMPAA rating PG for mild rude humor and some action/perilRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ice-age-collision-review-20160718-snap-story.html,200,iceage3,iceage,latimes

Credit 20th Century Fox Film Corporation The woolly mammoth couple Manny and Ellie contend with possible empty-nest syndrome and a possibly nest-destroying asteroid in ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the 37th installment in the popular computer animation franchise. O.K. actually its only the fifth feature but what with the shorts and TV specials and video games it feels as if there have been so so many more.The key attributes of the movie which is directed by Galen T. Chu and Mike Thurmeier are undemanding and audience-approved. Anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animals spout endless contemporary-culture-allusive wisecracks (""You look nothing like your profile picture"" ""Hashtag hashtag hashtag"" etc. and ad infinitum) alternating with Hollywood-standard family-values twaddle that is as facile as it is insincerely expressed. Hence the movies actual entertainment value rises considerably during the dialogue-free sequences most of which involve a manic squirrel Scrat chasing his coveted acorn into a spaceship initially encased in a glacier. He inadvertently launches the spacecraft and flies around in a way that reorders the known universe. Video Trailer Ice Age Collision Course A preview of the film. By 20th CENTURY FOX PICTURES on Publish Date May 11 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed ""Road Runner""-style gags recycled in computer-smooth 3-D animation still pack some punch as it happens. A scene in which an electrical storm menaces the movies protagonists also generates some visual interest.The wide-ranging celebrity cast of voice talent here makes room for the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson as a version of himself and Adam Devine as Manny and Ellies would-be son-in-law Julian who repeatedly refers to Manny as ""Bro Dad"" a habit that is precisely as unendearing as it sounds. Eagle-eyed parents can rest easy; the role of Peaches the object of Julians affections is voiced by Keke Palmer not the eponymous raunchy performing artist. I consider this a missed opportunity. GLENN KENNY""Ice Age Collision Course"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animal body-function humor mostly.

"Ice Age Collision Course | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ice-age-collision-course ) Ice Age Collision Course (United States 2016) July 21 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ice Age Collision Course the fifth installment in this lamentably long-lived animated franchise is the last Ice Age movie I intend to see. In a way this review is superfluous. Thats because Ice Age Collision Course isnt a movie. Oh its projected on multiplex screens but it is at best an oversized overbudgeted Saturday morning cartoon. Younger kids will have fun with the movie. Its in their wheelhouse. The juvenile jokes will amuse them and the braindead storyline wont confuse them or hinder their ability to enjoy the subpar 3-D and cheapish animation. Adults - well thats another story. Admittedly this isnt made for people over the age of about 10. But most children need adult accompaniment to attend a movie and in this case the sacrificial lamb can add another thing to the list of ""things I sacrificed to have kids."" I found the experience nearly unendurable and was fighting the urge to take a nap. Finding Dory is still in theaters. So is The Secret Lives of Pets. Both have their flaws but they are real movies. Compared to them Ice Age Collision Course is an embarrassment. Its a cash grab of the most crass kind using the lure of familiar characters and a marketable name to fill 20th Century Foxs coffers. The movies story doesnt try to make sense because well whats the point? Were so deep in cartoonland here that all but the most rudimentary aspects of the narrative have been jettisoned. This is about wisecracking anthropomorphic animals and disaster film cliches. Everyone is back which isnt necessarily a good thing. The main Ice Age trio of Manny the Mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabertooth Tiger (Denis Leary) were never that exciting to begin with and familiarity had not made the heart grow fonder. They are rejoined by Mannys family - wife Ellie (Queen Latifa) grown-up daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and soon-to-be-son-in-law Julian (Adam Devine); Deigos wife Shira (Jennifer Lopez); and Sids granny (Wanda Sykes). Simon Peggs Buck is also back meaning that aside from Julian the only newcomers in chapter five are lesser figures like Neil deBuck Weasel (Neil deGrasse Tyson) Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Brooke a.k.a. Sids overdue love interest (Jessie J). Also returning of course is Scrat the Sabertooth Squirrel. This Wiley Coyote-inspired creature with bug eyes and a desperate love for acorns has been one of the high points of the Ice Age saga. Scrats segments disconnected vignettes reminiscent of the old Looney Tunes shorts have not only offered amusing interludes from the more staid activities of the speaking characters but have featured heavily in the marketing campaigns. This time however even Scrat is showing signs of becoming stale. In Collision Course hes chasing an acorn in outer space and on a space ship and the level of inventiveness and manic energy associated with his past exploits is missing. After having faced global warming dinosaurs and continental drift this time the prehistoric mammals are pitted against an extinction event asteroid. Determined to do to our furry friends what something similar did to the dinosaurs (at least those not enjoying life in their underground hidden world) this chunk of galactic debris is headed for Earth forcing Peaches to postpone her wedding plans and Ellie to stop sniping at Manny for forgetting their anniversary. If a way cant be found to divert the asteroid (wheres Bruce Willis when you need him?) there wont be a sixth Ice Age film. (Go asteroid go) Although the trajectory of the Ice Age films hasnt been consistently downward Collision Course is the worst of the batch. With all due respect to co-directors Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu (both of whom worked on earlier Ice Age films) this one feels not only obligatory but lazy. I understand that in todays movie-making economy lucrative productions must always have sequels. But theres nothing that says the sequels have to be flat lifeless and creatively bankrupt. Disney and Dreamworks consistently churn out product thats as enjoyable for someone age 40 as it is for someone age 4. No one will ever mistake Ice Age Collision Course for one of those movies.

(The image of a world-splitting fissure caused by the planting of a single acorn comes to mind for some reason.) This time Scrat is in space having activated an icebound flying saucer and the violence visited upon him by artificial gravity teleportation et.al. very nearly evokes the glory days of Wile E. Coyote. While hes up there he accidentally sends a doomsday meteor hurtling toward earth and Manny amp; Co. set out to stop it. But all the while Dad is fretting over his darling daughters impending nuptials to a good-hearted goofball. Theres a moment of interest in a weasels paean of self-praise set to Figaros aria from The Barber of Seville and grownups can pass the time puzzling over the various random anachronisms (""You look

""Ice Age Collision Course"" by Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Close icon Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer I enjoyed the first Ice Age picture immensely. The 2002 animated family adventure featuring a great voice cast led by Ray Romano Denis Leary and John Leguizamo as a trio of misfit prehistoric creatures was inventive humorous and full of heart. It wasnt the smartest or hippest feature cartoon out there but it worked nicely. Then 20th Century Fox had to go and turn the moneymaker - the 59 million film made 383.3 million - into a franchise that includes three soundtrack CDs eight video games a couple of TV specials and a touring stage musical. Four film sequels and 14 years later the best I can say of Ice Age Collision Course is that it has nice coloring and good picture contrast. An empty boring limping exercise in futility the fifth Ice Age entry is a picture in search of a reason to exist. None is forthcoming. The three original stars are still on board - Romano returns as Manny the mammoth Leguizamo as Sid the giant ground sloth and Leary as saber-toothed tiger Diego. Also back is a raft of costars who have joined Ice Age along the way including Queen Latifah as Mannys mammoth wife Ellie; Wanda Sykes as Sids granny; Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel; and Jennifer Lopez as Diegos mate the fierce tiger Shira. The story opens with Scrat (Chris Wedge) a saber-toothed squirrel featured in several Ice Age shorts. His obsession with collecting and burying acorns ends in a chain reaction involving a flying saucer that ends up sending a bucketload of asteroids speeding toward Earth. Will a collision wipe out the Earths fledgling mammal population just as it killed all the dinosaurs? (Actually a few dinos still exist in a sort of wildlife sanctuary overseen by Buck.) Our heroes set about averting the disaster using their natural-born ingenuity and a few insights in mathematics and physics. Ice Age Collision Course winds its way through its singularly unexciting story line with tired dialogue flat jokes and surprisingly uninventive visuals. One would think that the animation department would at least compensate for the bad script with some awe-inducing visual trickery. Afraid not. Ice Age Collision Course isnt a film. Its a glorified Saturday-morning cartoon - and a mediocre one at that. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW Ice Age Collision Course s1/2 (Out of four stars) yDirected by Mike Thurmeier.

(20th Century Fox) ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this. We get it Its summertime and the kids need to be entertained. But take them to see ""Finding Dory"" a second -- or even third -- time. Its no ""Finding Nemo"" but its still a better use of time and money. Why settle for a story thats set into motion -- yet again -- by that irritating saber-toothed squirrel in search of an acorn? Yes Scrat accidentally ends up in a UFO pinballing around the cosmos. The good news -- for the universe not the viewer -- is that all that bouncing around somehow leads to the formation of our galaxy. The bad news is that the activity sends a huge destructive asteroid hurtling toward Earth. Down on the Blue Planet Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) is fretting over losing his daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) to her betrothed the stupid but sweet Julian (Adam Devine). Mannys buddy the lisping sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) has just had his heart broken and saber-toothed tigers Diego and Shira (Dennis Leary and Jennifer Lopez) are lamenting that every young animal in the kingdom is terrified of them. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Of course theyve got a bigger problem to worry about the imminent destruction of their planet. To help with that conundrum they have the crafty one-eyed weasel Buck (Simon Pegg) who formulates a far-fetched plan involving magnetic space rocks. Nothing however can save them from the terrible dialogue and stale jokes. The movies idea of hilarity is a pun on the word ""duty."" Measured against that low bar the films more inspired bits include a cameo by Neil deGrasse Tyson (playing scientist Neil deBuck Weasel); a cult leader Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) who loves crystals and yoga; and hashtag jokes. Dont waste too much brain power on the fact that Twitter didnt exist during the Paleolithic. Screenwriters Michael J. Wilson Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner strain to jam as many characters into the story as possible leaving the movie feeling both overstuffed and utterly superficial. A musical interlude is usually a dependable pick-me-up but the one in ""Ice Age"" -- set to Figaros aria from ""The Barber of Seville"" -- feels slapdash. (Sample lyric ""You may be Jurassic but I am fantastic."") If theres a bright spot its the animation which conjures a colorful world called Geotopia inside the fallen asteroid. Theres also a clever sequence that recreates a prophecy carved into a stone totem. It isnt enough though. Since Pixar upped the animation game childrens entertainment is now expected to delight grown-ups too. That may seem like a tall order but this franchise has done it before. It just feels like we havent seen it since the first Ice Age. PG. At area theaters. Contains mild rude humor and action peril. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Fifth Ice Age is a glacial bore review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFifth Ice Age is a glacial bore reviewThe stakes and ambition are low in Ice Age Collision Course.In Ice Age Collision Course the familiar gang of ancient creatures has a collective crisis about aging.  (TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX)  By Nick PatchEntertainment ReporterThu. July 21 2016Ice Age Collision CourseStarring Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen Latifah and Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu. 100 minutes. GWith a lumbering fifth film the Ice Age franchises appeal seems to have melted away.In Ice Age Collision Course the familiar gang of ancient creatures has a collective crisis about aging -- at the very moment the 14-year-old series turns tragically long in the (sabre)tooth.Article Continued BelowThis time Manny the woolly mammoth (Ray Romano) and his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) fret that beloved daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) will be whisked away after her marriage to eager-to-please Julian (Adam Devine).Meanwhile moody tigers Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) contemplate parenthood; Sid the hapless ground sloth (John Leguizamo) clumsily chases love and dino-bird Roger (Max Greenfield debuting) yearns for the respect of his growling dad.Yes these majestic beasts do love domestic drama. As the couples bicker some truly prehistoric sitcom tropes rear their heads from forgotten wedding anniversaries to disapproving in-laws and confused husbands grousing over drinks.Slowly the plot ambles into place the whole gang must come together to deflect an apocalyptic comet flurry.The cosmic storm is the unwitting work of Scrat the squirrel whose wordless non-sequitur adventures have become the series signature. Here hes navigating deep space in a flying saucer spinning the movies only comedy.Wanda Sykes kiddie crowd-pleasing Granny aside the other laughs are meant to be derived from puns (a rainbow-haired yogi is named Shangri Llama) mild potty humour and occasional parent-aimed pop culture nods like Neil deGrasse Tyson cameoing as Neil deBuck Weasel.Hes there for a scientific explanation but unlike other entries in the series the latest Ice Age doesnt seem imbued with any sort of environmental message.Young kids arent likely to find anything here frightening but they arent likely to find anything fascinating either. The pace is glacial the stakes and ambition low and the settings by now too familiar.Its sometimes hard to tell if the beasts of Ice Age are facing extinction or exhaustion. The series has certainly succumbed to one and the other doesnt feel far away.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rated PG (mildly scary themes). For parents in search of kid-friendly entertainment that isnt overtly grating the ""Ice Age"" series has always been a good bet. But the fifth installment ""Collision Course"" feels both deeply rote and way overpacked with characters. Scrat the neurotic squirrel forever in search of a place to bury his acorn is still fun though. Hes pummeled squashed slingshotted and otherwise mangled in the course of his quest -- this time in space after unearthing a frozen UFO. His antics are responsible for the life-endangering asteroid that comes barreling toward Earth. Thats bad news for Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) and his family which now includes a future son-in-law Julian (Adam Devine whose voice alone I find irritating). They set out to improbably stop the disaster with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) his granny (Wanda Sykes) Diego the tiger (Denis Leary) and Buck the weasel (Simon Pegg) all series stalwarts. Newcomers include Nick Offerman as the leader of a trio of ""dino-birds"" whose existence Im still a little unclear on logically; a ""Shangri-Llama"" guru (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) living in the middle of a crashed asteroid whose magnetic properties will help save the day; and ""Neil deBuck Weasel"" a science expert voiced by -- who else? -- Neil deGrasse Tyson. Good luck keeping track of all of them. Or your eyes open.

EntertainmentMovies Ice Age Collision Course chaos on a cosmic scale Originally published July 21 2016 at 848 am Updated July 21 2016 at 241 pm In the animated comedy ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the movies makers have fired the gibbering rodent Scrat into space where true to form he causes chaos this time on a truly cosmic scale. Rated 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times In space all you can hear is screaming. And wailing. And squeaking. All wordless noises coming at you courtesy of Scrat the bulgy-eyed hyperactive fang-adorned squirrel/rat with the acorn fetish whos been a constant comic presence in the ""Ice Age"" movies. ""Ice Age Collision Course"" is the fifth iteration in the seemingly endless animated series. This time around the gibbering rodent has been fired into space where true to form he causes chaos this time on a truly cosmic scale. Planets are knocked about like billiard balls and worlds are destroyed thanks to the caroming flying saucer carrying the cowering critter to and fro through the great void. Movie Review    Ice Age Collision Course featuring the voices of Ray Romano Queen Latifah John Leguizamo. Directed by Michael Thurmeier and Galen Tan Chu from a screenplay by Michael Wilson Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner. 100 minutes. Rated PG for mild rude humor and some action/peril. Several theaters. The frenetic to-ing and fro-ing is pretty funny frankly but here as in all previous ""Ice Ages"" the makers know that the frantic antics of this comic character are not by themselves sufficient to carry a full-length movie. Eventually the action has to head for Earth. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Manny is suffering separation anxiety over the upcoming marriage of his daughter to a slacker-dude pachyderm; Sid the good-hearted dolt is bemoaning his single state and Diego is mulling starting a family. Oh and while all this dithering is going on a massive meteor set loose by the destructive doings of Scrat-in-space is heading straight for Earth. Doomsday approaches. Mammothkind must figure out some way to head off obliteration. Somehow yoga and magnetic crystals are worked into the effort to save the planet. There are even unicorns. The result? A confused mishmash of plot elements featuring overwrought extraneous characters. Kids likely will love it. Their parents will just have to grin and bear it.

Chu; Release Date 07/22/2016; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating PG Posted July 21 2016 -- 1100 AM EDT See also How a single joke in Ice Age turned into the fifth movie Ice Age franchise is going to the ice with new live show Its been 14 years since we first met Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) in the original Ice Age. Were now on our fifth--yes fifth--installment in the computer-generated series and with Ice Age Collision Course the novelty is starting to thaw. The Ice Age series was never great cinema but theres always been a sense of heart under all the wisecracks and zany antics. Collision Course abandons that in favor of already stale pop culture references and laughless jokes. The latest installment kicks off as always with Scrat the bucktoothed squirrel who accidentally uncovers an alien spaceship while searching for a place to bury his beloved acorn. Poor Scrat soon finds himself hurled into space bouncing around the solar system like hes in some sort of interstellar pinball machine and before too long hes inadvertently sent an enormous asteroid hurtling toward his home planet. Back on earth our hero Manny voiced by a returning Romano is faced with a melodramatic plot pulled from any lazy sitcom of the last 30 years Not only did he forget his wifes anniversary but his beloved daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) is engaged to an oafish mammoth named Julian (Adam DeVine) and the pair are planning to move away soon after the wedding. All this is soon overshadowed however by the enormous asteroid overhead and Manny is forced to gather his massive herd in an attempt to stop the inevitable extinction. Every Ice Age movie has added more and more prehistoric characters and Collision Course is no exception introducing Nick Offerman Max Greenfield and Stephanie Beatriz as a trio of sinister feathered dinosaurs and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as a flexible yogi llama. The result is a lifeless caper thats overstuffed with one-dimensional characters and insipid gags. One or two sidekicks can work but when youre juggling a sassy sloth grandmother (Wanda Sykes) two grating opossum brothers (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) a swashbuckling weasel (Simon Pegg) and frequent cameos from Neil deGrasse Tyson (a.k.a. Neil DeBuck Weasel) its hard to really care about any of them. Even Scrats madcap misfortunes feel dull the fifth time around. Youre not necessarily rooting for the asteroid but youre not exactly rooting against it either.

With the voices of Ray Romano John Leguizamo Jennifer Lopez and new addition Adam Devine. (Credit 20th Century-Fox UK) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Manny the mammoth and his prehistoric pals must stop an asteroid from ending life on Earth.CAST Voices of Ray Romano Simon Pegg Queen LatifahRATED PG (rude humor)LENGTH 134BOTTOM LINE Another infuriatingly unfunny and probably successful entry in the long-running animated franchise. Theres a cost-benefit analysis to be done with ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth film in the animated series from 20th Century Fox. For about 13 per ticket you could take your children to see this hyperkinetic highly irritating comedy full of loud noises cheap jokes and flatulence. Then again for 3.50 you could purchase a 2-pound box of Domino sugar and just pour it down your kids throats. The effect would be roughly the same and youd save yourself a few bucks not to mention 90 minutes of grief. Easily the most maddening entry in this gallingly successful franchise ""Collision Course"" is the first to break totally free of narrative coherence and logic. It begins as always with Scrat the prehistoric squirrel chasing an acorn but this time Scrat discovers a UFO pilots it into space and accidentally sends a meteor hurtling toward Earth. This weird catastrophe brings the bickering Mammoth family -- Ray Romano as Manny Queen Latifah as Ellie and Keke Palmer as their daughter Peaches -- closer together. Whats more their old friend Buck the weasel (Simon Pegg) has a plan to stop the disaster. Can this motley crew avoid the same fate as the dinosaurs? advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Collision Course"" seems to have been written using Mad Libs with utterly random nouns and verbs driving the plot action and humor. Buck adopts a pumpkin as his child. Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) finds a girlfriend using social media. There are cameos by a green rabbit some unicorns Neil deGrasse Tyson and a hippie-dippie animal called the Shangri-Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson). Amid all this chaos Denis Leary and Jennifer Lopez as the saber-tooth tigers Diego and Shira barely register. You might counter that ""Collision Course"" is in the tradition of great wacko comedies like the Marx Brothers ""Duck Soup"" or W.C. Fields ""Million Dollar Legs."" Theres a difference however between inspired lunacy and mere grabbing at straws. The films moments of lukewarm poignancy as little Peaches prepares to leave the nest and marry Julian (Adam Devine) further suggest that we are not in the presence of Dadaist brilliance. That said the ""Ice Ace"" franchise has earned nearly 3 billion with this very same mix of treacly sentiment and brain-dump humor. ""Collision Course"" will likely put it over the edge.

Twentieth Century Fox Chase Karacostas Guidelive Reporter chasekaracostas ckaracostasdallasnews.com Though slightly charming Ice Age Collision Course is anA unnecessary sequel (C-) Jul. 20 2016 445pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Chase Karacostas Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Considering that the first Ice Age movie was released fourteen years ago (about the same amount of time it took Disney to make one Finding Nemo sequel) upon seeing this fifth installment of the franchise I began to wonder why it existed. While the movie was decent and had some fun personalities its existence was entirely unnecessary. The plot fell pretty flat and for the most part the individual characters were the funniest parts of the movie. That and the toddler who felt the need to start dancing at the front of the theater before the movie began. Maybe you can guess the plot. A fun situation at the beginning of the movie one of the herd does something stupid to irritate the others antagonist appears group comes back together and they all survive extinction yet again.Oh wait ... isnt that the plot of the other four movies? The only difference between this movie and the other four is that the antagonist is a magnetic glowing purple meteor (because all magnets glow) instead of a saber toothed tiger pack global warming a dinosaur that looks like the antagonist of Jurassic World or the end of Pangaea. How will they survive this time? They dont have nuclear weapons to launch at the meteor but rest assured this is a PG movie. They cant annihilate the world.Also why has global warming not killed these creatures? There is not nearly enough snow and ice around those mammoths to prevent them from overheating with all of that fur. Logic aside subplots seemed to be what defined this movie and half of them were about the love interests of every couple a or single in the case of Sid (John Leguizamo). At times those storylines got kind of ridiculous and they brought to mind the never ending failed love cycles in all superhero TV shows. The stars of Collision Course Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Manny (Ray Romano) have marital/parental/social angst as their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and her fiance Julian (Adam Devine) get ready to tie the knot and roam the world. But before they can do that Julian has to prove himself to Manny in this awkward ""father hates potential son-in-law"" subplot. The franchise also brought back many of its previous laughable characters like Crash and Eddie along with Granny Sids grandmother (voiced by Wanda Sykes) who in the trailer rants ""dont you hurry me Ive been struck by lightning more times than youve had hot breakfasts"" after Sid begs her to move faster to avoid an electrical storm.The most important subplot of all which was really a side-plot was Scrats (Chris Wedge). In his lifelong trek to find the perfect place to bury his acorn he went into space and caused a significant amount of havoc (including launching the meteor towards Earth) narrated by one of our favorite astrophysicists Neil Degrasse Tyson. ""Since the beginning of time we have wondered how the universe came to be. A gloriously orchestrated plan? Or something much much dumber."" By the end I felt like the writers of Collision Course had attempted to cram as much random s--- into the movie as possible. But if thats true there might be a silver lining This might actually be the end of the ice age. ICE AGE COLLISION COURSE (C-)Directed by Mike Thurmeier and Galen Chu.

Ray Romano Queen Latifah Keke Palmer Adam Devine Jennifer Lopez Denis Leary Seann William Scott Josh Peck and Simon Pegg are among the many voices in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Photo Twentieth Century Fox TNS Rooting for the asteroid in 5th Ice Age movie 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Five films into the ""Ice Age"" series the franchise feels like the last 45 minutes of a house party that has gotten out of control. Even the most forgettable characters return and a half dozen more are introduced to the point that its impossible to remember how everyone met. Who invited that elderly sloth voiced by Wanda Sykes? Are those scrawny rodents at the punch bowl friends with the weasel? Could someone just call the cops and end this thing? The ""Ice Age"" pentalogy from Blue Sky Studios never aspired to deep thought. The films deliberately abandon any semblance of science and historic accuracy in favor of slapstick and bodily function jokes. And theres absolutely nothing wrong with that. As ""The Secret Life of Pets"" proved just two weeks ago mindlessly killing an hour and a half on a summer afternoon can be a noble thing. But this series has collapsed under its own weight. Even ""Toy Story 3"" had the sense to kill off a couple of characters. The makers of the ""Ice Age"" series just keep adding more like cinematic hoarders. The good news ""Ice Age Collision Course"" is no worse than the fourth entry ""Ice Age Continental Drift."" After the movies had gotten progressively worse with each new entry the decline has reached a steady state of badness. But theres also no attempt at narrative momentum from movie to movie anymore. At this point the storytelling team is trying to top the outlandishness of the last film waiting to see if the box office is big enough for another sequel -- and then starting all over again. Because theyve tried pretty much everything else this movies plot is ""Armageddon"" meets ""Father of the Bride"" meets the sixth season of ""Family Ties."" (Or maybe that last influence was ""Lethal Weapon 4."") Manny the woolly mammoth voiced again by Ray Romano is anxiety-ridden after his daughter Peaches announces her engagement to the bumbling but decent Julian (Adam Devine). While Manny overreacts and tries to sabotage their relationship the rest of the characters fight to stop the asteroid that is hurtling toward Earth and about to cause their extinction. All of the above would be fine if there were compelling action on the screen. Instead the ""Ice Age"" screenwriters seem to be making up the rules as they go along distracted by tired side plots to give the other characters a reason to exist in the film. Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) once again tries to find love with depressing results. Denis Learys saber-toothed tiger and the girlfriend he picked up in the last movie mostly sit this one out. Another group of characters (sigh) is introduced including a New Age llama delivering the kind of punch lines that peaked in the 1980s or 1990s about hot tubs and crystals. Among the fresh voices is astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson as a weasel version of himself dispensing science in what may be the least scientific movie ever made. That leaves swashbuckling one-eyed weasel Buck (Simon Pegg introduced two movies ago) and prehistoric squirrel Scrat to provide the bulk of the quality laughs. Scrat is basically Wile E. Coyote his beloved nut always just beyond his reach and he remains the consistent entertainment in the series. Scrat is in outer space this time like Miss Piggy in the sixth ""Muppet"" movie and Jason in the 10th ""Friday the 13th."" Hopefully the ""Ice Age"" series wont make it that far. Blue Sky Studios has resources and talented filmmakers. It would be great to see them try something new and remind us of how we felt when this party started.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet God is a demented rodent lusting haphazardly for nuts. Thats one of the more plausible ideas floated by Collision Course the latest entry in the proudly implausible (and implausibly ongoing) Ice Age series. Part five opens as every Ice Age does on the comic agony of Scrat the twitchy squirrel whose Sisyphean efforts to hoard a stray acorn lead this time to a flying saucer frozen solid in the glacier he bumbles upon. Before you can wrap your head around the implications of that reveal Scrat has accidentally piloted the spacecraft out of Earths atmosphere where--after the 2001st 2001 joke--the little guy knocks around some debris creating the entire layout of the solar system before bumping a giant hunk of space rock in the general direction of our planet. ""Someone up there likes us"" one of the nattering mammals below eventually squawks blissfully unaware that the higher power creating chaos from the cosmos is a screaming pest with a brain smaller than the shelled snack he covets.A nagging question occurs early and often Could this be the most scientifically inaccurate movie ever made? The first Ice Age released in the prehistoric past of 2002 wasnt exactly educational entertainment but it at least kept its geologic periods straight. When the sequel said ""screw it"" and unfroze some long-extinct aquatic reptiles all bets were off. In Collision Course a talking possum cant take two steps without violating some basic law of motion; the cartoon physics make Chuck Jones look like David Attenborough. Taking anachronistic humor to nonsensical new lengths the filmmakers also stuff their characters maws with mentions of profile pictures and hashtags. ""That seems highly implausible just from a scientific standpoint"" goes one bit of lazy lampshading. Another casts professional pedant Neil DeGrasse Tyson as an imaginary weasel spitting hard data from another animals mind palace. Its a bit like Alicia Silverstone handing out asparagus at Baconfest.Yes yes this is a kids movie so it hardly matters that none of it makes one lick of sense even on its own terms. Collision Courses half-assed fact-fudging is much easier to roll with than its half-assed sitcom mushiness. Ray Romano back as grouchy mastodon Manny may sign up for these movies for the easy paychecks but hes still the closest thing they have to an auteur. What is the Ice Age series now but an animated Everybody Loves Raymond? Manny and his celebrity-voiced friends and family do plenty of multitasking on their way to diverting doomsday; a plummeting asteroid is no more urgent than an impending case of empty-nest syndrome. Accompanying adults not tickled by jokes screaming out for a laugh track or the inevitable obligatory pop-song jamboree can mark time trying to pinpoint which stars have lent their pipes and climbed aboard the Ice Age money train since the last installment.Every once in a while the hacky zingers halt in favor of some inspired physical comedy--as when for example an eye-patched miniature pirate voiced by Simon Pegg plays keep-away with a dinosaur egg the ""camera"" tracing his acrobatic evasion of flying adversaries. (As is too often the case with studio cartoons a gaping blast crater separates the effort level of the animators from that of the writing team.) The best bits as always belong to Scrat. Collision Course finds its grotesque mojo every time the focus shifts back to outer space where the speechless critters fur and flesh fall off his skeleton in a high-gravity mishap and an overtaxed teleporter does a Cronenbergian number on his physiology. Its enough to make the discerning wish that Ice Age would pull a Minions and make these sidekick pratfalls the main attraction. That or just let the falling rock do its damage. Is extinction imminent for this franchise and its domesticated wildlife? Parents and film critics should be so lucky.

It doesnt take long into ""Ice Age Collision Course"" for you to begin rooting for that meteor.  Theres been no shortage of high-quality animated talking-animal movies this year. ""Zootopia"" ""The Jungle Book"" ""Finding Dory"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets"" all did well with critics and for now are on 2016s top 10 list for domestic box-office grosses. ""Ice Age"" is an embarrassment in comparison a hot mess of random references clashing styles and recycled gags babbling at high speed like a kid on a sugar rush.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceSetting ""Collision Course"" into motion is Scrat the blessedly wordless saber-toothed squirrel with an insatiable craving for acorns.

Featuring voices of Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo Queen Latifah and Simon Pegg. Rated PG (134) Like the very asteroid that is hurtling toward Earth in the movie ""Ice Age Collision Course"" is chunky clunky and bulky. Unlike the asteroid the film seems to move at a glacial pace. A lot of the gang is back for the fifth installment in the Ice Age franchise -- Ray Romano Queen Latifah John Leguizamo and Denis Leary are together again. But even diehard Ice Age fans shouldnt expect the same level of laughs as before. The gang is back for the fifth installment of the Ice Age franchise. (Blue Sky Studios) The plot is simple enough -- after enjoying some much-needed peace after the dinosaurs floods and continental drifts of Ice Ages past the animals are living in prehistoric bliss once again. They are playing ice hockey sipping coconut cocktails and planning anniversary parties and weddings. They squabble they nuzzle and they hit the bar to escape their wives. Theres even a peaceful little commune led by a yogi llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) where no one ages. Life is good. But all the bucolic bounty is threatened when Buck (Simon Pegg) a hilarious eyepatch wearing weasel warns the crew that an asteroid is going to wipe them all out. And fast Together with Buck Manny (Romano) Ellie (Latifah) Sid (Leguizamo) and Diego (Leary) all work to redirect the asteroid and save the planet. Dont Think Twice by Mike Birbiglia a funny-sad look at comedy Look theres not much depth. The Earth is in danger and eventually the cute cartoon animals figure out how to save the day and its over. But there are some things to consider discussing with kids -- global warming taking care of the Earth and lessons in protecting the planet for future generations -- when the movie and popcorn are done. Theres also something to be said about interspecies co-operation - the crazy Dinobirds help the mammals in a pivotal scene even though the two species dont exactly get along and both kids and adults could always use a little reminder about lending a helping hand to people that dont look like us. A lovelorn Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) proposes to his lady friend Francine (voiced by Melissa Rauch) --on their first date. (Blue Sky Studios) Theres some scary stuff too -- a meteor shower things on fire and the whole apocalypse-asteroid-hurtling-toward-earth-thing. So parents with jumpy preschoolers should be prepared particularly since the movie is in 3D. And for laughs -- take them when you can get them -- parents should remember that Michael Strahan voices Teddy a body builder bunny rabbit who lives in the Geotopia commune. Even in crazy cartoon land Strahans got a real way with the ladies.

Its hard to shake the suspicion that the producers looked at the dwindling quality and soaring box office of the first four films and concluded that actually they didnt need to put much effort at all. The setup remains unchanged focusing on the midlife struggles of three prehistoric mammals Mannie the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger (Denis Leary whose drastically reduced role may reflect his drastically reduced star power). In classic lazy-sitcom fashion Mannies daughter (Keke Palmer) wants to get married but dad doesnt approve. Will he swallow his pride and come around? What do you think? Meanwhile madcap weasal Buck (Simon Pegg grating beyond belief) is convinced the worlds about to end leading to a perfunctory road-movie plot a series of half-hearted action scenes and Jessie J as a Cockney hippy sloth. With even the Looney Tunes-style Scrat-the-slapstick-squirrel scenes feeling tired its time to put this franchise on ice for good.

This helping of pixar entertainment tackled the issue of a giant killer asteroid on a collision course with Earth (hence the name) and our unlikely heroes are the only ones to stop it. In my opinion a lot of the content in this feature was a bit deep and meaningful for a kids film and most of the references (Pythagoras anyone?) would go straight over the youngsters heads. However the characters were as cute as ever and Scrat steals the show as always.

TWITTER 7/22/2016 Ray Romano Queen Latifah John Leguizamo and Denis Leary return in a franchise thats starting to show its age. Toward the end of Ice Age Collision Course while attempting to divert the path of an incoming killer asteroid Ray Romanos woolly mammoth Manny sighs ""This isnt working."" Its a sentiment likely to be shared by many enduring this disappointing chaotic fifth installment of the wildly successful computer-animated franchise. While the Ice Age movies have increasingly tended to place shtick ahead of substance there had always remained a certain sweetness at their core manifested through the various milestones taking place in the main characters prehistoric lives. Sadly 15 years in even the domestic developments surrounding Manny and his brood have been relegated to the sidelines displaced by too many shrill characters frantically attempting to pad the emaciated plot. Given the films track record theres still sufficient distraction for younger fans to allow Fox to handily build on the more than 2.8 billion theyve amassed in worldwide grosses to date (it had its premiere at the Sydney Film Festival) but others cant help but notice the vast emptiness of it all. The new chapter as with the previous ones kicks off with a Scrat prologue with Neil deGrasse Tyson this time providing the introduction as the hapless saber-tooth squirrel is chasing his elusive acorn throughout the cosmos ping-ponging off celestial bodies and helping to initiate the Big Bang Theory in the process. Meanwhile back down on terra firma Manny and Ellie (Queen Latifah) arent exactly thrilled about the impending marriage between daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and the perpetually upbeat Julian (newcomer Adam Devine) but the threat of an empty nest quickly takes a backseat to that ginormous fiery rock hurtling toward them. Manny desperately needs to come up with a plan but its hard to concentrate what with the cacophony of creatures that have been crammed into IA5. Joining the likes of Sid (John Leguizamo) Diego (Denis Leary) Shira (Jennifer Lopez) and Granny (Wanda Sykes) is a whole menagerie of new characters played by Nick Offerman singer Jessie J Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Michael Strahan among others. Its as if co-directors Michael Thurmeier and Galen Tan Chu both veterans of the Ice Age franchise sensed that there was essentially nowhere left to go with the concept and opted to instead overstuff the production with too many characters breathlessly doing tired pop culture-heavy ""bits"" like it was open mic night at the Paleolithic Punch Line. Even when screenwriters Michael Wilson Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner also no strangers to the Ice Age universe attempt to introduce something fresher such as Geotopia a new age-y community living inside a giant geode the concept never comes to life. In the absence of a skeleton of a storyline to hang a film upon youve got a lot more of Simon Peggs hyper swashbuckling weasel Buck (he sat out Dawn of the Dinosaurs) and noticeably more Scrat which is never a bad thing -- although every time the film checks up on his outer space adventures it disrupts whatever remaining investment there was in its main plotline. As always it all at least looks very nice -- the Ice Age movies could always be counted on to possess a state-of-the-art visual luster and Collision Course certainly does well by those 3D glasses. At times it feels as if you could reach right out and stroke all that undulating CG fur. For the most part though that blazing asteroid cant arrive soon enough.

"Ice Age Collision Course review An engaging return to form | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Ice Age Collision Course Owen Gleiberman Chief Film Critic OwenGleiberman 4 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Fox Family June 18 2016 | 0700PM PT The long-running series returns to form with an infectious chatterbox comedy about the end of the world as we know it. ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the breathless fifth chapter in what has become the most die-hard franchise in the history of digital animation kicks off with a cheeky but spectacular prologue in which Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel accidentally creates the solar system. Hes sitting in a frozen wasteland in pursuit of -- what else? -- the acorn thats forever destined to squirt out of his clutches. Only now that precious nut gets wedged into a control lever... that operates a flying saucer... thats been frozen inside a glacier. The sequence that follows might be described as Terrence Malick meets Tex Avery When Scrat hits that lever and liberates the alien ship it shoots off into space and causes a chain reaction that knocks apart the planets like billiard balls in much the same way that Scrat split the continents apart in the 2010 short ""Scrats Continental Crack-Up."" Scrat has been there of course from the first ""Ice Age"" film back in 2002. (Yes weve been living with these movies since what may seem like the dawn of time.) Yet theres something about Scrat No matter how often we see him his manic starving Tasmanian-devil energy never gets old. More than just a gnashing mascot hes got a hungry life force thats primordial. With ""Collision Course"" he once again becomes the guiding spirit of the ""Ice Age"" movies and the result proves to be an essential course correction for the franchise. After the last two installments ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" (2009) and the all-too-aptly named ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" (2012) the series was running on prehistoric fumes but now against all odds it has gotten its mojo back. ""Collision Course"" is a cosmic comedy about facing down the end of the world as we know it. It may be a slight entertainment in the grand scheme of things but its been made with a busy nattering joy that is positively infectious. Even with animated competition from the likes of Pixar (""Finding Dory"") and Illumination (""The Secret Life of Pets"") box office prospects look solid as ice. Back in the snowy prehistoric wilds life has been good for our old friends Sid the neurotic lisping ground sloth (John Leguizamo) Diego the grumpy saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) and of course Manny the woolly mammoth (Ray Romano) and his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) whose daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) is now engaged -- to a mastodon named Julian voiced by Adam Devine as the series first bro. Manny has serious doubts about marrying off his daughter to a flaky hipster who wants to take her far away. But that all seems like small beer after Scrat still floating around in space threatens the very existence of Earth by setting off a meteor shower that gives rise to one notably gargantuan purple-flaming rock speeding toward the planet. Its Buck the one-eyed British weasel returning from the third ""Ice Age"" film who diagnoses the catastrophe and also figures out how they can stop it by journeying to the valley where meteors have always struck Earth and creating a magnetic space that will attract and divert this one. The science is loopy and its meant to be but thats perfectly OK since the true molecular force at work in ""Ice Age Collision Course"" has to do with a very special brand of entertainment fuel. Call it sidekick energy. Audiences of course have fed off this energy for decades; they do it every time characters like Timon and Pumbaa pop up in ""The Lion King"" or Eddie Murphys in-your-face Donkey in ""Shrek."" But ""Collision Course"" even more than the previous ""Ice Age"" films takes this phenomenon to the next level because aside from Ray Romanos slightly saddened old-school crustiness the movie in essence is all sidekick energy. Its Sid the sloth jabbering on about how lonely he is or his ex-girlfriend the Brooklyn American princess Francine (Melissa Rauch) telling him ""You look nothing like ya profile picshuh"" or Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) the skinny twin opossums commenting upon everything like a Greek chorus of imbecility or Simon Peggs Buck being introduced with an operatic solo so deliriously quick and tongue-twisty that even the flying camera can barely keep up with him or the movie pausing for a pit stop inside Bucks brain where an astronomer named Neil deBuck Weasel (Neil deGrasse Tyson) holds forth or Wanda Sykes toothless scraggly-haired Granny sloth saying things like ""That plan is so dumb I wish it had a face so I could smack it"" In theory this much comic relief is too much (it might almost seem to be something you need relief from). But the films co-directors Mike Thurmeier (who co-directed the last two films) and Galen T. Chu create a welcome mixture of tones. They let the apocalyptic asteroid plot furnish a hint of gravitas and more than that they allow us to embrace the films hypomanic menagerie as a community of crackpots who are maximally silly but also rather vulnerable. We cant take them seriously but that doesnt mean that we want to see them extinct. The other aspect of ""Ice Age Collision Course"" that lends this finally conventional movie a wee bit of soul is the animation an often gorgeous treasure trove of finely sculpted visual wit. The glaciers are bathed in a misty lavender glow suggesting the most perfect sunset youve ever seen. And that feels right since any variation on purple -- the color of the asteroids flame -- carries a hint of the sun setting on Earth itself. The whole look and feel of the Ice Age here is more complicated than its been a symbiotic dialogue between woodland and snow with hidden pockets of splendor. When our heroes make their way to the lair of Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) the yoga-loving spiritual leader of Geotopia the character turns out to be an oddly fey stereotype but the crystal paradise of youth he presides over is an ice castle of gigantic raw jewels thats like candy for the eyes. Can our heroes pile enough of those crystals into a nearby volcano to thwart natures end? By the finish youre pumped to see them do it. Youre also pumped -- maybe to the point of surprise -- to want to see what happens to them in the next sequel. Film Review Ice Age Collision CourseReviewed at 20th Century Fox New York June 16 2016.

I miss the days when Variety critics had taste Reply SS says June 18 2016 at 1136 pm SPOILER ALERT ""Its Buck the one-eyed British weasel returning from the third ""Ice Age"" film who diagnoses the catastrophe and also figures out how they can stop it by journeying to the valley where meteors have always struck Earth and creating a magnetic space that will attract and divert this one."" Thats when I stopped reading your review. You might want to remove that and then this comment. (Whats with all these new amateur critics at Variety??

Top 40 Pixar Characters From Toy Story to Finding Dory (Videos) This series is so blandly forgettable that parents could probably show an earlier entry to their kids and pretend its the new one In one of the great mysteries of contemporary film most sequels to animated feature hits go directly to DVD while somehow a fifth ""Ice Age"" movie is galumphing its way into theaters. Lacking laughs energy and sharp edges in equal degrees to its predecessors ""Ice Age Collision Course"" takes huge strides in the hotly-contested race to be 2016s Most Irrelevant Sequel. Theres plenty of fart jokes forward motion and bright colors to engage easily-entertained children but their parents will be subjected to yet another movie that has all the zing of watching evolution in real time. Scene-stealer Scrat and his acorn have been promoted from sideline slapstick to plot engine - the hyperactive rodent stumbles upon a flying saucer embedded in the ice and he accidentally launches into outer space forming the Milky Way galaxy and sending some extinction-level meteors toward Earth. After five minutes with our protagonists you may find yourself on Team Meteor. See Video Ice Age Collision Course Trailer Teases the End of an Era Woolly mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) is grappling with plot complications that date back to the Pleistocene era of TV sitcoms - hes forgotten about his wedding anniversary after wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) has thrown them a big party and both of them are worried that daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) plans to pull up stakes and go exploring with fiance Julian (Adam DeVine Jack Black-ing as hard as he can). With the impending meteor bringing certain death to the mammoths as well as sloth pals Sal (John Leguizamo) and Granny (Wanda Sykes saddled with some of the worst sassy-senior-citizen dialogue on record) and sabertooths Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) all seems lost. Not so fast says weasel Buck (Simon Pegg) who suggests they travel to the area where the meteors always land so they can figure out a way to send it back into space. (The science here leads to the films one passable gag involving a celebrity cameo.) See Photos All 17 Pixar Movies Ranked Worst to Best Adding new characters over the course of the previous four movies has overloaded the proceedings -- Lopez has about six lines here -- and ""Ice Age Collision Course"" throws in a bunch of new ones from a band of predatory dino-birds (led by Nick Offerman) to the yoga-obsessed Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson). The dialogue that gets passed around to this massive cast courtesy of writers Michael Wilson Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner (""Ice Age"" series vets all) stoops to pick up every possible gag about poop butts and penises it can manage to cadge along with way. Visually at least directors Mike Thurmeier and Galen C. Chu along with their team of artists know how to create striking-looking characters and thanks to our heroes journey to a city made entirely of gemstones the filmmakers get to play around with colors beyond the greens and browns of the forest. If only the characters themselves and what they have to say could be as interesting as how they look and where they go. Also Read Guillermo del Toro Reveals Cast for Netflix Series Trollhunters The ""Ice Age"" movies are so utterly featureless and interchangeable that if Fox reissued an old one under a new title its quite possible that no one would notice. ""Collision Course"" offers an argument for extinction that even environmentalists could support. Email 15 Most Beloved Disney/Pixar Animated Shorts Ranked (Videos) Both Disney and Pixar have left a mark on animation that no other studios can match and for both their origins can be traced to animated shorts. Pixar has accompanied all of its feature films since its second feature film (""A Bugs Life"") with opening shorts and Disney has recently followed suit with shorts that range from groundbreaking experiments to revitalization of their most classic characters. 15.) ""Tin Toy"" (1988) -- This is the short that saved Pixar from financial ruin became the first CGI film to win an Oscar and led to Disney making a deal with Pixar to create ""Toy Story."" The baby that chases after our toy hero was stuck in the Uncanny Valley when the film first came out and looks even worse in the years since. Still it went a long way to showing the world the sort of storytelling that could be made with computer animation. 14.) ""Lorenzo"" (2004) -- Designed for a ""Fantasia"" film that never got completed ""Lorenzo"" features a spoiled fat cat who makes a big mistake when he mocks a black cat for not having a tail. The black cat hexes the tubby feline causing his tail to come alive and wrap him into a dance scene set to an Argentinean tango. 13.) ""One Man Band"" (2006) -- A whimsical tale with Pixars most creative use of music. Two street performers play multiple instruments simultaneously in an attempt to win the money of a young girl who wants to see a show. 12.) ""Geris Game"" (1997) -- Pixar put its short film projects on hold during the 90s to focus on building profits with feature films and commercials. They returned to the format in a big way with an Oscar-winning short featuring an old man playing chess against himself. Its notable for being the first Pixar project with a human main character after years of toys and insects in the lead. 11.) ""For The Birds"" (2001) -- Pixars third Oscar-winning short featured a large gangly bird trying to befriend a bunch of snobby little birds that wanted nothing to do with him. To animate the film Pixar developed a new animation tool to allow for the birds to have feathers that moved individually. 10.) ""Sanjays Super Team"" (2015) -- A deeply personal Pixar short made by director Sanjay Patel to show the internal conflict he felt as a kid between his familys Hindu traditions and the pull of modern Western culture. The cartoon features Sanjay as a kid imagining Hindu deities as superheroes much like the ones he watches on Saturday morning. 9.) ""The Little Matchgirl"" (2006) -- Heres a rarity a Disney film that doesnt have a happy ending. Set to a string quartet piece by Alexander Borodin and based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale the story depicts a girl stuck in the cold streets of Moscow at Christmas. 8.) ""How To Hook Up Your Home Theater"" (2007) -- In the 40s and 50s Goofy became a prominent member of Disneys stable with the ""Everyman"" shorts a series of cartoons where he would clumsily struggle to do things like play baseball and do a waltz while a droll announcer provided instructions. Disney brought back the format with a topic every sports fan can sympathize with setting up an HDTV and surround sound in your living room. 7.) ""Runaway Brain"" (1997) -- A common complaint about Mickey Mouse is that in modern times he has become more of a corporate mascot than a cartoon character. The Disney shorts restore him to greatness particularly this macabre tale in which a mad scientist switches Mickeys brain with that of a monster named Julius leading to the creepy sight of Mickeys face turning into a sharp-toothed visage. 6.) ""The Blue Umbrella"" (2013) -- A dramatic change in Pixars visual style. The story of two umbrellas befriending each other is what one expects from the studio. Whats unexpected is the realistic city the story is set in swapping out Pixars usual cartoon style with an attention to detail youd see in ""Batman Arkham Knight."" 5.) ""Get a Horse"" (2013) -- A hilarious and powerful retrospective on the evolution of Disney animation. What starts as a throwback to Mickey Mouses 1928 roots quickly transforms into a fourth-wall breaking blend of 2D and 3D animation. The cartoon also reuses archival audio of Walt Disney for Mickeys voice. 4.) ""Piper"" (2016) -- The newest and most detailed Pixar short to date starring a baby sandpiper bird who overcomes his fear of the waves to forage for clams on the beach. The shore is rendered with the same attention to detail as ""The Blue Umbrella"" culminating in an underwater scene where you can see every grain of sand. 3.) ""Paperman"" (2012) -- The most visually striking work Disney has produced this decade. This short features a cubicle worker trying to get the attention of a woman in the next building over with paper planes. Presented in black and white with a blend of computer and traditional animation it was the first Disney short to win an Oscar since 1969. 2.) ""Day and Night"" (2010) -- Two 2D animated characters symbolizing day and night squabble over which of them is better. In addition to having one clever sight gag after another the short provides commentary on prejudice and fear of the unknown without its characters saying a single word. 1.) ""Destino"" (2003) -- Disney has made nothing like this before and likely never will again. In 1945 Walt Disney began a collaboration with Salvador Dali that was shuttered due to financial struggles. Over fifty years later Walts nephew Roy E. Disney commissioned the companys French animation studio to make a short based on Dalis perplexing storyboards. The result is a cryptic but beautiful short that brings Dalis paintings to life.
