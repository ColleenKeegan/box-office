Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday November 21 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Just two years ago Alexander Payne was releasing ""The Descendants"" his lush melancholy ode to family ties and Americas most far-reaching polyglot frontier. With ""Nebraska"" he once again delves into family dynamics and self-deception this time training his keen eye on a part of American culture that in terms of the popular imagination has been virtually hiding in plain sight. Disposing of Red State cliches condescending superiority and trite sentimentalism Payne brings rigorous often goofily amusing insight to this portrayal of his home state (he grew up in Omaha and still lives there part-time). Only someone with intimate knowledge of the Midwests singular cadences social codes and confounding emotional stew (er covered hot dish) of aggression and politesse could pull off something as masterful meaningful and poetic as ""Nebraska."" And perhaps only Bruce Dern could inhabit the character of Woody Grant -- the alcoholic cantankerous cotton-haired lead character of this alternately sad and funny picaresque. Much like the pitchfork-wielding stoic in his reverse namesakes most famous painting Woody is something of a cipher his speech rarely veering from taciturn responses like ""Guess so"" and ""I suppose."" But as ""Nebraska"" unfolds -- when Woody enlists his son David (Will Forte) to help him collect the million-dollar prize money promised to him in a sweepstakes form letter -- the traumas and tiny heartbreaks of Woodys life emerge drip by drip like the condensation on the glass of buttermilk he sips late at night in the kitchen alone. In many ways ""Nebraska"" hews to the classic buddy road-picture with the mismatched Woody and Dave setting forth on a journey of mishaps chance encounters hilarious high jinks and -- of course -- filial bonding. But thanks to Bob Nelsons lean tone-perfect script and Paynes tender execution ""Nebraska"" never feels patronizing or facile. Sure its hilarious when Woody and Dave arrive in Woodys depressed home town of Hawthorne and Dave immediately endures a mocking interchange with his two huge corn-fed cousins about how long it took him to drive from Montana. Later Payne and longtime cinematographer Phedon Papamichael film Woody Dave and their relatives as a human still life of resignation a tableau of eight white guys sitting around talking about cars staring at an unseen television and watching the game. These moments inject welcome notes of deadpan levity but they never devolve into ridicule Payne has filmed ""Nebraska"" in wide-screen black and white lending the prairies blighted main streets and faded taverns an artful gelatin-print air of pastoral stillness. When Woodys wife Kate (June Squibb) arrives on the scene the mood loosens considerably -- shes a foul-mouthed sharp-tongued battle-axe who skates dangerously close to the caricature of the Swearin Grandma. Luckily Nelson and Payne seem always to know instinctively when to pull back and change course either sending Woody and Dave to another stop along their odyssey or soothing the waters by introducing an artifact or figure from Woodys past like a former business partner played by Stacey Keach or Angela McEwans newspaper editor who is true to the actresss name angelic. Its Squibbs Kate with her brutally frank pronouncements and ribald gossipy asides whos the scene-stealer of ""Nebraska."" And Forte best known as a comic actor from ""Saturday Night Live"" makes an impressively restrained dramatic debut as a man whos equally longing to connect and reflexively wary. (Bob Odenkirk lately of ""Breaking Bad"" plays Daves anchorman brother Ross.) For all of its superb supporting performances though ""Nebraska"" is Derns movie and he carries it with a sure-footed authority and focus utterly belied by Woodys own knock-kneed hobble and abstracted spaced-out demeanor. As the reasons for his sadness and self-medication come to light it becomes clear that rather than being cut off from his feelings Woody is channeling them through his quixotic quest which becomes his last-ditch attempt at expressing hope desire and -- perhaps most important -- long-buried generosity. Dern lets that realization seep in slowly never forcing the audience to love him never indulging in the plays for affection and sympathy that an actor of his skill and experience know inside out. In other words he has the guts to let Woody be Woody and to allow us to come to him or not. As Woody himself might put it ""Doesnt matter."" At 76 Dern finally gets to be the leading man hes long deserved to be filling ""Nebraskas"" wide open spaces with a performance of subtlety bittersweetness and surpassing emotional courage. And hes created a character every bit as iconic as his painterly alter-ego one who eloquently embodies the anxieties thwarted aspirations and stubborn tenacity of a rural middle class facing inexorable decline. Hes made an ""American Gothic"" for 21st-century post-recession America. Who needs a pitchfork anyway when you can have an ice cold bottle of Bud?     R. At area theaters.

"Movie Review Roundup Four Thanksgiving Weekend Options From Oldboy to Nebraska << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Movie Review Roundup Four Thanksgiving Weekend Options From Oldboy to Nebraska Universal Pictures Reviews November 27 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print After dinner after football youll want a movie. Here are four options. Oldboy directed by Spike Lee Everything is wrong with Lees version of Park Chan-wooks notorious super-violent super-action-thriller. For one thing its far from super. Not the quality per se (although for Lee thats off too) but the energy. Parks movie lunged and charged at you. This one doesnt muster that same relentless forward motion. A sleazy suit (Josh Brolin) wakes up one day and finds himself locked in a room. He doesnt know why. But he does a lot of sit-ups and yoga. Twenty years later hes set free climbing out of the sort of Louis Vuitton trunk youd find in a Wes Anderson movie. Dressed in a nicer suit the man searches for his captor his daughter and answers Did for instance he actually kill his ex-wife? He winds up slaying lots of men with a hammer a bat and his bare hands. Parks movie from 2003 had both a maniac charge and psychopathic precision. He meant every broken bone every instance of impromptu dentistry. Violence was the films diseased currency. It was gross but it meant something. And you never lost sight of the larger existential mystery Into whom does all this killing make this man? Lees interpretation features an impressive warehouse brawl between Brolin and dozens of goons. Lee shoots in a long shot with few cuts. Its the most delightfully directed humorously choreographed sequence in the movie with Brolin as a homicidal Gene Kelly. Its also another moment that makes you wonder where that Spike Lee musical is. Otherwise this Oldboy which Mark Protosevich has rewritten drags along. The existential questions are better applied to Lee Who is this man with the sudden interest in empty grisliness? Im guessing that its a director daring critics (in the press in the audience) to attack him for the tools to heads and the slicing of necks. Lee hasnt been shy in complaining about Quentin Tarantinos easy comfort with blackness with his audaciously vulgar use of Samuel L. Jackson in his movies. Jackson and Lee havent done a movie since Jungle Fever in 1991. Oldboy is a thankless reunion. Jackson spends a couple of scenes in loudly colored funky clothes (think Cameo) and a strip of hair across his bald head. He smokes and curses up a storm not as the villain (that would be Sharlto Copley whose soft menace is memorably creepy) but as his helper. Why not celebrate the reunion with a better part? Jacksons treatment here feels like a punishment for defection. And the movie feels like an encroachment upon Tarantinos Asian action turf. But theres none of Tarantinos geeky movie glee -- and little of Lees just a trudging obligation to see the movie through. You cant say that about any of his nonfiction work in the last decade -- its alive. The best we get here is a strange poster of a grinning bellhop (its Lees younger brother Cinque) that hangs in Brolins cell and some winking production and costume design. With the arrival of the nasty explanation for Brolins suffering you realize you dont quite care. Park wanted his finale to nauseate you more than the physical violence did. That was cartoon stuff by comparison. Lees movie should be appalling. Its defensive instead playing catch-up both to its superior source material and to Tarantino. Most appalling is that Oldboy isnt even called a Spike Lee Joint. That makes sense. Its karaoke. Black Nativity directed by Kasi Lemmons This musical means well (its very vaguely based on Langston Hughess yuletide gospel pageant). But from the opening minutes things dont bode well. We go from an apartment eviction notice to a mother (Jennifer Hudson) altruistically shipping off her teenage son Langston (Jacob Latimore) to Harlem and her estranged churchy parents (the Reverend Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett). On the bus he sing-raps with Nas. When he arrives in New York a Jaden Smith look-alike steals his backpack which had all his cash. His phone is dead too so he enters a hotel to call his grandparents who are looking for him in Times Square. A guest has left his wallet on the counter and yes Langston considers picking it up and taking it. Instead he hands it to its owner but he winds up in jail anyway -- next to Tyrese who asks ""Langston. Like the poet?"" Says Langston ""You know it."" This is the first 15 or 20 minutes. But all of Black Nativity proceeds with sort of clumsy obviousness. Whitaker is full of lectures about Hughes and full of guilt about his daughter who winds up belting a number in front of foreclosure signs. There are family secrets here that you can see coming before the movie is even partway over. You dont feel good about being a half-hour ahead of everyone. But the movie has the kind of earnest badness that starts to hook you. Langston belts some numbers with a sexy homeless couple. He hits up Tyrese for a gun. As he pieces this together he sings ""Did my birth destroy my family?"" Hudson can afford a cab from Times Square to Harlem that cost more than her bus fare. And for a couple of scenes Mary J. Blige wears a big yellow wig that makes her look like an expensive dessert. At least once theres a fantasy in which four characters partake in a hard-luck sing-off. The actual nativity pageant as narrated (and sung) by Whitaker feels like something new -- well it feels like one of Ms. Grants numbers from Fame. But it gives Lemmons a chance to do some filmmaking. The pageant is Hughess material (it played Off Broadway in 1961) and you dont know why its not the entire movie. Its as if she couldnt secure good funding without the ghetto-bourgeois tension. At some point Latimore even throws his mother a tantrum that more or less asks ""You had me living in Good Times when I coulda been a Huxtable?"" Lemmons has also given Samuel L. Jackson two of his more memorable roles -- as a leering daddy in Eves Bayou and as a homeless dreadlocked violinist in The Cavemans Valentine. Jacksons not here perhaps because he has cut down on the number of mistakes he can make in a week. You want the best for Lemmons. Shes an independent filmmaker who seems to have to fight to keep working. You even want the best for this movie. There would appear to be redemption once the entire cast fills Whitakers church with a gospel version of Stevie Wonders As. But the same song in the same setting is also the emotional climax of Best Man Holiday. Only one makes you laugh. Homefront directed by Gary Fleder When you see Fleders name you know youre in for an evening of trashed-up thrills. He has made the good kind (Kiss the Girls) the icky (Michael Douglas in Dont Say a Word) the trendy (Things to Do in Denver When Youre Dead) and the Grisham (Runaway Jury). This new movie might be the most inane. It has Jason Statham as Phil Broker a former undercover narcotics detective living a new life as a carpenter in Louisiana. He left the force after a drug raid went action-movie crazy and killed a kingpins son. The imprisoned father (Chuck Zito) gets wind of Brokers new location more or less courtesy of a small-time dealer that James Franco plays. Obviously it all climaxes with Statham unleashing a Home Depot-load of hurt -- a toolbox to the head a ladder to the face a hammer not quite as imaginatively deployed as in Oldboy. No I dont know what accent hes using here but Statham can still turn motion into magic. But when its not clobbering time the rest of the movie feels like a production you couldnt even get a WWE wrestler to agree to. The screenplay is by Sylvester Stallone and its mumbled plot suggests that it might have been dictated more than it was typed. You dont know what anyones motivation is for anything -- neither Kate Bosworths skeletal mother-junkie nor Winona Ryders fit ex-""biker skank."" Not to mention the anonymous absurdly armed dudes who come looking for Phil and his daughter. Its that kind of movie. Its also the kind of movie in which everyone uses profanity as if it had just been legalized. This film features the worst cursing I might ever have heard and it must account for a quarter of the dialogue. Another quarter consists of characters screaming ""Broker"" the way Principal Rooney growled ""Bueller."" It all ends in a hail of bullets and flying workmens boots. I can barely remember who lives or dies. I barely cared. Nebraska directed by Alexander Payne A delirious old war veteran named Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) attempts to walk from Billings Montana to Lincoln Nebraska. The occasion is the million dollars hes told he has won in a sweepstakes. Woodys wife Kate (June Squibb) and his younger son David (Will Forte) know theres no money. But David reluctantly agrees to drive him while Kate makes an embittered fuss. The film becomes a journey in pictures but an unusually frill-less one. No one learns a lesson. No one hugs. The tall tales one-liners and complex blend of Midwestern good nature and anomie are from Bob Nelsons screenplay (his first). What Payne lends is a sense of menace and melancholy that after About Schmidt Sideways and The Descendants feels bracingly new for him. The cynicism is sugar-free -- theres no Kathy Bates or Hawaiian vistas to alleviate the air of lamentation. Nebraska was shot in color then drained of it so that the landscapes and long faces appear stark in black-and-white. The movie has its moments of comedic nonsense -- the Grant boys spend a few days in Woodys hometown of Hawthorne where Woodys twin nephews scheme to get the money. But the insinuations of Stacy Keach as one of Woodys old buddies and Squibbs brassy blunt approach to exasperation mar the comic-strip outlines. Forte is also a surprise making David a perfect blend of his parents resentment and compliance. Is Payne mocking Woody and by extension the Midwest? Is Derns acting recessive or simply blank? The deft achievement of this movie is that it has a hardness that doesnt delight in the meanness of mockery as the Coens often do. Dern meanwhile does nothing Method-actor flashy nothing Dern-like. Woody could be one of the war vets Dern played decades ago aged calcified demented checked out. Another filmmaker would have softened the blow of the trip and found a bit of redemptive magic and made the film an elegy for a dying way of being a man for a dying way of being an American. Not Payne. Hes strictly declarative here. Those ways are dead and this is the eulogy. Filed Under Reviews Alexander Payne James Franco Jason Statham Samuel L.

With films like Sideways and The Descendants he tells laidback tales of people facing problems or changes in their lives. His new film Nebraska is shot in black and white and takes the name of his home state as its title. Its an intimate road movie about one family yet it also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time dying vision of the American Midwest.Theres a wistful air of time passed and chances lost as Payne tells of a quiet but irascible elderly man Woody (Bruce Dern) a retired mechanic taken on an interstate trip to his small fading Nebraskan hometown by his patient son David (Will Forte) who sells stereos in the suburbs. Their journey is part of a wild goose chase to collect some non-existent prize money which Woody insists hes owed after receiving a scam letter. His snappy wife Kate (June Squibb) has long since stopped listening to - but not loving - him. I never knew the son of a bitch wanted to be a millionaire she barks. The promise of riches sends the heads of some old friends and family into a spin and shows their true colours. But David and Woodys other son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) do their best to humour a dad who hasnt been much of a father to them.The films laughs are as low-key as Paynes reflective but straight-shooting style of storytelling and theres a fair amount of sadness. Theres a last-minute dash for warmth too but mostly Nebraska is fairly blunt about family relationships and friendships while preserving the possibility that neither are necessarily bad for you and never getting too tragic or maudlin. One of the poignant questions that hangs over the film is whether Woody played with real unshowiness by veteran character actor Dern is going senile or is depressed neither of which possibilities are helped by his lingering alcoholism.Whats driving Woody to go on this trip? Does he believe the letter? Or is it a last-minute desire on his part however deeply buried behind his inexpressive exterior to squeeze something else out of a not exactly perfect life? Nebraska doesnt suggest any trite answers to any of this. Its also pleasingly free of nostalgia even if the past hangs heavily over Bob Wilsons well calculated often moving screenplay and theres definitely a suggestion that the world has got harder meaner He just believes stuff that people tell him David says of his old dad. Its often funny too in a deadpan gallows-humour sort of way and more than ever Payne allows the humour to rise up gently from his story rather than burst through it.

Funny  insightful beautifully scored and photographed (Black amp; white has never looked so good since Woody Allens Manhattan) there is a dreamy feel to the whole film. Wonderful performances from every single member of the cast with Bruce Dern just outstanding. Even 110 mins felt way too short - I could have easily sat through another hour of such high quality work. For me one of the finest films of the last decade and certainly the best one Ive seen this past year.

I dont know what it is that makes black and white photography so appropriate for capturing the wide open spaces of the States but for me it is up there with ""Hud"" or ""The Last Picture Show"" both also elegies for vital qualities that have been undermined or lost. This is both gentle but tough unpretentious but wise. Payne directs with exactly the right touch allowing the film to unfold in a way that seems relaxed and natural but was probably achieved by rigorous attention to detail. Most of all for general audiences it is often laugh out loud funny. In fact so-called comedies have often left me stony faced. The comedy is achieved not because we are laughing AT the characters but rather because we love them and can empathise with them. The single criticism is that the two cousins are at times made to be more oafish than they need to be and verge on caricature. This is a minor quibble. See this before it vanishes under the plethora of Christmas blockbusters.

The sons patience exasperation and love in trying to humour his declining father by taking him on a wild goose chase across the stark flat landscapes of the Mid West to claim some mythical prize money will strike chords with anyone who has cared for an elderley relative. The fathers emotional incapacity and stubborness coupled with his fragility is finely played by Bruce Dern and Will Forte as the long suffering son whose own humdrum life is of no interest to his self-absorbed dad is also a delight. The ability of our parents to enbarass us even at middle age is well captued when David ( Fortes) mother regales them with tales of how several men in their home town wanted to get into her bloomers and insists on lifting her skirt at one of her past suitors graves to show him what he missed. Davids persistence in trying to grant his Dad his humble desires despite the inevitable absence of prize noney and thus poke two fingers at his home town former cronies who have written him off is touching and enteraining enables a small triumph; act of tenderness which makes this film quietly memorable in underlining the need for small but significant acts of human kindness.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/nebraska,200,nebraska2,nebraska,timeout

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Nebraska Share Comment ""Nebraska"" the latest from Alexander Payne (""The Descendants"") is a desolate comedy-drama about fathers sons lifes highways and missed off-ramps. The plot is a close cousin to Paynes 2002 ""About Schmidt"" with Bruce Dern as an ornery old coot on a 900-mile road trip to claim a sweepstakes prize and Will Forte unexpectedly good as the grown son trying to get him there. Shot in a black and white that tends to the glow-y infrared end of the spectrum its a movie about ghosts the American promise of a quick million and a man driving his own car for three blocks. Despite some easy cynicism about Midwesterners the film floods you with emotion when you least expect it. With June Squibb and Stacy Keach. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Nebraska"" is a wonderful comedy shot in black-and-white and told in shades of gray. Its a low-key story about fathers and mothers and brothers and life and death. Its characters are as contradictory and rich as people we know. Take David Grant (Will Forte) a kind careworn audio salesman in a Butte Mont. electronics store. Hes too gentle to push customers into actually buying things. Hes the one his family assigns to retrieve his dad from the police when the old man wanders off down the highway. Woody (Bruce Dern) has won a million dollars from a magazine marketing company -- thinks he has anyway -- and since nobody would drive him to Lincoln Neb. to collect the check he sets out on foot. Unwilling to make him face disappointment alone David hopes to let him down easy. Against the wishes of his tart-tongued mom Kate (June Squibb) and bitter brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) who resent the old man for years of drinking and inattention David drives Woody cross-country. First stop Woodys old home town where the locals get swept up in the million-dollar fantasy. Woody Grant a taciturn testy dreamer is a classic character. Woodys speech is curt. His standard expression is a ""youve got to be kidding me"" squint. His knees are shot but he stumbles onward without complaint. Derns performance teems with emotion beneath the surface. One of Davids motives for making the trip is to learn more about his laconic father. Woody is too closed-off to volunteer the affirmation and acceptance the forlorn David wants from him but the return to Woodys old homestead is like stepping into a family album. The owner of the town newspaper teaches him a lot about Woodys Korean War experiences his personality as a young man the women who competed for his attention. Each revelation shows David his father is someone he scarcely knows. nebraska  out of 4 stars Rating R for language. Theater Uptown Theres abundant small-town satire here with a melancholy-comic tone thats pleasantly askew. Woodys tribe of equally stoical brothers and a pair of knucklehead nephews provide easy hugely funny targets. Yet there are more decent naive folks in Bob Nelsons awards-worthy screenplay than boobs or grifters. Director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"" ""The Descendants"") makes movies about people not IMAX-sized monsters or superheroes. He takes his time allowing us to observe and form our own opinions about his men and women in all their flawed frayed humanity. They do the ordinary things that people do -- eat travel about find lodgings -- and we gather a lot from those everyday actions. His films are both surprising and logical and ""Nebraska"" is one of his best. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

HOEP This image released by Paramount Pictures shows Bruce Dern as Woody Grant left and Will Forte as David Grant in a scene from the film ""Nebraska"" about a booze-addled father who makes to Nebraska with his estranged son in order to claim a million dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize. (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) HANDOUT Bruce Dern and Will Forte play a father and son in ""Nebraska."" (Courtesy Paramount Pictures/MCT) Seven years ago my wife and I got married in a town called Valentine Neb. We chose it because of the name but many couples from neighboring South Dakota choose it because the marriage-license fee is cheaper in Nebraska. Thats the kind of people who inhabit the Great Plains -- pragmatic and unsentimental northern Europeans and Native Americans. They inhabit a harsh landscape but expect to be rewarded for their hard work.Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) believes that his payoff has come at last in the form of a million-dollar sweepstakes prize. But Woody is 77 too senile and sodden with booze to realize its a scam. His fed-up wife Katie (June Squibb) and his protective son David (Will Forte) refuse to drive him from their home in Billings Mont. to the sweepstakes office in Lincoln Neb. so stubborn Woody starts walking.David a stereo salesman whose girlfriend has left him with little to lose reluctantly decides to drive his father the 800 miles to Lincoln hoping they can make peace with each other before the loveless old man slips around the bend. Instead they end up in Woodys former hometown of Hawthorne Neb. where his extended family and former friends want a piece of his presumed fortune. One of the best films of the year the deadpan comedy ""Nebraska"" was directed by Alexander Payne an Omaha native who returns to his home state after award-winning detours to California (""Sideways"") and Hawaii (""The Descendents""). As in ""About Schmidt"" an old mans road trip becomes a journey of awakening although Woodys is slower and sadder. Dern typecast as a villainous psycho for much of his movie career appears shockingly old and addled but thats just acting and when the character gets a few beers under his belt he is lucid and direct admitting his infidelities and vices.Yet a saving grace of this potentially bleak film is that Woody is not quite as monstrous as he seems and its his neglected family that peels away the layers of calloused old skin. When the vultures circle Katie is his feistiest protector. Squibb is from Vandalia Ill. and shes so effortlessly profane and funny that if you didnt remember her small role as Jack Nicholsons wife in ""About Schmidt"" you might mistake her for one of the many nonactors who give the film such an authentic small-town flavor. Forte is an alumnus of ""Saturday Night Live"" but here hes essentially the straight man to Dern. Likewise Bob Odenkirk plays it straight as Davids marginally more successful brother but the two comedians get to engage in some life-affirming antics before the storys pitch-perfect finale.A co-star deserving special mention is Nebraska itself which Payne films in black-and-white to mirror the austerity of life on the de-populated prairie. These corners of the Cornhusker State are as empty as the promise of a sweepstakes prize. In this land of ghosts one old pioneer tries to grab his stake before he becomes another windblown husk.What ""Nebraska"" Three and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 155  Content Strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Nebraska (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Nebraska (R) Bruce Dern gives a career-high performance in the latest melancholy comedy from director Alexander Payne. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/26/2013 Editor rating 3.5 In Nebraska writer-director Alexander Payne (The Descendants Sideways) returns to his home turf for his smallest most intimate film yet. It is also one of his most moving. Shot by Phedon Papamichael and filled with wide black-and-white vistas of Midwestern flatlands and desolated farms the movie has a longing melancholy that leavens the humor -- its a surprisingly sad gentle comedy. Beginning with the vintage Paramount logo that opens the picture Nebraska evokes 1970s-era character studies (Hal Ashby is a particularly strong influence here). Bruce Dern stars as Woody an aging alcoholic who is hellbent on walking from Billings Mt. to Lincoln Neb. to collect a 1 million sweepstakes prize he received in the mail. Everyone tells him the letter is junk simply a scam to trick people into subscribing to magazines. But Woody is nearing the end of his life with little to show for it other than two estranged sons David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and a furious wife (June Squibb) who resents having put up with his drunken ways their entire marriage. Woodys mind is also starting to fade He says he wants to buy a truck with his winnings and an air compressor. But despite moments of haziness he will not be deterred from his quest. So David newly dumped by his girlfriend of two years agrees to drive his dad to collect his prize on the condition that they stop at a small town along the way for a family reunion. Nebraska which was written by first-timer Bob Nelson is yet another variation on the kind of road movie that Payne excels at making. We know father and son will get to know each other better during their journey but how and why that connection happens is surprising. Dern a veteran actor too often taken for granted is so good at portraying this shambling regretful cantankerous man that his performance is a revelation -- you feel like youre seeing him for the first time. Forte a former Saturday Night Live cast member best known for his MacGruber skits uses restraint and subtlety to portray a man having to rethink everything he had always believed about his father whom he had written off as an unreliable drunk. And Squibb nearly steals the movie as a hilariously cantankerous woman whose constant angry whinings and complaints are a sign of her deep love of her family. Like many of Paynes previous films Nebraska will be accused of being condescending and misanthropic in spots getting cheap laughs at the expense of cartoonish characters. But even the most broadly drawn protagonists such as Woodys two knuckle-dragging nephews end up playing an important role in the story which alternates between slow contemplative character study and madcap humor. Payne remains a deeply humanist filmmaker He loves people no matter their flaws and he once again conveys that sympathy through a beautiful haunting film that initially feels slight but grows large in your memory.

"Nebraska | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nebraska ) Nebraska (United States 2013) November 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Nostalgia can be a wonderful thing especially when a director tweaks it and plays with it. With Nebraska Alexander Payne working from a screenplay credited to Bob Nelson targets a very specific slice of Americana that has often been romanticized in Norman Rockwellian fashion. His decision to make the film in black-and-white lends a timeless quality to the proceedings and his choice of opening Nebraska with the 50s/60s Paramount logo distances the story from the present even though its evident from clues (like the models of cars on the road) that this is taking place in a contemporary era. This doesnt feel like a current movie but Payne doesnt want his viewers to become lost in a yearning for simpler times. Instead hes making a statement about the stagnation of those ""old time"" values and the misapprehension that just because something evokes a bygone epoch that its necessarily ""better."" As with Paynes previous films this once crisscrosses the lines between drama and comedy without hints of awkwardness when navigating the tone shifts. The framework is a road trip - a common enough foundation for a Payne film - but the characters dont bond the way Hollywood has taught us to expect. There is some coming together but its mostly one sided because one character has a reached a point in life where he simply cant change. Senility or Alzheimers is eating away at him and although he is mostly lucid its clear hes slipping away. Sad? At times. But also very very funny in other instances. Most of the Oscar buzz related to Nebraska will be about Bruce Dern who plays Woody Grant an octogenarian who by no means fits the stereotype of the ""loveable old coot."" Hes short-tempered stubborn and mostly unpleasant. Dern presents Woody as someone who captures our sympathy but not necessarily our amity. Hes careful to make Woody a character not a caricature. This is neither a Grumpy Old Man nor a Mr. Potter. As steady and impressive as Dern is however equal praise should be bestowed upon SNL veteran Will Forte who plays a straight role and shows himself to be an excellent dramatic actor. As Woodys long-suffering son David Forte exhibits the complexity of feelings suffered by the adult children of a deteriorating parent guilt frustration anger exasperation and a dozen other emotions. By its nature Fortes role is less showy than Derns but the performance is no less adept. Finally theres June Squibb who as Woodys wife Kate steals every scene in which she appears. Brass foul-mouthed and not afraid to speak her mind Kate fuels a good deal of the films comedy although that by no means is her sole contribution. The plot is set into motion when Woody receives a sweepstakes notice in the mail. Its one of those Publishers Clearing House things - you ""may"" have won 1 million if your unique number has been selected. Woody interprets the ""may"" as a ""have"" and decides he must travel from his home in Billings Montana to the office in Lincoln Nebraska to pick up his prize. David knows his dad hasnt won anything but agrees to drive him there anyway. Along the way they stop off for a family visit with Woodys kin and he tells anyone who will listen that hes about to become a millionaire. When David tries to contradict him no one listens. And thats when the vultures start to circle. Nebraska is a rambling affair. Its about characters and dialogue. Theres not much of a narrative to speak of - this is even more minimalist than About Schmidt or Sideways. Its about the interactions between people and how the scent of money can infect their neighborly ways. It makes a statement about human nature and illustrates that one doesnt have to live in a big city to be impacted by avarice. The most moving scene in Nebraska comes when Woody Kate and their sons David and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) tour the dilapidated house where Woody lived as a boy. Like a minimalist tour guide he describes who lived in each room but the faraway look in his eyes makes one wonder how much of him is in the present and how much has slipped into the past. Its the kind of universal experience everyone over a certain age can relate to you can go home again but it most likely wont be the same home you left behind. The only way to time travel is through memories. Nebraska is a unique and moving motion picture with just enough comedy to keep it from sliding into tragedy. It fits well in Paynes oeuvre and those who enjoyed his previous outings will almost certainly appreciate this one. We need more movies like Nebraska. Unfortunately when one considers the limited demographic likely to purchase tickets it seems the only time well get to see material like this is when there are Oscar possibilities to consider. More and more character-based storytelling is becoming a thing of a past when movies were in black-and-white even if the people inhabiting them werent.

In a career-refining performance Bruce Dern (winner of the best-actor award at the Cannes Film Festival) gives us a character in Woody Grant whos hardened by booze hard to like and -- if his bad-dad tendencies dont cut too close to your bone -- pretty durn amusing. We meet the wild-haired denture-losing codger as hes headed by foot from Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. Thats 850 miles give or take. There he plans to collect the sweepstakes winnings he learned about in a letter from Mega Sweepstakes Marketing. You know the kind. Why doesnt he? Whether out of filial duty or the freedom that comes from a recent romantic heave-ho younger son David (Will Forte) joins Woody on this misbegotten journey. Their road trip will land them in the town of Woodys childhood a rural burg peopled with family and folk from Woodys past including his one-time business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) and a high-school flame and small-town newspaper editor Peg Nagy (played with nuanced warmth by Angela McEwan). It is a telling homecoming. A scene of the Grant men watching television might be all you need to understand why Woody split and also why hes so taciturn. Its in the genes tempered by the climes of the great and dwarfing plains. As Woodys mate June Squibb swings between shrewish and just plain shrewd. (Its turning out to be some sort of Rorschach test which moviegoers like Squibbs version of prickly over Woodys.) Once she and elder son Ross (Bob Odenkirk as the anchorman hopeful) join Woody and David in Hawthorne she proves a formidable at times surprising champion. But its Forte who blunts the edges of this spiky spare tale shot in black-and-white as if to underscore the vanishing of the old places. Hes got sweet eyes that take in with exasperation and growing tenderness this man this father capable of wounding but also wounded.

Photo Paramount Pictures Nebraska review Road trip to the soul of despair 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Nebraska Comedy-drama. Starring Bruce Dern and Will Forte. Directed by Alexander Payne. (R. 115 minutes.) Director Alexander Payne marries an urbane sensibility with a rare awareness that there are entire stretches of the United States that are neither big cities nor the Wild West and that life takes place there. His latest ""Nebraska"" in addition to being a strong showcase for Bruce Dern is an authentic piece of Americana. Theres no lying or condescending from this director. ""Nebraska"" feels pure. Its also a fascinating entity rather like a patient with no apparent vital signs who is yet alive and active. Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson keep the movie afloat despite a story that in its broad outlines sounds like ""Waiting for Godot"" on quaaludes Woody (Dern) an old man in the middle stages of dementia becomes convinced that he has won a million dollars from something like Publishers Clearing House and he sets out on foot from his home in Montana to collect the money from the home office in Lincoln Neb. Someday when they write dissertations about Alexander Payne ""Nebraska"" will be considered a companion piece to Paynes earlier ""About Schmidt"" (2002). Both involve disappointed old men. Both involve road trips through the middle of the country. Both depict old age as a time of spiritual confusion bordering on panic and both present a long-term marriage as exhausted and of little comfort. If anything ""About Schmidt"" is the more pessimistic as in downright despairing while ""Nebraska"" suggests that hope itself might provide solace. An even fight Dern brings lots of history to this role. In his youth and middle age he was renowned for playing men either angry crazy or both. Woody is a departure only in that it places this character actor at the center of the film. Otherwise Woody is not unlike the earlier Dern reimagined as an aging hero still angry but no longer dangerous; resentful of his own weakness and hovering between reality and delusion. Because Woody can no longer drive and because this idee fixe is beyond the reach of reason his younger son David (Will Forte) decides to drive him to Nebraska. Forte is a revelation as a dramatic actor full of feeling with expressive eyes and an aura that radiates niceness. You look at him and you look at Dern and you think how awful it must have been for a sensitive boy to grow up with a taciturn hard-drinking father. But now the son is grown up and the father is diminished so its finally an even fight. Conveniently for the story we discover that Woody and his wife (June Squibb) spent most of their early married life in Nebraska and so most of the film is taken up with scenes of Woody interacting with people from his past including his formidable former business partner (Stacy Keach). ""Nebraska"" is wide enough to harmonize a range of experience from the comedy that comes of everyones believing that Woody has become a millionaire to the poignancy of his visiting the site of his unhappy childhood. June Squibb as Woodys wife is an important force in the film - sometimes comically unpleasant but someone whose drive and wit ultimately suggest the very attractive young woman that Woody married years before. Wanting to be envied Like ""About Schmidt"" ""Nebraska"" takes a dark view of old age but at least offers the possibility that resiliency and self-delusion can make the last years tolerable. What is it that Woody wants with a million dollars? What is it in this wreck of a man that makes him want to believe that hes hit a jackpot? Its not about money or the things money can buy. Its about wanting to be envied to be admired and looked at and regarded as someone special. That desire which Dern conveys with beautiful subtlety never goes away until they nail down the coffin lid. ""Nebraska"" is shot in black and white not the glossy black and white of ""Frances Ha"" but a workmanlike black and white that doesnt try to make anything pretty. There are lots of long shots that emphasize the wideness of streets the grandness of space and the contrasting smallness of the lives - of all individual lives in the big scheme. In the face of all that self-belief would hardly seem possible and yet people keep managing it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Grade A- Alexander Payne has crafted an ornery American comedy with a brusque Midwestern edge and a core of authentic feeling. It provokes wise wary laughter even as it makes you choke back tears. ""Nebraska"" follows Korean War vet lifelong alcoholic and former car mechanic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and his younger son Dave (Will Forte) as they drive from Billings Montana to Lincoln Nebraska. Battling dementia Woody is convinced that a vague bogus sweepstakes notice means hes won a million bucks. His wife Kate (June Squibb) and older son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) consider putting him in a home. For Dave Woodys quest for his supposed bonanza is a way of bringing focus to his dads final days of sanity. Dave packs him into his Subaru Outback and heads southeast to ""redeem"" Woodys ""prize."" Nothing goes the way Dave wants. Yet Woody and Dave and amazingly Kate and Ross too get exactly what they need. Woodys crackpot odyssey becomes a voyage of understanding for Dave and a slapstick communion for their family. ""Nebraska"" is about the secrets of parents lives that hide in plain sight from their children. Dave learns about the personal and military traumas that transformed his dad from a bighearted often drunk and sometimes befuddled innocent to a peculiar difficult man. Dave also gets a chance to witness the revitalizing fervor of his cantankerous mother. The films title isnt whimsical pretentious or merely a homage to Springsteens 1982 album. The movie largely unfolds in the small fictional town of Hawthorne Nebraska where Woody based his family before moving to Billings. Dave drags Woody there against his wishes after Woody falls during a night stop and gets a nasty gash on his head. Everyone except Woody thinks its best that he catch his breath at the home of his brother Ray (Rance Howard) and sister-in-law Martha (Mary Louise Wilson). The more hours they rack up in Hawthorne the more the town comes off as a black-comic limbo. (One of Woodys brothers gets his kicks sitting at the curbside and watching for cars.) Woodys insistence that hes won a million dollars rouses greed and envy from kith and kin as well as his old-time mechanic partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach).The present-day action suggests a past of curdled affections and unsolvable conflicts. By the end you know why Woody wanted to leave the state behind. The introductory scenes are earthy and exquisite. Ross has a wife and two kids and has just gotten his first stint on a Billings TV stations news anchor desk. Dave who sells home electronics at a strip mall has just said goodbye to his two-year live-in girlfriend. The tension between the successful brother and his floundering sibling is subtly excruciating. Woodys marital fights are unsubtly excruciating but they suggest tigress qualities in Kate that must have come in handy with an easy touch like Woody as a husband. The shouting that erupts between wife (""You dumb cluck"") and husband (""Cool your jets"") is colloquially note-perfect. (Later Kate defends him against others with a word that rhymes with cluck.) The movie finds its feet as an unlikely lyric farce when Dave and Woody hit the road. Paynes collaboration with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael creates a look thats lovingly exact. The portraits of lonely roads motels bars and gas stations have the subdued passion of Walker Evans photographs. The decision to shoot the film in monochrome was a masterstroke. This movie contains innumerable shades of black and white and gray. It evokes the textures of piercing memories and fading illusions. Dern and Forte are a dream team in a nightmare situation. They immediately put you on a precarious comic edge then relax you with their on-and-off rapport. Theyre completely disarming for example when they try to top each other in a gag about lost false teeth. Dern is terrific as a man whose idee fixe offers his best take on reality; the actor conveys the lingering aura of an alcoholic personality even when his character isnt drinking. He adopts a bent posture and a default scowl without pleading for audience support. Forte though carries the movie. He plays an altruistic character with ruthless self-awareness. He can tell when people consider him a disappointment or a doofus such as when his mother says he was such a beautiful baby that people would stop in the street just to look at him. Forte brings an open-ended yearning to Daves character. You see from the beginning that he has the potential to turn Woodys bleak trek into a pilgrimage. One or two New York-based critics have taken this film to task for its supposed heartlessness. Actually Payne and his screenwriter Bob Nelson are anything but. Theyre acutely observant about the unpredictable emotions that lie beneath family units as large as an extended farming clan and as small as a father and son bantering in the front seat of a car. When everyone ends up in Hawthorne what ensues is a comedy of stillness and taciturnity every bit as exhilarating as a comedy of verbal and visual pratfalls. Aunt Martha says the Grant men never spoke much and boy is she right. The movie wrings laughs from the way they grab at isolated details to ground their shared lives - as in one hilarious conversational road to nowhere about a Chevrolet Impala that turns out to have been a Buick. The movie is startlingly funny about groupings within families like a scummy pair of nephews who brag about their ability to cover vast land masses in record speeds. Their mother chalks up their sorry lives including one nephews jail time for sexual assault to the terrible economy. The filmmakers dont buy it but the evidence of recession is everywhere. When an E.R. medic learns that Woody seeks a million dollars he says that should pay for one night in a hospital. You might worry that the Grants will come off as just another one of the dysfunctional households that have overrun American independent movies. The triumph of ""Nebraska"" is that Woody Kate Ross and Dave are a unique entwined vital family. (The true horrors are Woodys frozen-in-place brothers.) Ross and Dave learn what Kate knows but doesnt state. Woody isnt merely afflicted with drink and dementia. Hes been suffering partly because he believes what people tell him - even that hes won a million dollars. You understand why Woody needs a feisty and protective wife. ""Nebraska"" is not perfect but it contains many perfect scenes. A visit to the farm where Woody grew up in a house built by his father speaks volumes about ruptured traditions that send sons off on distant paths. ""Nebraska"" wields invigorating down-home wit to open up the lives of reticent men and talkative women. Its intimate and epic - a wide-open prairie of a movie.

Comments click to enlarge Nebraska Recommended Video Rated R  114 minutes  2013 All the Oscar buzz is for Bruce Dern as a grizzled old coot sliding into dementia but the most impressive performance in this poignant black-and-white comedy comes from Will Forte as the mans long-suffering son who wearily humors his dads conviction that hes won a million dollars on one of those sweepstakes offers that come in the mail. Their road trip from Billings Montana to Lincoln Nebraska to claim the old mans prize doesnt make a lick of sense but its ideal material for Alexander Payne a director with great affection for the interstate (Sideways About Schmidt). His deft comic touch is evident here in the various red-state oddballs who turn up along the way all with designs on the old mans supposed jackpot; among the fine supporting players are Stacy Keach as the fathers menacing old crony and Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray as Fortes mouth-breathing cousins.

"Nebraska chases the American Dream down a melancholy road review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNebraska chases the American Dream down a melancholy road reviewThe American Dream finds an unusual avatar in Woody Grant the bedraggled protagonist of Alexander Paynes finely etched Nebraska.Will Forte left and Bruce Dern as father and son in Nebraska about a man pursuing his dream to claim a sweepstakes prize.  (Merie W. Wallace / Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 21 2013NebraskaStarring Bruce Dern Will Forte June Squibb Bob Odenkirk and Stacy Keach. Directed by Alexander Payne. Opens Nov. 22. See Star listings for theatres and show times. 115 minutes. PGThe American Dream finds an unusual avatar in Woody Grant the bedraggled protagonist of Alexander Paynes finely etched Nebraska.Played by a resurgent Bruce Dern who took Best Actor at Cannes and now courts Oscar attention Woody truly believes that his country is the land of boundless opportunity. Article Continued BelowSo when a form letter comes through the mail slot telling him that he Woodrow T. Grant of Billings Montana has just won 1 million he doesnt roll his eyes at the obvious scam the way most people would. The retired codger figures he deserves this windfall. Didnt he fight for freedom in the Korean War? Didnt he faithfully pay his taxes? Didnt he and his obstreperous wife Kate (June Squibb) raise two sons?Not thinking too clearly beyond this -- drinking and senility have taken a toll -- Woody opts to walk the more than 1400 kilometres from Billings to Lincoln Nebraska where the prize office is for his imagined pot of gold. Its along a frigid and forlorn road at the Billings city limits where we first meet him as his thirtysomething son David (Will Forte) tries to talk sense into him. When David reasons that the 1-million pitch is one of the oldest of cons just a ruse to sell magazines Woody cuts him off ""They cant say it if its not true.""David decides to drive his gruff and distant dad to Lincoln to prove to him that the money isnt for real. Its not like David is doing all that much anyway. His girlfriend has just left him and he has a dead-end job in a stereo shop. And as he tells his dubious brother Ross who argues that Woody should just be put into a home ""The guy doesnt need a nursing home. He just needs something to live for.""Woodys stubborn optimism and the droll and sad things that arise from his dogged dream quest might ordinarily not have taken Nebraska much further than those same city limits. Couldnt people just take a quick gander at Woodys form letter as few bother to do to realize hes been conned?American auteur Payne (Election Sideways The Descendants) and rookie screenwriter Bob Nelson arent really concerned with the destination just the journey. Neither of them strain to make Nebraska funny although it often is.They pack the film with grace notes (check out the framed Grateful Dead poster in Davids messy living room) and rich character studies that make it easy to overlook script contrivances.Some of the characters are a bit much. A matched set of obnoxious cousins who are amongst the curious Grant family relations when Woody and David make a side trip to their old hometown of Hawthorne Neb. seem drawn more from the funny pages than from flesh and blood. Fortes David acts as if timidity were a virtue full stop. And Squibbs Kate while frequently amusing with her scathing commentary starts to grate like a rusty weather vane.But the same stopover introduces us to the believable likes of Peg (Angela McEwan) editor of the weekly Hawthorne Republican and an old flame of Woodys who reveals the mans gentler side ""People took advantage of him. He just couldnt turn down a favour.""The people who fleeced Woody include bumptious Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) who isnt done with the old man yet. He cracks a sharks grin when word gets out that Woodys in for a big payday.Nebraska is shot in black-and-white and in deep focus (Phedon Papamichaels cinematography is immaculate) and its evident that Payne wants us to look not just at the characters but at their surroundings. Theyre travelling through a big and open land that seems drained of not just colour but also opportunity and optimism. The prevailing mood is a sense of resignation that things arent going to get better anytime soon the only person thinking otherwise being a crazy oil coot who just wants to buy a new truck and an air compressor. The films insistent fiddle score by Mark Orton seems more for a eulogy than a celebration.Payne has never before been this melancholy or this sincere. Nebraska looks into Americas soul and finds a troubling emptiness.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Woody Grant the broken-down traveler of Alexander Paynes Nebraska could have sprung to life from those very tales if only Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson hadnt made their film so quietly funny.Perfectly played by 77-year-old Bruce Dern Woody has lived a hard life and it was especially hard on those around him. His adult sons David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) have mostly forgiven him the wounds inflicted by alcoholism. His thick-skinned wife (the wonderful June Squibb) has survived by shooting straight and when the occasion allows working blue. Woody an ornery old cuss isnt long for this world; he can barely hear and has trouble staying awake.But he still has to borrow the title of a Springsteen Nebraska song a reason to believe One of those bogus million-dollar sweepstakes letters has arrived in the mail and Woody with little else to do decides he needs to leave his home in Billings Mont. and pick up his cash in Lincoln. David in the midst of his losing streak indulges the old man and takes the wheel.Shot in starkly gorgeous black and white Nebraska like all of Paynes movies contains multitudes of meaning beneath its unflashy surface. David and Woody stop off in Woodys little hometown of Hawthorne (pop. 1358) and as the vultures and bullies encroach on Woodys false fortune we realize they all need something to latch on to some tangible sign of hope however illusory. Thankfully this doesnt keep Squibb from laying down the law in profane defense of the man she still loves. (Shes a shoo-in for a supporting-actress nomination.)Payne is a native son of Omaha and he gracefully strolls the line between laughing at his characters and crying for them. In Hawthorne he uses the whole frame to capture the ghostly spaces of a downtown left behind the blinkered hope of a blinking tavern sign in the night. A color Nebraska is as hard to imagine as a color Last Picture Show. The movie plays like a particularly existential Preston Sturges farce with the same attention to character and bemused appreciation of human folly.Among the predators looking for a piece of Woodys nonexistent pie is a burly baritone Stacy Keach who plays Woodys old business partner; squint a little and he could be a low-stakes John Huston. Forte is also fine as the hangdog David who slowly realizes his dad was once a pretty miserable kid. But all the players orbit around Derns fading sun.When Woody snaps to at some old memory or slight Derns eyes fill with the panic of a confused kid busted doing something shameful. Dern was always an underrated asset as a wild-man character actor; here he digs deep within for what hopefully wont be his final victory lap.Nebraska is the work of a great director hitting his stride. Payne has amassed filmmaking capital as a two-time screenplay Oscar winner. Hes chosen to use it by making a robust and morally complex black-and-white comedy about mortality and regret.

Photo Credit Paramount Vantage advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An aging man becomes convinced that he is a millionaire. Rated R (language) BOTTOM LINE This wry raunchy tender comedy rides almost entirely on Dern whose funny-sad performance could well translate into his first-ever Oscar. CAST Bruce Dern Will Forte June Squibb LENGTH 145 To fully appreciate Alexander Paynes new comedy-drama ""Nebraska"" it helps to know something about its 77-year-old star Bruce Dern. He plays Woody Grant an aging alcoholic whose mind is slipping. A letter from Mega Sweepstakes Marketing in Lincoln Neb. has informed him of a million-dollar prize and Woody is determined to walk there -- from Billings Mont. -- to collect. His reasoning ""They wouldnt say it if it wasnt true."" This sad funny exasperating old man could well translate into Derns first-ever Oscar. (Dern already won best actor at Cannes and has since been on a press campaign that might tucker out an actor half his age.) Whats more the role of Woody is an anomaly for this lanky jittery actor known largely for playing psychos and killers like the one who shot John Wayne in the back in 1972s ""The Cowboys."" Even Derns Oscar nomination for 1978s ""Coming Home"" was for playing an unhinged Vietnam veteran. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? As Woody he looks heartbreakingly helpless a gray-muzzled stray cared for by his frustrated but loving son David (Will Forte quite serviceable despite ""MacGruber""). Its David who decides to drive Woody to Nebraska in the hopes of doing some father-son bonding. Fat chance Woody is a Midwestern man of few words and squashed emotions. Davids questions about prehistory (""Why did you marry mom?"") are mostly met with unilluminating answers (""She wanted to""). Though written by Bob Nelson ""Nebraska"" is classic Payne (""About Schmidt"" ""Sideways"") and not just because the Omaha-born director once again casts nonprofessional locals in several small roles. ""Nebraska"" bears Paynes trademark combination of low-key humor poignancy and an overall feeling of Beckett-esque resignation. Moments of raunchy humor come from the wonderful June Squibb as Woodys foul-mouthed wife while Stacy Keach adds shades of genuine darkness as Woodys grasping bullying friend. ""Nebraska"" can feel slightly thin much as Paynes ""The Descendants"" did The mood tends to speak louder than the story. Dern however says almost nothing and somehow speaks loudest of all. 204 MoviesNebraska trailer PLOT An aging man becomes convinced that he is a millionaire. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (language) CAST Bruce Dern Will Forte June Squibb LENGTH 145 BOTTOM LINE This wry raunchy tender comedy rides almost entirely on Dern whose funny-sad performance could well translate into his first-ever Oscar. 142 MoviesHoliday movie trailers Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Nebraska Movie Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Plains-spoken in Nebraska Alexander Paynes Nebraska showcases a cast led by Bruce Dern June SquibbNovember 21 2013|Michael PhillipsScene from the film ""Nebraska."" (Paramount Vantage)The small and medium towns in the Midwest and the Great Plains region arent so different from any other part -- rural urban or in between -- of the United States. Half the people dont talk much while the other half chatter to fill the silence. Its a time-honored cliche according to Garrison Keillor but theres truth in it.And there truly are a million or more men in this country like Woody Grant the tight-lipped subject of Alexander Paynes latest film ""Nebraska.""Throughout Bob Nelsons tidy well-ordered screenplay Woodys wife his sons his distant relations and his old dubious friends from back home drop little bits of biographical detail regarding the addled irritable melancholy soul at the movies center. We learn hes a lifelong alcoholic; a Korean war veteran who saw too much carnage; and he wasnt much of a father. He may also have early-onset dementia.And now having received a magazine subscription flier in the mail with his name on it he believes himself to be the lucky winner of a million-dollar sweepstakes and he is determined to travel from his home in Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. to collect the grand prize.This is a road trip story. Woody given to wandering off on his own finds a traveling companion in his younger son David who sells electronics in Billings and whose recent breakup has left him in a state of stasis. Why not David figures. Why not give the old man a ride and indulge his fantasy? Eventually Woodys wife Kate whose first sentence on screen is a forthright ""You dumb cluck"" and his ""go-getter"" Billings TV anchor son meet up with the men for an uneasy reunion in Hawthorne Neb. where Woody and Kate grew up and met.""Nebraska"" is less a movie than a feature-length equivalent of a wry comic ballad observing some ordinary lives. A lot of Paynes film his sixth feature is funny in that gently sardonic way distinguishing his best work. (I like ""Election"" ""Sideways"" and ""The Descendants"" best so far.) Some of ""Nebraska"" feels thin and slightly misjudged -- the broadly comic stuff with the idiot cousins for example. The script a tiny bit meager digs only so far underneath anyones skin. But Payne shooting in widescreen black and white with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael elevates the material with images simply composed of serious and paradoxically ordinary beauty. This is a movie that treats the lonely street outside a dingy small-town tavern with the same care as Payne shows his actors beginning and ending with Bruce Dern.Dern won the best actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year for his portrayal -- childlike and frightened one second flinty and amusingly crusty the next -- of a man who never amounted to much on paper. So much of direction is a matter of politely beating the acting out of an actor and encouraging easy-breathing in-character behavior instead. Dern here does the least overt and most affecting work of his screen career a career pockmarked with one too many bug-eyed psychos and head cases. His comic timing remains shrewdly unpredictable. Will Forte plays David a sad sack eager to find out whos in there behind his fathers glazed eyes. Over beers one night David broaches the subject of his parents marriage.""You mustve been in love"" David says hoping for a ""yes"" regarding his parents courtship. A quick puzzled pause and Dern answers ""Never came up.""Dern and Forte are both effective but my favorite performances in ""Nebraska"" belong to the women. As Kate June Squibb who played Jack Nicholsons wife in Paynes ""About Schmidt"" feels authentic and true in every instance. And in the small role of the Hawthorne newspaper owner and editor who knew Woody when luminous Angela McEwan works wonders in between the lines. Payne knows gold when he sees it The close-up of McEwan near the end speaks volumes and evokes many things wordlessly.Much of ""Nebraska"" is ordinary prose but the best parts are plain-spoken comic poetry including the priceless tableau of a living room full of stoic men drinking beer watching a football game. Woody fits right in. Rance Howard (director Rons father) plays Woodys brother and the way he performs in this sequence staring at the off-screen TV its as if hed been sitting in that living room his entire life holding the same beer waiting for someone to show up with a camera and mutter ""Action.""""Nebraska""- 3 starsmjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for some language)Running time 150Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBruce Derns long run to NebraskaNovember 11 2013Alexander Payne Aiming At The Judges WillOctober 8 2013Black and white and Blue catch the attentionMay 24 2013Nebraska Widens Oscar Buzz After Weekend ScreeningsSeptember 30 2013Reese Witherspoon honored at Gene Siskel Film Center galaJune 25 2012Find More Stories AboutNebraskaAlexander PayneBruce DernTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-nebraska-1122-20131121,0,7806760.column",200,nebraska18,nebraska,chicagotribune
"Nebraska 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Nebraska 4 stars Bruce Dern (left) and Will Forte in a scene from the film ""Nebraska."" Paramount Pictures. SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Nebraska"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 21 2013 836 AM Lets describe Alexander Paynes ""Nebraska"" in brief a film shot in black-and-white about a mean old coot who cant see reality when it smacks him in the face bound and determined to follow his own path no matter how miserable he makes everyone around him. What a terrific movie. OK maybe it doesnt sound like it and theres probably no way to describe or critique it in a way that will convince you otherwise. Then just trust this see it. Youll be treated to some laugh-out-loud humor a lot of heart and some outstanding performances. First among them is Bruce Dern as Woody a cantankerous alcoholic who has received one of those ""You may have won a million dollars"" come-ons in the mail and takes it at its word. But he doesnt trust the mail and he doesnt drive anymore so he is going to walk from his home in Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. to claim his winnings. And that is all there is to it. His wife Kate (June Squibb) calls him a ""dumb cluck"" for making the trip (about as nice a thing as she says about him or anyone else). His oldest son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) a fill-in local-news anchor thinks hes as daffy as Kate does. So too does younger son David (Will Forte). But his love life and his stereo-sales job pretty much define ""stagnant"" so David decides in a what-the-hell manner that hell pile his old man into his Subaru and drive him to Lincoln himself. Thus begins a road trip that in lesser hands would lead to a father-son bonding exercise. Thats not what Payne or screenwriter Bob Nelson have in mind. Whatever delights this film contains and it contains many are hard won set off by the bleakly beautiful landscape of the bitterly cold Midwest practically every rugged mountain or barren field displayed in Woodys craggy face. As happens in trips like this in movies Woody and David encounter some obstacles that necessitate a few detours. The main one here is to the small town in Nebraska where Woody and Kate grew up and married and where most of Woodys family still lives. Seemingly every economic problem of the past few years has been visited upon the place. Yet that picture pales in comparison to the sight of Woodys family sitting around the television beers in their hands blank stares on their faces. Woodys nephews Davids cousins are swollen good ol boys whose dim-bulb demeanors will be recognizable to anyone who grew up in a small town. They are funny but in a pathetic sort of way. That describes the place in general where we learn more about Woody and perhaps get a few hints into his taciturn nature. When word spreads of Woodys ""winnings"" the old man lightens up a bit obviously enjoying a little good fortune however false. Yet small-town bitterness bubbles up personified by Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) who used to own a car shop with Woody. Gradually the congratulatory atmosphere turns more mercenary. Dern who won the best actor prize at Cannes is great; this is probably the best performance in an underrated career. Yet Forte is too in a lower-key role. We sense his confusion his frustration and his pain in doing whatever he can to get to know a father who is willfully unknowable. For his part Payne has a reputation of sometimes making fun of the Midwesterners he grew up among (he is a Nebraska native). But those familiar with the soap-opera nature of small towns will recognize a sort of tough love at work here. ""Nebraska"" is as cold and unforgiving as its setting yet just as stunning.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 15 2013 Save for later Saved Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and his son Dave (Will Forte) bicker and bond on the road in Nebraska. Menemsha Films          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Shot in pearly wide-screen black and white Alexander Paynes ""Nebraska"" strikes a retro melancholic note from the first frame. We first see an old man Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) sauntering purposefully but none too steadily down a highway on the outskirts of Billings Mont. No longer permitted to drive he is hiking his way to Lincoln Neb. to claim what he believes are his million-dollar winnings from a mail-order sweepstakes.His son Dave (Will Forte) a stereo salesman whose girlfriend has just walked out on him is exasperated with the old man but unlike Woodys harridan wife Kate (June Squibb) hes also sympathetic. After days of telling Woody that the sweepstakes are a scam he ends up driving him to Lincoln if for no other reason than to shut him up. En route they stop in Hawthorne Neb. where Woody grew up and meet with many of his old friends and foes and family. The old homestead now abandoned is revisited. When word gets out that Woody has ""won"" a million dollars he is treated by all but the most skeptical townspeople as a returning hero.Payne has always been big on road-trip movies - ""Sideways"" is the best of them - and ""Nebraska"" which was written by fellow Nebraskan Bob Nelson is the latest in the line. Its also a father-son bondathon and a wistful cockeyed tribute to a rural homespun sensibility that for present-day urbanites at least can seem as emotionally remote as science fiction. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Payne shows a great deal of affection for these ornery not always so soft-spoken Midwesterners but he also demonstrates a fair amount of disaffection too. In his earlier movies especially ""Citizen Ruth"" and to a lesser extent ""About Schmidt"" I thought he sometimes made fun of his characters at the expense of their humanity. The ridicule was perhaps his way of separating himself from them as if to demonstrate that though he shared their background he was no rube.His recent movies have shucked off that attitude but its partially back here When Woody walks into the home of his Hawthorne relatives we might be staring into a zoo. His Tweedledee/Tweedledum nephews in particular are caricatured in the broadest of ways as stunted burbly moochers. Payne is too fine an artist to be settling for potshots. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The grizzled Woody his long white hair as messy as every other part of his life is played by Bruce Dern without any sops to the audience. Its a flinty uncompromising performance but at times I wish Dern had compromised just a little. Woody never really deepens as a character; he just plays out the same grumpy-angry routine. Most of what we learn about him at least biographically comes from others especially Ed (Stacy Keach) an old Hawthorne nemesis and former business partner and Kate who reenters the film halfway through the journey and enlivens the dawdliness.Dave who just wants his father to play out his sweepstakes fantasy before it disintegrates is essentially Woodys foil. We never learn a whole lot about him either. Paynes reluctance to go deep with these characters may have something to do with his desire to maintain an even folksy tone - a kind of heightened drabness.Even the handsome black-and-white cinematography has its drear side. It evokes not only the setting but inevitably old movies about the passing of an era (like ""The Last Picture Show""). But this old-movie swoon doesnt arise naturally from the story.Its a filmmakers conceit. These filmmakers may come from Nebraska but from the looks of things they dont want to be spending much time there. Grade B (Rated R for some language.)

Nebraska By Peter Travers November 15 2013 More News Nebraska Is a Gentle and Funny Film Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Have you ever thought of Nebraska as Oz? Woody Grant played by an understated unforgettable Bruce Dern sure as hell has. Old Woody got one of those magazine scams in the mail claiming hes bagged a million bucks. ""It says I won"" growls Woody with an unshakable faith in what he sees in print. All he needs to do is leave his home in Billings Montana and head off to the prize office in Lincoln Nebraska. More News Nebraska Is a Gentle and Funny Film Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> From that outline director Alexander Payne and first-time screenwriter Bob Nelson sculpt a story of the American character on the lost frontiers of trust and shame. Nebraska aims to investigate how those qualities went missing. And not just in the Midwest. Of the Omaha-born Paynes six films four (Citizen Ruth Election About Schmidt Nebraska) were shot in his home state. But two that werent Sideways and The Descendants also use small details to reach a larger truth. Is Nebraska a comedy or a drama? Like life its both. Payne takes his time. Deal with it. This is a movie to bring home and live with to kick around in your head after it hits you in the heart. Its damn near perfect starting with the acting. Dern 77 has specialized in instability and menace. He killed John Wayne in The Cowboys stuck it to Robert Redford in The Great Gatsby terrorized the Super Bowl in Black Sunday and got an Oscar nomination for playing a traumatized Vietnam vet in Coming Home. But Derns laser focus is nowhere to be seen in Nebraska. Woodys eyes are blurred from drinking his spirit sapped by broken dreams. His wife Kate (the priceless June Squibb) calls him a damn fool for chasing a bogus jackpot. Squibb should have an Oscar in her reach; shes that bruisingly funny and true. But sorrow seeps in. Woodys TV newsman son Ross (Breaking Bads Bob Odenkirk) wants to put the old man in a home. Its son David (Will Forte) a stereo salesman who joins daddy Don Quixote on his quest for a slice of dignity and maybe a new truck. And so begins Woodys road odyssey shot by the gifted Phedon Papamichael in glorious widescreen black and white and scored by Mark Orton with a fiddlers ear for the sharp and the tender. Along the way Woody meets up with greedy relatives (Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray) the girl that got away (Angela McEwan) and an old enemy (Stacy Keach). But mostly father and son learn about each other. Forte of SNL and MacGruber is revelatory nailing every nuance in a complex role. And just try to take your eyes off Dern. In his finest two hours onscreen he gives a performance worth cheering. Theres not an ounce of bullshit in it. Same goes for the movie.

They feature pointless arguments small-minded attacks and lovingly nursed grudges. But theyre really about something else. Theyre about our attempts to be better than that. Paynes heroes arent always successful and theyre sure to make a mess of things along the way. But theyre trying and that not only makes them painfully human but sometimes heroic. His new ""Nebraska"" begins like a companion piece to David Lynchs ""The Straight Story"" Old codger Woody Grant thinks he just won a million dollars in some junk-mail subscription sweepstakes. So hes going to Nebraska to claim his prize. Hes lost his drivers license? His wife wont take him? No problem. Hell walk -- all the way from Wyoming. His too-forgiving son takes pity on him however and the roadtrip begins. But -- like the voyages in ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"" -- where it leads is somewhere unexpected and Woodys boy likes us begins to see the man behind the parent. For example at first it seems were expected to take Woody as just a cantankerous (and slightly senile) old coot. But eventually we begin see a sadness there the culmination of decades of diminished dreams. (What were they? Saddest of all Woody cant remember.) The people around him have different sides too. Like his old business partner a backslapping buddy with a nasty edge. Or Woodys wife Kate who may seem as wholesome as a Jell-O mold but actually has her own dirty past and a cheerful taste for nasty gossip. The script is by Bob Nelson but the story feels very much part of Paynes world and not just because the director grew up in Omaha. It has his appreciation for character quirkiness and small victories. It has his love of actors -- particularly supporting ones. Yes Payne had Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" and George Clooney in ""The Descendants"" -- but you cant help but feel his sympathies are with the Paul Giamattis of this world (who thrilled in ""Sideways"") And ""Nebraska"" has a breakout performance by June Squibb as the raunchy Kate and a thrilling one by Dern as Woody. Dern has been a busy character actor for more than 50 years but hes rarely gotten leads -- and never has he played someone so withheld so interior so still. Its a sad lovely haunted performance (nicely set off by Will Forte who plays Woodys much-maligned son and is perhaps the real hero of the piece). And although Payne has never been a flashy director -- hes one of the few modern filmmakers who regularly publicly puts script and performance first -- there are so many lovely visual moments in this film shot in wide-screen black-and-white.

Like the longshot of a prairie cemetery a graveyard of limited lives mocked by a limitless horizon. Or the interiors at an abandoned home where every broken window like a sightless eye gazes out onto nothingness. Theres a spare and deep-focused honesty to Paynes plains. Because that simple clarity means theres no place to hide no comforting shadows to help obscure the truth. Like those other Midwestern exiles the Coen brothers Payne is often criticized (oddly by East Coast critics) of treating his former farm-state neighbors with contemptuous superiority. It is nice albeit uncharacteristic for the New York elite to stand up for traditional Middle America but I think theyre missing the point. Payne like the Coens may seem hip and flip and sardonic but at his heart he like his birthplace is deeply traditional. He has no patience for people with grand ideas about themselves or their place in the world. He is a big fan of fairness forgiveness and generosity. And what he loves most of all is someone who is flawed and selfish and petty. And yet trying to do better. Ratings note The film contains strong language brief violence and alcohol abuse.

Photo Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Nebraska Twisted roots. Running time 114 minutes. Rated R (profanity). At the Lincoln Square and the Angelika. Bruce Dern and Will Forte take a black-and-white road trip from Montana to ""Nebraska director Alexander Paynes latest acutely acted and occasionally hilarious seriocomic look at his Midwestern roots. A magnificent Dern plays Woody an ornery alcoholic whose dementia has reached the point where he actually believes hes won 1 million in a magazine sweepstakes contest. When Woody insists on picking up his ""winnings in person his long-suffering son David (a surprisingly effective Forte) agrees to take the old man on the 850-mile trip to Omaha hoping to bond at last with his distant parent. Along the way they stop in Dads small blighted hometown in Nebraska to visit his siblings and their families -- who quickly try to cut themselves in for a portion of Woodys windfall to cover his past debts no matter how much David insists that the money doesnt actually exist. Woodys sharp-tongued wife (the wonderful June Squibb) and his older son (Bob Odenkirk) turn up in town for a wildly dysfunctional family reunion. Also demanding money is Woodys former partner in a local garage (the great Stacy Keach). Bob Nelsons original script a sort of unlikely cross between ""The Last Picture Show and ""The Miracle of Morgans Creek offers a biting satire of Midwestern life that Payne sometimes allows to border on condescension. Whats missing is enough of the sympathy for his characters that made Paynes ""The Descendants and ""Sideways so much more enjoyable. There are certainly things to appreciate in the new film including cinematography that vividly captures a small town that time and prosperity have apparently forgotten. ""Nebraska has enough good lines scenes and performances to make it worth your while as well as a sufficiently upbeat ending to qualify it as holiday entertainment. But I dont want to oversell an emotionally bleak film thats been overhyped since it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival.

But to the septuagenarian Woody a former auto mechanic and lifelong alcoholic whose dementia is beginning to interfere with his everyday functioning Nebraska also represents a kind of oasis on the plains a place of impossible fulfillment Its there he believes that he will collect on the sweepstakes ticket that makes him a millionaire. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The sweepstakes unsurprisingly is the most transparent of scams the kind of mass-mailed magazine promotion that Ed McMahon would have lent his auto-signature to back in the day. But Woodys delusional belief in his own stroke of fortune is such that his plain-spoken wife Kate (the very funny June Squibb) cant keep him from setting out--on foot--to make the 850-mile journey to pick up his reward in Lincoln. Unable to control the wandering of her increasingly senile husband Kate calls their younger son at all hours to drive around in search of him. Davids older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) a local TV anchor with a wife and kids is too busy to check in as often with his parents but David a struggling stereo equipment salesman whose girlfriend has just left him has plenty of time on his hands. Eventually sick of cruising the streets of Billings searching for his bitter and monosyllabic father (who as Ross points out was never a decent parent to begin with) David agrees to drive Woody to Lincoln by the sweepstakes deadline. His motivations seem to lie somewhere between the filial--its an opportunity to get some quality time with his ever more checked-out dad--and the vengeful Its a chance to prove to the selfish old coot that he didnt win jack. If you think that sounds like the setup for a heartwarming intergenerational road movie you must not know Alexander Payne very well. Filmed in stark un-nostalgic black and white in the cold of a Great Plains autumn Nebraska (which was written by Bob Nelson) isnt without heart--its far less emotionally chilly for example than the work of Paynes fellow Midwestern satirists the Coen brothers--but it takes time and patience to get to this movies (marginally) gooey center. Advertisement Derns Woody isnt glamorously wicked enough to be called an antihero. Hes an even harder character type to like an angry self-pitying slightly pathetic drunk who rebuffs his sons attempts at bonding with either cranky putdowns or dismissive grunts. But as played by the 77-year-old Bruce Dern (in a near-mute but magnificent performance that like the movie unfolds its layers slowly) Woody is so unpredictable complicated fragile and real--so human--that we cant help but care about him even at the moments when we dislike him intensely. That emotional dissonance seems fitting in a movie about trying to love the family you have not the one you would have wanted. Derns quiet deeply internal performance requires a sensitive co-star to bounce off of and Forte--whom you may remember with a stalk of celery up his butt in the goofy SNL-spinoff comedy MacGruber--turns David into far more than just a beleaguered eye-rolling straight man. You see how his anger at his father is bound up with his determination to somehow find a way in to the old mans remote inaccessible heart. Ive always admired Paynes commitment to both seriousness and laughter to showing the beauty of ordinary human life side by side with its petty venal absurdity. Barely speaking father and son make their way across Wyoming and South Dakota with a side trip to Mount Rushmore. (""A bunch of rocks"" shrugs an unimpressed Woody.) Their road trip unrolls in a leisurely fashion--lots of shots of gas stations snowy plains and grazing bison--but with stunning black-and-white cinematography by Phedon Papamichael and a wistful fiddle score by Mark Orton its contemplative pace feels just right. Eventually David and Woody make it to the small town of Hawthorne Neb. where Woody grew up. There they stop to spend the weekend at the house of one of his many equally taciturn brothers. (A shot of the Grant siblings watching TV looks like the male half of the American Gothic couple reproduced in quintuplicate). Making the rounds of the taverns on Hawthornes main street--can you say ""rounds"" if there are only two?--Woody cant resist boasting about his sweepstakes win and soon the whole town including his former business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) believes that their seventysomething local boy has made good. The harder David (and his mother and brother who have joined them in Hawthorne for an impromptu family reunion) try to set the record straight the more convinced Pegram and the extended Grant family become that Woody is a millionaire and that having helped his sorry ass out in the past they deserve a piece of the action. The last third of the movie brings in a farcical element that Payne fans will recognize from his earlier films. (Remember Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Churchs slapstick mission to rescue a lost wedding ring in Sideways?) The increasingly importunate relatives spearheaded by Davids hulking dim-bulb cousins (Devin Ratray and Tim Driscoll) step up the pressure on Woody to fork over some of his nonexistent dough even as Pegram rapidly escalates from congratulating his ex-partner to openly threatening him. Woody Kate and their sons go to a cemetery to pay less-than-respectful tribute to some deceased ancestors. ""I liked Rose but she was a whore"" insists Kate before lifting her skirt over the grave of an old beau ""See what you couldve had Keith if you hadnt talked about wheat all the time?"" And in the movies best comic set piece the Grant boys (wonderfully played by Odenkirk and Forte who really seem like brothers) try to steal back an air compressor that their father lent Pegram 40 years ago and never got back. I wont reveal whether David and his dad ever make it to Lincoln except to say that the final scene which takes place on the by-now-familiar main street of Hawthorne leaves the viewer both feeling both bottomlessly sad and oddly buoyant. There are viewers who will find the folksy humor of Nebraskas comic scenes too broad and others who will condemn Paynes portrayal of Midwesterners as caricatured and condescending. I am not among those viewers Ive always admired this directors commitment to both seriousness and laughter to showing the beauty and significance of ordinary human life side by side with its petty venal absurdity. Nebraskas unsentimental but ultimately loving vision of small-town America seems closer than ever to Preston Sturges--a director to whom Payne is often compared and whose great satire Hail the Conquering Hero (about a hapless soldier whos mistaken for a war hero without ever having fought a day in his life) seems like a clear influence here. But a long nearly silent scene in which Woody and his family visit the empty hulk of the house where he grew up or another in which his high school sweetheart (Angela McEwan) catches a glimpse of her old beau for the first time in 40 years aim for something very different from Sturges-style satire. Theres something almost Lear-like about Woody in those late scenes surveying the void of his past with eyes that have seen too much. Hes halfway gone from the world already en route to his own private Nebraska. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Nebraska is where the director is from. That bit of information (as detailed in Margaret Talbots Profile of Payne in the magazine) isnt crucial to an appreciation of Paynes haunting virtual archeology of long-sedimented family stories but it suggests why the movie conveys such a lived-in intimacy by means of its locations and its moods. The black-and-white widescreen images of big sky rolling land and open air that surround the aged and dishevelled Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) as he shuffles along a highway near his home in Billings Montana begin the movie with a calm and confident embrace of the way the place looks and feels--even as the classical cinematic format lends them a detached mythic grandeur. From the start Payne presents a landscape that both thrums with life and is filled with the past--a past that in the course of the movie he pushes to the surface in the poignant person of Woody whose memory is going and yet who is the living agent of memory. Its a familiar mode for the director--its the basis of his most perfect work to date his short film for the compilation ""Paris Je Taime"" in which he excavates layers of hidden import from the grating clash of the sharp and painterly images with the shambling seemingly oblivious presence and voice of his protagonist. ""Nebraska"" captures the same sort of dislocation on a grander scale overlaying it with relocation--a series of mild or intense shocks arising from Woodys return to his long-abandoned home town in Nebraska in the company of his son David (Will Forte) for whom the territory is unfamiliar and the family history unknown and even repressed. What gets Woody and David on the road is the elderly mans addled insistence that a sweepstakes promotion hes received in the mail is actually a million-dollar-winning ticket that he needs to redeem in Lincoln Nebraska. Woody is a slow-moving hunched-over alcoholic who seems to carry years of disappointment and frustration on his back--along with the justified reproaches that his wife Kate (June Squibb) adds to the pile. Kate is tart-tongued active and smart and she bears most of the practical burden of caring for her increasingly confused and dependent husband. David for his part is a bright guy stuck in a dead-end job whose marriage has come apart and who lives in a furnished studio or motel room while sorting things out. When he takes his father on the road trip to see about the sweepstakes ticket its not just to humor Woody or to dispel once and for all his delusion but to get away--not on a trip of escape and liberation but paradoxically of responsibility and duty even of resignation. Theres a febrile artifice to Paynes setup and a tinge of theatrical exaggeration in the performances (including those of Dern and Forte) that contrast somewhat gratingly with the silky painterly widescreen black-and-white images--and that very abrasion is the stuff of the movie. In effect the contact with the rugged new environments (and that ruggedness is as much physical as it is emotional) does two things at once it scrapes beneath the surfaces of those places to yield unanticipated and revealing layers of personal and family history and it scrapes the paint off the personae and breaks through their social roles and set behavior to an unsought and uneasy vulnerability. The heart of the story is the arrival of Woody and David in the (fictitious) town of Hawthorne Nebraska where it turns out Woody was born and where as a young man he had built a house--with his own hands--that now lies in ruins. Its also where his brothers and their families live; and those families seem even less well-off than do Woody and Kate. Theyre not necessarily poorer but they seem by comparison stultified (even down to the crude and criminal behavior of Davids bullet-headed cousins). They simply havent gone far in the literal sense--they live and seem likely to die where they were born whereas Woody and Kate are distinguished by the simple fact that when they met with trouble they picked up and started over again elsewhere. Their moxie may have helped to make their sons David and Ross a TV newsman (played by Bob Odenkirk) a little different and may have given them a little more energy and mental spark but it doesnt spare them from the agonies of their own old age and it doesnt make their bright and striving sons any happier. Thats why theres (almost) nothing satirical about Paynes wry and sarcastic comic views of the Grant family both nuclear and extended--his jibes are distributed all around with equally sharp pokes if not quite with equal tenderness (he reserves a particular place in comic hell for the craven and the unsentimental). En route to Hawthorne Woodys long-stifled resentments begin to bubble to the surface--at first slowly in a drolly trivial form and then once there with greater intensity and import. It turns out however that in the eyes of his former neighbors and even of his brothers Woody was no angel and his arrival similarly dredges up their smothered pains. The loveliest most poignant scene in the film takes place in the sleepy office of the towns newspaper where David goes in quest of information and chats with the elderly editor (Angela McEwan) who it turns out has history with the family. Its the scene that quietly wrenches the movie apart and makes the distant unspoken past vibrate with a revived passionate power. Its a scene that Payne doubles with another of Kates own long-silenced reminiscences; the two womens performances--McEwans tremulously discursive and Squibbs brashly so--are the true heart of the movie. Payne wraps things up with a moment of cheerful satisfaction that packs bitter ironies. David and Woody dont return home better equipped to face their troubles; Woody is still in decline and Davids job and solitude await him in Billings. The knowledge that David brings back and the experiences that hes had in Hawthorne wont be of much help to him. Rather the knowledge is life itself; the movie is the story of a life deepening and filling out as if in real time--but that deepening life doesnt improve in any practical sense. Nothing changes; and yet at the end of the movie nothing seems the same. More Movies Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter the best of The New Yorker every day.

"Review Nebraska offers a rich reward along its journey - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Nebraska offers a rich reward along its journey Review Nebraska Kenneth Turan reviews Nebraska starring Bruce Dern Will Forte Bob Odenkirk and Stacy Keach. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Nebraska starring Bruce Dern Will Forte Bob Odenkirk and Stacy Keach. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its the letter everyones received. The one that gets your attention by saying youve won a million dollars but is actually all about selling magazine subscriptions. But what if someone truly believed theyd won that million? And what if that individual was your crabby cranky and cantankerous father and he insisted on going to prize headquarters to collect his money? In person.That in a nutshell is the premise of Alexander Paynes poignant and ruefully funny ""Nebraska."" But summations cant convey the filmmaking delicacy that marries tart-tongued comedy with unexpected warmth in a story that touches on family memory getting old and staying alive. Plus allowing 77-year-old Bruce Dern the opportunity to give the performance of a lifetime. ""Nebraska"" marks a homecoming of sorts for Omaha native Payne who set his first three films in the state before turning to California (""Sideways"") and Hawaii (""The Descendants""). The films interest in road trips and obsessive personalities is also familiar but ""Nebraska"" offers something deeper and more mature the ability to make us care about its characters and their story on a different level than Payne has given us before.VIDEO Nebraskas cast and crew discuss the film A two-time Oscar winner for adapted screenplay Payne has turned for the first time to a script he does not have a writing credit on an original by Bob Nelson who began his career as a comedy writer before turning his attention to Woodrow T. Grant Woody to his friends a man on a mission.Elegantly shot in the wonderful but too rarely used black and white Cinemascope format by Payne regular Phedon Papamichael ""Nebraska"" opens not in its namesake state but in Billings Mont. with a shot of Woody (Dern) at his Woodiest.Uncertain on his feet but nothing if not determined Woody lurches unsteadily toward us oblivious enough on a busy highway to attract police attention. His hair is disheveled hes in need of a shave and his clothes (carefully weathered by being put through a cement mixer and soaked with lemon juice by the costume department) have seen better days. As has Woody. But where is he going?Woodys son David (""Saturday Night Live"" veteran Will Forte hitting all the right notes in a straight dramatic role) finds the answer at the police station when the old man produces his form letter from Mega Sweepstakes Marketing and insists (""They cant say it if its not so"") hes won a fortune. No he wont take the form to the post office (""Im not trusting the mail with a million dollars""). Nothing will do but to go to Mega headquarters in Lincoln Neb. in person. The people closest to Woody naturally think the alcoholic old man has finally lost his mind. His aggrieved take-no-prisoners wife Kate (a profanely delightful June Squibb Jack Nicholsons characters wife in Paynes ""About Schmidt"") says ""I never knew the dumb cluck even wanted to be a millionaire"" while his other son Ross (""Breaking Bads"" Bob Odenkirk) is equally unsympathetic to a father whos never been there for anyone.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013David thinks Woody is nuts too but though he has a job selling sound systems at Mid City Superstore hes just been abandoned by his girlfriend and his life is mired in lassitude. Woodys ""what else you got going on?"" taunt may be typically mean-spirited but it has some truth in it and much to his mother and brothers disgust David agrees to drive his father to Lincoln just to prove that there is no money there.Stubborn querulous and bad-tempered at the best of times Woody is hardly at his best now and circumstances beyond Davids control detour the trip to the fictional hamlet of Hawthorne Neb. Woodys hometown where the bulk of the film takes place and where its themes come into tighter focus.The creation of sharply drawn characters has always been a strength of Paynes which is likely one reason he was attracted to Nelsons script. These include family members like Woodys devious lunkhead nephews Bart and Cole (Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray) and assorted townsfolk most notably Ed Pegram a shadowy figure from Woodys past expertly played by Stacy Keach (who throws in a priceless karaoke version of ""In the Ghetto"" for good measure).Woody cant help but tell folks about his million-dollar windfall and he soon becomes the talk of the town much to Davids increasing exasperation (Fortes natural hangdog look is perfect here). It turns out these people are as eager to believe in Woodys good fortune as he is with increasingly outrageous results.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVThese characters may be unknowing participants in a comedy of the everyday absurd but ""Nebraska"" takes pains to treat all its people with respect to allow them the dignity of being doggedly themselves delusions and all. We may laugh at what theyre up to but we shake our heads in inevitable recognition as well.Though it has its screwball elements ""Nebraska"" makes its mark with its delicate emotional situations many of which involve the relationship between Woody and David. Always looking to enhance his sketchy connection to a difficult father David finds it tough going at first -- when he asks Woody if he was ever in love with wife Kate the old man barks ""It never came up"" -- but his persistence ends up paying surprising dividends for him and for us. For in ways that are wholly unanticipated David does come to a greater understanding of not only who his father is but how he got that way and why that phantom million dollars looms so large in his life.None of this would have been possible obviously without Derns meticulous work as the battered and baffled Woody. Restraint has not always been a hallmark of Derns previous efforts but he is in impressive control here with acting that does as much with looks and body language as it does with words. His character reminds us as does the entire film how little it takes to make us happy and how hard it is to get even that. kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------NebraskaMPAA rating R for some languageRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPlaying ArcLight Hollywood; Landmark West Los Angeles PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Stacy Keach Saturday Night Live (tv program) Jack Nicholson Bruce Dern Nebraska Alexander Payne on returning to the Midwest All Is Lost Gravity Nebraska go big with small casts Nebraskas Stacy Keach is busy in any genre Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-nebraska-20131115,0,5377444.story#axzz2kfeNsGto",200,nebraska28,nebraska,latimes

Shot in black-and-white on some of the most depressing American locations youll ever see ""Nebraska"" is a ruthless social satire that proves Payne hasnt lost his misanthropic edge after going gentle with ""The Descendants."" At the same time its also a sentimental two-hander with Hollywood veteran Bruce Dern and one-time ""Saturday Night Live"" star Will Forte as an estranged father and son finding a way to connect during an unexpected road trip. Its a career-capping performance by Dern who is so convincing as an addled drunken embittered and probably dying man that he doesnt appear to be acting but Forte is just as good playing a preoccupied emotionally constricted man-child. (Dern who is now 77 won the best-actor prize at Cannes this year and is likely to be nominated for an Oscar as well.)These two aspects of the movie are sometimes in harmony and sometimes in conflict and after two viewings I feel like theres a dissonance at the heart of ""Nebraska"" that Payne doesnt quite control. Maybe hes not trying to; the dissonance comes from America. One of the purposes of the red-state odyssey undertaken by Woody Grant (Dern) and his son David (Forte) - they drive from Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. 800-odd miles of North American empty - is to demonstrate that the much-mythologized agricultural communities of the heartland are moral and economic vacuums zones of stupidity obesity and small-minded greed. Karl Marxs famous remark about ""the idiocy of rural life"" (by which he actually meant its cultural isolation and political apathy) has nothing on Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelsons portrayal of the fictional Hawthorne Neb. the Grant familys original hometown.I dont claim that Payne had any political intentions in making this movie but its hard not to perceive ""Nebraska"" as a portrait of a version of American life thats rapidly dying out. To a significant extent the aging white small-town demographic of this movie correlates with Tea Party sympathy ""values voters"" and profoundly self-destructive anti-government sentiment (although none of those things is ever mentioned). Almost everyone we meet in Hawthorne is old not counting Bart (Tim Driscoll) and Cole (Devin Ratray) Davids bovine and criminal identical-twin cousins; the only businesses that seem to be thriving are the two downscale taverns and a garage run by Mexican immigrants. Were treated to a number of conversations about how long it takes or might hypothetically take to drive from Point A to Point B (a topic of endless fascination to the American male) and about who used to drive what car and when. Theres a wonderful back-and-forth about a 78 Impala - unless it was a 79 Buick - that ran forever until it stopped running that betrays Nelsons past as a sketch-comedy writer. (Nelson is from Yankton S.D. and Paynes parents ran a restaurant in Omaha so you cant accuse either of them of being snarky coastal invaders.)David doesnt especially want to drive his dad all the way to Lincoln or at least he doesnt at first. But one of the sneaky things about ""Nebraska"" is that from the outset David grasps the narrative possibilities. Woodys received a letter telling him that hes won a million dollars - yes one of those letters and I didnt know they still existed either - and literally wont let go of it. In the opening scene he gets corralled by a sheriffs deputy on the shoulder of the interstate as he doggedly trudges out of Billings and later David has to drag him home from the bus station. (Woody isnt entrusting his million bucks to the U.S. Postal Service and can you blame him?) Davids job selling home-theater hardware isnt going that great and his girlfriend has moved out. Driving to Nebraska offers both a window into his own familys past and one last chance to forge a connection with Woody who seems mentally checked out about half the time and is clearly in failing health. About two-thirds of the way through the movie David gets to sit at a kitchen table with Woody and tell him how glad he is theyve gotten to spend this time together.Woody isnt having it. While watching Derns performance a second time through I couldnt help recalling William Butler Yeats famous lines about an old mans heart ""sick with desire/ And fastened to a dying animal/ It knows not what it is."" Theres nothing like seeing a familiar figure do something entirely new and at no point in Derns long career of playing crime-movie bad guys and (as he puts it) ""fifth cowboy on the left"" has there been anything remotely like this. Theres a blankness to Woody as well as a hunger and a ferocity that feels terrifyingly real. We cant tell what hes really thinking when David tells him over and over again that the million-dollar letter is a come-on for magazine subscriptions and that he hasnt won anything. Sometimes Woody gives back an implacable hostility and sometimes hes like a petulant child ""But it says I won"" When he claims not to remember an old girlfriend from Hawthorne or never to have considered the question of whether he was in love with Kate (the marvelous June Squibb) Davids irascible and foulmouthed mother we cant be sure whether hes lying to David or to himself. You Might Also Like As David and Kate both observe its not like theres anything Woody could really do with a million dollars at this point. He says he wants a new pickup truck (even though his drivers license has been revoked) and an air compressor to replace the one an old business partner back in Hawthorne absconded with 30-odd years ago. When David and Woody stop off in Hawthorne for an impromptu family reunion on their way to Lincoln - they drive by way of Rapid City and Mount Rushmore and those of you with Google Maps open can start tut-tutting right now - you can bet former partner Ed Pegram surfaces again once word starts to spread through town that ol Woody has come into serious money. That would be Stacy Keach nearly stealing the show in one of his best villain roles leading the pack of locals who refuse to believe Davids explanation that the whole thing is just an old mans bewilderment and there isnt actually any money. As one of the bovine mutton-chop-sporting twins scornfully puts it ""Were way beyond that"" Woody may be a confused old drunk with a tendency to lose his teeth in odd locations who was a crappy father to David and Billings newscaster Ross (Bob Odenkirk) but his quest for nonexistent riches seems positively noble next to the zombielike grasping of the Hawthorne townspeople. In the middle of a movie thats bound for a heartwarming conclusion (of sorts) Paynes portrayal of Woodys old friends and extended family is almost unrelentingly cruel. I guess you have to put it in context that being the fact that these people live in the absolute middle of nowhere and have suffered through a long-term economic shift that has caused many Grain Belt small towns like Hawthorne to dry up and blow away. (One of my great-grandfathers was born in a town in Iowa that has fewer people today than it had in 1900.) Even the smell of entirely imaginary money is enough to render them all simultaneously pathetic and evil a bunch of buffoons who traded in their souls long ago for a platter of bleu-cheese buffalo wings.As always Payne is expert at pulling comedy out of unlikely situations A visit to the town cemetery in which Kate flashes the grave of a former boyfriend (""See what you couldve had if you hadnt talked so damn much about wheat?"") or David and Ross renegade effort to resteal the missing air compressor. Even though Payne didnt write this movie it rolls together many of the themes of his previous work ""About Schmidt"" ""Sideways"" and ""The Descendants"" all involve road trips family secrets and moments of male reckoning and the tone of withering satire here harkens back to ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election."" ""Nebraska"" is also overtly manipulative which has also become Paynes trademark He wants us to laugh at this demented old guy with his sweepstakes letter his sad-sack son and their depraved surroundings and then he wants to turn it all around at almost the last minute and redeem them. It works or more accurately it comes damn close largely thanks to the remarkable performances Payne gets from Dern and Forte. But when you actually do hit the lottery dont tell anyone back home.

Wallace Paramount Vantage)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Bruce Dern Will Forte June Squibb Bob Odenkirk Stacy KeachRated R; runtime 1 hour 55 minutes; opens Friday in select citiesWoody Grant is not about to fade into oblivion.He seems to embody Dylan Thomas poetic advice "" Old age should burn and rave at close of day."" A cantankerous old coot he may be limping disheveled and confused but his stubborn determination defines him.Bruce Dern gives the performance of his career as the headstrong Woody in the brilliant wisely observed and wryly funny Nebraska ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday in select cities). What stands out is the fullness of the character with mannerisms and expressions that make him wholly dimensional.STORY In Nebraska Bruce Dern scowls his way to Oscar talkREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHOLIDAY MOVIE CALENDAR November Nebraska is a wistful tale of family ties and economic hardship shot in crisp black and white. Woody is its most indelible character a befuddled laconic curmudgeon who is also vaguely childlike in his bouts of docility and irrational willfulness. Derns performance never falls into caricature. His portrayal is both reserved and raw sometimes painful to watch always masterfully underplayed.In a more subtle role Will Forte is superb as the dutiful kindly son David who is mystified by his enigmatic father. June Squibb is very funny as Woodys eye-rolling hectoring wife who finds him endlessly exasperating. Woodys older son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) is also convincing as a local news anchorman clearly his mothers favorite.Neither Ross nor David have ever understood their father especially now that hes in his dotage. Ross is resentful about how hes let them down but David yearns to connect.Woody seems stuck in the recesses of his mind pondering thoughts he doesnt care to share with those around him. Or maybe hes in an alcoholic stupor. When he receives a sweepstakes mailer announcing hes ""already won"" a million dollars he doesnt see it as a come-on or a common scam. Instead he pockets the faux certificate convinced hes holding the golden ticket.When the audience first gets a glimpse of him Woodys limping along a sparsely traveled boulevard. Questioned by a police officer he matter-of-factly explains hes on his way to Lincoln Neb. for his million-dollar check. The street hes walking on is in his hometown of Billings Mont..Is Woody merely an obstinate fool or is he holding on to his last hope of dignity and happiness?Ever-patient David decides to drive his dad to Nebraska to prove the prize is a fake. Plus he wants to spend some time with him. Their odyssey is often poignant sometimes farcically hilarious occasionally infuriating.Nebraska is a film of raw beauty and great humanity. Alexander Paynes nimble direction with its stunning Midwestern vistas captures the storys wistfulness. As in his previous films including About Schmidt Sideways and The Descendants Payne depicts ordinary people. That may sound simplistic or reductive but to convincingly capture human nature is difficult. Working from a script by Bob Nelson Payne understands the players involved. And no matter how flawed they may seem he never mocks or belittles them.Shot across four states this perfectly pitched character study artfully blends good-natured humor with haunting visual beauty and melancholy grace. 61 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ctC24rHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

A booze-addled father (Bruce Dern) makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son (Will Forte) in order to claim a sweepstakes prize. Also starring Bob Odenkirk. (Photo Paramount Vantage) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Nov. 14 2013 136 p.m. ET What makes a movie big or small? By one set of measurements Alexander Paynes ""Nebraska"" which was written by Bob Nelson is on the small side--modest budget black-and-white photography a road movie played out across flat country at a leisurely pace and nary a trace of special effects. Measured differently though this is a richly textured film about a half-cracked father and a nearly estranged son a universal tale in which the father dodging dementia--and his shrewish wife--with sporadic success clings fiercely heroically and often hilariously to his own reality. By the metrics of the heart ""Nebraska"" is as big as it is beautiful. Everything turns on the father Woody Grant and Bruce Derns portrait of the boozy old coot is a wonder as well as the capstone thus far of that singular actors career. With a white nimbus of unkempt hair and a wild look in his gimlet eyes Woody walks stiffly like a puppet with splintering legs attached to strings of unequal length but he walks often and far. Instead of a wanderlust he has a wander-off-lust that keeps his wife Kate (June Squibb) in a state of agitation and keeps their 40-something son David busy looking for him. (David is played with soulful delicacy by Will Forte.) Woodys reality is woefully skewed but clearly focused even if the objects of his focus are illusory. Thats particularly true of the million-dollar sweepstakes prize hes convinced he has won on the basis of a direct-mail letter. Its a scam of course but a perfect pretext for a movie plot. When Woody insists on traveling from his home in Montana to the sweepstakes office in Nebraska to collect his windfall his sad sweet-spirited son makes an impulsive decision to indulge his fathers fantasy and the two men hit the road. Related Video WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews Nebraska a black-and-white road movie that unfolds in classic tradition. Photo Paramount Pictures. The filmmaker is a Nebraska native so its no surprise that his film has a vivid sense of place. (Phedon Papamichaels cinematography goes beyond vivid into radiant in its depiction of tranquil cloudscapes meandering country roads and moldering rural backwaters. Some of his images evoke the American Gothic of Grant Wood or on city streets along the way those of Garry Winogrand but the overall aesthetic is his own and deeply pleasing.) Whats extraordinary is what happens at the intersection of Mr. Paynes impeccable direction and Mr. Nelsons brilliant script. The odyssey combines quite effortlessly prickly combat between father and son; picaresque comedy--a blissfully funny sequence involves a purloined compressor--and a stirring exploration of Woodys past for which he has harbored little fondness. ""You must have been in love at least at first"" David says to his father searching for the slightest trace of warmth in his parents marriage. ""It never came up"" Woody replies. The past ""Nebraska"" wants us to know is always with us whether figuratively in its heros case--he turns out to be basically the same scattered naive sucker he was as a kid--or literally as evidenced by one of those backwaters a Nebraska town called Hawthorne where time moves in such small halting steps that the present hasnt arrived. Woody grew up there and he cant fathom that people he knew are dead and gone but part of his family remains including a couple of grotesque nephews with nothing to do all day. Fall Movie Preview The Coen Brothers 1961 Revisited David O. Russells Latest Chapter An Iranian in Paris A Queen Plays Commoner When Walt Disney Charmed Mary Poppins A Felon for a Houseguest When a Voice Takes Center Stage Can East Meet West? August Streep Roberts Script Firepower In the hands of a lesser director working from another script everyone in town might have been grotesque; this film is notable for its grace and generosity. The old folks being old talk slowly and a little too loudly but they arent broadened into caricature. The one exception is Kate the wife and mother who never has a good word to say about anyone. Ms. Squibbs performance is so broad that its hard to believe such a scold could have produced a son as open and gentle as David Kates first words hurled witheringly at Woody are ""You dumb cluck"" Yet she sells her characters crackling dialogue with a verve thats bound to be popular. As a road movie in a classic tradition ""Nebraska"" with an exquisite score by Mark Orton has a stated destination and an unstated goal. Getting to that sweepstakes office is a trip and a half punctuated by encounters with such pungent characters as Stacy Keachs Ed Pegram a smiling brute whos alive to the possibilities of Woodys putative fortune and Angela McEwans Peg Nagy an other-worldly pixie who runs Hawthornes little newspaper and dispatches a boy on a bicycle to photograph Woody for the article she intends to write about him. But getting to the goal of reconciliation is what carries father and son along and leads to a vehicular climax thats entirely in keeping with what has gone before--ineffably tender entirely unexpected and quietly thrilling. Watch a clip from the film ""At Berkeley"" a documentary on UC Berkeley that shows the major aspects of university life its intellectual and social mission its obligation to the state and to larger ideas of higher education. (Photo Berkeley Film Inc.) At Berkeley During one of the many scenes set in classrooms and laboratories in ""At Berkeley"" Frederick Wisemans remarkable documentary on the University of California at Berkeley a professor wonders aloud how our brains create our sense of time. The process is mysterious he notes since theres nothing in our bodies or brains that perceives time ""It isnt there you know to be perceived."" The filmmaker may have included this vignette as a sly joke given our likely perception that his film which clocks in at slightly over four hours takes a lot of time to watch. Yet ""At Berkeley"" is more than the sum of its minutes. Narration-free and artfully discursive its a one-of-a-kind mosaic portrait of a great institution struggling under dire stress to retain its essential character at a time of declining support for public education. When filming took place over the course of 12 weeks in 2010 Californias budget crisis was at its peak and the stress amounted to a siege; massive cuts in state aid had prompted faculty furloughs soaring tuition costs and a searching of Berkeleys institutional soul by the universitys leadership team and its chancellor at the time Robert Birgeneau; strategy meetings of the group are interspersed with vignettes of student and faculty life on campus. Since then the economy has improved and short-term fixes have stabilized the situation but the questions the film raises are no less urgent. Will Berkeley continue to be able to serve low-income students and indeed those from the middle class? Will the knowledge it produces belong to the public or to the government and the corporations on which the university must increasingly depend? At one point the camera lingers over a construction project where workers are pouring cement; what values will be built into the new building? Berkeley were told was originally modeled on Harvard but with an anti-elitist emphasis--a university created in the middle of the 19th century for a new California and a diverse population. The diversity on screen goes beyond the students faces to the subjects they study dark energy; a John Donne poem on sexual love as sacred activity; computer science (mechanical arms and hands picking up a towel and folding it intricately); biomechanics (a veteran disabled by a spinal-cord injury learning to walk with computer assistance); the genetics of cancer; the theme of desecration in Thoreaus ""Walden Pond."" ""At Berkeley"" is the 38th in Mr. Wisemans series of films about contemporary institutions; as always he finds symbolic resonance in seemingly random observations. It isnt a stretch to see a student practicing tight-rope walking on a rope strung between two trees as a stand-in for the universitys chancellor in the midst of sweeping reorganization and hurtling change. (And as always he declines to identify any of the people on screen out of a purists insistence on letting all parties speak for themselves.) ENLARGE A scene from At Berkeley. Berkeley Film Inc. Were apt to be a bit puzzled by all the attention the filmmaker pays to grounds-keeping and maintenance--a worker wielding a leaf blower another with a mop still another riding a lawn mower--until we learn at a leadership session devoted to maintenance that budget cuts have left UC Berkeley with only one lawn mower for the whole huge campus. Its a startling symbol from that time of the threat of desecration or disabling or whatever you want to call it at a world-class center of learning in a nation that needs all the education it can get. The film ends on an eerie note--a student production with a carnival flavor in which the black silhouettes of dancers make their way across a dark blue background while Willie Nelsons version of ""The City of New Orleans"" accompanies their balletic but spasmodic progress. ""Good morning America how are you?"" the singer asks. The answer remains to be told. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Silent Running (1972) Bruce Dern is a biologist named Freeman Lowell in this sci-fi classic with a green message. At a time when Earths vegetation has been destroyed by pollution and overcrowding Freeman serves as a steward of precious forests that are flourishing aboard a giant spaceship. The scuttling little droids that serve him were progenitors of R2-D2 and WALL-E. The script was written by Deric Washburn Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco. The director was Douglas Trumbull who supervised the visual effects in ""Blade Runner"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""The Tree of Life"" and was one of the special photographic effects supervisors for ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" ENLARGE Election (1999) If life is like high school Alexander Paynes now-classic comedy about high-school politics nails the world we live in. On its face which is funny enough the story concerns a high-school civics teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) who tries to tamper with an election thats going to make an insufferable overachiever named Tracy Flick president of the student body. (Shes played brilliantly by Reese Witherspoon.) Yet the movie makes a joyous mockery of larger issues--steely ambition self-righteous hypocrisy the howling hollowness of the political process. ENLARGE Sideways (2004) Mr. Payne directed his nosegay to the wine-country from a script that he and Jim Taylor based on a Rex Pickett novel. The film is full of pleasures and quiet surprises and a scene that has become a classic. Its the one in which Paul Giamattis self-sabotaging oenophile Miles discusses the virtues of pinot noir with Virginia Madsens Maya an earthy common-sensical waitress who has deep roots in Californias vineyards. As Miles babbles on about the pinot grape we begin to understand what Maya has understood instantly that this searcher for love is talking about his difficult-to-cultivate self.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 14 2013 1200 PM Title Nebraska Film Info R Language. Angelika Lincoln Plaza. Capturing family on film -- the real rhythms of family with all the annoyances awkwardness and affection -- is tough. Tougher still is navigating a story around the murky emotional waters of Midwestern relatives. Yet one neednt be cut from that cloth to see the hilarious beauty and the beautiful honesty in ""Nebraska."" Director Alexander Paynes film opens with Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) a cranky ol coot walking alone up the side of the highway. Hes hoofing slowly from Montana to Nebraska to collect the ""million-dollar prize"" Woody thinks he won from a misleading postcard. He wont let anyone get in his way especially his sons David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) who try to halt Woody at the urging of their mom (June Squibb). ""Try"" is the main word. Woody has been through nearly 80 years of hard work and hard drinking and hes grasping at something no matter how outlandish. Realizing his dad wont drop the notion of the trip David agrees to a drive the two of them to Lincoln. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern second from left) takes a tour through his past in ""Nebraska."" Co-starring are (l.-r.) Will Forte June Squibb and Bob Odenkirk. On the way they visit Woodys brothers a half-dozen sons of bitches as stoic as he is. Squabbles turn to scrapes between David and his cousins as well as with Ed (Stacy Keach) a longtime foe of Woodys. Minor secrets are revealed but what mostly comes to light is that with the fame heading Woodys way (local guy turns millionaire) also comes mooching resentment and unburied hatchets. Woody himself may have misremembered a few details as he has turned anecdote into myth. But that wont stop him from finally being a hometown big shot if just briefly. As in ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"" Payne -- an Oscar winner for the script of ""The Descendants"" -- finds poetry in everyday lower-middle-class folks. Forte and Odenkirk step up by making their characters look and feel exhausted. Like the dilapidated houses and barren main streets that look lovely in gorgeous black-and-white theyre guys who may just be holding on but theyre not about to let go. In ""Nebraska"" Will Forte as David Grant conveys the exhaustion of lower-middle-class life in the heartland. If some of the actors dont jell it may be because Payne -- working from a script by Bob Nelson -- works so specifically. He has an affection for early buffets where oldsters earnestly sing karaoke Elvis conversations about interstate off-ramps and shabby bars whose Old Milwaukee signs arent hung with hip irony. Then theres what Dern does here. With his sneer and his physicality he is a piece of work decades in the making. Boxy and bony wispy gray cloud atop his head he delays then slowly delivers the Dern-isms we saw more than 40 years ago in ""Will Penny"" ""Silent Running"" and ""The King of Marvin Gardens."" Woody doesnt say much but watch him ramble through the ramshackle home he grew up in tersely and matter-of-factly muttering about the past and see great and plain all at once. jneumaiernydailynews.com On a mobile device?

The day after he returned home empty-handed he had a stroke. Four months later he bought a second plane ticket to Florida and stubbornly knocked on their doors again. After all the letter hed received screamed ""Richard Lusk Final Results Are In and Theyre Official Youre Our Newest 11 Million Winner"" Shrugged Lusk ""I didnt see how I could be wrong."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - When your eyes are old its hard to read the fine print. Add boredom gullibility and desperation to leave some cash to family when you die and youre ripe for exploitation. In Alexander Paynes endearingly gruff Nebraska ex-auto mechanic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern with a wild puff of white hair) is the sucker senior citizen. But our sympathies are with his exasperated sons David and Ross (Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk) who must gingerly convince their father that hes a fool.Naturally he thinks theyre morons for not immediately offering to drive him from Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. to claim his winning check.Film DetailsCritics Pick Nebraska RatingR GenreDrama Running Time115 min.

Sep. 13 600pm Another director would have made Woodys damnable insistence on trekking 849 miles a comedy. But Nebraska is the antidote to other family charmers about goofballs in matching sweaters. Payne even drains the film of color shooting Woodys wishful odyssey in unsentimental black-and-white -- the better to show the dirt in the snow and the lines in Derns face.Once Payne too dabbled in wish fulfillment -- its been nine years since Sideways and Im still cranky that Virginia Madsen settles for Paul Giamattis whiny schlub -- but his later films are sure-footed and pragmatic.In The Descendants he shrugged at marriage while making Honolulu look as dingy as the plant aisle at Home Depot. Here he takes the heartland -- a stretch of America that Hollywood flatters as the place where a Reese Witherspoon type can really you know find herself -- and strips the Norman Rockwell off it like cheap aluminum siding.On the surface Nebraska sounds like a saccharine road-trip flick the type that ends in a hug. David wishes it were. Before the two quiet men hit the freeway hes embraced the big idea that this million-dollar folly gives dad a reason to live. He gets it.And then the drive is spent watching Davids own big-hug dreams deflate. Woody couldnt care less about family bonding. When David asks why he even bothered to marry and spawn two sons Woody grunts ""I liked to screw and your mothers a Catholic so you figure it out.""Instead David -- and we -- learn more about his dad from other people particularly during a cobbled-together Grant family reunion a long detour that gives Ross and Kate time to grab a bus and rejoin the plot.The Grants are hard to love. These terse farm folk dont believe the world offers anything more beautiful than a decent TV. But we may know them -- Im related to a few myself -- and forgive Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson for creating real people who look like cliches including Davids pig-faced cousins and money-hungry aunts. These bit players are excellent and Dern is near-guaranteed an Oscar nod if only by virtue of being openly old.But the loudest laughs come from Squibbs Kate who bitterly resents her husband her in-laws and anyone else she can blame for wasting her youth. In one cemetery sequence that hoots for awards attention she merrily dismisses the dead Grants as a bunch of whores bitches and drunks before hoisting her skirt over the grave of an ex-boyfriend and yelling ""See what you could have had Keith if you hadnt talked about wheat all the time?""Its funny scene-stealing stuff but its too sour to share the screen with Fortes subtle turn as the steamrollered son. The former Saturday Night Live star has defiled his share of cemeteries -- all hail the scene where he boned Maya Rudolphs ghost on a tombstone in the criminally underappreciated MacGruber -- but Payne is the first director to trust him with real emotions. The gamble pays off. With his scared eyes and small lips Forte looks like the resurrection of Buster Keaton -- and like Keaton he plays it simple waiting for the audience to warm to him when were ready.That Payne trusts us too to find the heart in his chilly film feels like a gift as we begin the slog of a holiday season where Hollywood slobberingly begs us to feel. David never does get that hug but he does get the dignity of learning to love people for who they are not for who he wishes theyd be while accepting that they cant always respond in ways he understands.Its true for families and its true for films. And Nebraska is worth making the effort.NEBRASKA | Directed by Alexander Payne | Written by Bob Nelson | Paramount Vantage | Landmark Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Paramount Pictures Nebraska Director Alexander Payne Genre Drama Running Time 115 minutes Rated R for some language With Bruce Dern Will Forte June Squibb (Recommended) Woody Grant has white hair a cranky disposition and a stubbornness that just wont quit. When we meet him hes being stopped by a highway patrolman as hes walking down the shoulder of a Montana interstate. His son David picks him up at the police station and it turns out Woody was on an 850-mile stroll to Nebraska to collect the million dollars promised to him in a letter. David points out gently that the letter is an ad for magazine subscriptions but hes no sooner got the older man back to his house then he gets a call from his mom Woody has hit the road again. As played by Bruce Dern in a performance youll be hearing about at awards time Woody may be slipping mentally but hes still sharp in flashes. He also has a plain-spoken scene-stealing wife (June Squibb) whom you might call a decent incentive for getting out of town. The son youd expect these two to produce -- put-upon David played with wary grace by Will Forte -- decides a bit of bonding with a father he doesnt really know couldnt hurt. So they hop in his car and soon theyre passing through the town where Woody grew up a place where the people look as weathered as the buildings and where David discovers despite much backslapping that even friends can be harsh. i Woodys wife Kate (June Squibb) has her own strong opinions about her husband and his supposed riches.

Wallace/Paramount Pictures Woodys wife Kate (June Squibb) has her own strong opinions about her husband and his supposed riches. Merie W. Wallace/Paramount Pictures Director Alexander Payne (Sideways The Descendants) shot Nebraska in black and white a decision that gives the films windswept landscapes a Last Picture Show meets Grapes of Wrath feel -- and that makes those rugged faces seem as iconic as the ones on Mount Rushmore. (Which Woody dismisses when they drive by it as looking unfinished.) The filmmaker has crammed Nebraska with orneriness humor greed Americana and performances so natural they seem like found objects -- especially Derns which caps a career of character parts with a delicately nuanced character. Im guessing the name hes been given in the film wasnt accidental. Woody Grant could have stepped straight out of Grant Woods painting American Gothic. His story too crusty old coot from a dying farm town looking for Meaning at the end of a life that may not have had one.

In todays frenzied atmosphere of zombies vampires and people floating aimlessly through outer space the deceptive simplicity of Alexander Paynes Nebraska the measured pace and the fact that it was filmed in glorious black-and-white are possible reasons why it might not be every moviegoers cinematic bromide. But woe be the fool who misses it. Bruce Dern won the Best Actor award at this years Cannes Film Festival and its easy to see why. As Woody Grant a grizzled vestige of a fading era of calloused pioneer American spirit that has all but vanished he is focused three-dimensional fully realized and mesmerizing. When first seen Woody is an old codger from Billings Mont. hobbling down the interstate on foot who tells the cop who stops him that he is not only not a homeless vagrant but hes on his way to Lincoln Neb. to collect a million-dollar sweepstakes prize advertised in a mail coupon. His son David (Will Forte) tries to explain to no avail that its a mail-in fraud to sell magazine subscriptions but the old man has a stubborn resolve as hard as concrete so to avoid picking him up on street corners and bar stools the young man decides to drive his dad all the way to Nebraska himself. David an underachiever who sells electronics and his more successful older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) a Billings TV news reporter have nothing in common but they share a fondness for their dad that has never been warmly reciprocated in addition to a growing concern about his advancing dementia. In a fabulous understated carefully nuanced performance as the old mans exasperated long-suffering wife Kate June Squibb shows up on the road trip to add the voice of reason and rant to the soft-hearted men in her life. With tart-tongued sarcasm she steals the picture. In one of the few Payne films written by somebody else (in this case the poignant carefully modulated script is by Bob Nelson) the director loses none of his trademark sympathy for the little people in the human stain prominent in triumphs like Election Citizen Ruth and Sideways. (He only temporarily derailed in his sentimental soporific George Clooney disappointment The Descendants.) Almost every scene is magically informed by the stoic seniority of Mr. Dern. An accident in a drunken fall causes him to lose his false teeth on a railroad track while a detour to see Mount Rushmore furnishes some unexpected cracker barrel wisdom that is both revealing and wry. A ghastly weekend in a dried-up hick town where Woody used to own a garage leads to a reunion with an old girlfriend and an overnight stay at the tacky house of relatives who see a chance to cash in on some of Woodys money says a lot about the American hypocrisy of family ties. Through Wyoming and South Dakota Phedon Papamichaels camera paints a moving portrait of the barren ugliness of the changing landscape of the American grain belt with its empty fields shingle houses and dying mom-and-pop businesses decimated by the economy. And Mr. Nelsons observant detailed script flawlessly captures the mood of what American ennui has done to both old and young men on their way to becoming losers lending a look and feel that seems like the Great Depression. Woody has reached the point where dreams are dead the mind cobbles and the apple wont bite. Mr. Dern plays him as one of the leftover people--no past no sense of belonging and feelings long buried that ache to resurface. When his son asks in a moment of candor ""Did you ever love Mom?"" Woody says ""It never came up."" He drinks because he doesnt know what else to do. In one of the years most memorable characterizations Mr. Dern is the most plausible old tree root--implacable and etched in rye whiskey--since Richard Farnsworth rode that lawn mower across the country in The Straight Story. Eons removed from his comic turns on Saturday Night Live Will Forte is a wonderful son and travel companion--indulging the old mans whims doing what he can to show affection and hiding the fact that he craves the same in return--and Ms. Squibb is hilarious as the dyspeptic no-nonsense family matriarch. The movie is wrenchingly slow--you know from the start that nothing is ever going to happen--but Nebraska has a charm that grows on you like a lichen a wicked sense of humor that makes you laugh in spite of yourself a concealed heart soft as a Hostess Twinkie and a generous welcome respect for the basic decency of the human race more valuable than any lottery ticket.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 10 2013 ShareThis Bruce Dern in Nebraska.  (Photo Merie W. Wallace/Courtesy of Paramount Vantage) The premise of Alexander Paynes road movie Nebraska is an obvious dead end. An elderly man in Billings Montana receives a form letter saying hes the winner of a million-dollar-sweepstakes prize and that all he needs to do is call the company and maybe buy a magazine subscription or three. To collect his supposed fortune Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) insists on traveling the 900 miles from Billings to Lincoln Nebraska in person on foot if no one will drive him. (Being somewhat addled he has lost his license.) Woodys son an electronics-store salesman named David (Will Forte) tries patiently to explain that theres no million dollars in Nebraska. Woodys diminutive-hellion wife Kate (June Squibb) adds that hes a dumb cluck and that if he wanted to be a millionaire he should have worked for it years ago. But whenever his family turns their backs the old man is quickly out the door trudging southeast in the snow toward the Magic Kingdom that is Nebraska. The problem going in is that its hard to make an emotional investment in a man so mulishly irrationally wrong and one whos surly and taciturn to boot. The movies trailer makes the journey look especially cringe-worthy. Its cut to suggest whimsy like Waking Ned Devine or some other comedy about puckish elders doing the darndest things. Then theres the question Paynes movies always seem to raise Is he condescending to the little people? His Midwest (he grew up there) is rich in overweight intellectually underpowered yokels whose ugly dwellings are an insult to the land on which they squat. Working from a script by Bob Nelson Payne seems to have done everything possible to shoot the tires on his own car. It turns out though that the point where so many of us squirm is Paynes artistic sweet spot the famously fine line between love and hate empathy and ridicule. Nebraska is a bumpy rideI fought with it constantly. But that car goes somewhere unexpected. The movie is a triumph of an especially satisfying kind. It arrives at a kind of gnarled grace thats true to this sorry old man and the family he let down in so many ways. What sympathy we give to Woody were probably giving to Dern an actor who rose to semi-stardom in the shadow of counterculture supernovas like Jack Nicholson and who never found a nichebut has hung on honorably (and given us a treasure in his daughter Laura). Dern has always had a runners gauntness but now hes yet more drawn with a shock of white hair and eyes that are mostly cast down. But when he lifts them theyre huge and liquid. Alcohol as well as age have evidently burned out a lot of Woodys synapses and he wasnt given to talk in any case. He served in Korea and married and had kids without discussing it. The question hangs from first frame to last How much is in there? How much does he know? How much does he feel? Dern gives a beautiful performance near-pantomimebroken with the odd expulsive obscenity. Will Forte is an ordinary-looking guy with a manic streak in comedy that takes him places even he likely doesnt understand. He doesnt get to tap that mania herehes the harried straight man. But his energy keeps the movie going. His David reacts to everything while his father appears to register nothing. David agrees to drive his dad to Lincoln but takes a detour off the highway to the small Nebraska town where he was born and where Woody and Kate once made their life. Woodys family is still there and so are many of his old neighbors and friendsuneasy friends friends with grudges. Why did the family decamp for Billings? Why has Woody been gone so long and why has he never looked back? Theres a tension from the start between the crabbed shut-down characters and the gorgeously expansive frames which are heavy on Midwest-farmland iconography and cows and rusted machinery and puffy clouds. Payne has chosen to shoot Nebraska in black and white and though at first I asked Why? I soon realized that color would be a distraction and that many things are better in black and white. Even Davids cousinsone on parole after a sexual assault and both unemployed transfixed by the TV and photographed to look like Fat and Fatterhave an iconic sharpness. This economy has just torn up young men says their mother and who knows whats nature and whats the deadening effect of their milieu? Woody joins his elderly brothers for a reunion which largely consists of the old men sitting in their plaid shirts in front of the television; they trade monosyllables without looking one anothers way. Nature or nurture? Their fine weathered features (Payne uses many nonactors) and composer Mark Ortons stoic minor-key banjo and strings give them a dignity that turns an easy sight gag into something more mysterious. The prospect of Woodys sudden wealth brings out the thug in Woodys family and former friends among them Stacy Keach as an exbusiness partner soaked in booze and resentmenta hard scary performance. Theres an edge to the other elders too who are outwardly friendly but suspicious. More than half of Nebraska is bleak and spiky redolent of alcohol and rust of unwelcoming old-man bars. But there are respites. Bob Odenkirk shows up as Davids older brother Ross a TV reporter on the verge (maybe) of becoming an anchorman. Rosss smoothness makes him seem as if hes from another dimensiontelevision has given him a reassuringly civilized veneer. An actress named Angela McEwan has a blessedly gentle scene as the owner of a small-town newspaper who knows Woody through and through and forgives him everything. Squibb has the showstopping role. She powers through her insults hammering away at the fading Woody but saving her most exultant put-downs for the family she left in evident disgust. Nebraska has something close to a feel-good ending and its notmiraculouslya cheat. Payne and screenwriter Nelson pull a rabbit out of their hat. They turn their focus inward; they go to the emotional source of Woodys quest his idee fixe. They even accountobliquelyfor his dementia which must be partly willed the longed-for stupor of a man who doesnt want to reckon with a half-lived life. His sudden connection with the son who sticks by him in spite of everything is worth the price of a ticketours and Davids. At the end of the road you feel like a million bucks.

Review With Nebraska Has Alexander Payne Gone Soft? Eric Kohn Nov 11 2013 920 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Alexander Paynes movies walk a fine line between cruel satire and subtle emotions but in ""Nebraska"" its particularly hard to discern which is which. The black-and-white road trip dramedy might be his least essential work but its also notably distinct from the rest of it. The first project that the filmmaker didnt write himself ""Nebraska"" lacks the vulgar edge typically at the center of his scenarios. Its a sad undeniably thoughtful depiction of midwestern eccentrics regretting the past and growing bored of the present -- ideas that Payne regards with gentle humor and pathos but also something of a shrug. At its core ""Nebraksa"" revolves around a pair of downbeat men David (Will Forte) and his father Woody (Bruce Dern) on an aimless mission to claim a million-dollar prize sweepstakes prize that doesnt exist. Having received a scam letter in the mail the disgruntled and possibly senile Woody continually wanders away from his home in Montana under the pretense of claiming his wealth much to the chagrin of his nagging wife Kate (June Squibb). Growing weary of picking up his father on random street corners David -- a down-on-his-luck electronics salesman -- decides to drive his dad to Lincoln Nebraska while stopping at their relatives home along the way. At that point the story basically pauses to reckon with Woodys underwhelming past establishing a tame but lightly endearing drama only vaguely twisted by implication Nobodys lives hold particular interest in ""Nebraska"" and the main thrust of the narrative involves David and Woody more or less accepting that. Much of the action unfolds in Woodys old hometown where his former acquaintances and mean-spirited relatives hit him up for all the debt they claim he has accrued. Eventually Kate and Davids slightly more put-together brother (Bob Odenkirk) join the duo at the home of Woodys equally subdued sibling (Rance Howard) where David is repeatedly mocked by his two portly cousins played by Devin Ratray and Kevin Kunkel with the broad humor of a Todd Phillips movie. One can easily imagine Phillips churning Bob Nelsons screenplay into a more outrageous and probably sophomoric comedy but Payne takes it at face value focusing on a mature agreeable mood. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichaels monochrome images capture the emptiness of a small town Americana that has echoes of ""Paper Moon"" while Mark Ortons rich score elaborates on the elegant world until it grows redundant. The atmosphere however never quite synchs with the hopelessness engulfing these characters lives. Instead Payne pities them to a great degree. The same perspective applies to his previous character studies of highly dysfunctional men and women from Reese Witherspoons success-addicted teen in ""Election"" to Jack Nicholsons frumpy turn in ""About Schmidt."" In ""Nebraska"" by comparison Payne for the first time allows his losers the opportunity to make peace with themselves. In contrast to everything else its a downright commercial venture. READ MORE Indiewire Blog The Playlist Offers a Different Take on ""Nebraska"" Mocking David for his slow driving and attempting to strong arm Woody into giving the family his make-believe winnings the cousins point to the darker side of Paynes tale particularly the ways that everyone attempts to take advantage of the meek David and Woody for their own personal gain. Only Kate manages to stand up to their aggression to the point where Squibb virtually steals the movie in a handful of scenes. Dern ostensibly at the center of the story mutters his lines in gruff monotone and comes across fairly dry; Forte meanwhile mainly just looks astonished to show up in such a straightforward production. Yet there are glimmers of wicked humor that frequently beckon to come out. Over drinks David asks his father why he had children in the first place. ""I figured if we kept on screwing wed have a couple of you"" he says. That line alone explains the uneasiness of their relationship but played for laughs it lacks the ability to deepen the sentiment. The bittersweet quality of David and Woodys awkward bonding session continues in several other scenes including a visit to Woodys childhood home but never once do the stakes rise or the feelings cut particularly deep. Still the pieces are all there. Like every Payne movie ""Nebraska"" involves neurotic characters afraid of their own mortality. The specter of death and lives not worth living hangs over ""Nebraska."" Its a subtle idea that lacks inspiration. A Nebraska native Payne has evidently made a personal movie about a place and time where nobody goes anywhere but most people make peace with their limitations. With the affably unexceptional ""Nebraska"" Payne follows suit. Criticwire grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Paramount opens ""Nebraska"" this Friday in limited release ahead of a nationwide expansion. Reviews have been mixed-to-positive since Cannes suggesting less of a hit than ""The Descendants"" but awards traction for Bruce Dern remains strong; hes a strong contender for a nomination in the best actor field while Payne has a shot at best original screenplay. A version of this review originally ran during the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

Perhaps the reviewer needs to watch the movie again to fully appreciate its subtleties and give it the write-up it deserves.

Reply bob hawk May 12 2016 101 pm ""Soft"" ""least essential"" ""a shrug"" are to my mind all inappropriate words to apply to Alexander Paynes quietly compelling work. My words would be ""most mature assured and accomplished yet."" (And I love his earlier work as well.) Reply ttheresa May 12 2016 101 pm It is difficult to attain uniform quality when trying to mix satire with emotions. Payne attempts to do this in every one of his films.

The story of an aging alcoholic who enlists his son to help him retrieve 1 million in prize money Alexander Paynes latest meets at an unexpectedly powerful crossroads between hazy optimism and clear-eyed nostalgia. Alternately a poetic tale of personal affirmation and a plainspoken metaphor for tenacity in the face of meager hope ""Nebraska"" is not just a beautiful or great film but an essential one for our time. Bruce Dern (TVs ""Big Love"") plays Woody Grant a boozy retiree who becomes obsessed with going to Nebraska after a sweepstakes letter arrives in the mail announcing that hes won a million dollars. His son David (former ""Saturday Night Live"" player Will Forte) eventually volunteers to drive him from Montana if only to stop him from trying to walk there on his own. But after Woody drunkenly injures himself David makes a detour to their home town so that Woody can recover before the companys home office reopens on Monday morning. Also read 20 Movies Were Dying to See This Fall See video Reuniting with friends and family for the first time in decades Woody becomes an overnight celebrity when he announces his winnings. But after his father gets besieged for handouts from the locals David scrambles to protect him while contemplating how much longer to indulge his delusions of grandeur. If theres no one skeleton key that unlocks a childs understanding of his or her parent ""Nebraska"" suggests that theres at least a sort of road map that leads towards key moments and formative experiences in Mom and Dads lives. Unsurprisingly Payne handles the Grants dyspeptic interactions with typical sensitivity indulging the humor of small-town sensibilities without judgment or condescension. For example beyond its immediate comedic dividends theres something deeply recognizable about the notion of a family reunion two decades in the making that culminates in a dinner where no one has anything to say. Meanwhile the inevitable emergence of longstanding grievances and lurking resentments both supplies the film with drama and bolsters its real-world authenticity. As Woody Dern delivers an utterly convincing performance thats equal parts stubbornness and senility conveying a distant sense of awareness that hes undertaking a fools errand but also a desperate possibly drunken hope that inspires his perseverance. Meanwhile June Squibb plays his long-suffering wife Kate with a honey badgers disregard for propriety a spitfire whos unafraid to tell it like it is whether shes condemning Woodys pointless quest or scolding his greedy relatives. See video Bruce Dern Thinks Hes a Millionaire in Nebraska Trailer David on the other hand understands both Woody and Kate and Forte strikes an effortless balance between their opposing viewpoints feels like a natural byproduct of their parental influence. Despite being a performer whose comedic roles often tap into a sort of frenzied desperation Forte is delicate and understated under Paynes direction slowly appeasing the characters muffled unhappiness as he begins to find common ground with his estranged father. Employing the same road-trip structure of his earlier films ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"" Payne utilizes the rolling vistas of the Midwest as a canvas for his father and sons tumultuous interactions. But the filmmakers contemplative approach never turns mournful or mawkish and he consistently downplays the storys larger symbolic implications by keeping his focus on the behavior of the characters. In so doing Payne crafts a film that skirts the extremes of a parochial existence - neither the Bedford Falls of ""Its a Wonderful Life"" nor the North Texas wasteland of ""The Last Picture Show"" - in favor of an appropriately nuanced portrait of small-town life. Ultimately an intimate tale whose larger ramifications lurk just beyond the horizon of Woodys immediate priorities ""Nebraska"" sets its goalposts at poignancy rather than profundity and achieves emotional transcendence precisely because its victories prove just enough for one man.

Video Video Why is Ryan Goslings new film being panned by critics at Cannes? Shot in black-and-white to suggest a Depression-era view of the American heartland the story begins in Billings Mont. where David a sad-sack bachelor and home-theatre salesman gets a call after his dad is picked up by the police walking on the highway.What follows is a road trip ending up as a small-town family reunion where the possible imminent millionaire becomes everyones friend or target.Some of the comedy (echoing Preston Sturgess Hail the Conquering Hero) is oversilly but theres a poignant suggestion of a modern-day Don Quixote and Sancho Panza and it works in a thoughtfully wrought film that feels more built to last than Paynes last feature The Descendants.

As much as I love Election his 1999 breakthrough film the Payne movie that really kicked off the Payne format was About Schmidt (2002). The leisurely semi-planted version of the road-trip structure; the classically framed images of a falling-down American middle class that Hollywood is no longer in touch with and no longer knows how to show us; the earnest damaged heroes with their family ties and family demons; the arcs that are built not out of screenwriting-class ""story points"" but rather out of experience - arcs that serve as emotional bridges from one state of being to another. Not every Payne film conforms to every one of these traits (The Descendants wasnt a road movie - though Id argue it was a road movie of the spirit) but Payne Land is still by now a familiar and even cozy place with its own off-kilter humor and skewed knuckleball humanity. All of which makes Nebraska which premiered today at Cannes a whimsical minor addition to the Payne canon. The movie is shot in black-and-white and set mostly in Hawthorne Nebraska an economically crumbling small town (population 1300) and the images - of highways and farms of streets with shuttered stores of tacky night-glowing bars and even tackier homes - are I must say breathtaking in a clean spare way. If youre going to shoot a movie in black-and-white (a surefire commercial detriment according to the current thinking) then youd better believe this is the way to do it by making the images look like Ansel Adams collaborated with Diane Arbus and Edward Hopper. Within those stately austere frames Payne tells the story of David Grant (played by Will Forte of Saturday Night Live) a genial loser of a stereo salesman who still lives in his hometown of Billings Montana; and also his father Woody (Bruce Dern) a softly grizzled old coot with flyaway white hair who we meet in the opening scene as he wanders down a highway like some homeless bumpkin. Is he suffering from dementia? Possibly the earliest signs of it but really Woodys problem is that hes a frail dejected emotionally disconnected geezer who has spent his life pickling his brain in alcohol. He lives in a self-centered fog of his own devising. The reason hes wandering down that highway is that he thinks hes won a million dollars In the mail he received one of those Mega Sweepstakes Marketing ""prizes"" (which are really just gimmicks to sell magazine subscriptions) and since he isnt allowed to drive he has decided to walk all the way from Billings to Lincoln Nebraska where the Sweepstakes office is in order to claim his million. (""It says I won"") David who along with his TV-news-reporter brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) realizes that it might be getting time for Dad to go into a nursing home decides to deal with the situation by driving Woody to Lincoln in order to get the prize-money fantasy out of his system. Along the way they stop in Hawthorne where Woody grew up and they end up stuck there for the weekend. They visit Woodys brothers they visit the old farmhouse where he grew up (its still there but now abandoned) and they run into Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) the nasty blowhard he once owned a garage with. Woody is old and pretty much everyone they meet is old. The movie is Paynes offhanded ""salute"" to all the anonymous aging Americans who sit around in cramped living rooms watching TV with nothing much on their minds but the past. Is Payne working from a script by Bob Nelson mocking these people? Or does he have affection for them? Well both. And probably more affection than mockery. You could argue that theres an ever-so-slightly patronizing heres-what-the-humdrum-little-peoples-lives-are-like attitude running through Nebraska but really the true limitation of the movie is that Woody though Dern plays him with pitch-perfect trembly frail befuddlement is not a major Payne character. Neither is Fortes David. The comedian who doesnt have one laugh line in the movie is used for his airy regular-guy facade and he doesnt give a bad performance but we never learn all that much about David. Hes a decent chap who basically spends the entire film doing damage control for his inept cantankerous father. For a while everyone in Hawthorne thinks that Woody really has won a million dollars - a Preston Sturges joke that in this case speaks to a small-town culture on the skids. Over the course of a few days David learns a lot about Woody filling in the gaps of his existence that Woody himself was too indifferent or depressed to fill in for him. And whats genuinely touching about the movie is this It allows you to glimpse the powerful entirety of even the most ordinary life. After a while Woodys wife shows up and in her quarrelsome way shes kind of a wacky character (I mean that in both good and bad ways) a Catholic whos fixated on gossip and the behavior of ""sluts."" June Squibb who plays her has a great Midwestern-mom look and we realize that its her Kate who has really held their lives together. Nebraska is a nice movie and it goes through its paces in that patented Alexander Payne mode of acerbically touching homespun quirkiness. But when I just wrote that sentence at least a part of me was tempted to replace the word ""mode"" with ""formula.""     Heres a trivia question What are the only two movies in history to win the Palme dOr at Cannes and Best Picture at the Academy Awards? Drum roll please....the two films are The Lost Weekend (1945) and Marty (1955). Its been a long time hasnt it? And I dont expect that this year is going to break that pattern. What strikes me though looking over my roster of what I would call the years likeliest Palme dOr contenders is that theres a fascinating overlap right now in Cannes/Hollywood awards potential. My personal favorite film of the festival - and it shocks me a little to say this - is Behind the Candelabra Steven Soderberghs wickedly fun and dark and moving Liberace-in-love biopic. Its not just me either The film has provoked such a tremendous response here that though its not even going to play in American movie theaters (it premieres on HBO this Sunday May 26 at 900 p.m.) I think it has an honest shot at winning the Palme dOr. That said the fact that it is a made-for-television movie will not help its chances. What Im now absolutely convinced of is that if a major movie studio had backed Behind the Candelabra and had released it as an outre prestige film during awards season it could have gotten a slew of Oscar nominations with Michael Douglas and Matt Damon each having a good chance to win. As it stands I predict that the film will be recognized in some fashion by the Cannes jury. (It will also clean up at the Emmys and the Golden Globes.) That leaves in my view two other key contenders for the Palme dOr. They are The Past the Iranian director Asghar Farhadis masterful follow-up to A Separation and Inside Llewyn Davis the Coen brothers playfully cynical early-60s New York folk-music fable a movie that a lot of people here loved more than I did. Which is not to say that I dismiss it Its supremely well-crafted with tasty touches throughout and so amazingly shot that its spare burnished images of Greenwich Village in 1961 imprint themselves on your imagination. The Coen brothers havent won the Palme dOr since Barton Fink - thats right Barton Fink - won in 1991. I could easily see them winning this year. And once again if they do there will be major Cannes/Hollywood synergy since I think that Inside Llewyn Davis is going to be a multiple-category Oscar contender. The movie could win...but I dont think it will. With as powerful a figure as Steven Spielberg heading the Cannes jury this year attempting to predict what the jury is going to do by trying to guess what Spielberg would do seems to me to be all to the point. (Thats not always the case. But the head of the jury does have notorious sway here. Its a France/hierarchical/ political thing.) My hunch is that Spielberg will go for The Past - that he will not only want to salute what a brilliant and humane filmmaker Asghar Farhadi is but that theres something about the way Farhadis films work that will strike a special chord in Spielberg. Farhadi makes neorealist domestic dramas that are also in their intimate way thrillers. He draws on and extends traditions of cinema from Kiarostami to Renoir to Hitchcock that reach back nearly a century. World cinema if you travel to enough film festivals is on some level thriving but it is not necessarily thriving in a populist way. As relatively young as his career may be it would feel right this year for Asghar Farhadi to be indoctrinated into the pantheon of Cannes auteurs. And thats why with admittedly two more days of the festival to go (who knows what will be shown?) I predict that The Past will take the Palme dOr.

After making side trips to Californias Central Coast and Hawaii (for ""Sideways"" and ""The Descendants"" respectively) Alexander Payne returns to his home state of Nebraska for his sixth directorial feature a wistful ode to small-town Midwestern life and the quixotic dreams of stubborn old men. Sporting a career-crowning performance by Bruce Dern and a thoroughly impressive dramatic turn by ""SNL""/""30 Rock"" alum Will Forte Paynes first film based on another writers original screenplay (by debut feature scribe Bob Nelson) nevertheless fits nicely alongside his other low-concept finely etched studies of flawed characters stuck in lifes well-worn grooves. Black-and-white lensing and lack of a Clooney-sized star portend less than ""Descendants""-sized business but critical hosannas and awards buzz should mean solid prestige success for this November Paramount release.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Just as ""The Last Picture Show"" was a movie made in the 1970s about the end of 50s-era innocence ""Nebraska"" feels despite its present-day setting like a eulogy for a bygone America (and American cinema) from the casting of New Hollywood fixtures Dern and Stacy Keach to its many windswept vistas of a vital agro-industrial heartland outsourced into irrelevance. First seen trudging alone along a busy stretch of Montana highway Derns Woody Grant is a man who like his surroundings seems to have outlived his usefulness an ornery alcoholic whose bouts of confusion have put a strain on his marriage to Kate (""About Schmidts"" June Squibb) and caused sons David (Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) to worry that he might be losing his mind. Offering further evidence to support this claim Woody has become convinced hes won 1 million in a Publishers Clearing House-like sweepstakes -- a prize he insists on collecting in person at the companys HQ in Lincoln Neb. Though more levelheaded parties insist that the money is bogus Woody cannot be deterred. Asked what hell do with his ""winnings"" he announces his intention to buy a new truck -- even though he can no longer drive -- and a new air compressor (to replace one he loaned to a friend 40 years ago). But like the childrens playground commissioned by the dying bureaucrat in Kurosawas ""Ikiru"" or the interstate tractor journey undertaken by the Iowa farmer of David Lynchs ""The Straight Story"" Woodys quest is really a last valedictory gesture designed to give meaning to a life. So David reluctantly agrees to take Dad on the road as much out of pity as to escape his own broken-down situation working a dead-end retail job and recently dumped by his live-in girlfriend. What follows is like many of Paynes films a road movie of sorts winding its way through Wyoming and South Dakota slate-colored skies hanging over pastureland and lonely blacktop last-stop diners standing on the edge of nowhere. The widescreen monochrome imagery shot by Paynes longtime d.p. Phedon Papamichael is at once ravishing and melancholy evoking both Robert Surtees ""Picture Show"" lensing and a host of iconic American still photography (Walker Evans Dorothea Lange et al.) without calling undue attention to itself. Eventually father and son make a pit stop in Woodys hometown of Hawthorne (actually Norfolk Neb.) where it doesnt take long for the incipient millionaire to become headline news like the ersatz war hero (also named Woody) at the center of Preston Sturges ""Hail the Conquering Hero."" Nor does Woody seem to mind the attention even as it brings all manner of moocher out of the woodwork including more than a few family members and a former business partner (the coy flinty Keach) with an old score to settle. Everyone it seems wants -- or perhaps needs -- to believe in Woodys dream as much as he does. Throughout Payne gently infuses the films comic tone with strains of longing and regret always careful to avoid the maudlin or cheaply sentimental. (A couple of nincompoop nephews played by Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray rep the pics only real concession to slapstick.) In a series of lovely understated scenes David finds himself learning secondhand about the taciturn father he has never really known meeting an ex-flame (Angela McEwan) who competed with his mother for Woodys affections hearing rumors of a possible extramarital affair gleaning details about Woodys service in the Korean War. Finally rejoined by Kate and Ross for the final leg of the journey the entire family visits the farmhouse where Woody grew up now a decrepit mausoleum of farm-belt prosperity. The closer the characters get to Lincoln the more they appear to be receding into the past culminating in one magnificent sequence that equates a drive down a small main street with the span of an entire life lived. Dern is simply marvelous in a role the director reportedly first offered to Gene Hackman but which is all the richer for being played by someone who was never as big of a star. Looking suitably disheveled and sometimes dazed he conveys the full measure of a man who has fallen short of his own expectations resisting the temptation to overplay letting his wonderfully weathered face course with subtle shades of sorrow self-loathing and indignation. Given the less innately attention-getting role (a la Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man"") Forte does similarly nuanced work his scenes with Dern resonating with the major and minor grievances that lie unresolved between parents and children. Had Payne not already used it ""The Descendants"" would have been an equally apt title here so acute is the films sense of the virtues and vices passed down from one generation to the next. Keach and Squibb (bumped off early in ""About Schmidt"" getting to go the full distance here) also stand out in a resolutely un-starry cast full of convincingly ordinary plainspoken Midwesterners. In addition to Papamichaels camerawork the plaintive guitar-and-fiddle score by Mark Orton is another craft standout.

Reply Carolyn says May 23 2013 at 800 pm Woodys hometown ""Hawthorne"" is actually in Plainview Nebraska-not Norfolk. I cant wait to see this film Reply Sherry says May 24 2013 at 732 pm Thank You Carolyn for the correction. Plainview Nebraska has not gotten much publicity. Alot of people are giving the publicity to Norfolk probably because that it where they were stationed while they were in the area.

TWITTER Alexander Paynes in competition black-and-white film follows a father and son on a road trip to Lincoln Nebraska. A strong sense of a vanishing past holds sway over an illusory future in Nebraska Alexander Paynes wryly poignant and potent comic drama about the bereft state of things in Americas oft-vaunted heartland. Echoing the directors most recent film The Descendants in its preoccupation with generational issues within families how the smell of money contaminates the behavior of friends and relatives and the way Wasps hide and disclose secrets this is nonetheless a more melancholy less boisterous work. Its also defined commercially by the difference between a colorful Hawaii-set comedy starring George Clooney and a black-and-white prairie-based old-age odyssey featuring a straggly and unkempt Bruce Dern. All the same Paramount Vantage should be able to ride accolades for this very fine Cannes competition entry to respectable specialized returns in fall release. PHOTOS Cannes Competition Lineup Features Behind the Candelabra Only God Forgives Nebraska ""I dont remember it doesnt matter"" largely sums up the attitude toward the events of his life by old Woody Grant (Dern) a cranky bedraggled partially senile coot first seen walking on a highway near home in Billings Mont. His younger son David (Will Forte) wishes his father would be a bit more communicative as hed like a closer relationship but only his mother Kate (June Squibb) will talk about the old days and then only in the most derogatory terms about her ""useless"" husband and just about everyone else. Woodys hit the road because of a sweepstakes eligibility certificate he received in the mail that he imagines entitles him to a million-dollar windfall. No matter how plainly June and David explain that its a scam nothing will dissuade Woody from walking if need be the 850 miles to Lincoln Neb. the source of the deceptive document to collect. Conceding that his old man ""just needs something to live for"" beleaguered David takes off work to drive him there just for the personal time it will give them. But while the ostensible focus of Bob Nelsons original screenplay (the first for a Payne film the director did not officially have a hand in writing himself) is the father-son road trip nearly all the peripheral characters that come into the picture develop motives related to expectations that Woody has come into mighty big bucks. STORY Paramount Sets Release Date for Alexander Paynes Nebraska Befitting its Paramount heritage there is a muted Preston Sturges element to the films view of the human condition in the way the populaces heads are completely turned by the presence of celebrity which the confused Woody now represents and a possible financial windfall. Two of Sturges classics Hail the Conquering Hero and The Miracle of Morgans Creek turned on very similar premises. Part of the issue is that there isnt that much else to talk about. After brief stops at Mount Rushmore which Woody disdains because it ""doesnt look finished"" and a goofy interlude spent looking for his missing false teeth along some railway tracks the two men stop for an impromptu family reunion in (fictional) Hawthorne Neb. to visit Woodys brother Ray (Rance Howard) and his family. Joined by Kate and Davids older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) the clan mostly sits around and watches TV; Rays overweight sons (Tim Driscoll Devin Ratray) are immature layabouts who like the older men who come over mostly talk about cars. While Payne tries to walk a fine line between honest representation and satiric caricature the result is a pretty caustic group portrait of men who whatever they may be feeling inside are utterly undisposed to talk about it representing one colossal failure to communicate that feels like a genetic male trait. It falls therefore to the women to address the existence of an inner life not only about themselves but about the men who refuse self-reflection. Kate is utterly uncensored in her running commentaries about long-ago sexual shenanigans. But it is the odd women David meets around the tiny forlorn town notably a wonderful old soul at the town newspaper office (beautifully played by Angela McEwan) who disclose private information that opens a window on Woodys life the son would otherwise never know. Then there is Woodys long-ago business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach). Each man claims the other owes him something but now that hes convinced Woody is loaded Ed becomes threatening. Then all the relatives pile on resulting in a group portrait of greed and mooching that is none too pretty. VIDEO Live From Cannes Todd McCarthys Favorite Films So Far The emptied-out look of Hawthorne makes it resemble the town in The Last Picture Show but without the teenagers; there are only old people here in the saloons and the streets and other key settings -- the cemetery the newspaper morgue the dilapidated farmhouse Woody grew up in and his father built -- quietly contribute to the feel of time and opportunity having passed by. In this light Paynes insistence on shooting in black-and-white -- not an easy argument to win at a studio these days -- enriches the film artistically; the story is set in a world that still both in the cinematic and collective memory exists in black-and-white. Its stuck like the leading characters with decisions made decades ago and that is still defined by the past and a diminishing number of survivors. At times in his career Dern has played characters as half-loonies when it wasnt necessarily called for. Here portraying a man well on his way to being checked out he underplays without a trace of neurosis or mannerism. Woody is a man who will give starts of recognition to anyone who has had parents or grandparents of diminishing abilities and Dern and Payne keep him interesting by providing flashes of consciousness discernible behind his general inscrutability. The performance is like a window blind thats mostly closed but can momentarily flip open to reveal whats in the room. Forte nicely underplays an incipient sad sack who would dearly like to enrich an uneventful life by learning more about his father but can only do so indirectly while Squibb gets the most laughs by virtue of her colorful litany of complaints. Keach applies fine contours to his role of an old man all too alive to what he considers unfinished business. Great care is evident in casting down to the smallest bit player. Phedon Papamichaels handsome monochromatic cinematography is neither ostentatious nor overly gritty just forthright and elegantly composed while Mark Ortons lovely score which often employs just a guitar in combination with an array of individual second instruments provides a constant source of pleasure.

Usually you need a Halkanian ion storm to get there but one piece of it showed up on the Mediterranean coast during the Cannes Film Festival. Alexander Paynes ""Nebraska"" is fundamentally a reverso-version of David Lynchs ""The Straight Story."" A man toward the end of his life takes a quixotic journey through the central United States. Only this time hes kind of an asshole. Bruce Dern stars as Nick Nolte - no thats not it hold on. Ah Bruce Dern stars as Billings Montanas Woody Grant. An angry (mostly) functional alcoholic no longer able to drive whose main focus in life is to make his wife Kate (June Squibb) miserable. The recipient of one of those Publishers Clearing House letters Woody is convinced theres a million dollar prize waiting for him. Unwilling to claim it through the mail he insists on traveling to Lincoln Nebraska the source of the letter. No amount of saying ""this is just some scam"" will deter him. Not from Kate not from his back-up newscaster son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) or from his younger son the melancholy consumer electronics salesman David (Will Forte.) Despite Woodys nasty demeanor David has enough sympathy to take him on a car trip to Lincoln just to shut him up (and to keep him from getting picked up from cops each time he just gets up and starts walking there.) Or maybe its that David recognizes theres some healing that needs to be done before his father dies - an event that will probably come soon the way Woody treats himself. Davids girlfriend of two years recently moved out and her plea to ""get married or break up or both - lets just do something"" seems to have hit home. An accident along the way derails them a few hours outside of Lincoln not too far from (surprise) the town where Woody and Kate come from. Thats where all their miserable family members and old friends sit around and stare at the television and drink beer and live a life that is drab ugly and meaningless. Kate (and later Ross) come to visit by bus and a trip to the cemetery is among the films highlights. Shes what youd call ""a pistol"" - eager to share secrets and speak frankly about sexuality but is fundamentally not a very nice person. Neither is Woodys old business partner (a terrific Stacey Keach) or any of the relatives - especially when word of Woodys incoming million dollar prize starts to spread. It takes this little trip (and some audience-pleasing hijinks similar to a naked Thomas Haden Church in Paynes ""Sideways"") to get the nuclear family in a car and laughing together again. It is to ""Nebraska""s credit however that these band-aids are never meant to imply old deep wounds are even slightly healed. ""You big idiot"" is the most tender thing Kate will ever sat to Woody. Furthermore Dern plays Woody inscrutably; just cant tell knows whats going on or not. His noncommittal grunts imply that hes reached full-on dementia but then hell lay in with a joke showing that he may be in full control. ""Nebraska"" is a sad film shot in striking black amp; white and it pulls no punches in showing how gross the deteriorated main streets of Americas heartland have become in a rough economy. Payne is darn-near ethnographic in his insistence of casting ""real looking people."" Daves on-the-rocks girlfriend appearing sympathetically in just one scene is by movies standards practically a Medusa. In actuality shes representative of 99% of the world - its just that were not used to seeing people like that in movies. Alexander Paynes first four films - ""Citizen Ruth"" ""Election"" ""About Schmit"" and ""Sideways"" - are all pretty stinking good and they were all co-written by a fella named Jim Taylor. ""The Descendants"" was a step down but still good. Taylor was a producer but is not credited on the script. ""Nebraska"" doesnt have Taylors name anywhere on it. What am I getting at? Well ""Nebraska"" still has much merit but for Payne it is a little underwhelming. (For what its worth though Taylors other work includes ""We Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry"" so this is definitely a two-way partnership.) Its not just that this is a small film it is a slight film and a little hard to fully embrace. Theres an essence of falseness around the characters and the scenario and the lack of full-throated bite holds it back from being harsh satire. There are some laughs - and a few moments worthy of tears - but theres a breaking point of believability in here somewhere that keeps ""Nebraska"" merely good as opposed to great.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Cannes Film Festival Nebraska Alexander Paynes America Plains and Simple In this family satire the directors home region is a weird place but you wouldnt want to live there By Richard Corliss May 23 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Paramount Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Europeans created America by landing on the East Coast and moving West in the process confecting the nations near-Biblical legend of Manifest Destiny. (Sorry Indians.) That hope (or illusion) nourished our indigenous art forms the picaresque novel and its cinematic equivalent the road movie. The directors of the Cannes Film Festival must also be smitten with the genre. Last year they invited three films about young people traveling toward some tantalizing other place Moonrise Kingdom Cosmopolis and the movie version of Jack Kerouacs On the Road. The same wanderlust is examined in a trio of American films here this year. The Coen brothers Inside Llewyn Davis focused on a young urban folk singer hoping to get a big gig in Chicago. In James Francos adaptation of the William Faulkner novel As I Lay Dying the patriarch of a backwoods Mississippi brood insists that they haul his late wifes corpse to another town for burial. This evening we get Alexander Paynes Nebraska the new film from the director of Election Sideways and The Descendants. A minor work with some incidental pleasures Nebraska plays a more comic but no less acerbic variation on Faulkners theme of obsessive fathers family members bound and imprisoned by blood and the millions of also-rans seduced by the American Dream. (READ The Cannes reviews of Inside Llewyn Davis and As I Lay Dying) In Bob Nelsons original screenplay old Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) sinking into senility is convinced that a million dollars awaits him in a magazine-subscription promotion if only he can get from his Billings Montana home to the sweepstakes companys headquarters in Lincoln Nebraska. Driving him there with a few nostalgic stops is his dutiful son David (Will Forte) soon joined by his brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and their mother Kate (June Squibb). On the way father and son stop in their former hometown of Hawthorne where Woody tells his old friends of his imminent good fortune. That cues a greed spree of locals eager to collect their share of the loot -- a miniature chimerical replay of the actual hundreds of millions at sake in The Descendants Hawaiian land deal. The Grant clan is a mess -- has been for decades. That Woody needs medical supervision is as plain as the hairs in the nose on his face. A dedicated alcoholic with no drivers license he goes wandering on foot down a Billings highway headed for Lincoln. That doesnt stop him from roping David into a bar where he insists ""Beer aint drinkin"" and adds with an Oedipal chill that he may not have unintended ""Youd drink too if you were married to your mother."" (READ Corlisss review of Alexander Paynes The Descendants) Kate whos put up with this coot for a half-century and is eager to send Woody to a home has an explanation for his belligerence ""His mother spoiled him."" (Woody is like 80.) Ross has fled family responsibilities for modest success as a substitute anchor on a Billings TV news show. David who sells electrical appliances and qualifies as the familys token decent person shares little with Woody including the old mans outsize fantasies. Davids wan hope is to reconnect with his overweight under-beautiful girlfriend. Even thats a long shot. A Cornhusker born and bred Payne set his first three films -- Citizen Ruth Election and About Schmidt -- in his native state. To those living in Montana Nebraska must be Xanadu so devoutly does Woody believe in its financial and emotional restorative powers. Like the Coen brothers Fargo set in Minnesota this is a movie whose denizens think that the land of opportunity is anywhere else. (READ Richard Schickel on Alexander Paynes About Schmidt) You have to wonder though whether either Montanas or Nebraskans would warm to Paynes group portrait which veers between social satire and deadpan contempt. Released in black-and-white the film suggests that the region is too poor or the inhabitants too dour to be shown in color. (No one is likely to scan the miles of flat lands and exclaim ""What beautiful scenery) Except for Woodys old Hawthorne buddy Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) whose honeyed voice conceals a vindictive sting virtually all of the men are stolid mean of spirt and near-mute eight of them sit in a parlor wordlessly watching a baseball game as if auditioning for a reality show based on Grant Woods American Gothic. Theres little heart in Paynes heartland. The annoyance quotient rises with the scripts insistence on the million-dollar sweepstakes coupon. Woody may believe hes a winner but anyone over 40 knows that the small print requires a lucky number on your ticket. To clear up the misunderstanding in a trice -- David would need to speak only two words Ed McMahon. (READ Joel Steins profile of Alexander Payne) Look in the corners of this corrosive fresco and find some tangy supporting performances. Some last only a second like the appliance-store browser who corrects Davids pronunciation of her name not Janice but ""Janeece."" When Davids uncle says that his son Cole did some time in jail Cole (Devin Ratray) spits out ""Bitch lied through her teeth."" The sweetest most acute work is by Angela McEwan as Peg an old girlfriend of Woodys and the wisest soul in two states. She and Woody broke up she tells David because ""I wouldnt let him round the bases."" Squibb is excellent as the serpent-toothed wife of a ""useless"" man she is still ready to defend agains scavengers. And Dern gives good value as a fading senior whose sin and strength are that he refuses to accept his weakness. Theres no need for Forte the viewers designated surrogate to italicize the exasperation David feels for his father. We feel it too. But Forte overplays the underplaying shoulder slumps sidelong glances hangdog mortification. If a drinking game required you to empty a shot glass every time Forte expelled a mournful sigh by the end of the film youd be drunker than Woody ever was. (FIND Alexander Paynes Election on TIMEs Top 10 Movies of 1999) We dont doubt that Alexander Payne and Bob Nelson know the people they put in the movie. To get a more lyrical sense of the state youll need to consult a Jersey boy and listen again to the Bruce Springsteen album Nebraska.

Share Tweet 0 Shares By Keith Uhlich Posted Wednesday May 22 2013 NebraskaFor the most part I found Alexander Paynes American heartland drama Nebraska a rank exercise in hicksploitation sentimentalism. Its almost always a crapshoot whether the filmmakers self-consciously low-key aesthetic will play with pointed insight or freakish repellence; even in one of his best works the Hawaii-set The Descendants Payne cant resist reducing wronged woman Judy Greer to a hysteria-prone punchline. Sad to say that his worst instincts win out here.RECOMMENDED Full coverage of the Cannes Film FestivalNebraska feels off from the start right from the appearance of the old-time Paramount logo that several current directors have used to signify their nostalgic love for 1970s American cinema and implied disdain for the present. (The golden-years affect has long gotten old and artists should really stop feeling embarrassed about making movies for their own time.) Furthering the those-were-the-days noxiousness is Phedon Papamichaels black-and-white cinematography reportedly post-converted from color which has all the textural quality of curdled milk as well as the presence of 70s character actor du jour Bruce Dern as the films Alzheimers afflicted protagonist Woody Grant. Montana-residing Woody is so convinced hes won a million dollars in one of those scam mail-in sweepstakes that he often wanders off on his own in an attempt to collect the prize. His son David (Will Forte just terrible) is always called in to pick up Dad on the side of the road or at the police station. Frustrated with this predictable cycle as well as with his own static life David decides to take Pop on a road trip to the sweepstakes headquarters in Nebraska. A minor accident along the way diverts the duo to Woodys old hometown where they stay with some officious money-grubbing relatives and confront a few lingering issues from the past. Theres no shortage of slack-jawed yokel stereotyping in Nebraska (Payne takes great delight in portraying a Sunday family dinner strictly divided along women-in-the-kitchen and men-watching-football gender lines). But I dont think thats the real problem since plenty of movies--David Lynchs The Straight Story is an especially apt point of comparison--have used exaggeration to unearth profound truths about regional communities that are not often portrayed on cinema screens. Payne knows this location well--he was born and still has family in Nebraska--and the characters are clearly drawn from experience. (June Squibb is sure to be singled out for supporting actor accolades as Woodys speaks-her-mind spouse Kate.) What rankles is the abyssal and abysmal disconnect between the filmmakers apparent understanding of his subject and how he executes that vision onscreen. It mostly comes down to an unharmonious mix of lowest common denominator satire and treacly emotionalism. Payne will follow one such track for a tedious while--such as a grating cemetery sequence in which the saucy Kate criticizes a number of dead acquaintances before flashing her nether-regions at an old flames headstone--then grindingly switch gears into sickly-sweet heartstring-plucking territory. I hope to see no scene this year as off-puttingly pleased with its own bathos as Woody and Davids climactic reconciliatory truck ride down main street. Neither tone meshes well with the other (its like watching two different films one composed of sugar the other of arsenic blended coarsely together). Plus theres a special place in hell reserved for Mark Ortons maudlin score which obsequiously indicates every emotion youre supposed to feel even as it sticks in your head with its inane elevator-muzak repetitiveness. Payne can only go up from this misfire. One hopes. A few quick words on another regional effort Johnnie Tos Blind Detective far from being the martial-arts ass-kicker promised by its marketing is actually a broader-than-broad comedy about a retinally-damaged cop (Andy Lau) who teams up with a policewoman (Sammi Cheng) to help solve a few cold cases one of them very personal. Its screechy nails-on-blackboard tone is clearly pitched at a Hong Kong audience and if the stone-cold reactions that greeted the film at my screening are any indication its unlikely to find its way stateside beyond a few niche fests.Theres still something fascinating about the relentlessness of the humor which manages to make light of murder cannibalism and oversexed grandmas among other wild targets. It also helps that To treats the proceedings like a master-goofing-off lark and that Lau and Cheng have an alternately aggravating and ingratiating chemistry that suggests Nick and Nora Charles as played by Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. A Looney time alright.

I thought I was the only one who thinks this film is thin from every angle. The photography the score the dialog the sickly digital black and white (check out A Field in England--budget digital converted to BW can be vivid and exciting and experimental).
