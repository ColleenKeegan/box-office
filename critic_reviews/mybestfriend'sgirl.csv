Comments My Best Friends Girl Dane Cook stars as a major-league asshole who specializes in mending other peoples relationships jilted boyfriends hire him to date their exes and repel the women back into their former lovers arms. His lucrative business is threatened however when he meets his roommates brassy self-centered ex (Kate Hudson) whose immunity to Cooks antics proves irresistible to him. Cook does some surprisingly good work bringing a darker and more malevolent undercurrent to his character than the script might have suggested. Theres something genuinely transgressive beneath the movies rom-com surface though director Howard Deutch keeps retreating to the safety of frat-boy humor. R 101 min.

"Girl wastes Hudson and local setting - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Girl wastes Hudson and local setting Kate Hudson and Dane Cook in My Best Friends Girl which was filmed in Boston. (claire folger/lionsgate) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / September 20 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The inexplicable romantic comedy career of Dane Cook marches on. In Kate Hudson Cook appears to have found a woman who can both withstand his obnoxiousness and sometimes surpass it. The occasion is ""My Best Friends Girl"" another of Cooks gimmicky vehicles that probably couldnt score the free 200 points on the SAT. In ""Good Luck Chuck"" he was a charm that got women married. Now men hire him to be such a heathen on dates with the women theyve wronged that his crassness makes them seem princely. Cooks roommate (Jason Biggs) is obsessed with Hudson and hires him to work his magic. Naturally he falls in love and what took most episodes of ""Friends"" 22 minutes to resolve here requires about an hour and 40.Theres a cheap thrill in watching Hudson defuse Cooks pig antics with some foulness of her own. I dont know for instance how far it advances the cause of women at the movies to enjoy watching Hudson shout along to one of 2 Live Crews skank odes. But I laughed while she rapped dirty mostly out of surprise. I used to think Hudson was above such crummy faux-romantic eyesores but thats how shes paying her cable bill these days - ""You Me and Dupree"" ""Fools Gold"" now this another movie that looks like it was made by no one who cared.In fact Howard Deutch made it. A veteran of canceled shows and pitiful sequels whose originals he didnt direct (""The Odd Couple II"" say) Deutch is a master of seeming as though hes never made a movie before. His first film was ""Pretty in Pink"" so many semesters ago. And before ""My Best Friends Girl"" it was ""The Whole Ten Yards.""Its worth noting that Deutch shot this movie in Boston and what the film lacks in actual Bostonians aside from Cook it makes up with gratuitous helicopter shots above Back Bay and the South End - more Google Earth than cinema. But if the movie doesnt work as romantic comedy (Jordan Cahans script seems like it was written with some buddies to cope with the tedium of their Fantasy Football draft) it succeeds in making this city seem like the last place youd want to have sex.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The movie is raunchier than expected and above all cliched formulaic and thoroughly sexist. Worst its just not very funny. In fact its pretty much nothing but bad. The only real laughs involve Biggs and an eyebrow-shaving scene thats more slapstick than clever. There is not a remotely sympathetic character in the mix. Biggs seems like a whiny loser. Hudson has none of her trademark charm and Cook has yet to display anything resembling charm in any of his movies. Playing a caddish womanizer isnt really his thing. Yes this Lothario is a loutish boor and Cooks limited talents work fine for that facet of the role but he doesnt have the requisite suave sex appeal to make his luck with the ladies believable. Its a part that might have been played decently by a younger Ryan Reynolds. Cook just goes overboard with the obnoxious aspects and its mystifying what the rather refined character Hudson plays would see in him. But somehow she falls for him no doubt because it says so in the script. His womanizing ways have led to a part-time career in fixing break-ups. The plan is simple One date with him and his disgusting irritating habits and women go running back to the guy they dumped. The assumption that women are this stupid is bad enough but none of it generates a laugh which is the biggest sin for a movie billed as a comedy. It borrows from much funnier movies such as Hitch Wedding Crashers and My Best Friends Wedding. Never has a romantic comedy seemed less romantic or less comedic. In fact this should kick off a new genre repugnant comedies. Cooks character is appropriately named Tank. If there were any justice in the movie world thats exactly what this movie would do.

The raunch-to-romance ratio isnt up to Judd Apatow level -- the current gold standard for R-rated romantic comedies -- and the third act bespeaks much second-guessing and waffling on the part of everyone involved. Still despite bowing on the low end of expectations with some 8 million ""My Best Friends Girl"" has plenty of down-and-dirty laughs and should have a long shelf life as homevideo fare. The inevitable ""unrated directors cut"" should sell especially well even though its difficult to imagine how it could be more foul-mouthed than the current theatrical version. Top-billed comic-turned-actor Dane Cook is almost too credible for comfort in the lead role of Tank a customer-service telerep who moonlights as ""an asshole"" -- his own self-description -- for fun and profit. In the world according to scribe Jordan Cahan any fellow whos dumped by his girlfriend can win her back simply by paying Tank to treat her to the worst date of her life. One night out with the purposefully obnoxious and sexually aggressive lout and the g.f. will run back to the guy she left behind. Tank is so adept at this that his services are sought by Dustin (Jason Biggs) his roomie and best friend. Hopelessly smitten with Alexis (Kate Hudson) a beautiful co-worker Dustin proposes to her barely five weeks into their relationship. But Alexis isnt ready to proceed so quickly so she rebuffs his overeager overtures and Dustin calls Tank. Complications arise however as Alexis -- actively encouraged by her randy roommate Ami (Lizzy Caplan) -- realizes that at this particular point in her relatively unexciting life what she really wants isnt Mr. Right but Mr. Right Now. That is a stud muffin who makes booty calls without demanding commitments. Which of course makes Tank the wrong man in the right place at the right time. Not surprisingly Tank heretofore a swaggering sexual buccaneer quickly evolves into a reluctantly lovestruck suitor when the tables are turned on him. For an impressively long stretch though director Howard Deutch (who took a considerably more demure approach to romance way back when he helmed ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and ""Pretty in Pink"") manages to distract auds from the predictability of the plot with fusillades of profanely funny dialogue and some playfully sexy chemistry generated by Cook and Hudson. It also helps that Alec Baldwin gleefully steals scenes right and left as Tanks father a middle-aged unapologetically sybaritic college professor who feigns feminist attitudes to score with women of all ages. (""Guilt"" father warns son ""is just one more thing trying to asphyxiate us while were having sex."") Somewhere around the two-thirds mark however ""My Best Friends Girl"" starts to cloud over with an air of indecision suggesting the filmmakers were torn between the commercial imperative of providing an upbeat resolution and a near-uncontrollable urge to go for broke with a cynical (but more dramatically plausible) conclusion. Final scene feels like a tacked-on compromise that may have been added after unsuccessful preview screenings. Cook is most amusing while emphasizing his sardonic edginess a trait that may eventually serve him well in some anti-heroic (or downright villainous) dramatic role. Better still he establishes an effectively fluid give-and-take with Hudson enabling her to strike an attractive balance of comedy and carnality. Drab lensing of Boston locations is a minor annoyance throughout.

"My Best Friends Girl | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; my-best-friend-s-girl ) My Best Friends Girl (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Romantic comedies are fantasies. They invite us to fall in love with the main characters as they fall in love with each other. Thats difficult to accomplish when viewers find themselves actively disliking those characters. How is it possible to succumb to the fantasy when its participants are sleazy creepy or bitchy? With My Best Friends Girl director Howard Deutch has the beginnings of an excellent anti-romantic comedy unlikeable characters betrayals and a general desire to see everyone die in a nuclear holocaust. For a while My Best Friends Girl seems to be going in the direction of a full-on black comedy where the words ""ever after"" are spoken only in reference to the phrase ""praying for the end of time"" (with apologies to Meat Loaf). Alas around the halfway point the film takes a 180-degree turn and tries to follow the formula reforming the selfish protagonist and proving that true love conquers all. The problem? We still hate the characters and the happy ending feels as much like a cheat as any I have seen all year. The premise immediately puts the film on shaky ground - not because its inherently bad but because it is poorly executed. Tank (Dane Cook) is the biggest asshole in the world - or at least thats what he wants everyone to think. His hobby is visiting ""emotional terrorism"" on women so theyll fly back into the arms of their ex-boyfriends. His tactic set up a ""meet cute"" get the woman to like him then take her on the date from hell. At evenings end shell be so horrified by the sharks in the dating pool that shell flee back to the safe harbor of her exs arms. Tank is well known as being the best in the business and he owes it all to his superficial selfish womanizing father (Alec Baldwin). Tanks roommate Dustin (Jason Biggs) is a ""nice guy"" whos stuck in a ""just want to be friends"" relationship with a co-worker Alexis (Kate Hudson). Dustin hires Tank to work his magic on Alexis so shell realize what a great deal a romantic relationship with Dustin would be. But when Alexis goes out with Tank shes looking for Tanks specialty - the one-night stand - and doesnt care if hes a jerk. This of course throws him off his game and he finds himself trapped in his own web falling for the woman who is supposed to be his prey. From this point seeing the movie isnt a prerequisite for figuring out where things are going. I have never been able to understand Dane Cooks appeal. There are people out there who love him but his body of work such as it is is underwhelming. I suppose his frat-boy personality appeals to certain groups. His ratio of movies to late-night talk show appearances is about one-to-three. His characters tend to be cocky and obnoxious and Tank is no exception. Maybe the problem isnt that Cook is a bad actor but that hes unnervingly convincing in a particular kind of role. His chemistry with Kate Hudson is toxic. These two dont have a credible romantic moment in the entire movie. Actually its impossible to believe that Alexis could be in love with anyone except herself. Hudson has provided her share of appealing performances (sometimes in bad movies) but this isnt one of them. Meanwhile I think were supposed to be sympathetic to the dweeb Dustin but Biggs makes him into a creepy stalker-type. Instead of channeling the oddly charming goofball personality Biggs employed in American Pie the actor has tapped into something unsavory. If this is the filmmakers notion of a ""nice guy"" they have some twisted ideas. It is worth noting that there are two supporting characters who are interesting enough in small bites that the movie might have been better served by focusing more on them and less on the detestable main trio. Alec Baldwin has a grand time playing Tanks philandering father who will sleep with anything possessing the correct body parts. Baldwin brings energy to scenes where it is otherwise sorely lacking but his total screen time doesnt exceed ten minutes. Similar compliments can be heaped upon Lizzy Caplan (as Alexis roommate Ami). Halfway through the film I was hoping Alexis would get his by a bus so Ami could take over as the female lead. The director Howard Deutch has lost his way over the years. He began his career as the hand-picked helmsman for two of John Hughes most beloved teen films Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. After that he moved on to making bad sequels to dubious ""franchises."" Now he has led us to this pit of a romantic comedy. Deutch has directed a lot of comedies but few of them have been funny and this is no exception. Whatever grasp he once displayed of fleshing out human characters is long gone. When Tank decides to redeem himself and save Alexis by showing her his ""true"" self the sentimentality is cloying enough to choke on. It would kill the movie even if we cared about the characters. My Best Friends Girl isnt just a misfire; its a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations and its hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except perhaps Dane Cooks fan club).

"Movie review My Best Friends Girl -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review My Best Friends Girl -- 1 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic A couple of schools of thought come into play with the new Dane Cook comedy My Best Friends Girl. Start with ""If at first you dont succeed"" and maybe work your way down to ""The definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over expecting a different result.""Thus does Hollywood hurl Cook the most divisive comic since -- who? Andrew Dice Clay? Carrot Top?  at the screen time and again hoping something will stick. Cook remakes his Good Luck Chuck with Best Friends Girl playing a guy so good at being obnoxious that he charges other guys to date their exes and send them screaming back into the arms of Mr. Cast Aside.Kate Hudson remakes Failure to Launch as the woman who falls for Mr. Jerk-on-Purpose right down to casting Lizzy Caplan as a Zooey Deschanel look-and-sound-alike as her sassy sexy roomie/best friend. Jason Biggs remakes every movie hes done since American Pie playing the poor dull sap who cant get the girl because hes a dull sap.And Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink) remakes his 80s oeuvre with an 80s pop-riddled romp about realizing that ""Im not the best she can do.""Think of this as an R-rated Pretty in Pink with Cook throwing himself at this character Sherman ""Tank"" Turner with a vulgar vengeance. He courts. He dances. He charms. He curses. He insults. He drink. He smokes. He does a little gay bashing (OK a LOT).""You sound like Liberaces stylists boyfriend."" Tanks the heavy artillery dragging dates to strip clubs and health inspector-flunked restaurants bombarding them with coarse come-ons. They call the ex and Tank collects his pay. He doesnt want to help Dustin (Biggs) with his stuck-in-the-friend-zone problem with Alexis (Hudson) because hes like family. But he does.But Alexis ""Tanking"" doesnt take. Our boys got a problem. And even the tree that this worm-ridden apple didnt fall far from (Alec Baldwin is the sleazeball college prof dad) cant help him. Tanks in love.Alexis meanwhile isnt sure hes not the worst decision shes ever made -- ""And Ive eaten sushi in Tijuana""A funny bit He takes a Christian school teacher to a hilariously sacrilegious pizza joint Cheezus Crust ""Where pizzas a religion.. .. . People worship it.""Another grin Cook busting a move old school when Tank takes Alexis to ""the prom"" she missed in high school.But isolated bits dont add up to much here. Deutch keeps trotting out that guitar solo to the Cars title tune ""My Best Friends Girl"" as if that can make up the film and its stars charm deficit.With his dyed hair perma-stubble and too-fast too-rehearsed patter Cook sets himself up as a C-list Vince Vaughn. Hes been in film and TV since the late 90s and can count one good credit on his resume Dan in Real Life. You dont have to be a Cook hater (Google him its an eye-opener) to realize that hes best used as a supporting player. Hes a one-trick pony. And no matter how many times he trots out that trick hes never going to get it right.
