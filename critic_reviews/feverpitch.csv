That being said what it actually is still represents something of a feat a modern romantic comedy that tries to deal with the messy process of nurturing a proper adult relationship rather than simply shoehorning two lovers into a predictable set of catastrophic circumstances until they finally succumb to one another. Until its climax the Farrelly Brothers 2005 adaptation of Nick Hornbys soccer-minded memoir (actually ""football"" yes Im aware moving on) genuinely values the compromise that comes with real life over the reliable contrivance of rom-com fare and even then its only-in-the-movies ending seems worthy of the fantastical upturn of the Boston Red Sox own 2004 season which even the screenwriters hadnt anticipated at the time. Were getting ahead of ourselves though. This is the story of a love triangle one between a man a woman and his favorite sports team. To be fair Ben (Jimmy Fallon) makes this clear to Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) early on acknowledging that his passion for the Sox has come between him and other girls but this workaholic is willing to roll with it. Instead of being worried that shell once again prioritize her job over her latest boyfriend she assumes that his games will keep him suitably occupied in her absence. What seems like an ideal arrangement turns out to be a tacit agreement in mutual neglect and while Bens fanaticism takes on exaggerated proportions its key that writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel accept in a very real way that people can be as devoted to their traditions and institutions as they are relationships. Fans of Hornbys own ""High Fidelity"" or its screen adaptation shouldnt be surprised; they are essentially the same thing with LPs swapped out for HRs and fewer catty asides to the audience. Whenever Lindseys family and friends refer to Ben they call him ""the schoolteacher"" and while our leading lady is initially dismissive of such a casual label its fitting that Ben might only exist as an abstract to her this elusive idea -- nay ideal -- of a steady healthy meaningful relationship. Out of the stands hes the outsider panicked at dinners when strangers opt to discuss a game he hasnt yet watched absent at parties because hed rather be with his ""summer family"" than dare to meet hers. At Fenway though Lindsey gets to be the Other for a change distracted distracting ignorant to the rules of the game and callous towards the superstitions of its fans (as such she is seemingly punished for her skepticism with a flyball to the noggin). Its made clear from the start that Red Sox home games began as a steady surrogate for Bens broken home the need for which adult Ben has never shaken. However questionable his behavior this arent just lazy Apatow-like man-child antics; these are honest-to-goodness deep-seated associations between commitment and happiness. I may not care much for sports myself but as speaking as someone who has spent many a weeknight and Saturday morning seated in dark theaters with complete strangers its not hard to extrapolate Bens baseball-fueled bliss as just about any other time-consuming pursuit occupational or otherwise. For all this neurotic groundwork ""Fever Pitch"" is still a decently enjoyable movie beholden to sitcom-like lighting and gentle stabs at the ol Farrelly crudeness (at worst a non-starter ball-shaving gag; at best Ben cleans up Lindseys unseen vomit on their woebegone first date) but bolstered by an emphasis on their trademark sweetness a salve here that would only proceed to appear at odds with the hard-R flop-sweat of 2007s ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and 2011s ""Hall Pass."" By the time we get to our formulaic third act Lindsey decides to leave a Big Meeting in order to make a Big Gesture to win back Ben before thousands of fans and viewers as he goes about selling off his inherited season tickets. After splitting up Lindsey does have a promotion going for her; theres at least some measure of gain to come from shirking their relationship. For Ben its much less of an either/or proposition. He isnt selling his tickets in an effort to win Lindsey back so much as attempting to put away childish things but if he forsakes them both then he is likely forsaking ever loving anything or anyone so deeply again. He wants something safe she wants something safe and yet in the end they admit that trying to strike that balance with one another is better than risking nothing at all. In a movie that is itself the very definition of ""safe"" that sentiment seems more fair than foul to me.

"At the Movies Fever Pitch 040505 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies Fever Pitch By David Germain| Associated Press Tuesday April 05 2005 Stripped of almost all the brothers usual crudeness ""Fever Pitch"" proves what weve suspected all along That beneath the gross-out gags and freak-show humor Peter and Bobby Farrelly are just a couple of lovable romantics. No doubt it helps that theyre directing off someone elses material. Especially when its actually three someones with a track record in romantic storytelling screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (""Splash"") and British author Nick Hornby whose autobiographical book was the basis for the film. Drew Barrymore is at her most likable as a driven career woman who runs into foul territory when she falls for a man maniacally devoted to the Boston Red Sox. And as the Sox disciple Jimmy Fallon presents understated charm and cheeriness lacking in last falls ""Taxi"" his miserable big-screen debut as a lead player. It all adds up to the most unFarrelly of Farrelly brothers movies a straight-on romantic comedy that dispenses with the indelicate humor of such flicks as ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Shallow Hal."" In tone at least ""Fever Pitch"" better resembles ""Outside Providence"" the sweet little teen comedy the brothers co-wrote and produced based on Peter Farrellys novel than anything else theyve done. As Hollywood did with Hornbys ""High Fidelity"" ""Fever Pitch"" transplants his book from Britain to America switching the sports fanaticism to baseball instead of soccer. Fallon plays Ben Wrightman who caught Red Sox fever as a boy when his uncle took him to a game at Fenway Park. Ben inherited his uncles season tickets near the Sox dugout and never misses a game. His apartment is dementedly festooned with memorabilia - towels sheets a shower curtain even a replica of the Green Monster Fenways outfield wall in the living room. A math teacher Ben meets business consultant Lindsey Meeks (Barrymore) on a field trip with his students. Its not exactly love at first sight but Bens gentle humor and gallantry soon win Lindsey over. At least in winter before opening day. Ben confesses his Red Sox fixation early on but Lindsey does not realize the all-consuming passion of the sports zealot until the height of summer when shes too far into the relationship to back away without getting hurt. ""I already know I like winter guy. Its summer guy that broke my heart"" Lindsey tells Ben. The movie runs a bit dull and choppy early on but the laughs build along with the momentum as the season progresses and Bens compulsion mounts. ""Fever Pitch"" is so completely Barrymore and Fallons show that talented supporting players such as Ione Skye JoBeth Williams and Willie Garson come off as benchwarmers who never see any meaningful action. The filmmakers got down in the trenches with the Red Sox and their fans filming at Fenway both during games and while the team was on road trips. ""Fever Pitch"" nicely incorporates the sights and sounds of a town reveling in their team and bemoaning their fate as fans of one of the unluckiest franchises in sports. Blind luck landed the Farrellys at Fenway as Boston actually started winning the Red Sox finally ending the curse of the Bambino to win their first World Series since 1918. The filmmakers scrambled to adapt the story which originally ended with the Sox losing yet again. The Farrellys even managed to sneak Barrymore and Fallon on the field in St. Louis after Boston won the championship last fall. That gave the filmmakers leeway to go sugary sweet with a fairy-tale conclusion that would have been dismissed as Hollywood fluff had it not actually happened.

The teams triumph was so unforeseen -- nay borderline inconceivable -- that the filmmakers Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly ended up having to rework their film. (The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel had been loosely based on Nick Hornbys autobiographical novel rich in comic heartbreak about his obsession with soccer and the London football club Arsenal.) This new and revised comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon combines familiar elements of chick-flick romance with a heartfelt hymn to the (non-steroidal) sweetness of baseball. The results are erratic if not downright lumpy even though the Farrelly brothers of ""Theres Something About Mary"" fame have taken a vacation from their usual gross-out style. Heres another surprise though. The film turns out to be a substantial pleasure as the spirit of the Sox shines through. The shining takes a while to start. At first ""Fever Pitch"" seems fixated by the folklore of dating. Ms. Barrymores Lindsey a business consultant of some sort -- its never quite clear what she does -- is smitten with Mr. Fallons Ben a geometry teacher and a hopeless Red Sox fanatic. (Until last fall hopelessness went hand in mitt with Sox fanaticism.) Theres every reason why she should find him attractive. Hes gentle intriguingly shy and surprisingly witty though whats unclear about him is how hes able to swing from amiable bumbler to giddily surreal comic without missing a beat. (The secret is arbitrary writing.) But then a new baseball season begins and mere fanaticism turns into flat-out madness. Thats the conflict such as it is. Lindsey is a level-headed woman who can go only so far in understanding and competing with the object of Bens obsession. Ben is an overgrown child who cant bring himself to go far from Fenway Park where he has great season seats that were inherited from his family. Hes a worshiper in the church of Boston baseball a member of an obscure sect whose lore is dominated by the Curse of the Bambino and whose holy objects include the Green Monster and Peskys Pole. And he cant understand how Lindsey doesnt respond as he does -- with blind though perennially questioning faith. Down on his knees before her he asks ""Lindsey will you...go to opening day with me?"" When ""Fever Pitch"" is dumb it can be very dumb. Sitcom situations keep threatening to tear the patchy fabric to tatters. Ms. Barrymore tries fitfully to be charming; its only when she stops that her great natural charm re-emerges. (Just watch her beguiling delivery of the bizarre line ""Im concussed."") Mr. Fallon who sometimes looks like a silent-film star often seems uncomfortable; his limited skills as a movie actor are not enhanced to put it mildly by the primitive cinematography and direction. Yet his performance is oddly endearing maybe because its so hard to pin down. Is he clumsy or playing clumsy? Who knows? More to the point who cares since the film is extremely smart about the fantasy world in which Ben and his reluctant beloved live. Its a friendly village surrounding a diamond-shaped green where an extended family holds a joyous reunion every spring summer and fall. For all its various failures ""Fever Pitch"" taps expertly into our nostalgia for an era when baseball really was the American pastime unsullied by money drugs or celebrity. The players on the field -- the movie interweaves clips from notable games -- are seen simply as powerful combatants. The fans in the seats may be outspoken but theyre basically benign and people of modest means. No wealthy corporate box-holders here; Bens seatmates might be mistaken for creatures of the bleachers from half a century ago. A little heartfelt can go a long way and the Farrellys film has quite a lot. (It also has a climactic device that may connect with the current debate about fan behavior.) What begins as a date movie about dating becomes a study of obsession and then an affecting story of faith lost then regained. Like the Red Sox -- at least the Red Sox of last year -- ""Fever Pitch"" delivers when and where it counts.    DVD TIP Two tips in fact both related to sports. Before ""Fever Pitch"" there was ""Fever Pitch"" (1997) which was adapted by Nick Hornby from his own book. The obsessive football fan was played by Colin Firth. And the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel did the screenplay for the uncertain but affecting ""A League of Their Own"" (1992). The director was Penny Marshall the subject was the beginnings of womens baseball and the cast included Geena Davis Tom Hanks and Madonna. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

They had to wait 86 years for their 2004 World Series victory which would surely make even Arsenal fans wince. Charged with transferring Hornbys deft North London specifics to New England A-list Hollywood screenwriting team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (Splash City Slickers) have kept Sox maniac Jimmy Fallon as a high-school teacher but changed his love interest to Drew Barrymores high-powered workaholic business exec who meets him during the teams winter downtime thinks hes adorable and is thus unprepared to be displaced in his affections by his summer season ticket for Fenway Park.  While the original explored the notion of sporting obsession as a refuge from life (for good and ill) here its as much a plot point as a passion since his n hers opposing values are played largely for conventional romantic comedy. Its slickly done pleasantly watchable but despite Barrymores ever-charming earnestness not quite a home run. Although theres a characteristic note of class tension and we get to see the funny side of food poisoning and concussion the Farrellys seem on their best behaviour as if slightly hamstrung by the challenge of working in the classic Hollywood mould. Then again perhaps they really needed John Cusack since Saturday Night Live alumnus Fallon is far too lightweight a lead; moderately amusing as a man-child fan-boy dressed from the Red Sox gift-shop but an unpersuasive potential partner for go-getting Drew.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The first in what would be an unintended comic trilogy on arrested development Nick Hornbys hilarious confessional Fever Pitch (which was followed by the novels High Fidelity and About A Boy) wrestles with his consuming passion for Arsenal a British soccer team that only rewards his devotion with misery. It seems a natural choice for an American adaptation to center on the Boston Red Sox which finally ended 86 years of futility in the last World Series but the only things the book and film have in common are the title and an interest in sports. By spinning Hornbys book into a romantic comedy the diabolical writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers) lose the obsessive first-person so shrewdly captured by the film versions of High Fidelity and About A Boy. Without it they miss the funny psychosis of caring deeply for something inessential so enslaved by the endless trivia of roster changes stat sheets and inconsequential mid-season series that things like love and happiness become distant priorities. Casting John Cusack or Hugh Grant might have helped. Saturday Night Live alum Jimmy Fallon hasnt gotten far in his nascent movie career but his halting tentative line-readings are more awkward than quirky--its like being trapped at a party with a social leper. Playing a mild-mannered schoolteacher by day Fallon seems like a pretty good catch for single women looking for a stable sensitive partner but once girlfriends witness the extent of his Red Sox mania they always bail. When Fallon starts dating high-powered businesswoman Drew Barrymore she seems to be the exception; she not only tolerates his fandom but also accompanies him to Fenway and studies up on Sox lore. But her indulgence of ""Summer Guy"" the creature that replaces the loveable ""Winter Guy"" once spring training begins sours when it becomes clear that Fallons devotion to Barrymore has dropped one spot in the standings. Once the gross-out maestros of Kingpin and Theres Something About Mary the Farrelly brothers have softened considerably with recent efforts like Shallow Hal and Stuck On You but their sensibility all but disappears into the generic rom-com trappings of Fever Pitch. The timing of the Red Soxs post-season triumph gives the film a lift coinciding with an improbable and wildly romantic gesture that brings new meaning to the term ""lamour fou."" Barrymore has rarely been so bright and effortlessly charming but its all lost on Fallon who often resembles one of those unfortunate SNL guests who freeze up on live TV completely out of their element.

Comments Fever Pitch A schoolteacher (Jimmy Fallon) finds his fanatical attachment to the Boston Red Sox getting in the way of his budding relationship with a business consultant (Drew Barrymore) in this slightly-better-than-average romantic comedy by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (Theres Something About Mary). It doesnt require any knowledge of baseball and in fact does a pretty good job of exploring the more regressive aspects of sports fandom though it doesnt advance very far beyond predictable formula. To call this ""Farrelly brothers lite"" may be a little redundant but aside from the odd vomit gag it goes relatively easy on their usual working-class taboo busting. Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel wrote the script adapting Nick Hornbys memoir about his addiction to English soccer. PG-13 105 min.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The end of an 86-year losing streak is a great backdrop for a romantic comedy the perfect metaphor for finding love against all odds. In the Farrelly brothers ""Fever Pitch"" Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon find true love just barely as the long-beleaguered Boston Red Sox wend their way toward winning the World Series. The picture is supposedly about a character who puts his love of baseball before his love of actual people. But in some ways the picture itself does the same thing. By the end of it we have a vivid understanding of how desperately Red Sox fans care about their team. But the human-to-human love story tucked in amid the dementia feels like an afterthought a workaround to the problem of being consumed by the love that in New York City at least dare not speak its name. Like nearly every Farrelly brothers movie that has come before it ""Fever Pitch"" is made with so much genuine affection and such obvious good intentions that it seems churlish to treat it too harshly -- the picture is reasonably entertaining and shows glimmers of the Farrellys characteristic offhanded sweetness. Yet my disappointment in it makes me feel Ive been banished from Eden. ""Fever Pitch"" lacks that Farrelly spark that warm crazy glint that made movies like ""Stuck on You"" and the unfairly maligned ""Shallow Hal"" glisten even through their flaws. That may be partly because the Farrellys didnt write ""Fever Pitch"" The script inspired by Nick Hornbys 1992 memoir is by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who specialize in sleek products like ""Splash"" ""A League of Their Own"" and ""City Slickers."" ""Fever Pitch"" may at times look and feel like a Farrelly brothers movie. But get too close and you see all the ways in which it just doesnt move as it should. Its an impostor in the correct uniform. Fallon plays Ben a 10th-grade math teacher whose shirttails are always dangling beguilingly over the waistband of his ill-fitting corduroys -- in other words hes the kind of shy smart schlumpy charmer that in the movie universe at least women need to be convinced to look twice at even though underneath it all hes supposedly the best kind of catch a woman could hope for. Luckily successful adorable career-gal Lindsey (Barrymore) does look twice even though at first shes convinced Ben isnt her type. But their relationship gels immediately On the night of whats supposed to be their first date Ben tends to Lindsey (and cleans up) when a nasty stomach bug lays her low. Her dog adores him. The three of them have picnics in the park during which Ben lists the things he loves about her -- you know those inventories of stray freckles and unconscious instances of nose-crinkling that movie characters so often feel compelled to make. But thats during the winter. What Lindsey doesnt know is that once baseball season starts Ben belongs to the Red Sox. He has season tickets and the seats are amazing He inherited them from his uncle (played in an all-too-brief cameo by Boston comic Lenny Clark) who ignited Bens adoration of the game when he was just a lonely awkward kid. His friends (among them the always likable Willie Garson from ""Sex and the City"") clamor for the opportunity to be his guest at select games. Lindsey at first is happy enough to tag along with him despite the fact that the ""regulars"" in the nearby seats clearly distrust her for not liking the game enough (or maybe for just not being working-class enough -- a bit of reverse classism that you wouldnt expect from the Farrellys who are among the few filmmakers I can think of who actually get class). But before long Lindsey realizes that the Red Sox schedule rules Bens life. No family event is ever more important. He owns almost no grown-up clothes other than sneakers and T-shirts. Tensions arise. She loves him but what should she do?All of that makes ""Fever Pitch"" sound disarmingly mild. Youre probably wondering ""Whats the girls problem? Hes a great guy and he loves baseball -- so what?"" And that is ultimately exactly what the movie wants you to feel even though Bens harmless love of baseball causes him to do some not very cool things. The Farrellys New Englanders by birth love the Red Sox so much that they forgive their lead character a multitude of sins that in any of their other movies theyd be too gentlemanly (and too humane) to ever allow. When Lindsey excitedly announces that she has to go on a last-minute business trip to Paris and is going to whisk him off for a romantic weekend there he hems and haws -- hell have to miss an important game. Understandably shes stung. Meanwhile were left with one crisp image ringing through our brains A weekend in bed in Paris with Drew Barrymore. What kind of schmuck would pass that up to watch a bunch of guys running around in tight pants? You Might Also Like Ben finally does allow himself to miss a game only to ruin an exceedingly romantic moment -- the sort of moment at which both men and women are at their most vulnerable -- by grousing about not being at Fenway. And worst of all when Lindsey is struck and knocked out by a foul ball while Bens back is turned hes more interested in high-fiving the guy who caught it; only after that does he notice his girlfriend slumped unconscious in her seat. Later he watches this horrifying moment played out on TV and while he flinches momentarily the incident ends up meaning nothing to him. As Ben is written hes the kind of great ""catch"" women would probably be better off not looking twice at. Hes one of those ostensibly nice guys whos really not so nice at all. Of course by the end of ""Fever Pitch"" Ben has supposedly changed. But we dont believe it for a minute. Fallon is extremely well-cast as Ben -- in his early scenes especially his stammering awkwardness makes him at least vaguely appealing. But by the movies end were long past the point of just wishing hed grow up -- weve begun to suspect that his lost-puppy routine is just a coverup for an essential lack of character. And Barrymore as always is luminous and delightful but the role is beneath her. (She needs to stop taking these cheerful girlfriend roles especially in movies that shes involved in producing like this one.) ""Fever Pitch"" is really a love story about baseball and considering the sport is our national pastime theres nothing wrong with that. In Hornbys book the game in question was football (that is to say soccer) so for an American movie the switch to baseball makes sense The perceived reality at least is that baseball fans -- particularly those persistently dreamy Red Sox types -- are much more delightfully innocent than those scary Anglo and European football fans. How many times have you seen the words ""baseball"" and ""hooligan"" used together? But the reality is that maybe particularly in Boston baseball attracts its fair share of boozy loudmouths as I can attest after having lived near Fenway Park for four years in the 80s. During baseball season just getting home from the subway after work (dressed in ordinary work apparel not expensive yuppie togs) meant trudging through bands of noisy cretins whose ""love of the game"" apparently translated into a special license to harass anyone not kitted out in a backward baseball cap. I would see parents particularly dads headed out to the ballgame with their kids and feel bummed out that they had to reckon with these yobbos just to enjoy an evening at the ballpark. And I could never get over the fact that although Boston is an incredibly racially diverse city the faces I saw coming to and from those ballgames were almost universally white. Thats not to knock baseball a sport many people love for all the right reasons. (And the charms of Fenway Park even to people who arent baseball fans are undeniable.) But to use romanticism of the sport as a substitute for actually writing a character -- ""Hes not a bad guy hes just a crazy dreamer"" -- is lazy and dull. And while boyishness is charming outright immaturity masquerading as boyishness wears thin pretty quickly. At one point in ""Fever Pitch"" Lindsey throws open Bens closet door and facing a sea of Red Sox jerseys jackets and sweats laments ""This isnt a mans closet"" It isnt a mans life either.

"Fever Pitch The Farrellys Ground Ball to Left Field washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Fever Pitch The Farrellys Ground Ball to Left Field Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 8 2005 ""Buckner."" This is one of the funniest lines in the otherwise lethargic romantic comedy ""Fever Pitch"" and its delivered with a lingering mortified bitterness familiar to any Boston Red Sox fan unlucky enough to remember Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. (Hey I was a Mets fan and the Buckner error still gives me tsoris.) But take heart Red Sox Nation Youll always have last years Game 5. That of course would be the American League Championship Series game in which the team completed a remarkable rally part of the Sox comeback against the New York Yankees for a ticket to the World Series. And those honeyed moments are appropriately exploited by filmmakers Bobby and Peter Farrelly who otherwise have uneven success adapting British author Nick Hornbys memoir. That book had to do with Hornbys heartbreaking devotion to Arsenal the Red Sox of British soccer. Notwithstanding the felicitous parallels between the two teams -- the working-class roots legendary losing streaks long-standing rivalries and rabidly even violently loyal fans -- the Americanized ""Fever Pitch"" is no livelier than the blah 1997 British rom-com starring Colin Firth. ""Saturday Night Live"" player Jimmy Fallon takes on Firths role as a man whose lifelong worship of his home team gets in the way of a budding relationship with the perfect woman. Here shes played by Drew Barrymore whose career seems to consist of movies in which shes either infectiously adorable or inexplicably wooden. A couple of well-played physical gags aside ""Fever Pitch"" should be immediately placed in the latter category. The title of ""Fever Pitch"" is obviously a sports pun but it could just as easily apply to its one-line high-concept plot ""Maniacal Red Sox fan meets the girl of his dreams but cant keep her."" And thats about all you need to know about a movie that all but completely squanders its potential to be romantic or comedic. Mostly this is due to bad casting Barrymore largely submerges her signature goofy appeal to play a number-crunching business consultant. (She does have a wonderful line when Fallons character explains that he attends spring training every year to figure out who should start and who should be cut. ""And the Red Sox ask your opinion?"" she asks brightly.) Fallon in his first headlining role looks cute but he can barely make himself understood through his slurry adenoidal mumble (is there a SAG requirement these days that all actors sound as if theyve just sprayed their throats with Chloraseptic?). But the Farrelly brothers whose comedies ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"" have made them the Toscaninis of gross-out humor are just as misplaced. Like their other attempt at a movie for grown-ups the 2000 misfire ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" ""Fever Pitch"" suffers from oddly clunky pacing and long talky passages of little verbal dexterity and zero interest import or impact . Its as if deprived of their usual set pieces involving flatulence body fluids or the infliction of pain on male nether regions theyre utterly unable to move a narrative along. (Lest Farrelly fans think theyve wandered into the wrong movie however the directors have included a ridiculously protracted sequence of vomit jokes including sound effects.) Still there are bright spots in ""Fever Pitch"" when the Farrellys inherent sweetness shines through. (That sweetness has always been there in the best of their movies -- think of Jonathan Richmans winsome Greek chorus in ""Theres Something About Mary."") Most of them take place at Fenway Park where the filmmakers were allowed to shoot right through to the end of last years championship season (Game 5 is handled with particular finesse). They aptly capture the giddy excitement of that time starting with the guarded optimism of Opening Day and ending with well you know how it ends. If anything ""Fever Pitch"" will give Bosox fans one more chance to relive in big-screen glory those fleeting flavorsome days. And just maybe it will give newly minted Nats fans a taste of things to come. (N.B. For reasons known only to the recently departed geniuses who ran 20th Century Fox and to Rupert Murdoch ""Fever Pitch"" is preceded by a loathsome animated short film called ""American Dad."" All American dads moms and kids are encouraged to wait it out in the more edifying environs of the theater restroom.) Fever Pitch (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and mild sexuality.

(AP ... more Photo DARREN MICHAELS Love life or Sox life? Tough choice for Boston fan. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Fever Pitch Romantic comedy. Starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Fever Pitch"" the latest from the Farrelly brothers is a romantic comedy that flirts with something serious but never gets past the flirting stage. Its about a guy whose obsession with the Boston Red Sox -- a consuming fixation that lets in no other interest -- gets in the way of his romantic relationships. His life is dominated by baseball from the beginning of spring training until the end of the season and his season ticket to Fenway Park keeps him busy most nights and weekends. Essentially its about someone whos locked in spectator mode a common phenomenon in the modern world. Our hero has not gone past the emotional place he occupied as a sad child whose spirits were lifted when an uncle took him to a Red Sox game. So hes stuck. He longs for the companionship of an adult woman but he remains a boy inside. Will he grow up? Is he capable of it? From that description ""Fever Pitch"" would seem to be the thoughtful movie the Farrelly brothers (""Dumb and Dumber"") have been tacking toward in recent years. But the script is gutless caught in a triangulation of Hollywood rules and formulas 1) In movies dealing with sports sports can only be presented as glorious; 2) In romantic comedies all incompatibility issues are solvable; and 3) Infantilism in men is always delightful even cuddly. Heres an idea for a great omnibus film. Reunite the casts of 10 romantic comedies from the past and in a series of shorts show how each got divorced. Show the kids and the custody battles. Show how they all absolutely detest each other. So ""Fever Pitch"" for all its promise is nothing but routine a showcase for a couple of attractive actors who are put through the paces of a bland romance. Drew Barrymore is Lindsey a successful executive and Jimmy Fallon is Ben a high school math teacher. She makes more money than he does but eventually she condescends to go out with him. Its a little creepy; in ""Fever Pitch"" they talk about being a schoolteacher as though he were living out of a shopping cart. When she brings him around to meet her friends they all seem amazed that hes not drooling. Barrymore is charming as always and Fallon has a winning way with a one- liner but the script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel is strangely off. Lindsey and Ben are going out for months yet they still talk to each other as though they were on a second or third date. Theyre tentative preening and slightly uncomfortable. This is not the movies commentary on their relationship. Its a case of screenwriters being caught in courtship mode the time of jokes and easy laughs. ""Fever Pitch"" was adapted from Nick Hornbys memoir of the same name in which he wrote about his obsession with English football (soccer). It was in production during the 2004 baseball season and had to be altered when the Red Sox got into the playoffs and won the World Series. But what was good luck for Boston was bad luck for the movie. It confounds its point. It takes a man whos so twisted that he turns down a romantic weekend in Paris in order not to miss a couple of baseball games. And then it shows that on some level he was right after all. This was the season not to miss. By the end ""Fever Pitch"" makes no sense at all. It introduces problems it doesnt solve but it pretends to solve them. Its one idea is simple too simple Bostons winning conquers all. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and some untoward language.

"The Amityville Horror Kung Fu Hustle and more movie violence Slate Sign In Sign Up The Amityville Horror Kung Fu Hustle and more movie violence The Amityville Horror Kung Fu Hustle and more movie violence Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.April 15 2005 408 PM Amity and Enmity Violence Violations and Kung Fu Hustles By David Edelstein Id like to tell you about the remake of The Amityville Horror (MGM) but I ankled after less than five minutes. It was something about the little girl holding the stuffed animal getting blown away with a shotgun at point-blank range. I hate it when critics boast about walking out of movies--were paid to keep our butts in our seats (at the very least). But I swear this is true I felt my body rise and move smoothly out of the screening room in advance of my minds resolution to do so. As a card-carrying skeptic Im reluctant to invoke the supernatural especially in relation to the community of Amityville. (The family at the center of this ""true"" story owned up to the hoax after all the money had been made.) But Id like to believe I was propelled from that room by a beneficent spirit. Dude I owe you a drink in the afterlife. Readers of this column know that when it comes to violence onscreen I have selective recoil. As one e-mailed ""Why did you object to the violence in The Passion of the Christ and not Sin City? Could you possibly be a hypocrite?"" Possibly. But I think that when it comes to violence in movies one size doesnt fit all. A flamboyantly stylized largely black and white movie with canted angles and blood that runs white green and mustard is not comparable to an ultra-realistic depiction of one person being beaten and hacked at relentlessly for two hours. (This is irrespective of Mel Gibsons higher motives.) Extreme stylization builds in a kind of emotional distance--as it does in the hyperbolically entertaining Kung Fu Hustle (see below) the over-the-top splattery dismemberment of the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and even (moving much further along this artificial spectrum) the private-eye ballet at the end of The Band Wagon. Advertisement But it is a thorny (no pun intended) issue the moral and immoral uses of violence in popular culture. I would hardly have described myself as ""going to hell"" for loving Sin City if I hadnt been troubled by my enjoyment of its many sadistic acts of revenge. Many years ago Stuart Gordon--purveyor of such shockingly bloody horror films as Re-Animator and From Beyond--struggled with the MPAAs penchant for slapping him with X ratings because his use of violence upset people. Isnt the greater danger he asked me violence that is portrayed as painless or fun? Gordon recalled that when he staged his first fistfight in the theater he did some research and discovered that many fights last one punch One guy breaks his hand and the other breaks his nose. He appreciated the irony If he put a fight onscreen in a way that made the audience hate violence (cartilage breaking blood flowing copiously in close-up) he might get an X for his troubles; but if he made it Popeye-painless (scores of bloodless punches with no bruising) hed get a PG and an audience of happy kids learning the lesson that violence is fun. The violence in Stephen Chows Kung Fu Hustle (Sony Pictures Classics) is fun city. Too bad its rated R or Id say bring the kiddies. At times the picture evokes such stylized musicals as The Band Wagon; at others it seems to whirr every kung-fu movie ever made into the most luscious action smoothie youll ever imbibe. A mob of dancing pinstripe-suited killers called the Axe Gang descends on a poor village the inhabitants of which prove more adept at self-defense than anyone could have predicted. The Axe Gang calls in some supernaturally agile assassins; the village counters with even more supernaturally agile defenders. The Axe Gang brings in the biggest baddest killer of all but the village turns out to have its own secret weapons. ... The vagueness is meant to keep from spoiling what is actually 100 minutes of can-you-top-this that begins where other action movies climax. Content is meaningless; computerized effects and design are all. Two years ago I flew to San Franciscos East Bay to have the special effects director of The Matrix show me a few precious seconds from the ""Burly Brawl"" the computer-generated kung-fu-fighting sequence that would change the face of film. Now Chow and his computer technicians and choreographers not only parody the ""Burly Brawl"" but best it by a factor of 10 making it seem threadbare in its adherence to the space-time continuum. Thumbing its nose at gravity deflating Zen solemnity embracing big-top artifice with childish glee Kung Fu Hustle zings you with some of the most unfettered slapstick ever put on film. Advertisement On the subject of unfettered slapstick--and Black Knights Broadway isnt my bailiwick but some indignities cant be contained. As someone who cherishes nearly every syllable of Monty Python and the Holy Grail I was juiced for Spamalot Broadways current impossible-ticket musical--the latest in an apparently endless line of shows adapted from old movies. Hats-in-the-air reviews standing ovations ... Ive rarely parted as happily in advance with my money. Folks its thoroughly second-rate. Half of Spamalot consists of intact exchanges from the movie mostly delivered by Americans who get the inflections wrong--about on par with me and my dorm-mates 20 years ago only we didnt charge over a hundred bucks and had the excuse of being stoned. The other half is Broadway camp--intermittently amusing but awkwardly juxtaposed with the tricky hyper-literary Cambridge Footlights absurdism of the Python boys at the peak of their inspiration and near-peak (Life of Brian was to come) of their irreverence. I say ""Ni"" to it. ... 106 PT Judy Irvings documentary The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill (Shadow Distribution Inc.) has been in release for a few months but with a related book on the extended bestseller list and stupendous word-of-mouth (not to mention in the blogosphere enthusiastic advocacy by The Daily HowlersBob Somersby) the movie is actually returning with the spring to some cities. Its much needed--it thaws the soul. The film chronicles the principal passion of a man named Mark Bittner a musician with no visible means of support (at least until his bestseller which came after the movie was made). Living in a rundown cottage beneath San Franciscos Coit Tower (thanks to the largesse of a conflicted yuppie-liberal couple up the hill) Mark has a splendid vantage on the flock of cherry heads that has improbably taken up residence in the trees. (The film briefly explores the various urban legends on how these tropical creatures--obviously pets--came to live and breed in the wild.) Bittner studies them occasionally feeds them cares for them when theyre sick and reaches out to them as a friend from another world. Advertisement He is rather careful to say that he is not anthromorphizing the birds and I believe that he is correct. What happens is much more fascinating Without fully realizing it he seems to be ""avianizing"" humans--or at least letting some parallels between the two species float suggestively. Asked by Irving why he has such long straggly salt-and-pepper hair (it reaches to his waist) he replies that he will cut it when he finds a mate. He follows avidly the couplings and uncouplings of various parrots--among them a self-pecker that drives her significant other away by attempting to defeather him as well. Most of all he is deeply empathetic towards a bird he names ""Connor"" a parrot from a different species (the blue head) that seems to have reluctantly taken up with this flock--proud isolated but often gruffly helping out the weak or injured birds cast off by the cherry heads. ""I dont think of myself as an eccentric"" Bittner says and he isnt--except perhaps in his serene indifference to questions of money employment and shelter. If he is an eccentric we should all have the time space and temperament for such eccentricity. A loner who arrived in San Francisco in the 60s but regarded the Beats as ""too down"" and the hippies as ""too airy"" he has staked out a nature-reverent middle position embodied by the poet Gary Snyder. Hes one of the gentle creatures of San Francisco--the city where people who want to be in a city but cant deal with cities end up if theyre lucky. Irving (along with Bittner who shot some of the footage) lingers on the vividly-colored parrots without overdoing the lyricism using slow motion only to capture (astonishingly) an instant or two in which the birds emotions are plain. There is a split-second punchline that sends you out giggling but the principal mood of The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill is one of yearning and heartbreak. These non-native birds seem much more vulnerable than their truly independent native counterparts and Bittner might be fighting a losing battle with nature to keep them healthy. In many ways this is a movie for outcasts and outcasts at heart--most of us Ill wager. Even more melancholy is Winter Solstice (Paramount Classics)--the title implies that its no barrel of monkeys. Written and directed by Josh Sternfeld its a quivering portrait of a grief-stricken family all male after the loss of a wife and mom. Jim Winters (Anthony LaPaglia) is a suburban landscaper with two sons who barely pay attention to him They are obstinately embarrassed by displays of emotion. The dinner table scenes are pure torture in the monosyllables and hanging silences as the patriarch reaches out and unanswered remains helplessly extended a very Quasimodo of mute despair. Advertisement For the first 20 minutes or so I was impatient with the longeurs but then it became clear that the movie is one long longeur and that each still frame is bursting with emotional desperation. You can feel your inner rhythms slow as the film takes hold--enough for you to take in the details of the houses yards garages and basements. I found myself almost in tears over a minor item in the cellar--a Calphalon box on a crowded shelf maybe a piece of kitchen equipment bought by the mother and now stowed away unused. (Its worth singling out the production designer Jody Asnes.) (Actually its often worth singling out production designers--we dont do it enough.) I cant think of too many actors who could bring off Jim Winters. LaPaglia manages to convey wordlessly the mans inner struggle between his own instinct for emotional retreat and his conscience as a father which impels him to try to break through to his boys however imperfectly. Aaron Stanford is very fine as the elder son; as the younger Mark Webber is remarkable. Partially deaf from an accident Webbers Pete hides behind an all-purpose smirk cultivating a sort of laconic superiority that might be the last refuge of the emotionally crippled. Allison Janney plays a paralegal whos housesitting in the neighborhood and attempts in her awkward way to engage this stunted family. Freed from the brittle headlong pacing that is her (superb) specialty she is beautiful and real. One more thing The first line of the Winter Solstice coming attraction is the revelation to which the entire movie is building. The next lines are smaller revelations to which other scenes are building. Now I know that previews are constructed out of highlights and that they almost always show you more of a film than you want to see. But this might be the most gruesomely insensitive coming attraction ever made. By removing the silences (not even suggesting that there are silences) and cutting among all the big dramatic moments (which in the film itself are squeezed like blood from proverbial stones) the preview effectively disembowels the movie. If youre in a theater where its shown plug your ears and hum... 120 PT Its no big news that people who arent conventionally attractive especially women tend to be overlooked--professionally socially even walking by on the street. Agnes Jaouis new film Look at Me (Sony Pictures Classics) uses this harsh fact of life as the springboard for the drama of an overweight young woman (Marilou Berry) her famous and indifferent father (Look at Me co-writer Jean-Pierre Bacri) and the vocal teacher (director Jaoui) who doesnt pay much attention until she finds out who that father is. Advertisement Already Ive made Look at Me--the French title is Comme une Image--sound too tidy too pointed. This is an uninsistent film its pacing casual its camera somewhat detached. It dawdles--yet it builds almost imperceptibly to a vision of a world in which no one looks at anyone at least deeply enough to see beyond the trappings of beauty or fame. Its an ensemble movie set among self-centered intellectuals but Jaoui doesnt take easy shots at her characters--shes one of them. The choral teacher she plays Sylvia dreads being accosted after rehearsals by the plain self-conscious Lolita (Berry). What a bother that woman is she tells her husband Pierre (the amusingly morose Laurent Grevill) an unsuccessful novelist given to spasms of self-pity. How can she be expected to spare her precious energies for someone like that? And then on the verge of telling Lolita that she just doesnt have time to advise her and her little vocal group Sylvia discovers shes Lolita Cassard the daughter of the celebrated novelist and publisher Etienne Cassard--whose last novel has just been made into a big-deal movie. And suddenly she sees the girl and suddenly shes dazzled by the prospect of squeezing into that inner circle. When her husbands new novel gets a rave review in Le Monde she knows she has really arrived. Its only then that she begins to feel guilty about the way that she and everyone else have treated Cassards homely daughter. For long stretches you find yourself staring at Berrys Lolita whose name seems a cruel joke--shes anything but a nymphet. She has a big honker a wide body and shoulders that perpetually slump especially when shes forced to wear fashionable clothes. Shes proof that French women do get fat no matter how much leek soup (which apparently makes you pee like a horse) they ingest. Watching Lolita twiddle her hair and gaze into the distance you see how much the young woman has been formed by people not looking at her. In a clothing store with her fathers girlfriend Karine (Virginie Desarnauts) she barely flinches when the thin model-gorgeous blonde looks in the mirror and announces ""Im enormous"" Advertisement The heart of Look at Me is the relationship between Lolita and her kingly father who travels with his own courtier a worshipful masochist named Vincent (Gregoire Oestermann). That heart is a black hole a vacuum befitting a monster of self-absorption. Its unclear if Cassard would pay much attention to Lolita even if she were stunningly gorgeous. He certainly regards Karine and their attractive five-year-old daughter as props. He barely pays attention to anyone although he ostentatiously searches any party he enters for pretty girls. Over the course of the film Lolita tries to get Cassard to listen to a tape of her singing Perhaps if he cant look at her she seems to think he can hear her. But that tape goes unplayed and their encounters are incessantly interrupted. Cassards cell phone rings and he withdraws into his phone conversation or Lolita takes refuge in her cell phone; and no one is ever in the moment--no one that is except the filmmaker who gazes on without blinking. Perhaps this explains the films pacing and its formless air. The director is the only one present. Jaouis character undergoes a transformation but it doesnt lead to some cathartic confrontation. This is a bleak unresolved film with no release. What keeps it from being a mortal bummer is the music--exquisite sacred choral works plus Mozart. The Baroque arias that Lolita sings--in an imperfect but lovely high soprano so unrepresentative of her body mass--suggest a yearning for life on a non-physical plane for the world that will come when she has shuffled off this mortal coil. Or should I say gone beyond this too too solid flesh?... 134 PT The Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby didnt write the screenplay for their romantic comedy Fever Pitch (20th Century Fox) and by their standards its a mild offering. Theres only one gross-out scene and it takes place off camera--although the sounds of a food-poisoned Drew Barrymore upchucking repeatedly are pretty convincing. But the movie fits happily into the Farrellys universe. The hero Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a child-man so obsessed with the Red Sox that hes something of a freak and he finds himself torn between a challenging grown-up relationship with a career woman Lindsay (Drew Barrymore--not the most credible mathematics prodigy but adorable anyway) and the security of the Sox the Green Monster and the surrogate family with season tickets that he sees every season in the same section of Fenway Park behind home plate. This year Ben discovers one old duffer is in dialysis and one woman has dropped 200 pounds after a stomach stapling. On the field theres a Jimmy Fund boy with leg braces singing the national anthem. Its a hopeful inclusive world. Even after ""86 years of bangin our heads against the green wall"" Ben has faith. He even thinks the Sox could someday win the World Series I have to admit I miss the usual fart and masturbation jokes--I prefer the Farrellys when theyre disreputable and push the boundaries of taste because theyre otherwise a tad sentimental. Other directors develop as craftsmen over the course of their first few movies but the brothers will never be a threat to Steven Spielberg; they seem untroubled by their limp rhythms and ordinary staging. Fever Pitch isnt even very feverish. What makes the movie fun and sometimes even moving is its complicated view of fandom. The movie Fever Pitch has little in common with its supposed source Nick Hornbys memoir of his addiction to football (i.e. soccer) but its informed by Hornbys ambivalence. Fandom takes you out of the real world yet it makes you feel as if youre plugged into something higher outside yourself out of your control. Its about living for players who are completely indifferent to you personally and yet in worshipping them you remain in touch with a kind of pure childlike joy. (Hornbys book seems very amusing but I only understood about a quarter of it. Chaucer and Finnegans Wake were easier to follow than the ins and outs of English football.) The script credited to veterans Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel has its graceful patches. Lindsay worries that if she comes to share Bens obsession and lifestyle shell be like the women she knows who get new boyfriends and ""their prior lives just vanish."" And when she gets beaned by a foul ball and the late TV news shows Ben high-fiving the fan who came up with it before he noticed his unconscious girlfriend--thats enough to give anyone pause. But Fallons Ben is very sweet. Hes a compulsive jokester but hes friendly not aggressive. He says he loves the way Lindsay talks out of one side of her mouth ""like a stroke victim"" and thats a pretty good take on Barrymore--whos absolutely adorable (did I say that already?) and looks shockingly great in a flapper costume with Louise Brooks hair. (Fallon is rather good too by the way--his self-effacement here becomes him.) The Farrellys have a commentary track on their Something About Mary DVD and in every shot they point out the extras who are their childhood friends or relatives or doctors or the guys in some program for the disabled they support. (They evidently support many.) As commentaries go this one is incredibly boring but it helps you understand why their universe feels so warm. They really do love everyone on screen--in wheelchairs or connected at the waist or with long legs or with no legs. They loved the Red Sox when the team hadnt won a series for 86 years--or maybe because of that? It must have thrown them when the Sox actually did it because its the losers in their world who are transfigured.

The Farrelly brothers are growing up which in this case isnt a bad thing. With a tacked-on ending made necessary by the Boston Red Soxs improbable World Series run last fall ""Fever Pitch"" proves a charming romantic comedy against ""A Beautiful Mind""-type framework -- the ""illness"" here being a grown mans addiction to baseball. Likely to appeal to both men and women with its mix of sports mania ""Aw"" moments and occasional flourishes of Farrelly-esque goofiness this genial rookie should keep turnstiles clicking long enough to be scored as a hit if not a blast into the cheap seats. Accommodating mens infatuation with sports actually is an under-utilized device especially considering the pangs of recognition that greeted the moment in ""Diner"" when a Baltimore Colts fan subjects his would-be bride to a trivia test. Cleverly adapted from Nick Hornbys book about his obsession with soccer ""Fever Pitch"" seizes on the long-suffering Red Sox loyalists laboring under the curse of the Bambino and wonders whether a true die-hard can find love. Its an oddly logical impediment to romance adding a quirky wrinkle to boy meets girl foul ball hits girl boy loses girl etc. Jimmy Fallon captures the right touch of boyishness as Ben an affable if slightly nerdy schoolteacher who begins wooing Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) an ambitious promotion-seeking corporate exec. At first the class differences appear to represent a small hiccup but Lindseys snooty friend Robin (Kadee Strickland) insists there must be some darker reason why a cute almost-30 guy is on the market. Lindsey gets her answer soon enough since the courtship began in the winter before those six months that Ben devotes to the Sox -- from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia. Soon enough the issue becomes whether he can modulate his interest to meet Lindsey halfway or if she must accede to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work. Much like ""A Beautiful Mind"" the problem is that Ben can be a dreamboat one moment and a loon the next -- pitching a near-fit during dinner with Lindseys parents (James B. Sikking and JoBeth Williams) so he wont hear the final score of the Red Sox game which hes taping. As a practical matter given the duration and frequency of the baseball schedule theres not much room for a truly committed Sox supporter to get a life as much as Ben would like to have one. Although the Red Sox obviously have a storied history of frustration Bens eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan. At the same time the Farrellys along with writing tandem Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have toned down their customary gross-out excesses (albeit with a few tips of the cap in that direction) resulting in a film not as howlingly wicked as say ""Theres Something About Mary"" but likable nonetheless. After stalling out in ""Taxi"" ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Fallon exhibits real bigscreen potential overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unsympathetic. Barrymore meanwhile slips breezily into another romantic comedy role that accentuates the former and the filmmakers have assembled a nicely fleshed out supporting roster including Bens extended family at the ballpark whose level of dedication mirrors his own. Enough shooting was done at Bostons Fenway Park to convey a sense of authenticity as well as the ambience of the games though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. That said ""Fever Pitch"" is one of those nicely grooved pitches with which even a novice ought to be able to connect.

"Barrymore Is The Single Draw In Lukewarm `Fever Pitch - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Fallon Barrymore Is The Single Draw In Lukewarm `Fever Pitchmovies - reviewApril 8 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticGood Jimmy Fallon movies are as rare as Red Sox pennants.But maybe like the ""Sawx"" hes due. Even the blandest Saturday Night Live comic since Kevin Nealon should find an acorn sometimes.Fever Pitch comes close to breaking the Curse of the Carvey that rule that says SNL comics make lousy movies. That has little to do with Fallon as the star. Hed better realize how lucky he was to enjoy the winning presence of Drew Barrymore a tiny bit of heart in the script and a story structured like and tied to -- quite by accident -- last years improbable World Series triumph by sports most practiced losers the Boston Red Sox.Scripted by the guys who wrote Parenthood based on an English soccer romance by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity) and showing none of the crudity (or edge) of Team Dumb and Dumber the Farrelly Brothers Fever Pitch isnt half bad. Its just like a baseball season -- long and dull enough to be worth skipping until the playoffs.Fallon plays Ben a middle-school geometry teacher nagged into hitting on the pretty corporate numbers-cruncher played by Barrymore.All through the long Boston winter they flirt. She turns him down. Her pals nag her into not dating ""another guy just like you"" (driven and ambitious). Hes charming and accommodating. Sure he wears a little too much Sox gear but hes sweet.Then March comes. Ready to meet the parents?""Cant. Gotta go to Florida [Fort Myers] to see spring training.""""Wait arent those practice games?""He takes her to opening day. Shes clocked by a foul ball which leads to high fives all around. Welcome to Bens 23-year obsession with the Sox.""I get lost in the games"" he says in one of several horsehide reveries.And how. All summer its him planning his life around home stands and televised games and her breaking off from a tough job to be with him.The movie is at its best in Fenway Park where the obsessed go for their fix of hot dogs beers and frustration. Fallon can sound positively poetic talking about his ""summer family"" of season ticket holders.And when quite off script the Sox make their run to history the arc of the story (shes had enough he has to choose between his first love and his second) gets the same lift that the epic pennant run did. Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel say they had to rewrite on the fly as the teams fortunes changed. Pity the whole movie didnt have that urgency of make-it-up-on-the-spot.Fallon is a dead weight in the center of this very cute and fortuitous idea. He does a wicked fierce Bawston accent on SNL but doesnt even touch one here. Watch him and imagine what Jack Black could have done in this part.But Barrymore is at her winsome adorable best here acting rings around her hapless leading man demonstrating the straight-man timing shes had to perfect opposite the likes of Adam Sandler and other inferiors.Want to feel old? E.T.s pal Gertie just turned 30.Theres nothing here that would make as one wag cracks ""Ted Williams roll over in his freezer."" Blame that on reverent direction. Its as if the envelope-pushing Farrellys realized they were witnessing a sports miracle and dared not blaspheme the sainted Sox fans. They needed to.Without that suggestion of blind faith to the point of lunacy this Fever isnt catching.

The movies adapted from these books were exceptional -- funny smart and heartfelt nothing like the formulaic soul-numbing romantic comedies Hollywood usually makes. Fever Pitch an adaptation of a Hornby memoir isnt in their league. Its been turned into a more conventional movie and its pieces were carelessly put together allowing gaps in the seams. The basic design is sturdy enough though that it works. After a weak start the film becomes quite funny even affecting if youre susceptible to this sort of thing. The casting of Jimmy Fallon is the first clue that this is Nick Hornby lite -- if the man were any less substantial hed be a hologram. The other clue is that Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel wrote the script. The prolific pair wrote for Happy Days and Laverne amp; Shirley and their movies havent veered far from the sitcom mold. Hornbys book was a diarylike account of the British authors lifelong obsession with soccer. The writers moved the story to Boston filled it with Red Sox lore -- and game footage -- and turned it into a love triangle. Ben (Fallon) is an elementary school teacher whose world has revolved around baseball since he was 6 and his uncle took him to his first game. He loves Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) a successful work-obsessed business consultant. She loves him too but not enough to play second fiddle to a sport. At the movies core is a question that all couples face How much of ones identity must a person give up in order to make a relationship work? The filmmakers show good marketing sense in balancing the romantic elements with sports in a way that should draw women and men in equally. Lindsey and Ben make an unlikely couple -- their first meeting is painful to watch -- but she is at a stage where she wants a stable relationship. And once she gives him a chance she finds he is incredibly sweet. Lindseys friends warn that Ben cant be as good a catch as he looks but she warily wades deeper into a committed relationship. Even when baseball season starts and he changes she tries to adapt so much so that one of her friends says shes been ""colonized"" -- Ben is imposing his culture on her as if she were a developing country under occupation. Barrymore who also produced the film is adorable. The film is directed by the Farrelly brothers who are better known for the over-the-top grossness they impose on otherwise sentimental comedies such as Theres Something About Mary and Me Myself amp; Irene. They pretty much behave themselves here though there is an off-screen scene involving vomit and a dog that they highlight for good measure. The movie nicely orchestrates the necessary big situational crisis though the transformations the characters undergo near the end occur a bit too easily. Were willing to forgive that though because the race-against-the-clock finish works so well. All formula romantic comedies have these (they often involve a predictable dash to the airport). You know the finish works if you either laugh out loud or shed a tear.

Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 (crude and sexual humor). At the Empire the Loews 84th and Broadway the Union Square others. JUST as the Red Sox- oriented romantic comedy ""Fever Pitch"" was wrapping up last fall the Sox won the World Series. Rarely have filmmakers had a more wildly improbable happy ending forced on them. Well you need all the help you can get divine or otherwise when your two stars - Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon - have no chemistry whatsoever. Never more charming Barrymore goes into extra innings to persuade us that Lindsey a hard-driving executive is smitten with Ben a mild-mannered schoolteacher and obsessive fan of the Sox who when the movie began shooting were best known for an eight-decade losing streak. Fallon the erstwhile ""Saturday Night Live"" star plays Ben. Hes improved considerably as an actor since last years crime against humanity ""Taxi"" but the movies energy level still drops faster than the barometer during a hurricane when hes required to carry a scene without Barrymore. ""Fever Pitch"" is loosely based on Nick Hornbys novel of the same name which was about a British soccer fan. In the U.K. the book received a faithful on-screen interpretation starring Colin Firth in 1997. But the domestic version arrives as an assembly-line romantic comedy from the word processors of Hollywood vets Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel whose oeuvre runs from ""Splash"" to ""Robots."" It all basically boils down to whether Lindsey can live with a man who sleeps on Red Sox sheets and would rather be at a game than anywhere else - even Paris for a weekend - and of course whether Ben is willing to make any sacrifices to keep her. One ominous hint When Lindsey gets hit on the head by a foul ball Ben first congratulates a bystander who catches the ball on the rebound. This is basically an Adam Sandler movie without Adam Sandler (or his edge; the metrosexual Fallon has none) - a pleasant way to kill a couple of hours largely thanks to Barrymore who produced the picture and cheerfully dominates it from beginning to end. Theres loads of ballpark color and vibrant characters courtesy of directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly who are genuine New England boys (as is Stephen King briefly glimpsed throwing out the first ball of the season). But the Farrellys eschew the kind of gross-out humor they perfected in ""Theres Something About Mary"" except for a mercifully brief bit when one of Bens pals (Willie Garson of ""Sex and the City"") gives him a genital shave. Even when a flu-stricken Lindsey vomits - and Ben cleans it up - the action occurs off-screen. ""Fever Pitch"" which was limping toward a bittersweet ending got a real-life boost when the Red Sox finally ended the Curse of the Bambino with their first World Series win since 1918. A newly written epilogue was hastily shot on the day the Sox won the pennant. The unlikely confluence of events showed that almost anything is possible even something so patently absurd as Lindsey and Ben ending up together.

With Drew Barrymore Jimmy Fallon. Directors Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (141). PG-13 Curde and sexual humor some sensuality. 2.5 STARS. Theres a sweet off-kilter romantic comedy buried inside ""Fever Pitch."" Sometimes you can sense it lurking in the nosebleed seats of Fenway Park where the filmmaking Farrelly brothers got lucky by shooting last year just when the Red Sox knocked the Curse of the Bambino out of the ballpark. Based on the Nick Hornby novel and changed from a theme of soccer fixation to baseball (there was a more faithful British version made in 1997) ""Fever Pitch"" can be funny and endearing when you dont dwell on the black hole that is Jimmy Fallon. Relationship comedy like this is mothers milk to Drew Barrymore who as usual is adorable and perfect. But Fallon as her boyfriend? As his mediocre skit work on ""Saturday Night Live"" demonstrated Fallon has no presence or charm. He looks terrified in scenes where his character is supposed to be shy manic where he should be disarming. Didnt anyone see ""Taxi"" before casting him? Bobby and Peter Farrelly continue to move away from the gross-out humor of ""Theres Something About Mary"" with this otherwise genial comedy about two nice people whose relationship hits a foul during baseball season. Shambling schoolteacher Ben Wrightman (Fallon) - notice the hookup possibilities implied by his name - is possibly perfect for career woman Lindsey Meeks (Barrymore). As Lindsey approaches 30 she gives Ben a try as an antidote to all those high-powered losers she usually dates. They get along in a reasonable if unsexy way. But spring training comes around and works on Ben like the moon on a werewolf. His life-long Red Sox obsession which during the off-season is confined to his collection of souvenir jackets and bedsheets threatens to bench the first good relationship either has ever had. Bens inherited season tickets place him practically on the field. And of course the production was there to record that unexpected history-defying Red Sox playoff win over the Yankees. Strangely though for a story fueled by sports enthusiasm there is very little baseball footage - something die-hard Yankee fans may appreciate. The jokey script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (the team that wrote ""City Slickers"" and other similarly slick comedies) offers some good one-liners as well as a lot of mush. Ben and Lindsey manage to emerge as interesting quirky characters with distinct senses of humor and the ability to articulate their views on that dating bugaboo compromise. The Farrelly brothers havent totally abandoned their roots. There is an extensive vomiting scene for example when a first date is marred by food poisoning. But here you see the kind of compromise Ben and Lindsey are talking about - the vomiting is offscreen even though you can hear it. Can sports fans and their resentful partners find this kind of middle ground? ""Fever Pitch"" says they can and must.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 08 2005 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 246PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Fever Pitch Reviewed by Rick Groen 1/2 Directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly Written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel Starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon Classification PG Crafted in his usual welcoming style -- his house of prose uses self-deprecating humour as the front porch that leads to a living-room of keen insights -- Nick Hornby once wrote a splendid little book about his life-long obsession with the Arsenal soccer team. A few years later Hornby himself helped to adapt (actually dismantle) the book into a quasi-British movie that starred Colin Firth but swiped its romance-comedy conventions straight from Hollywood. Now along comes Hollywood in the flesh to finish the job. In this version of Fever Pitch Arsenal soccer gives way to Boston Red Sox baseball Firth turns into Jimmy Fallon and the boys behind the camera are none other than the notorious Farrelly brothers. Warning Expect projectile vomiting. A few scenes in when the vomit does hurl expect to be surprised too. In fact the Farrellys contributions make this flick somewhat better than it has a right to be and certainly better than it would have been if left solely in the scripted clutches of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel those crusty vets whove devoted their entire screenwriting career to tightening the same old bolts on the same old comic formula. Fever Pitch is best when departing from the text to indulge in throwaway lines and antic bits of business. Directing a script thats intent on never straying from the playing field of tired convention the Farrellys bless their sophomoric souls at least keep trying to sneak off into the locker room to snap a few towels at the bare-assed proprieties. Of course back on the playing field the box score makes for a predictable read. Ben the lowly high-school teacher (Fallon) meets Lindsey the corporate bigwig (Drew Barrymore) and surprises himself (not to mention us) by playing up to the competition. Their romance blooms in winter -- the first date finds her with a bad case of the flu and the Farrellys with their barf bag at the ready. Alas with the coming of spring true love must surmount the impediment of his slavish devotion to the Red Sox those perennial losers who hadnt won a World Series since shoes came with high buttons. Until last October that is and victory at long last. Apparently this real-life miracle necessitated some 11th-hour rejigging of the screenplay but what was good for the team proves unkind to the movie. The climax is now ludicrous at least to anyone put off by the sight of Barrymore in the midst of an actual playoff game against the dreaded Yankees clambering over the centre-field wall and racing across the diamond toward home and heart. Happily before we reach that climactic strikeout some of the locker-room humour hits a clean single or two. The picture is occasionally amusing on the subject of the murky depths to which fandom can descend. Like taping a game that you cant watch live then studiously blocking your ears to any wayward mention of the score -- in this dogged ritual the present gets deferred to the future where it pretends not to be the past (technology has freed the obsessive fan from the chains of time). Also the innocent wisdom of the non-fan is good for the odd chuckle. When Ben boasts that hes off to Florida for the Soxs spring-training session Lindsey is duly impressed ""Oh they let you train with them?"" These little moments caught in asides or tucked as sight gags into a love-is-in-the-air montage tend to work quite nicely. The Farrellys have less luck when they swing for the fences notably in a shower scene -- involving a naked Ben his buddies and a straight razor -- that might have been recycled from the cutting-room floor of Theres Something About Mary. Suddenly were in a whole other movie thats in grave danger of getting slapped with an R-rating -- tantamount to forfeiting the game in todays young teen market. As for the principals a quick word about Barrymore. Actors like athletes are slaves to their bodies and Drew appears to be on a regimen of anti-steroids. Shes slimmed way down her face has thinned out but the cameras verdict is mixed -- her new look has eroded more than a bit of her natural charm. The twitchy Fallon yet another SNL expatriate is a different matter entirely. His screen presence divides audiences somewhere considerably left of the middle -- you either tolerate him or you hate him. Hes tolerable here. Lets give the last word to the man who started all this. Pondering the rigid exclusivity of professional sport its rejection even of the very talented in favour only of the sublimely gifted Hornby writes with characteristic honesty ""Sport doesnt allow you to dream in the way that writing or acting or painting or middle management does."" Too true. As a motion picture Fever Pitch is merely competent yet still capable of cracking the Friday lineup and playing to big crowds. If this same movie were a baseball player it couldnt make the softball team in a sandlot league.

Full of sexual fracas-ing sparked by ""guy"" obsessions the Farrelly brothers latest movie is a sort of undercooked Diner. Not totally out in left field Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon find romance. 20th Century Fox You remember that 1982 classic right? Its male-female battling over how a music collection should be organized ""just so""? A woman forced to pass a premarital sports quiz? The difference is that Diner is artful while Pitch is merely an easy-going goof about romance vs. the mans Red Sox mania. (Related video Watch the Fever Pitch trailer) Poised even when upchucking or getting beaned by a line-drive foul ball Drew Barrymore carries the picture as a rising executive happy to be dating a teacher (Jimmy Fallon) until it gradually dawns on her that hes a different person come warm weather. This is when inherited Fenway Park box seats near the dugout determine Fallons every life action after his annual Florida spring-training odyssey with a pack of lonely-guy buds. About the movie Fever Pitch   1/2 (out of four) Stars Drew Barrymore Jimmy Fallon James B. Sikking JoBeth Williams Ione Skye Director Peter and Bobby Farrelly Distributor 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and some sensuality Opens Friday nationwide With Bobby and Peter Farrelly co-directing a script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel the movie has its share of idiosyncratic folks including a Barrymore dad (James B. Sikking) who experiments with bottled hair coloring. But the execution is mild and so is Fallons performance and he looks like a guy who might still keep a 1957 Frank Malzone Topps card next to the dental floss. Pitchs dominant subtext is 86 years of BoSox fan misery but the team did something rude when the movie was in production It came back from a 0-3 deficit to beat the Yankees in the playoffs and then cruised to a World Series win. Thanks to some rewriting on the run theres a particularly outlandish climax that even on a farcical level asks that we swallow a Babe Ruthian mass of hot dogs. For quality perspective note that Pitch is executive-produced by Nick Hornby who also wrote the soccer-themed source novel and the screenplay for a 1997 British film with the same title. By contrast other Hornby screen adaptations are About a Boy and High Fidelity-- superb comedies both and in Fidelitys case a treatise on male obsession with far more depth and even more laughs.

"Love steps to the plate - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Love steps to the plateMixing romance with baseball the Farrellys Fever Pitch displays winning ways.April 08 2005|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer A sweet and often hilarious movie about modern romance and its fearsome adversary modern life ""Fever Pitch"" was adapted from Nick Hornbys memoirs of obsessive soccer fandom. The hapless hero of the book is an Arsenal fan and the American version finds a neat parallel universe in Boston. Translated from the British its the story of a love triangle involving Jimmy Fallon Drew Barrymore and the Red Sox. Real life just provided the extra-happy ending.Ben (Jimmy Fallon) a boyish middle school math teacher meets the go-getting Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) on a field trip to her office where hes taken his honors geometry class to meet someone who has applied her math skills in the real world. An ambitious executive on the rise Lindsey doesnt immediately see a potential partner in Ben and shes somewhat taken aback when he asks her out. Their first date gets off to a disastrous start when Lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning -- and her sonorous retching provides the first clue that we are in fact watching a Farrelly brothers movie. But theres a discreetness -- a gurgling delicacy if you will -- to the grossness which somehow makes the scene feel intimately endearingly disgusting. Rather than accept Lindseys (rather urgent) request to reschedule Ben sticks around to play nurse. And orderly. And janitor. To watch Ben scrub the toilet and the dogs teeth (you dont want to know) after his love interest has passed out with a bucket next to her bed is to be won over. When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch she begins the long fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards. ""I date poodles basically"" she explains later to Ben who is clearly more the lovable mutt type. And to her friends she rationalizes ""Why does everything in my life have to be a trophy?""As is par for the course in movies like this one Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends. Lindseys strictest buddy the skinny rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland) insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if hes still single at 30. ""He should be with the wrong person by now"" she reasons scaring Lindsey with one of the nastiest dating horror stories ever told. Plump curly-haired Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) supply the optimistic view.Of course Robin is onto something -- Ben is a lifelong Red Sox fan a condition that in many ways resembles martyrdom. Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle Ben has organized his life around the season -- hes never missed a game. The relationship which has progressed without a hitch through the winter (we know so via the requisite happiness montage) hits a snag at the start of the season.As closely as the movie sticks to formula generics the script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel also manages to incorporate Hornbys lyrical analysis of sports fandom without resorting to voice-over or time-stopping speeches. The roots and significance of Bens devotion/affliction add unexpected dimension to a character that could have come across as merely immature and selfish and Fallon embodies the goofy but solid Ben with a lightness and tenderness thats quite winning. When the relationship hits the skids a wise fifth-grader suggests that he ponder the unrequited nature of his Sox love but its through his conflicts with Lindsey -- who has her own issues -- that Ben comes to understand what role the team has played in his life.Barrymore who seems to have grown up lately is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey particularly as she struggles to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs. For example duty requires that she get up during the introductory dinner with her parents and cover her boyfriends ears (hes holding lobster claws) when a loudmouth at a nearby table nearly reveals a score to a game hes taped for later. Things get more difficult when their priorities directly contradict each other and both Fallon and Barrymore do a nice job of rendering the complicated negotiations that make up the daily ins and outs of any relationship.""Fever Pitch"" has its share of inspired comedic moments -- Bens version of hitting rock bottom for instance is priceless. Even if you can see the formula paces coming from a mile away ""Fever Pitch"" is a warm and funny enough diversion to make up for it. Its a prettified view of love for sure but as Sox fans would surely attest sometimes fairy tale dreams do come true.Fever PitchMPAA rating PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and some sensualityTimes guidelines The sexual humor is mild.Drew Barrymore...LindseyJimmy Fallon...BenA 20th Century Fox release.

Fallon Farrellys Strike Out With Fever Pitch By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 8 2005; Page WE45 IT WOULD be tempting to call ""Fever Pitch"" a foul ball or some baseball term suggesting catastrophe but that would be too flattering. The movie -- an American baseball recasting of a British soccer novel -- never quite steps up to its own plate. Its almost too dull to pan. I said ""almost."" Please stand by while I summon the outrage. Cue the sound of crickets as I mentally rewind all those woeful scenes in which Drew Barrymore pretends to be attracted to Jimmy Fallon . . . Okay Ready Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore play a Red Sox-obsessed fan and his girlfriend in the disappointing comedy ""Fever Pitch.""

After all you may recall reading in these very pages a spirited thumbs-up review of ""High Fidelity"" starring John Cusack which successfully turned Hornbys novel about a circle of British record-store list-making nerds into a Chicago-based story with American clerks. You may also recall a dismissal of the English version of ""Fever Pitch"" the 1997 film starring Colin Firth which Hornby himself wrote. The reason? Hornbys novel was about a soccer fan whose hopeless love affair with the London team Arsenal was entertainingly long on lyrical detail. But the British ""Fever Pitch"" used soccer as a passing backdrop for the romance. I am betting that Mr. Hornby doesnt watch that DVD too often. The latest ""Fever Pitch"" turns an English Arsenal fan into an American Boston Red Sox fan a high school teacher named Ben Wrightman. Thats Fallon whose performance here suggests a chipmunk trying to shake off a heroin addiction. Hes doped up twitchy and constantly uncomfortable. Blessed with lifelong season tickets just behind the dugout at Fenway Park hes a rabid Soxer who has been to every inning since he was a kid and feels the collective pain of the Curse of the Bambino. For those of you not in the know the curse refers to the Red Soxs almost century-long World Series drought ever since selling Babe Ruth to the unspeakable diabolical New York Yankees. Ben meets and falls for successful business consultant Lindsey Meeks (Barrymore). But hes socially inept a man-child who cant maintain a relationship because of his mania. For no apparent reason Lindseys circle of girlfriends (culled from a Central Casting rolodex of Professional Girlfriends) urges her to date the hapless loser. So they embark on a formulaic relationship so predictable you wonder why filmmaking brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly (makers of ""Dumb amp; Dumber"" ""Theres Something About Mary"") even wanted to do this. There isnt one true Farrelly moment in the whole film not one little pratfall no hair incidents no nothing. Why did they bother? If its a shock to learn that the Farrellys were behind this its no surprise that the screenplay was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who charted a steady descent from the promising ""Splash"" to those awful Billy Crystal movies. With Fallon as a romantic lead and the Crystal-meisters popping pabulum into his mouth this movie never stood a chance. Even Boston Red Sox fans are likely to turn away in disgust. If this movie proves anything its that some good things are better left alone instead of being coated over with artificial cheese and served with nacho chips at the local mallplex.

Its one of those transatlantic adaptations transposing a memoir about an English guy (author Nick Hornby) and his obsession with soccer into a story about an American guy and his obsession with baseball. More accurately an all-consuming love of the Boston Red Sox.Its a romantic comedy directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly the Theres Something About Mary sibs who have been on a terrible run lately (Me Myself amp; Irene Shallow Hal Stuck on You).And its a Drew Barrymore romantic comedy without Adam Sandler which is kind of like a Katharine Hepburn romantic comedy without Spencer Tracy isnt it? Instead we get Jimmy Fallon a likable but lightweight Saturday Night Live alum pinch-hitting in the male lead.But guess what Fever Pitch works. At times it works brilliantly bringing the fanatic (and mostly male) world of baseball geekdom into collision with the planet where women strive for career success and true love usually with painful disappointment in one department or the other. (And sometimes both.)Fallon with his flat-speak delivery and nice-guy smile is Ben Wrightman a ninth-grade math teacher who seems in the winter months to be just about perfect. Hes smart hes funny hes sensitive. If his date gets nauseated (which she does) hell even clean her toilet bowl for her and take care of the dog.But come March when major- league baseball begins spring training Ben turns into another person a happy idiot head-to-toe in Red Sox regalia cheering on Johnny Damon and company from the bleachers of the Florida playing fields.With season tickets left to him by a dear departed uncle Ben is a 24/7 Sox zealot. His bedroom - emblazoned with an eBay stores worth of pennants pics and memorabilia - looks as if it belongs to an 11-year-old which is exactly how Ben acts.Barrymore bringing her ditsy charm to the role of a serious career gal is Lindsey Meeks a brainy biz-world exec climbing the corporate ladder two rungs at a time. Closing in on 30 shes someone who likes to be in control of the situation who cannot function without her cell phone - and who doesnt know the first thing about baseball.And so of course the components of a classic opposites-attract romance fall into place.There are corny and clunky moments in Fever Pitch to be sure. (The title cards that introduce various chapters of the story are too cute by half.) As Lindseys best buds Ione Skye KaDee Strickland and Marissa Jaret Winokur bring Sex and the City sisterhood to the table (and to the gym where they work out).Bens friends consist entirely of fellow Sox-aholics. And to be a Red Sox fan were told is to be ""one of Gods most pathetic creatures"" - someone who year in and year out pins his hopes on a team that teases him with promise taunts him with possibility and then chokes tanks dies.Of course last year the story ended differently dramatically some say miraculously. Thats the year that Fallon Barrymore and the Farrellys happened to be shooting in Fenway Park (""the heart and soul of Boston"") when the teams storied 86-year World Series losing streak came to an end. Veteran scriptwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel and the Farrellys adapted to this unexpected event and even turned it to their advantage.The end of Fever Pitch finds one of its main characters experiencing a crisis of faith as profound as Jobs. And it finds him making a sacrifice play that while it may not be entirely believable gives a fairy-tale finish to this sweet-natured tale of love and baseball.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.Fever Pitch (out of four stars)Produced by Amanda Posey Alan Greenspan Gil Netter Drew Barrymore Nancy Juvonen and Bradley Thomas directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel cinematography by Matthew F.

"Fever Pitch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fever-pitch ) Fever Pitch (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli I will be surprised if this film does well in New York City. Yankees fans accustomed to success are still smarting from last years humiliating debacle and a romantic comedy that capitalizes on the Red Soxs triumph is unlikely to pack theaters in the Five Boroughs. Fever Pitch is a curious mix of smarts and schmaltz. The unusual combination derives from the group of creative collaborators involved in the films development. The Farrelly Brothers operating outside of Theres Something About Mary territory prove that they are as capable of bringing a generic formulaic romantic comedy to the screen as they are of producing something more edgy. (Only one scene a involving vomit and a dog a can be called a ""Farrelly moment."") The screenwriters are the team of Lowell Ganz amp; Babloo Mandel who have elevated fake sentimentality to a high art. Their tendency towards artificiality is mitigated somewhat by the fact that theyre adapting from a book by Nick Hornby (who retains an Executive Producer credit). As I have often said the key to a romantic comedy working is often whether the filmmakers invest the audience in the plight of the main characters. Do we have a rooting interest in these two getting together? This is something the Farrellys accomplish. And considering that the male lead is played by the insufferable Jimmy Fallon that may be a more significant achievement that it appears to be at first glance. Drew Barrymore has proven herself in this genre but it takes a shift of perspective to pull for someone as inherently irritating as Fallon. To his credit the ex-SNL player hides most of his rough edges and manages only to aggravate when hes trying too hard to get a laugh. His slapstick scenes arent just unfunny they are embarrassing. But the Farrellys keep these to a minimum. Fallon is otherwise palatable and we believe in his relationship with Barrymores character. Fever Pitch is the meet cute/fall in love/break up/happily ever after story of Lindsey (Barrymore) and Ben (Fallon). (Did you expect the movie to take some other path?) Their first encounter occurs when Ben a math teacher brings a group of select students to meet Lindsey a high-profile executive who does something with numbers (her exact job description is left vague). Ben is attracted to her and timorously asks her out only to be rebuffed. Afterwards Lindsey realizes that she may have made a mistake. Ben isnt like her past boyfriends but that could be a good thing. Maybe what she needs is a nice guy not someone driven by corporate ambition. So she calls him back and tells him she has changed her mind. For most of the winter the blossoming relationship moves along smoothly but come March Lindsey discovers that she has a rival for Bens affections - Spring Training. Ben isnt just a Boston Red Sox fan he is a Rabid Red Sox Follower. Suddenly Lindsey finds herself planning events and trips around Red Sox home games and begins to wonder whether Ben values the team more than her. The film provides each character with three or four friends as a support group but none of these characters is sufficiently developed to warrant more than a passing mention. (If one of Lindseys gal pals looks familiar thats because shes played by one-time ""it"" girl Ione Sky the object of John Cusacks obsession in Say Anything.) In Fever Pitch the only ones who really matter are Lindsey and Ben - and of course the 25 players comprising the Red Sox (a few of whom make actual appearances rather than just showing up in game archive footage). Sports widows will probably relate to Lindseys plight and long-suffering fans of many teams will see reflections of themselves in Ben. (By the way baseball fans in Boston no longer have the right to consider themselves ""long-suffering"" - they lost that privilege last October. If you want that moniker youll have to move on to another city. Try Chicago or Philadelphia.) The intelligent aspect of Fever Pitchs script comes from the way it balances its various elements. Ben is shown to be extreme but the film never openly mocks sports addicts. Bens love of the Red Sox is not belittled and Lindsey tries her best to accommodate him. Its only when he turns nasty as a result of it that she has difficulty coping. Reality it seems forced a re-write of the films ending. Handled better the ""have your cake and eat it too"" resolution might have been more satisfying but the finale seems rushed. Having had the actors and a few cameras at the Red Soxs first World Series victory since the 1910s might have seemed like manna from heaven but whatever footage the Farrellys captured is underused. Everyone except Yankees fans will feel shortchanged. And with George Steinbrenner paying ever-steeper payrolls theyll probably have their own feel-good story to tell in the near-future.

"Stranger than fiction - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Stranger than fictionWhats more unlikelyThat the Red Sox won the World Series or that the Farrellys made a sweet pratfall-free romance in Fever Pitch?FEVER PITCH (star)(star)(star)April 08 2005|By Allison Benedikt| Tribune staff reporter.The gall of Peter and Bobby Farrelly. To think that a romantic comedy might work absent a sleazy wager (guy wins bet for taking village wallflower to prom only to fall in love) or maddening miscommunication (girl sees boyfriend lunching with leggy lady dumps him only to realize later that Legs is his sister) takes a lot of chutzpah.Hypothetically the brothers Farrelly--they of Cameron Diazs stiff bangs (""Theres Something About Mary"") and Gwyneth Paltrows padded behind (""Shallow Hal"")--would not be anyones first choice to direct ""Fever Pitch"" a sweet faux pas-free Red Sox-adoring love story based on Nick Hornbys memoir of the same name (though not of the same sport Hornbys a rabid soccer fan). But with a romantic and comic touch not often applied to romantic comedy--go figure--and a fans exuberance for Americas pastime Mrs. Farrellys boys have got themselves a natural and heartfelt screen romance one that develops over time and without the aid of Peter Gabriel.""Fever Pitch"" opens in 1980 Boston with a warning Be careful kid--theyll break your heart. The line spoken by a professional Red Sox fan to his young nephew Ben on the ride home from Bens first Fenway experience comes too late. Wide-eyed and pint-sized Ben fell in love with the team at the top of the first.Flash forward to 2004 off-season. Some things have changed (Ben played by Jimmy Fallon is now a high school math teacher) others have not (the Red Sox are still plagued by the Curse though--please dont read if you TiVod game four of last years World Series and still havent watched it--not for long). Tasked with shaping young minds Ben takes his advanced students to meet Lindsey Meeks (Drew Barrymore) a mathlete cum business consultant whose charm and wit are matched only by her adorable love of algebra.Theres an initial spark--not an avalanche of passion a spark--and eventually the two make a date. One date turns to two and then three and soon a relationship blooms in Boston with all the uncertainty and awkwardness a new couple can manage.""Anything Id say about you would be an understatement"" Ben tells Lindsey in a moment of bare affection--the kind that makes those of us in the cocooning stage of a relationship commonly referred to as marriage bitterly nostalgic. Fallon toned-down and twitch-free and Barrymore as offbeat a beauty as ever are absolutely charming in these sentimental moments benefiting from Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandels subtle script (another in the screenwriting teams long line of successful comedies-of-substance including one of my favorites ""Parenthood"").But dont get too comfortable. It wouldnt be a proper Hornby adaptation without Peter Pan personified. From Hugh Grants trust-funder in ""About a Boy"" to John Cusacks mix tape-maniac in ""High Fidelity"" Hornbys leading men consistently suffer from the flying man-childs notorious syndrome. Ben is no different with reversion rearing its immature head every spring.See Ben inherited his uncles season tickets--two seats right behind the dugout--and his rites of spring annually include a wacky ticket-dividing ceremony with his Yankee-game coveting pals an annual trip down to Florida for spring training and a breakup. Ben has never managed to keep a girlfriend through baseball season. And as the birds start chirping he must reveal himself to Lindsey.""I"" he says with a mix of trepidation and pride ""am a Red Sox fan."" This much she knew what with Ben still sleeping on Sox pillow cases and keeping his phone cradled in a plastic mitt. The magnitude of Bens dedication is at first endearing even romantic.The Farrellys best work comes now. Its early in the season theres still an air of hope at Fenway and Lindsey has become Bens ultimate game day pal leaving work early to meet him at the park neglecting her own career for Curt Schillings and subsisting on a diet of hot dogs and peanuts.The Red Sox organization granted the Farrellys 10 days to shoot at Fenway five of which were game days and the energy of the park and fans is palpable as Ben and Lindsey toss back beers with Bens summer family and sing ""Sweet Caroline"" at the top of their lungs bobbing along with the crowd. Im not sure why this all works so well--maybe its because Red Sox fever was real or because sports has a way of embracing cliches making them not just digestible but euphoric.But as summer turns to fall Lindseys backside takes a backseat to Johnny Damons and as much as she doesnt want to be That Girl that girl is jealous. Some non-sports cliches unfold--particularly grating is the presence of a handsome new guy at Lindseys office and a late period--and Bens true passion threatens to overwhelm his true love.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBrit author Nick Hornby is at the top of his gameJune 8 2005Red Sox curseAugust 7 2004Red Sox Bomb MetsOctober 20 1986Graffanino big fan of Red Sox diehardsOctober 4 2005Find More Stories AboutWorld SeriesNick HornbyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-04-08/entertainment/0504080238_1_peter-and-bobby-farrelly-fan-red-sox,200,feverpitch30,feverpitch,chicagotribune

It was about the religion of sports fandom about how football can eclipse all other meaningful relationships in a mans world and how a man can feel perfectly justified letting it do so. And it got it all so hilariously mercilessly and terrifyingly right that even if you happened to root for Liverpool -- or perchance believe that proper football is played for touchdowns not goals -- Hornbys words seemed to be printed on Mylar. Now Fever Pitch is a movie directed by the Farrelly brothers and adapted by that old-reliable comedy team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (NightShift Splash City Slickers).The setting has been transposed to Boston the sport of choice to baseball and the team in question to -- who else? -- the Boston Red Sox whose 86-year ""Curse of the Bambino"" made Arsenals two-decade losing streak look as diminutive as the right-field line at Candlestick Park. The possessor of the fatal fan attraction is now Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon) a high school geometry teacher who hasnt missed a home game or (coincidentally?) had a long-term relationship in more than a decade. As Fever Pitch begins in the fall of 2003 Bens carefully ordered universe is ruptured by the intrusion of a beautiful businesswoman named Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) who first encounters Ben leading his students on an off-campus field trip and as they start to date gradually realizes the obsessive degree of his extracurricular activity. Will there be enough room in this relationship for man woman and Green Monster? No matter Hornbys own involvement in bringing Fever Pitch to the screen -- hes credited as an executive producer -- the film ranks among the most specious acts of literary adaptation since Troy claimed to have something to do with The Iliad. And that high infidelity may well be the least of the movies problems. Even on its own terms Fever Pitch strikes out. Despite its setting the film clearly isnt the work of real sports fans; it lacks the fundamental love of the game -- any game -- that graces Ron Sheltons sports pictures. And the more Fever Pitch strives to manufacture Bens baseball mania through bits of costume and set design exhumed from the studio prop warehouse the more hollow it seems. It doesnt feel Bens mad enthusiasm in its bones and so neither do we -- a fatal flaw in a movie that offers baseball both as the main characters raison detre and his chief antagonist. The actors dont help much either. With his perpetually untucked undershirts tousled hair and husky-mumbly voice Fallon tries to coast by on the reputation of cool irreverence he earned during his six seasons on Saturday Night Live but projects none of the sense of a vibrant inner character that Adam Sandler (who would have been perfect) does even in a subpar part. Barrymore who also produced the film is chipper and lovely to look at though in what has been heralded by some as her first ""grown-up"" movie role shes about as mature as a teenager playing dress-up in her moms business suit and her perky mannerisms quickly grow tiresome. (For the record Barrymore was immeasurably more grown-up in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.)Neither she nor Fallon receives much direction by the Farrellys who are at an utter loss working this far removed from the wanton slapstick of Kingpin Theres Something About Mary and a couple of other movies they made before they turned all maudlin and PC on us (ShallowHal Stuck on You).Which was still preferable to Fever Pitch a romantic comedy so unfunny charmless and hopelessly ordinary that Arthur Hiller might have signed his name to it. If every cloud -- even the Red Soxs -- has a silver lining Fever Pitchs is that Hornbys memoir was filmed once before in 1997 by the British director David Evans with Hornby himself doing the script. Evans Fever Pitch was never properly released in this country -- in the years preceding the success of Bend it Like Beckham Hollywood rested assured that English football (or soccer if you must) was anathema to American moviegoers. But it got right most of what the Farrellys get wrong and is built around a brilliant performance by Colin Firth that may be the richest in the screens growing gallery of Hornby man-boys (a formidable bunch that also includes John Cusack in High Fidelity and Hugh Grant in About a Boy).No doubt the whiff of a marketing opportunity will prompt cable broadcasters to begin running it again and video stores to replenish their supplies of the DVD. So stay home and watch it. Or better yet read the book.

The Farrelly name to the extent that it remains a brand sets up expectations -- of a raucous sports satire of laughter on steroids -- that this winningly low-volume and humane little movie cant satisfy. In comedy weve all been conditioned to seek out the brash and the obvious the fractious situational mix-ups the Adam Sandler baby-men the goo in the hair (thanks Peter and Bobby). Performers are rewarded for their winking hipster absurdism and so you might assume that Jimmy Fallon a former Saturday Night Live star now trying to break into the Sandler/Ferrell stratosphere would be packaged as another wild-eyed postmodern misfit -- a goof-meister in italics. In Fever Pitch though Fallon gets a chance to be that rarest of creatures a comic actor who plays it straight. As Ben Wrightman who teaches honors geometry to ninth graders Fallon doesnt overdo the stammering dorkiness; hes nervous and sincere in a way that makes him a sweetly infectious Everyguy. A movie star cant just be pretty. His features have to knead together in an interesting way and Fallon with those felt-tip-marker eyebrows that chiseled nose and smile that make him look like Pinocchio the moment after he was transformed into a real boy has an off-kilter cuteness. His anxious mental agility and eagerness to please make you root for him because they come from a childlike place that cant be faked. The film is clever about setting up Bens romance with Lindsey Meeks (Drew Barrymore) a yuppie with a flirty grin and a vaguely defined high-powered job whom he meets when he takes a handful of students on a tour of her office. According to Lindseys 21st-century rule book the fact that Ben teaches high school should make her run the other way (she must earn multiples of what he does). Yet hes handsome and in his scruffy and tentative fashion rather witty and were asked to enjoy his successful courtship as a symbolic victory for squarely dressed earnest geeks everywhere. That how-ever is a mere prelude to Bens big secret which is that he has already given his heart away. Hes married to the Boston Red Sox. Based on an essay memoir by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity) Fever Pitch was adapted by the veteran screenwriting team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (Splash) who have transplanted Hornbys tale of love soccer and suburban England into a tale of love baseball and Boston proper. This is the rare Farrelly film the brothers didnt generate themselves yet its a perfect addition to their gallery of men who havent grown up and the women they must remake their infantile souls for. Lindsey is more than happy to meet Bens Red Sox fixation halfway as she joins him in the stands with his ""family"" of fellow fans. She graciously endures his Red Sox pillowcases his outbreaks of freakish behavior like yelling in a restaurant lest he hear the results of an away game that he has yet to view on tape. It turns out though that there is no halfway. Ben wont part with the Sox not even for an amorous weekend in Paris. When Lindsey gets struck on the head by a foul ball his reaction -- he high-fives the guy who nabs the ball -- is not what is meant by love being blind. Fever Pitch provokes tender chuckles rather than guffaws yet you can feel the Farrelly touch in their eye for detail Ben and his friends smelling the package of season tickets the ingenious way that the 2004 season has been woven into the story. The biggest surprise is that the film is understated rather than exaggerated. Fallon brings off the neat trick of making Ben not a laughable sportsaholic but a lyrical young romantic with his wires crossed. Theres nothing macho in Bens worship of the Sox. His late uncle left him lifetime tickets just behind the dugout and he has the starry-eyed excitement of a true believer. What he loves about the players the contests the mood of Fenway Park is that they represent a perfect world. Even the curse of the Bambino the fabled myth of why Boston (until last year of course) hadnt won a championship since 1918 is a secret source of comfort It testifies to the purity of his obsession -- the ultimate in sports loyalty. In Fever Pitch Bens baseball ardor becomes a funny moving metaphor for the arrested males inability to surrender himself entirely to love. High Fidelity featured the same setup with rock fervor instead of baseball only this is a far more urgent variation. The two actors are wonderfully matched. Barrymore has never lost her honey-glazed cuddliness but theres a hint of melancholy to her now and it roots her big go-for-broke scene at Fenway Park a moment of the deepest cornball perfection. Its been a while since a movie made the game of love this winning.
