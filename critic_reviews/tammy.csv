Watch a clip from the film ""Tammy."" Starring Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon and Kathy Bates. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) By John Anderson July 2 2014 503 p.m. ET 8 COMMENTS In the crude and calamitous ""Tammy"" which stars Melissa McCarthy and was directed by her husband actor Ben Falcone the popular actress plays a raunchy disheveled overbearing undereducated all-but-unemployable woman with a dearth of social skills and a wealth of anger-management problems. Ms. McCarthy whose resume includes ""Bridesmaids"" ""The Heat"" ""Identity Thief"" and ""The Hangover Part III"" has become synonymous with such roles. Shes also the new Katharine Hepburn. No the two dont look alike. Nor are they associated with remotely the same kind of movie. But from the 1930s to the 80s Hepburn was a paragon of independent womanhood an actress who ran her career like a military operation and exerted iron control over her image. And yet regardless of how saucily liberated her characters may have been at the beginning of a film by the end credits they had usually surrendered to stereotype getting spanked by Spencer Tracy burning his breakfast or swooning at some altar. More Reviews Earth to Echo Venus in Fur A Hard Days Night Ms. McCarthy who helped bring the plus-size couple back to prime-time comedy (""Mike amp; Molly"") gets a lot of mileage out of being a maverick. But if representing the unconventional and unconventional-looking female movie star means playing the vulgarian time and time again in movies that merely confirm class-based cliches how liberating is that? Feminist icon Hepburn gave the audience what it demanded. Likewise Ms. McCarthy. The fact that ""Tammy"" was written by the actress and her director suggests a scene around a dinner table at which two pragmatic people sat down and decided to ride the fat-girl vehicle till its wheels fall off. That Ms. McCarthy is likable and naturally funny makes amusing at least some of what transpires in ""Tammy."" But the movies principal intention is to make you laugh at a loser and revel in scenes from which polite people would instinctively turn away. Driving her smoking (literally) compact to her job at the local fast-food restaurant Tammy hits a deer which wrecks the car which makes her late which prompts her sniveling boss (Mr. Falcone) to fire her which results in a geyser of vitriol a hurling of hamburgers and an indication that our heroine requires medication and/or leather restraints. Her life gets worse when she goes home and surprises her feckless husband (Nat Faxon) with the comely neighbor (Toni Collette). Tammy declares shes leaving town. But of course she has no way to leave. The brightest light in ""Tammy"" is Susan Sarandon playing a bit older than her years as Tammys savvy sexy grandmother Pearl who agrees to lend her granddaughter the getaway car if she gets to go along. Thus begins the inevitable road trip aka the screenwriters friend a way of abandoning sustained storytelling in favor of wacky incidents and madcap antics. Tammy riding a jet ski into a dock; Pearl having car sex with a guy named Earl (Gary Cole); Tammy putting the moves on the clearly uninterested son of Earl (Mark Duplass); Tammy robbing a fast-food restaurant to bail Pearl out of jail. Eventually they make their way to the home of their cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates) who is hosting the worlds biggest lesbian Fourth of July party at which both Pearl and Tammy insult each other in such horrifying fashion that you fully expect them never to talk to each other again. The bad news They make up. And keep talking to us.

MICHAEL TACKETT BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF TammyStarring Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon Directed by Ben Falcone Rated R for language including sexual references Running time 1 hour 36 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitMelissa McCarthy scrapes bottom in this witless road movie about a hapless woman who tries to change her life by hitting the highway with her neer-do-well grandma. Grade D Its way funnier to think of ""Tammy"" as a goofy cross-generational ""Thelma and Louise"" than it is to watch this limp weird and downright scuzzy movie. Twenty-three years after she played Louise Susan Sarandon portrays a randy alcoholic grandmother named Pearl. She goes on the road with her misfit granddaughter the title character (Melissa McCarthy) after Tammy loses her burger-joint job and finds her husband cheating with a neighbor. Just like Thelma and Louise Tammy and Pearl end their journey at a natural wonder Niagara Falls instead of the Grand Canyon. This movie too includes a couple of mates for the Mses. - not Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen exactly but a fellow alcoholic (Gary Cole) for Pearl and his gentlemanly son (Mark Duplass) for Tammy. The robbery of a fast-food restaurant subs for the convenience-store holdup. And to cement its feminist identity the movie throws in an alpha-female lesbian Pearls cousin (Kathy Bates) who with her svelte lover (Sandra Oh) tosses a fabulous Fourth of July bash and delivers tough love to Tammy. I was no fan of ""Thelma and Louise"" but ""Tammy"" as entertainment drives off a cliff within seconds not hours. Its obnoxious when it means to be comic and excruciating when it wants to be moving. McCarthy co-wrote the script with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed the movie and as an actor contributes a vicious caricature of a burger-franchise manager. Its a vanity production for the star though she plays the kind of loser who stuffs burgers in her pockets on her shame walk out of work then contaminates the rest of the food and badmouths it to the customers. Were meant to view her crass putdowns of other people and her relentless eating as overcompensation for unhappiness. When shes thoughtless or destructive toward property and most people shes at least super-loyal to her equally feckless grandma. Pearl forgets that shes a diabetic while she goads Tammy or eggs her on. Its no surprise that we ultimately see a softer prettier Tammy. The film mixes the maudlin with the slapstick-mundane. Its mostly one witless sex joke (starring Pearl) and one low-comic set piece (starring Tammy) after another. Not even Sarandon keeps her dignity in a movie that trolls for guffaws - by having Pearl flash her breasts - and vies for tears - by having her sleep as if dead. Sarandon descends to McCarthys level. ""Tammy"" is certain to catalyze a new round of debates over whether McCarthys heft is a plus a minus or merely a plus size. Rather than develop agility and grace like Fatty Arbuckle McCarthy goes straight for bull-in-the-china-shop bravado. Her woefully limited physical as well as psychological comedy is based on her size and appetite. Its meant to be uproarious that Tammy says shes irresistible. No wonder writers and critics sometimes focus on McCarthys weight. Arbuckle refused to do scenes that highlighted his fat like getting stuck in a window or a doorway. Not McCarthy. In the would-be hilarious robbery scene the laughs are designed to come from Tammys inability to soar over the counter or resist packaged pie. She comes on like the brash needy misanthropic love child of Rosie O Donnell and Krusty the Clown. The high jinks and the pathos are both dead weight.

"Rex Reed Reviews Tammy | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movies Melissa McCarthy Gives Tammy Her All But Its Nowhere Near Enough Road-trip farce is a grotesque grab-bag of farting belching snoring and sadism By Rex Reed  07/03/14 1244pm Susan Sarandon left and Melissa McCarthy in Tammy. The good news is that Tammy is not a crappy remake of the 1957 Tammy movie with Debbie Reynolds that spawned three sequels and a TV comedy series. The bad news is that this one is much worse. Its a desperate and brainless vehicle for Melissa McCarthy which she wrote herself with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed with all the efficiency and verve of an abandoned Volkswagen on the Jersey Turnpike. There isnt a single shred of evidence that either of them has one iota of talent in the world of filmmaking. Tammy is not just a celebration of everything vulgar and stupid in the dumbing down of American movies. Its a rambling pointless and labored attempt to cash in on Ms. McCarthys fan base without respect for any audience with a collective IQ of 10. And its about as funny as a liver transplant. TAMMY (0/4 stars) Written by Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone Directed by Ben Falcone Starring Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon and Kathy Bates Running time 96 min. With all due respect I bow to her ability to pander to the lowest instincts of her groupies by making box office obesity profitable. So fool that I am I went to Tammy hoping for the best and ready to give Ms. McCarthy every benefit of the doubt. What I got was one hour and 36 minutes of farting belching snoring and the kind of violence a sadist would perpetrate against someone in a wheelchair. One thing you gotta admit however amiable and attractive she might be in real life the star makes no attempt to beautify herself onscreen. Nothing shes ever done before will prepare you for what she looks like here with swollen feet tag-sale clothes and hair that resembles a nesting place for field mice. Working as a shuffling nose-picking waitress for a greasy junk-food chain called Topper Jacks and looking like shes been wolfing down most of the grease all by herself she gets sacked wrecks her Toyota when she broadsides a deer and returns home to find her cheating husband cooking dinner for a new bedmate (the over-employed Toni Collette). Tammy moves out announces to her mother (Allison Janney) shes leaving town and hits the road. Susan Sarandon is hopelessly miscast as the drunken nymphomaniac grandmother with 6700 in cash and a battered Cadillac who decides to go with her. The preposterous generation-gap road trip that follows is no Thelma and Louise. Along the way they drink themselves unconscious stuff themselves on barbecue buy ugly souvenirs get laid wreck a speedboat and land in jail. To make her grandmas bail after she plies a couple of teenagers with illegal drugs and alcohol Tammy robs another Topper Jacks with a paper bag over her head and they both end up at a lesbian jamboree that sets the LGBT movement back 20 years. At one point Grandma kicks her granddaughter out of their crummy motel room and forces Tammy to sleep on the ground while she has sex with a man she picks up in a barbecue joint and a raccoon eats Tammys candy bar. In the end Tammy lands in federal lockup Grandma leaves her AA meetings in the old folks home and all of the characters reunite on top of Niagara Falls. Unfortunately none of it makes one bit of sense and any display of genuine humor is replaced by Ms. McCarthys trademark sitcom technique which passes for acting. Spitting snarling and making Halloween-mask faces her one-dimensional performance is as exaggerated as a Punch and Judy show with members of the groaning audience wishing they were doing the punching. Expecting more from a Melissa McCarthy movie is an errand for fools but Susan Sarandon is another matter entirely. This woman won an Oscar already Shes no stranger to taking good money to make bad movies but has she forgotten how to read a script? One wonders what they paid to lure her into this swill. Even in a ratty gray wig and sporting wrinkles applied by the makeup department she looks younger than everyone else but also simultaneously miserable. So does everyone else in the criminally wasted cast including Mark Duplass Kathy Bates Gary Cole Sandra Oh and Dan Aykroyd. Who can blame them? The screenplay is sub-mental. In interviews Ms. McCarthy and her husband admit it was written in moving cars on napkins and toilet paper. I believe it. The characters seem hateful and retarded but maybe theyre just dumb as tree stumps. ""What have you ever done thats important?"" Tammy blurts out in a moment of pique. Grandma ""I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon."" Tammy ""On his bike?"" Grandma ""That was Lance Armstrong."" Tammy insists she doesnt know anything about his brother. Oh boy. These are the jokes and even a pro like Ms. Sarandon sinks when she tries to make them work. The purpose of every Melissa McCarthy movie is the same Take the most repulsive loser you can conjure up and make her sympathetic and lovable proving you can find beauty in anything if you look hard enough. This one fails to even do that. Instead of following any kind of linear narrative the script limps from one phony vignette to the next linked only by a different road sign. Without structure trajectory or logic the result becomes tragically boring. In the chaos I applaud the star--not for any discernible talent but for sheer stamina. Her entire performance--if you can call it that--consists of being slapped slugged dumped in various lakes and rivers and bounced off walls and pavements like a big rubber Shmoo doll. She isnt smart imaginative or creative enough to be a real female clown like Lucille Ball. Nothing that resembles a fresh approach to slapstick farce ever engages the mind or the eye. Instead she recycles every fatso cliche from John Candy to Totie Fields which only turns the viewer cynical. This movie is so bad it almost makes me take back everything I said about Identity Thief and The Heat. It would be a nice surprise to someday find this woman in something with enough substance to prove if she can act. But to paraphrase one of Bette Davis famous lines why wish for the moon when we have the cheese?

"Riding in Cars With Bores Why Is Melissa McCarthy Doing This to Herself? << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Riding in Cars With Bores Why Is Melissa McCarthy Doing This to Herself? Movies July 2 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Melissa McCarthy plays the title part in Tammy. Not too far in she winds up standing on a kitchen countertop. By this point a deer has totaled her car. Shes been fired from her fast-food job after showing up late and disheveled. Upon exiting she tosses ketchup packets at her manager and rubs her bloody sweating face all over a bag of hamburger buns. She comes home only to find her husband (Nat Faxon) making dinner for their neighbor (Toni Collette). Smelling the affair theyre having she comes further unhinged. Before he can tell her hes leaving she screams that she wants a divorce and runs into the kitchen which has been framed in a wide shot so that McCarthy still in the filthy fast-food uniform is shown standing up on the counter while Faxon and Collette look up at her. Its the only comedically wondrous image in the movie McCarthys girth has a grubby majesty -- a deep-fryer Falstaff. Half a minute later she jumps to the floor lands hard and falls over and the audience cracks up. Thats pretty much the joke Shes fat and shes nuts. McCarthy produced and also wrote the script with her husband Ben Falcone -- who serves as the director nominally. They give it a tired-but-manageable setup but then promise a road movie for Tammy and her randy alcoholic grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) which is right about where I detrained. The makeup artists have given Sarandon gray hair and intermittently swollen ankles. They might say theyve tried to age her but her agelessness keeps radiating through. Its like passing off good wine as Kool-Aid. Sarandon comes up with a stuttering gait. Still however old this woman is supposed to be isnt old enough. She and McCarthy spend most of the movie together and you never believe the relationship. Even with the makeup they could still be sisters. The film needs you to believe that Pearl is ancient and that her making out with a horny farmer (Gary Cole) in the back of her car is gross -- and there might be a class of moviegoer thats like Tammy cringing at the sight of Pearls hand pressed against the rear window. Sarandons sensuousness just underscores the parade of incongruities. Allison Janney plays Tammys mother and Pearls daughter which only exacerbates the casting confusion. By the time Kathy Bates steals the movie as Pearls sensible straight-talking lesbian cousin you dont know whats going on. This raggedy project exists only because McCarthy opted to cash in some stardom chips. I dont know what limits the studio placed on her and Falcone but the entire movie seems preemptively safe. Its probable that the only major risk is opening a movie on Fourth of July weekend with a female cast that averages about 52 years old. Thats also something to cheer. McCarthy is an actual bankable star and shes used her gathering clout to make a movie whose two funniest gags involve a slumped-over Sarandon. McCarthy is in the Will Smith and Michael Bay slot but feels no need to dress for the occasion Shes mostly in T-shirts sweats and Crocs. Her rise is more or less simultaneous with Kevin Harts which implies that weve been missing what for the movies are comically built loudmouths. But their talents are being misused. With the exception of this winters About Last Night Harts been running amok for four years. McCarthy gets marginally better material but needs a leash too. But I think the studios are looking at the profit margins of their hits and thinking Let them do what they want. What someone should do is find a reason to handcuff her to him. Anyone working on a Midnight Run remake Nows your chance. In the meantime we have Tammy. What hope should we have though for any road trip whose car gets wedged between two trees? Theres a mild stab at adventure that turns Tammy and Pearl into outlaws. Sarandon of course was half of one of the great movie road trips and there are moments when Tammy seems poised to evoke it. But the bits of sex and crime dont build to much let alone something as anarchic as Thelma amp; Louise. Theres no screenwriting here just loads of sketch comedy like McCarthys attempt to rob a restaurant while wearing a takeout bag on her head. Maybe a dumb movie like this is possible because of Thelma amp; Louise. They went over the edge so women like McCarthy no longer have to. But a female energy rules Tammy. Once Pearl and her granddaughter make it to Batess estate -- where she and her girlfriend (Sandra Oh) throw an all-girl July 4 rager -- youre excited that McCarthy and Falcone will take the movie somewhere new and weird that the rager will rock. Instead the ladies commit a Viking burial of a jet ski (dont ask) while Tammy maintains a flirtation with that farmers son (Mark Duplass). This movie doesnt know what its about. Neither does McCarthys comedy. She continues to do the equivalent of cannonballing into a pool drenching us laughing. But her ""stupid blue-collar fat lady"" routine is now a shtick. Sometimes it gets an ideal foil like Kristen Wiig or Sandra Bullock; but on her own youre left to wonder whether McCarthys success is an extension of privilege. Could Queen Latifah or Octavia Spencer practice the same nutso buffoonery and be the box-office draw McCarthys become? They dont really have the luxury to dare. In that regard McCarthys performance of unself-conscious uncouthness celebrates the freedom to be undignified. And still its being misused. The funniest line in Tammy is a throwaway. While pouring gasoline on a car (dont ask Part 2) McCarthy says ""Four dollars a gallon. Thanks Obamacare."" The flavor of her delivery is Tin Pan Alley orphan. A good movie a very smart one could do wonders with that idiot persona. A great heartless satirist -- Armando Iannucci say -- should rope her into his or her circus. In the meantime were stuck with gutless sentimentality. At some point the lunacy tends to break down and McCarthys characters start to ask for forgiveness to be loved. Her obnoxiousness is supposed to be tolerable because it has arisen from some wounded place. Identity Thief another road-trip comedy gave her an absurd last-minute sob story. This movie tries too. McCarthy can do the blubbering required to sell pathology but ultimately she doesnt have anything truly psychological to play. Her violent blend of vulgarity stupidity and rotund physicality have made her a star but its uneasy laughing. That body type is close to normal in the U.S. (Tammy showcases several full figures) but thats not how McCarthy is letting the movies depict her body. Over and over McCarthys way into a joke in Tammy is through food -- pies and Cheetos and an uncooperative vending machine -- and brutal almost narcissistic social awkwardness. Theres charisma driving all of her flopping around and bingeing and lashing out. But theres also something deeper that these movies seem afraid to explore -- a disorder. Tammy is told she needs to grow up; basically to stop acting like Jerry Lewis Will Ferrell and Seth Rogen. That misses the problem. Why isnt anyone telling her to see a shrink?

Shes one of the films producers; she co-wrote the script with Ben Falcone (her husband) who directed; and though Im honor-bound to report that ""Tammy"" is not a very funny comedy its worth adding that in substance its hardly a comedy at all. The title character works at a fast-food joint in a small town in Illinois. One day she loses her job and catches her husband (Nat Faxon) cheating on her. So she decides to leave town but has no car and no cash to travel with. However her grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) has both and she takes Tammy on a road trip--destination Niagara Falls--that quickly gets sidetracked into real trouble. Essentially McCarthy applies her unique comic style--a fast-talking raucous routine of boastful vanity and socially awkward swagger--to a near-neo-noir plot of a lower-middle-class downward spiral. She and Falcone came up with a story that highlights the essential element that distinguishes Tammys tale from sheer tragedy and rescues it for comedy namely its middle-class setting which is defined as a safety net of prosperous and secure family connections and friends who can appear when needed as the deus ex cash machine to keep the movies plot in progress. The subject of ""Tammy"" is the very definition of the middle class--its nonexistence with one foot slipping into poverty dependency and despair and the other perilously clung to by those whove climbed to higher economic echelons and reach out a helping hand (and then with safety momentarily restored offer a lecture in self-sufficiency). In McCarthy and Falcones strangely harrowing vision a middle-class person is a poor person with a rich relative. The movies double identity is its charm and its curse. Without its sociological setup its consistent comedic failings would be irredeemable; but its comedic failings turn its unusual and original perspective into a burden. McCarthy and Falcone have a clear sense of what they want to say but Falcones directorial perspective is vague. The gags remain scattershot the camera never seems to be in right place or rather seems to be no place and he lets McCarthy slip out of character and leave behind the blindly reckless person who drives the plot. At those moments she morphs spontaneously into someone more sympathetic and self-aware. An irrepressibly exuberant performer McCarthy surrounds herself with a cast that similarly bursts with idiosyncrasy starting with Sarandon who lends to Pearls ardor and recklessness an antsy energy that converges to her seeming oversize eyes which at times nearly pop through the screen. Kathy Bates as an entrepreneur; Gary Cole and Mark Duplass as a father-and-son team of farmers one shambling and the other poised; and Dan Aykroyd in a tightrope walk of a near-cameo all exist in performance spaces of their own each doing admirable and emblematic work that stands out like an audition tape through no fault of the actors. The character of Tammy is a sublime wreck who generates wreckage all around her even as the picking up of pieces glows with nobility. The premise that McCarthy and Falcone came up with is grand even Chaplinesque while the realization of it is slapdash and unintegrated. The movie never touches ground. The implicit tragedy doesnt cut deep and the blatant comedy offers only a handful of chuckles. ""Tammy"" is an object lesson in the art of directing which is all it would have taken to turn this near-miss into an instant classic. Though that may be true of most mediocre movies.

Kathy Bates recently starred on American Horror Story. By Peter Rainer Film critic July 2 2014 Save for later Saved Tammy stars Melissa McCarthy (r.) and Susan Sarandon (l.). Saeed Adyani/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Melissa McCarthy is a powerhouse all right but Im discovering that a little bit of her goes a long way. ""Tammy"" in which she plays a rejected wife who hits the road with her hard-drinking grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) is a lot of yowling and clonking and bashing. McCarthy starts things out with a bang - literally - by hitting a deer in her car on her way to her job at a fast-food joint where she is given the heave-ho by her snippy boss and retaliates by throwing food all over the place. This scene is actually funny in a slobbola kind of way but when ""Tammy"" turns into a road movie it becomes increasingly sappy. I much prefer slobby to sappy. The still youthful-looking Sarandon playing a grandmother is a jolt especially since she doesnt resemble the doddering roustabout shes supposed to be playing. Maybe thats why the director Ben Falcone (McCarthys husband and with her the films co-writer) gives Sarandon a full head of gray hair. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Pearls alcoholism is alternately play for laughs and pathos - a hypocritical two-step. A lot of good actors are wasted in this film in bit roles including Allison Janney Sandra Oh and Dan Aykroyd. The ones with bigger roles like Mark Duplass and Kathy Bates are wasted too.

On her way to work she has a car accident of her own making. She gets canned at the fast-food joint where she works. She walks in on her husband having a lovely dinner with a way more prim and proper woman. Yes shes having a rotten run. Even so thats no reason for you to indulge Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone her husband and ""Tammy"" director and co-writer by spending time with the tiresome character as she tries to right her sense of being wronged by hitting the road. Susan Sarandon plays Tammys grandma Pearl who joins her ultra-dense granddaughter on this ill-advised excursion -- destination Niagra Falls. Its Pearls car after all. And shes tired of being cooped up with daughter Deb (Allison Janney). Plus Pearls brought booze. This being a road trip there are sure to be side trips and trysts. Gary Cole and Mark Duplass play Earl a ladys man and his more thoughtful son Bobby. There will be reunions and reckonings. Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh step in as Pearls cousin Lenore and her partner. There will even be a felony. Sarah Baker is deadpan amusing as the fast-food worker who must deal with Tammys bumbling hold-up. Still with a stupid-to-funny ratio so out of whack its fair to ask is the R-rated uncouth gal vehicle McCarthy has been gunning since ""Bridesmaids"" already running on fumes? ""Identity Thief"" was a wreck even with the sharp-tongued aid of Jason Bateman. "" The Heat"" was funnier because Sandra Bullock was a tempering foil. It would be interesting to see if a PG-13 project would bring some much-needed discipline to McCarthys comedy. No matter how funny the performer is the writing has to be there. Falcone and McCarthy missed the turn-off. Theres something never fully realized about Tammy. At times she seems deeply ignorant; at other times her bone-headedness suggests a problem with brain chemistry. We love a fool but they still have to make sense. ""Tammy"" is a wince-worthy missed opportunity. What a cast McCarthy gathered. And as well-traveled a genre as the road-trip is theres always room for a good one. Sarandon now has the odd distinction of riding shotgun in one of the great road movies and one of the most forgettable. One might argue that things ended badly for Thelma and Louise. ""Tammy"" is simply bad.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Tammy Recommended Video Rated R  97 minutes  2014 Melissa McCarthy stars as a midwestern loudmouth who fired from her job at a burger joint and furious that her husband is having an affair skips town with her wily pill-popping grandmother (Susan Sarandon). Their sights are set on Niagara Falls but a booze-filled run-in with the police strands them in Louisville. Like a classic road comedy this tends to drift from scene to scene rather than adhere to a strict plot; the movie revolves mostly around McCarthy hilarious in her best performance to date. She cowrote the script with her husband Ben Falcone providing her character with a nuance absent from her other starring roles; she shows a more dramatic side and not every joke is predicated on her weight. Falcone directed; with Kathy Bates and Mark Duplass.

Saeed Adyani/Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Saeed Adyani/Warner Brothers Pictures Melissa McCarthy co-wrote produced and stars as the title character in Tammy -- a comedy about a woman on a felonious road trip with her alcoholic grandmother played by Susan Sarandon (left). Saeed Adyani/Warner Brothers Pictures Movie Reviews The Heat Broads In Blue Kicking Buddy-Cop Behind Arts amp; Life Bullock And McCarthy Packing Heat (And Laughs) In Boston Think of Melissa McCarthy playing Megan in Bridesmaids and you may first remember her defecating in a sink or driving a minivan full of stolen puppies or brazenly propositioning an air marshal. McCarthy stole the show with a talent for profanity and pratfalls but its a reflective one-on-one scene playing impromptu life coach to Kristen Wiigs character that solidified her star-making performance. For that scene she dropped the clownish shtick for a real human moment that made Megan into a character not just a caricature. Tammy McCarthys co-screenwriting debut with her husband Ben Falcone (who directs for the first time) looks to mine that same dichotomy. McCarthy plays the title role a slovenly small-town fast-food worker who loses her job her car and her husband in the first 10 minutes and spends the rest of the film trying to find some meaning in her broken life with the help of her alcoholic pill-popping grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon). But for the first 20 minutes or so McCarthy and Falcone seem to have misjudged the best uses of McCarthys talents to epic proportions. When she turns her performance up to 11 she doesnt just demand the spotlight; she creates her own. That allowed her to steal scenes in Bridesmaids or work effectively as a duo with Sandra Bullock in last years The Heat because there was the constant push and pull of her performance against other strong and contrasting ones. But the opening scenes of Tammy never challenge her for ownership of center stage. As a result its largely just McCarthy swearing and stumbling in a near vacuum a one-woman standup act about falling down. The supporting characters -- Falcone as her weaselly manager Nat Faxon as her blandly philandering husband Allison Janney as her anxious disappointed mother -- exist largely to bounce the focus back to her. Delivering a performance that screams for attention when you already have it ends up coming off as a desperate plea for laughs. Thats even more true when they go out of their way to make Tammy seem spectacularly dumb just to set up opportunities to cruelly mock her. The story requires Tammys life to fall apart so that we can watch her struggle to make a new one but McCarthy and Falcone wind up also having to put their movie back together after its ill-judged start. To some extent they do once Tammy settles into more of an ensemble piece than star showcase. Mark Duplass is the first grounding influence on the film just as his character Bobby helps to pull Tammy back from the brink. Kathy Bates playing Pearls rich cousin Lenore provides much the same kind of support. There are some surprisingly true notes in unexpected places. Pearls alcoholism for instance drives much of Tammys need to finally grow up. While its the catalyst for some funny set pieces -- one of the movies best scenes finds Tammy awkwardly holding up a fast-food joint to bail Grandma out of jail -- its also handled with enough poignancy to avoid reducing Pearl to an old-people-behaving-badly comedy stereotype. Tammy never quite manages to find that balance between the sweet and the smartass the way Bridesmaids did nor does the mismatched buddy dynamic between McCarthy and Sarandon ever approach the success of The Heat. But eventually the film does manage to find its own awkward way with enough effective and less desperate jokes to smooth things over after the rocky start. Its a shakier debut of McCarthy and Falcones efforts behind the camera than one might have hoped for but if Tammy can turn things around surely they can too.

"Melissa McCarthys Tammy Isnt Good But Its a Valuable American Comedy | IndieWire Movies New Releases Reviews Interviews Video Podcast Thompson on Hollywood News Features Lists Box Office Trailers Festivals Acquisitions Awards Oscar Predictions Emmy Predictions Thompson on Hollywood Crafts Video TV Toolkit Filmmaker Toolkit Project of the Day Project of the Week Project of the Month More About Team Advertise with Indiewire Movies New Releases Reviews Interviews Video Podcast Thompson on Hollywood News Features Lists Box Office Trailers Festivals Acquisitions Awards Oscar Predictions Emmy Predictions Thompson on Hollywood Crafts Video TV Toolkit Filmmaker Toolkit Project of the Day Project of the Week Project of the Month More About Team Advertise with Indiewire Melissa McCarthys Tammy Isnt Good But Its a Valuable American Comedy Melissa McCarthys Tammy Isnt Good But Its a Valuable American Comedy Eric Kohn Jul 3 2014 1025 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk In ""Tammy"" Melissa McCarthy plays an absolute train wreck. In the opening minutes she rams into a deer gets fired from her fast-food job and discovers her husband is cheating on her. Eventually she launches on a boisterous road trip through the midwest with her freewheeling alcoholic grandmother (Susan Sarandon) that ultimately leads to a clumsy bank robbery and other misadventures. The laughs are mostly uninspired but with ""Tammy"" context is everything. Directed by the actress husband Ben Falcone from a script co-written by the couple the movie features an untraditional leading woman defying the restrictions of a sexist industry. At her best McCarthy is an unruly figure of slapstick at odds with the world around her. It mirrors the battle that an actress of her girth faces to make a mainstream movie like this. Its very existence is a triumph but ""Tammy"" offers just enough kooky wit to make you wish it was a lot better. Unsurprisingly the movie succeeds whenever it veers away from the flimsy plot to let McCarthy transcend its limitations. The material doesnt match her acting strengths but it does play to them by allowing her to embrace the role of a largely unlikable character. Tammys anarchic energy and inane self-confidence like Danny McBrides similarly pathetic egotist on HBOs ""Eastbound and Down"" works because she doesnt see these qualities in herself. But in ""Tammy"" its not just the actress behavior or physicality that makes her stand out. The movie is a righteous attempt to put an middle-America antihero devoid of class privilege front and center. Whenever it foregrounds that feat it hints at a smarter movie. Even when it falters ""Tammy"" points in a promising direction for a genre that rarely reaches its potential in the mainstream. If nothing else its a conduit to better options. The Ultimate Underdog An early image of Tammy post-car crash caked in grease and blood while speeding her smoking wreck down the road suggests a kind of gnarly comic poetry that the bland dialogue cant touch. Later when Tammy goes into gangster mode during a second-act twist wearing a makeshift mask and prancing about while making thuggish gestures set to ""Thrift Shop"" the narrative gives way to a hilarious musical riff on the frustrations of the lower class. When was the last time a star-driven comedy went to such extremes? Jody Hills boisterous ""Observe and Report"" may have given us a mentally deranged mall cop who lives with his mother but at least he has a sense of duty. In ""Tammy"" the characters recklessness has no immediate outlet. McCarthy and Falcones screenplay is less satisfying when it sketches out Tammys apparent lack of education (mispronouncing ""Mark Twain"" as ""Mark Twan"" misunderstanding the meaning of the word ""pattern"") while her uneven relationship with her hard-drinking grandmother leads to a series of dead-ends as does her eventual romance with a gentle man she meets on the road (Mark Duplass). But theres just enough subtext here to hint at a sad compassionate portrait of alienation and angst that wouldnt feel entirely out of place in an Alexander Payne movie. (In fact its cross-generational road trip premise isnt that far from the basic scenario of ""Nebraska."") However despite its good-natured aspects ""Tammy"" constantly struggles against its sophomoric ingredients. Its a dumb broad comedy no matter how much it resists that outcome. While McCarthys starring role defies male-dominated American comedy ""Tammy"" becomes a mediocre refashioning of a cliche. It tries to shake up a genre that skews toward formula. (See ""Neighbors"" yet another pretty funny Seth Rogen movie thats little more than a safe bet.) But as usual its still several steps behind the more inventive comedies being made outside the system. Wheres the Vulgar Fun? To its credit ""Tammy"" manages to transcend the juvenile discussions surrounding ""fat humor"" that McCarthys celebrity has sadly provoked in the national conversation. The f-word only comes up once blurted out by Sarandon in a drunken rage and blended in with a slew of other simple insults. But while ""Tammy"" is too smart to make fun of its leading ladys size the humor never finds a good mode of expression. Yet in ""Premature"" another sweet-natured comedy with a vulgar edge opening in far fewer theaters this week a befuddled nerdy teenager (John Karna) ejaculates no less than seven times over the course of the goofy plot which uses this series of sexual misfires as its main device Whenever the guy blows his load his day starts all over again. But writer-director Dan Beers ""Groundhog Day-meets-American Pie"" premise is surprisingly well written and sympathizes with its dopey protagonist not only because of his weird temporal problem but also because hes a good-natured kid afraid of graduating high school and moving on with his life. Beers finds a balance between self-conscious lowbrow comedy and genuine pathos whereas ""Tammy"" only hints at dirtier possibilities. Though forward-leaning in parts it never does anything unique with the material. Self-Mockery Makes a Difference David Wains ""They Came Together"" out now in theaters and VOD would never be made as a studio comedy because it rips the genres conventions to threads. Wains searing criticism of the romcom formula revolves around an apparent happy couple (Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler) recounting their meet-cute origin story with a recurring self-awareness that manages to indulge in its sweet posturing while parodying its cliches. From the moment that Poehler describes Rudd as ""handsome but in a non-threatening way"" and he calls her ""the cutesy klutzy girl that sometimes will drive you a little bit crazy"" Wain makes it clear that he knows the material in his crosshairs all too well. READ MORE David Wains They Came Together With Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd is a Hilarious Knock on Romcoms ""They Came Together"" only gets shrewder from there tossing in awkward plot lines and absurdist tangents that suggests ""The Princess Bride"" by way of the Zucker brothers. In one of the more outrageous sequences as a romantic song plays on the soundtrack Wain cuts away to show the singer in the studio and the actors out of character paying a visit while a title card clues us into its eventual availability on iTunes and other platforms. Its a delightful swipe at the commercialization of storytelling that still maintains a gentle playful dimension. Wain manages to satirize material already done to death without turning preachy. Despite its loony character ""Tammy"" never pushes the material to the same outrageous heights as its lead. The lightweight finale backs away from confronting Tammys ostracized existence. She gets her happy ending but it feels like a cheat. More Nontraditional Antiheroes Please While Seth Rogen and company havent lost their funny their recurring dominance in American comedy is starting to feel stale. ""Tammy"" does register as a welcome response. White-guy antics can only inject fresh energy into the genre. But the task has largely fallen to television where ""Orange is the New Black"" provides audiences with a diverse range of ethnicities and unglamorous problems in dark comedic packaging. Of course ""Orange is the New Black"" was a calculated risk by a company venturing into new programming terrain whereas studios have less leeway for experimentation. ""Tammy"" is as close as theyve come to putting a non-traditional protagonist into the format of a mainstream comedy but there are shrewder attempts taking place outside that arena. In ""Obvious Child"" Jenny Slate plays a giggly standup comedienne who ruins her relationship with her onstage monologues and eventually gets an abortion without feeling overrun by guilt. The character casually unleashes scatalogical humor and sex jokes even when shes offstage. Liberated from the constraints of a rigid studio comedy ""Obvious Child"" is fearless without overstating its progressive nature. More than an alternative to ""Tammy"" it provides a better illustration of the casually edgy humor McCarthy implicitly reaches for. But ""Obvious Child"" has nothing on Justin Simiens wildly amusing satire ""Dear White People"" opening in October. Set at an upscale college campus the writer-directors endearing debut manages to toy with contradictory notions of racial identity in the Obama age. The title refers to the instructive radio show hosted by its main character (Tessa Thompson) a feisty young black woman eager to assault racial stereotypes even as she indulges in some of her own. The movie confronts its otherness in the marketplace head-on particularly when Thompsons character is told by her white lover that she should ""hold a mirror to your audience rather than dropping cannonballs on their heads."" Thats a plea that ""Tammy"" could have taken to heart It comes close to jarring its audience into experiencing a fresh kind of movie heroine but ultimately retreats into the same old routine.

Reply theresa May 12 2016 1128 am Tammy does not work because it trivializes the plight of women in her situation to comedy skits that do not include the tragic aspects in the life of women that do not conform to the ""picture"" of beautiful woman. Needless to say I believe the acting in the movie is very good. I believe the story line is poor.

Not that the eponymous Tammy (Melissa McCarthy) has much of a dream life to begin with--as this tonally scattershot but still bracingly sour comedy is quick to point out. Bad luck and bitterness run in Tammys blue-collar family especially in her acidic grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) who always has a whiskey bottle at the ready to drown her sorrows and wash down her illegally acquired codeine. Tammys latest setback inspires the duo to take a healing road trip to Niagara Falls though it isnt long before the insults fly. As is the case with many tart-tongued Hollywood comedies these days sentiment lies in wait. (Tammy grimaces broadly at Grandma getting busy in the back seat in one scene then sincerely bemoans her existence in another.) Yet the life lessons are wedded to a much more idiosyncratic story than you might think. McCarthys star power--solidified by the foul-mouthed farces Bridesmaids (2011) and The Heat (2013)--have earned her carte blanche to do as she wishes with this passion project which she and husband-director Ben Falcone nurtured over several years. They have little feel for the technical side of filmmaking; the imagery is flat and the editing amateurish. Most shots seem held for a beat too long or too short wreaking havoc with the comic rhythm. Nonetheless McCarthy and Falcones attempts to make Tammy more flesh-and-blood than a figure of fun are often poignant as in a scene in which our down-and-out heroine gets a tough talking-to from guest star Kathy Bates (making the most of her role as Pearls worldly lesbian cousin). For all its failings and flailings theres plenty to admire in this oddball star vehicle.

"Tammy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tammy ) Tammy (United States 2014) July 02 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Tammy is a road trip movie and like many road trip movies it embraces a meandering aimless tone. Its often said for films of this sort that its the journey that matters not the destination. Unfortunately in this case neither is worth the price of admission. Tammy defines the term ""forgettable."" Theres nothing about this movie thats either so bad or so good that it sticks in the memory. The uneven comedy offers a few sporadic chuckles but its neither extreme enough nor inventive enough to allow for more. The hackneyed dramatic elements fail to tweak the heart-strings. A week after seeing this movie I dare you to remember what it was about. Tammy puts Melissa McCarthy playing the title character and Susan Sarandon playing Grandma Pearl on the road together headed for Niagara Falls after Tammy loses her job at a fast food restaurant and learns that her husband is having an affair with a neighbor. Along the way Tammy and Pearl have misadventures that include an assignation with a randy old man (Gary Cole) a run-in with the police a daylight robbery and a ""lesbian Fourth of July."" Tammy finds a new love Grandma comes to grips with her alcoholism and Dan Aykroyd gets to make a cameo. Tammy was written by the husband-and-wife team of Ben Falcone and McCarthy. In addition to having a small role as Tammys boss Falcone directs making his feature debut. The movie has the feel of something that might have worked better as an indie film with a stronger dramatic undercarriage. The need to insert the hit-or-miss humor post-Bridesmaids audiences now associate with the lead actress takes away from the relationship between Tammy and Pearl and too many failed jokes rob the film of a strong identity. To her credit McCarthy doesnt try to push the envelope the way she has in some other recent films; the language is salty but the gross-out factor is kept to a minimum. Although its difficult to sympathize with Tammy because of her brash insensitivity this character isnt as overtly offensive as the one essayed by McCarthy in Identity Thief. However shes also not as genuine or likeable as Molly Flynn (the sitcom role the actress inhabited for most of the 00s). Theres also no evidence of chemistry between McCarthy and Susan Sarandon - a key ingredient necessary for any mismatched buddy relationship. (Not to mention that its difficult envisioning Sarandon whos 68 as the grandmother of the 44-year old McCarthy. Mother yes. Grandmother no.) There are a couple of scenes that work and these keep Tammy from sinking into unwatchability. One involves Tammy and Pearls attempts to return money stolen to a fast food joint. Another is a confrontation between the inebriated grandmother and her bitter granddaughter that evidences shadings of anger and pain. These moments offer glimpses of what a less mainstream-minded Tammy might have offered. Unfortunately the desire to appeal to the masses and to appease McCarthys growing legion of movie fans has resulted in a sleep-inducing product that may understandably have trouble finding its audience. If its a choice between seeing this and Transformers Age of Extinction this weekend my advice is to stay home.

"Tammy starring Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon Have Terrific Comic Chemistry in Tammy Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon Have Terrific Comic Chemistry in Tammy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 2 2014 211 PM Tammy Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon have terrific comic chemistry. By Aisha Harris Susan Sarandon and Melissa McCarthy on the road together in Tammy. Photo courtesy Saeed Adyani/Warner Bros. One of the best ways to vanquish your inner demons Hollywood has often taught us is to run away from them. There are few problems so big that they cant be overcome by taking a life-affirming road trip during which youre sure to find both adventure and self-discovery. Lost your job spouse and/or all sense of purpose in your life? Committed a crime in the heat of passion? Feeling suffocated by the pressures and expectations of being a royal heiress? When your life suddenly takes a turn for the worse--hit the road. Aisha Harris Aisha Harris is a Slate staff writer. Thats the lesson of Tammy the latest from the increasingly bankable Melissa McCarthy who stars in a role she also co-wrote with her husband and the films director Ben Falcone. Creatively there are few surprises to be had from the movies beat-by-beat execution of its familiar formula but Falcone stuffs the films brisk 90-minute run-time with crude jokes illicit hijinks and even a touching moment here and there. And the playful energy between McCarthy and her completely game co-star Susan Sarandon is more than enough to keep the movie humming along. When the film opens the titular character is at the end of her rope--a collision with a deer totals her car and her boss (played by Falcone) fires her from her soul-sucking fast food job at the fictional Topper Jacks. To cap off this terrible horrible no-good day Tammy mopes home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) sharing a cozy meal with their neighbor Missi (Toni Collette) with whom hes having an affair. Advertisement After bidding the lovebirds a sad though amusing good riddance (""You never made me dinner not once"" she laments. ""And it smells really good too"") the only thing left for Tammy to do is to skip town for a while. Her mother Deb (Allison Janney) by now used to Tammys serial misfortunes refuses to lend her money or let her borrow her car--but lucky for Tammy her grandmother Pearl (Sarandon) is in need of her own life-changing adventure and hoping to fulfill a childhood dream of visiting Niagara Falls. Pearl has the cash and the car to get them both on their way. Set aside your initial bewilderment at the casting choices--Sarandon at 67 plays mother to Janney (54) and grandmother to McCarthy (43)--and its pretty easy to go along for much of the fun that ensues. Sarandon decked out in loose-fitting patterned separates and sporting a mildly acerbic demeanor seems to have modeled her character on Maxine the spry wry old greeting-card lady only with a darkly alcoholic twist. McCarthy meanwhile wields her signature brazen style which at once complements Pearls attitude while also sparking tension as the road trip chugs north toward the falls. Consider for example the scene in which Pearl--fueled as usual by excessive alcohol consumption--effortlessly picks up a man named Earl at a bar while Tammy strikes out with his mild-mannered son Bobby whom she accosts on his way to the bathroom by abruptly planting a long awkward kiss on his lips. Sarandon and McCarthy make for an electric comedic duo but the film winds off course as the road trip progresses jumping between tones (ranging from light-hearted to macabre) and categories (the movie veers awkwardly into rom-com territory when Bobby eventually becomes Tammys underdeveloped love interest). Other characters are hastily folded into the story along the way including Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh as Lenore and Susanne a lesbian couple who help hide Tammy and Pearl after they (predictably) find themselves on the run from the law. Too often the scenes feel as thinly sketched as the supporting cast. When Pearl explains to Tammy her motivation for wanting to see Niagara Falls its clearly intended to be a revelatory moment for her character adding dimension to the ""cooky old grandma"" stereotype. But the scene ends suddenly with a half-hearted quip from Tammy who wonders aloud why her grandmother has chosen to tell her this story now--when the two are occupying adjacent stalls in a public restroom. Advertisement One thing the film does right however is allow McCarthys audacious humor to ebb and flow. In a departure from previous outings in The Heat Identity Thief or in her multiple Saturday Night Live appearances the comedian occasionally tones down the intensity letting Sarandon have some of the wackier moments which she more than handles. Tammys attempts to reel in Pearls dangerous alcoholism present a more subdued mild-mannered side of the actress we havent much seen on the big screen and when it works it works well. Its not that McCarthy hasnt played the straight woman before. Ahead of the fourth season of her CBS sitcom Mike and Molly its creator Chuck Lorre explained to incoming showrunner Al Higgins the reason McCarthy is a bigger star in movies than she is in TV ""In her movies people react to her and on the show she reacts to everyone else."" (The most recent season of the series was noted for featuring a livelier Molly.) Here McCarthy is neither too dialed up to bear nor too retiring to make an impression--she frequently finds the sweet spots in a flawed script. Its likely no coincidence that shes exhibiting this quality in a film she co-wrote--she seems to trust her ability to reach beyond broad humor more than some previous writers and directors have. Even if Tammy ultimately loses its way its exciting to see what McCarthy is capable of when she takes the wheel. A Slate Plus Special Feature Did You Finish Binge-Watching Orange Is the New Black?

Entertainment Melissa McCarthy Is Finally Her Own Heroine In ""Tammy"" Its not the bawdy comedy you expected but it shows a softer side of star and co-writer Melissa McCarthy. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Melissa McCarthy in Tammy Michael Tackett/Warner Bros. ID 3262648 The poster for Melissa McCarthys new movie Tammy features the actress in a ""Mahalo"" T-shirt baggy high waters and Crocs arms upraised outside of a fast food restaurant like the proud inheritor to a comedy throne once occupied by Chris Farley -- outsized sloppy and absolutely unashamed the new queen of not giving a fuck. With Tammy McCarthys finally solo headlining her own movie which opens July 2 at the start of a prime holiday weekend (""Declare your independence"" the tagline urges). The film has been made to look like it doubles up on the sort of outrageous brash physical humor thats made her a thriving movie star ever since her Oscar-nominated scene-stealing role in Bridesmaids. But this isnt the go-for-broke adventure its marketing may have you expecting. The shaggy slack but ultimately still pretty likable road-movie-to-nowhere is as prone to pathos as it is to having McCarthy tear up a dance floor crash a jet ski or offer some filter-free observations on her own sex appeal. Yes Tammy still has the actress doing things like riding on the hood of a car until she flies off then bouncing up and bellowing ""I stuck the landing"" But thats not its only or even its main interest. ID 3262046 View this image > Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon in Tammy Michael Tackett/Warner Bros ID 3264058 Tammy which McCarthy co-wrote with her husband and first-time director Ben Falcone showcases how fragile the rambunctious eponymous character actually is. Its a film thats made to showcase its stars remarkable ability to make a hairpin turn from blustery fearlessness right into poignant plaintiveness. The amount of time it focuses on the latter is bound to disappoint anyone expecting something rowdier but as the first movie McCarthys had a hand in creating herself it speaks to the kind of role she wants to play. Tammys rough abrasive impulsive selfish and immature but shes not a cartoon or the comic relief -- goddamn right shes the heroine. Shes also a Missouri woman who at the start of the movie loses her job car marriage and home in one lousy funny day. The jobs at a fast food chain called Topper Jacks the cars a beat-up Corolla and the husbands Greg (Nat Faxon) whos been cheating with the neighbor Missi (Toni Collette). The affair is almost more hurtful in how courtly and chaste it seems to be as theyre discovered having dinner together as opposed to in bed together. Tammy flees in distress to her mother Debs (Allison Janney) house next door to announce her intentions to blow town something she threatens to do whenever she gets really upset -- only this time her alcoholic grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) is willing to pay the way as long as shes able to come with. ID 3264041 View this image > Susan Sarandon and Melissa McCarthy in Tammy Saeed Adyani/Warner Bros ID 3264467 Its the setup to a wackier movie than what follows in which Tammys forced to deal with an elderly relative who actually has it even less together than she does who isnt taking her meds and whos willing to ditch her granddaughter to hook up with a guy named Earl (Gary Cole) whom she meets in a BBQ joint while Tammy and his son Bobby (Mark Duplass) wait uncomfortably for them to finish. But its that game of responsibility chicken with Pearl that allows the movie to show the vulnerability just underneath Tammys outlandish protective showing. Like other characters McCarthy has played Tammy is aggressive profane and seems to have an incredible amount of unearned confidence but its a bubble thats easily burst. In the early scene in which Tammy comes home to find Greg and Missi having dinner she bleats ""You never made me dinner not even once"" and suddenly an amusing row of tantrum becomes genuinely sad. After Bobby rejects Tammys silly Megan-in-Bridesmaids-style pass her exchanges with him shift to the more grounded self-deprecating tone of someone whos flirting without expecting to be taken seriously. Tammy may seem indestructible at first but shes far from it and the movie makes it clear that her swagger is an agreed-upon illusion between her and everyone watching and that its actually painfully easy to cut her down. ID 3264446 View this image > Mark Duplass Melissa McCarthy Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh in Tammy Michael Tackett/Warner Bros. ID 3264699 Tammy is definitely an awkward creation that never quite knits together McCarthys dramatic moments with the ones in which she struts to Macklemore in a parking lot. But its smaller pieces are the ones that stand out the most -- Tammy charming Bobby despite himself or Pearls cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates) busting out a hilarious dance move at her lesbian Fourth of July party. It may be ramshackle but Tammy stands somewhere between the type of film thats made McCarthy famous and the ones she seems to want to really make -- ones in which she gets to do something other than clown around in which she gets to have a romance and some softer moments as any leading lady does.

Entertainment Susan Sarandon and Melissa McCarthy in Tammy In her first film as star producer and cowriter the comedienne joins Susan Sarandon for an escapade that goes on the road -- and off the rails Tammy the new movie starring produced and cowritten by Melissa McCarthy could be an artifact from some alternate universe the creatures there resemble Earthlings but have an entirely different and debased idea of whats funny. Arriving in time for the July 4th weekend Tammy has the effect of a shoddily manufactured firecracker that weakly goes off in your hands -- leaving no permanent damage just a bitter memory. That is to say this one is bad -- a little comedy that flops in big ways. It sends Tammy (McCarthy) on a driving trip with her free-spirited alcoholic grandma (Susan Sarandon) but consistently loses its direction as if it were guided by a deranged GPS. So does Ben Falcone the movies director and cowriter and McCarthys husband. (The phrase ""vanity project"" is applicable in every way.) In film schools of the future professors will teach Tammy as an object lesson in Making Everything Go Wrong. 1. Assemble a group of ridiculously overqualified actors then give them nothing to do. The on-screen talent includes Sarandon (one Oscar win five nominations) Kathy Bates (one Oscar win three nominations) Alison Janney (four Emmys for The West Wing) Toni Collette and Dan Aykroyd (each with an Oscar nomination and an Emmy win) and Sandra Oh (five Emmy noms for Greys Anatomy) plus Oscar-nominated screenwriter Nat Faxon and Mumblecore indie guru Mark Duplass. McCarthy has her own Oscar nomination -- for Best Pooping in a Sink as one of The Bridesmaids -- and an Emmy for Mike amp; Molly. This bunch youd guess could read the fine print in an iPhone contract and make movie poetry of it. Instead they had to perform the McCarthy-Falcone script with dumb things to say and preposterously paper-thin characters to inhabit. 2. Leave audiences scratching their heads about your movie familys gene pool. You are asked to believe that McCarthy (short squat and 43) is the daughter of Janney (a thin 54-year-old six-footer) and the granddaughter of Sarandon (still gorgeous and fit at 67 even in cast-off clothes and a ratty wig). This goofy casting might have had some comic piquancy if the writers had given Tammy a taller foxier sister; the role could have been played by the stars first cousin Jenny McCarthy. But the genetic and chronological anomaly goes unremarked and were left with the most implausible three-generation movie trio since the 1988 crime comedy The Family Business which posited Sean Connery as Dustin Hoffmans father and Matthew Brodericks granddad. 3. Have your cast make stuff up and however feeble the results go with it. Variety reports that ""Falcone encouraged his cast to improvise heavily during production."" Really? Did the director -- who like McCarthy was a member of the improv troupe The Groundlings -- think his script was worse than the floundering he chose for the final cut? Bates has a few strong scenes improvised or not as a wise elderly lesbian but nearly everyone else looks stranded. Sarandon too often is left grinning sheepishly at the camera; or it might be a grimace that says ""Dont blame me."" Whatever the mix Tammy plays like 95 minutes of rejected footage from a real movie. 4. Hint at some social import but fail to deliver on it. This story of a Midwestern woman whos driven to despair when she loses her job her car and her husband on the same day might have been a parable of social and emotional impoverishment in post-Recession America. Theres a fitfully amusing moment when Tammy glares at a can of gasoline and mutters ""Four dollars a gallon. Thanks Obamacare"" -- a clue to how the countrys dispossessed have been conditioned to blame the President for every slight they endure. Thatd be fine -- except that everyone else in Tammys family is cheerfully middle-class. Shes the only one whos a rude ignorant mess incapable of being employed in a fast-food joint unaware of who Mark Twain is confusing Neil Armstrong with Lance Armstrong and driving a car farther into a tight spot not out of it. Thats Tammys life a series of stupid moves triggering a terrible temper. Shes just one misstep away from being the crazy lady shouting to no one outside the Walmart. 5. Manufacture instant and inexplicable changes of character. Tammy has been dumped by her husband (Faxon) and her boss (Falcone in a decent bit) -- though given her bad luck and worse disposition the wonder is not that she was abandoned and fired but that shed ever been married or hired. Even a deer shes hit on the road scampers away from her when she tries resuscitating it. She also confesses that she let the local ice-cream truck guy play with her breasts in return for a supply of Klondike bars. Yet this chronic rejectee somehow retains confidence in her sex appeal -- as when she approaches a gentle fellow (Duplass) at a bar to kiss him fat on the mouth. ""I do not want your tongue in my mouth"" he protests and she flirtatiously ripostes ""Whered ya want it man?"" Maybe some atavistic memory of girlhood when she might have been at all attractive has kept Tammy coming on to people who push her away. Or is the audience supposed to embrace Tammy and believe in the redemption afforded her at the movies end simply because shes... Melissa McCarthy? 6. Push the Melissa McCarthy character to its egregious extreme. I confess I dont get the character McCarthy has played in Bridesmaids Identity Thief and The Heat -- three movies that earned 460 million at the domestic box office and made her a comedy star. I wouldnt agree with Rex Reed the Observer critic who earned contumely for calling McCarthy a ""cacophonous tractor-sized... obese and obnoxious... female hippo."" Her size doesnt trouble me -- no its the rapacious abrasiveness of her screen personality thats the real elephant in the room. Comedies often rely on one character to represent the lure of chaos of tilting propriety into anarchy. Usually thats a supporting role which McCarthy filled with (to me) a raspingly unpleasant edge. Tammy has the big steel cojones to put this character front and center with an unnecessarily distinguished cast of satellites. That McCarthy was in charge of Tammy -- that she chose it indeed created it as her first top-billed role -- indicates that this is the way she wants her film career to go. And that is the most ominous element in this deplorable project that somewhere in that alternate universe where life is ugly and nothing is funny more Tammys await.

Courtney Shea Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 02 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jul. 02 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Ben Falcone Written by Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy Starring Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon Classification 14A Country USA Language English Melissa McCarthy is a movie star which in todays cinematic climate is the equivalent of a unicorn a four-leaf clover and a double rainbow all rolled up into one. The m-word didnt used to be such a rarity. Time was Tom Cruise Will Smith Cameron Diaz Adam Sandler even Vince Vaughn could all but guarantee box-office victory by just by putting their name on a film poster but todays audiences have abandoned famous flesh-and-blood humans in favour of superheroes animated toys and Earth-destroying robots. Three years after breaking out in Bridesmaids McCarthy has become the unlikely exception to this new cinematic order which is a phenomenal achievement. Even if her movies so far are not. Okay yes Bridesmaids was really good - a hilarious script with many excellent performances none better than McCarthys as the puppy-stealing poop-expelling sister of the groom. Critics lauded her Oscar nominated her and Toby Emmerich president of New Line Cinema told her agent that he wanted to buy ""whatever"" she was working on. That ""whatever"" turned out to be Tammy a road-trip comedy that McCarthy co-wrote with her real-life husband and frequent collaborator Ben Falcone (who also directs). According to an article in the Wall Street Journal this was the first time in his 20-plus year career that Emmerich signed a project script unseen. The producer of populist smashes like The Notebook Wedding Crashers and Sex and the City is seemingly wise to what has turned out to be an alarmingly true premise Audiences will watch this woman in anything.And so far they have. That Identity Thief cinematic excrement to put it kindly managed to squeak its way into the top 20 grossing films of 2013 is a testament to McCarthys siren song. The good news Tammy is a (slightly) better movie than Identity Thief. In it McCarthy plays the titular 35-year-old woman-child who comes home from getting fired at her fast-food job to find that her husband is having an affair with the prissy neighbour (Toni Collette). Understandably upset she decides to get out of town. She is also broke and without wheels so her car-owning whisky-guzzling granny (Susan Sarandon) is along for the ride.As a story Tammy is predictable odd couple on the open road - high jinks and interpersonal drama ensue. As a script it is uneven and tonally inconsistent - best as a brainless gross-out comedy less successful when striving for emotional poignancy. (Grandmas alcoholism for example plays better as a gag than a Hallmark moment). As a star vehicle though the movie gives McCarthy the only thing she really needs - screen time.There are maybe (maybe) two minutes in an hour-and-a-half where she isnt in the frame giving her considerable gifts as a physical comedian and improv master plenty of time to work their magic. We see her attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a deer attacking her ex-boss at the Flapper Jacks with cheeseburgers hamming it up on a jet ski coming to fisticuffs with a couple of unruly teenagers and channelling her inner gangsta before knocking off a different Flapper Jacks. In a scene reminiscent of her classic airplane scene in Bridesmaids (where McCarthys Megan is convinced that the air marshal is trying to jump her bones) Tammy trails her love interest to the bathroom and tries to tongue him before getting rebuffed. The intersection of emotionally clueless and sexually confident is McCarthys sweet spot - to see her dancing ""provocatively"" to the Black Crowes southern-rock anthem Hard to Handle is arguably worth the price of admission.Sarandon is fine as the grandmother though the character is depressing as often as she is funny (so too the experience of watching an acting legend flash her granny boobs for laughs). Other supporting players - Kathy Bates Allison Janney and especially Toni Collette - dont get much to chew on. Falcone is perfect in a small role as the pricky Flapper Jacks boss - the husband-and-wife chemistry hints at how funny the movie could have been had they maybe taken a little longer on the script.In one scene Tammy is explaining her magnetism to the opposite sex telling her grandma that men are on her like flies on you-know-what. Grandma replies that what she means to say is ""like bees to honey"" but given McCarthys undeniable flare for dung-polishing the former seems more apt.

With her husband Ben Falcone as the director and co-writer Melissa McCarthy has crafted a vehicle for herself called Tammy in which she attempts to metamorphose from a slob-clown into a figure of maturity and pathos and romance -- in the course of a single film. I hesitate to label the result as bad or good. Its just ... off. McCarthys Tammy is a squalling child-woman who hits a deer on the road when she reaches for a fallen snack gets the axe at her fast-food job and then bursts into her house to find her husband (Nat Faxon) wining and dining a neighbor played by Toni Collette. (Did Collette have a family member being held for ransom? Her participation is a head-scratcher.) In a scene staged for maximum humiliation Tammy packs a suitcase that ruptures and then marches with her arms full of clothes up the street to the house of her mother (Allison Janney) whos in the process of putting Tammys grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) in an old-folks home. With little preamble Tammy and Pearl jump into Pearls car and -- whee -- take off for Niagara Falls swilling beer and whiskey and heading south instead of north. The setup is promising but the casting is ... whats that word again? Off. McCarthy is 43 Janney 52 and Sarandon 66 going on 40. Seriously Sarandon is more gorgeous than she has been in any film since Bull Durham a quarter-century ago. She doesnt begin to compute as a granny whos one foot from an old-age home and shes so serenely assured a comedian that she steals every scene. When Gary Cole as a sex-crazed oldster pounced on Pearl I wished the movie had become their madcap odyssey rather than Tammys. A less generous star and director could have cut the film to keep Sarandon from waltzing away with it. I admire McCarthy for casting her and for wanting to play someone real. As she proved in Bridesmaids and The Heat she can sling an insult as deftly as anyone in movies. But shes not much of an actress -- not yet. Shes a face-puller a gross-out machine. Half the time Tammy is like some sort of horny helium-inflated Lisa Lupner from Saturday Night Live throwing herself at Mark Duplass (as Coles beleaguered son) or robbing a fast-food store with a bag over her head -- the film stopping dead so she can do a fumbly slapstick number that goes on too long. In the other half shes being ""sincere."" She tries to stop her grandmom from drinking too much and is called for her troubles a ""fat loser."" McCarthy sits there sadly as if trying to wonder how a movie star can balance the commercial appetite for watching her use her weight for laughs with her own desire to play someone halfway human. There are many nice moments in Tammy most underscored by the good Southern rock and bluegrass soundtrack. Kathy Bates pops in as Leonore Pearls wealthy lesbian cousin (her lover is played by Sandra Oh) and you get a glimpse I think of McCarthys ideal an older not-svelte actress who became a star (and won an Oscar) playing nuts but is now charismatically centered self-contained -- she doesnt give a shit what you think of how she looks. No this is not a bad movie. Its just trying to straddle two different worlds. McCarthy hasnt yet learned how to look strong while She Squats to Conquer.

Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Tammy Running time 97 minutes. Rated R (language). At the E-Walk the 34th St. others. Tammy (Melissa McCarthy) is a likable mess with a chronic inability to get it together. So is ""Tammy"" -- a collaboration between McCarthy who co-writes with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed. Its a shame because McCarthy is great at playing the female schlub and that nascent genre is in need of a good poster girl. But this pastiche of sitcomy episodes never gels into a plot. When we first meet her Tammys late for work at her depressing fast-food job because shes just hit a deer with her depressing car. Things go downhill from there including an altercation with her boss (Falcone) who fires her in that specifically haughty manner of the near-powerless and angry about it. After the final indignity of the day -- discovering her husband (Nat Faxon) is cheating on her with a svelte blonde (Toni Collette) -- Tammy has nothing left to lose and hits the open road with her spitfire grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon not really old enough for this part but enjoying herself). Pearl has a bunch of cash a wild streak (she once had an affair with an Allman brother -- ""not Gregg"") and a problem with alcohol and pills that starts out funny and gets ugly. Melissa McCarthy stars in ""Tammy.""Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures Its never clear why Tammy is so far off-track which is part of the films problem. Its hard to root for someone who seems reasonably aware yet reliably makes one bad call after another. The movie also has an odd amount of fun with Tammys general level of ignorance She calls Mark Twain ""Mark Twan"" and when Pearl references Neil Armstrong on the moon Tammys response is ""On his bike?"" The duo stops off at a roadhouse in one of several vague nods to ""Thelma and Louise"" where Pearl meets a man (Gary Cole) with whom shes soon making out in the back of her car much to the chagrin of his son (Mark Duplass) and Tammy who take a gradual liking to one another. McCarthy does her swaggering sexual self-confidence thing though here its thinly papered over a fragile soul. Shes actually at her best when the movie stops making her try so hard and lets her face relax into a captivating openness. But it doesnt happen often enough. Susan Sarandon and Melissa McCarthy in ""Tammy.""Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures A couple of bad decisions later the cash-strapped Tammys robbing a burger joint so she can bail Pearl out of jail. Its one of several scenes that just feel tone-deaf and overly long from McCarthys slo-mo gangsta rap moves beforehand (amusing kinda but wouldnt you want to get in and out as fast as possible?) to her halting guilty repartee with the cashiers. Eventually Tammy and Pearl now fugitives are aided by Pearls cousin (Kathy Bates) whose partner is played by Sandra Oh. Ill say one thing for this movie It passes the Bechdel Test (does it feature at least two women talking about something other than a man?) with flying colors culminating in a lesbian Fourth of July extravaganza involving a torched Jet Ski and Sarandon flashing her breasts at the assembled Sapphic partygoers. Theres no shortage of goodwill in ""Tammy"" at its core an ode to the female underdog. Nor is there any dearth of star power (Allison Janney and Dan Aykroyd also briefly play Tammys parents). It just doesnt hang together. McCarthy has a real facility with bizarre awkward one-liners -- its what made her such a scene-stealer in ""Bridesmaids"" -- but its tough to stitch those together into a leading role. Tougher than Falcone and McCarthy bargained for I imagine.

The film opens in theaters Wednesday July 2. (Reuters) By Ann Hornaday July 1 2014 Follow AnnHornaday I miss Sookie. Back at the turn of this century Melissa McCarthy came to the attention of millions of dedicated fans of the TV show ""Gilmore Girls"" a small-town dramedy in which she played Sookie St. James the cute stylishly zaftig best friend of cute stylishly un-zaftig Lorelei Gilmore. The show an addictive combination of rapid-fire dialogue of-the-moment pop references and shamelessly Capra-esque escapism was fun to watch largely thanks to characters like Sookie who was intelligent and warm and funny and even in her most idealized moments always recognizably human. ""Gilmore Girls"" ended in 2007; four years later McCarthy co-starred in the breakout comedy hit ""Bridesmaids"" in which she played an abrasive socially awkward misfit with a tomboyish demeanor and an aggressive libidinous streak. The movie ignited McCarthys career and with the exception of the bland TV sitcom ""Mike amp; Molly"" shes been playing an iteration of her ""Bridesmaids"" persona ever since In ""Identity Thief"" she portrayed a mouthy sociopath on the lam with Jason Bateman and in ""The Heat"" another smash success she starred opposite Sandra Bullock as an explosively hostile Boston cop. McCarthy goes back to the bilious well one more time in ""Tammy"" a movie she co-wrote with her husband Ben Falcone (who also directs) so she literally has only herself to blame. Her skin an angry shade of sunburned red her hair a frizzled mass of bleached split ends she blusters and bullies her way through a misbegotten movie that starts badly and ends worse. Tammy McCarthys character is a graceless obnoxious thoroughly unpleasant young woman who gets fired from her fast-food job and returns home to discover that her husband is having an affair; this sends her on a road trip to Niagara Falls with her grandmother who for reasons known only to heaven above and the good people of United Talent Agency is played by Susan Sarandon decked out in a curly gray wig and prosthetically swollen ankles. The joke if you can call it that is that Granny Pearl is just as down-and-dirty as Tammy and more sexually successful to boot. Most of ""Tammy"" consists of the two women getting entangled in some kind of un-funny ill-advised encounter which ends with a string of expletives and one or both of them knocking something over whether its a suntan lotion display on a personal watercraft vendors counter or the salt and pepper shakers on the table of two men who spurn Tammys boorish flirtations.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. If Sarandon thought ""Tammy"" might be a clever send-up of her role in the era-defining ""Thelma amp; Louise"" she was sorely mistaken She flounders and flails as she tries to find a movie to share with McCarthy who does nothing smart or subversive with her character other than make her progressively more shallow and mean-spirited. Crude coarse clueless and supremely sure of her own surpassing intelligence and talent Tammy is a cross between a toddler and a raging human Id Shes a tIddler. And Pearls a tippler her alcoholism escalating from a morning beer to a full-on binge that ends with a cruel public joke about Tammys weight. That scene set at a sumptuously appointed lesbian Fourth of July party features ""Tammys"" most bracing exchange which comes by way of the wonderful Kathy Bates playing Pearls fabulously successful cousin Lenore. But as a brief moment of truth it quickly gets lost within a tiresome offensively dishonest movie whose happy ending feels gratuitous and tacked on Lessons arent learned as much as hastily inserted directly from a Screenwriting 101 handbook. ""Tammy"" is a bummer not least because McCarthys fans know shes better than this. We all miss Sookie but we miss Melissa even more.

"Review Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon add fuel to Tammys comic engine - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon add fuel to Tammys comic engineBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 07/01/2014 030000 PM PDTUpdated 07/02/2014 024019 PM PDT The frisky road-trip ""Tammy"" is all over the map. But mostly in a good way.This is the first joint big-screen project for Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone her husband and frequent collaborator who co-wrote directs and even has a small part. While it runs afoul of some potholes it never goes completely off the road and eventually rights itself thanks to one rowdy cast of actors and characters riding shotgun. It also has two aces up its sleeve -- Susan Sarandon and Kathy Bates veteran actresses who play their offbeat colorful characters to the hilt. In tone and style ""Tammy"" reminded me of Steve Martins hilariously rude 1979 comedy ""The Jerk."" ""Tammys"" not as good but its good enough.In the title role McCarthy is hilarious with the same relentless energy she brought to ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat."" Tammy is a less-than-sharp blue-collar worker enduring one horribly wretched day. It begins when she runs her car into a deer (not too funny) gets canned from her fast-food job (very funny) by her boss (Falcone) and finds her husband at home romancing the neighbor (less funny than it should be). Its not until she makes a beeline out of her Midwest town with her Grandma Pearl (Sarandon) -- who has a set of wheels a wad of cash and a free spirit (all very funny) -- that the movie puts its foot on the pedal.Advertisement What happens on the road amounts to a series of comedy sketches involving hookups jail time and burning vehicles. Sometimes they work sometimes they fall flat. Still theyre exactly the kind of raucous antics that give McCarthy the chance to do what she does best -- play a loosely hinged mostly abrasive oddball. But even though her Tammy stoops to sticking up a fast-food joint (very very funny) and sometimes shows the intellect of a flea her wounded softer side is eventually revealed. In that way ""Tammy"" is something of a dramedy and a sharper one than youd think with McCarthy showing more versatility than just her high-level physical comedy routines. Toward the end it takes a daring sharp U-turn into more touching terrain and the smoothness with which it rounds the corner pays off with a satisfying ending.McCarthy more than meets the challenge as do many in the cast especially Bates. Just when the film starts to stall Bates arrives as Pearls feisty lesbian cousin Lenore. Her well-written part allows the Oscar-winner some of the films meatiest scenes all of which she plays with conviction and spirit. Sarandon as a very sexual alcoholic grandma whose benders reveal a cruel streak and explain why Tammy is the way she is nails every scene shes in. Meanwhile Mark Duplass is heart-melting as Bobby Tammys romantic interest a decent man she encounters along the way. Bobby finds himself growing attracted to this hot mess of a woman who like himself is tending to misbehaving older relatives in his case his drunken dad (Gary Cole).In his first big-screen directorial role Falcone shows a talent for making awkward situations funny through their genuine absurdity though he sometimes misses comic opportunities including the opening deer sequence. He also underuses the talented Toni Collette as the neighbor involved with Tammys cheating hubby (Nat Faxon) along with Allison Janney as Tammys mother. But hey as we all know family road trips are rarely as much fun as we expect them to be.

Photo Credit AP / Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A woman shakes up her dead-end life by taking a road trip with her eccentric grandmother. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE McCarthy plays to her strengths but misses the mark in this uneven comedy. CAST Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon Mark Duplass LENGTH 136 ""Tammy"" starring Melissa McCarthy as a fast-food worker who embarks on a life-changing road trip marks the popular actresss attempt to bottle her magic and sell it herself. In several hits for other filmmakers from ""Bridesmaids"" to ""The Heat"" McCarthy used her size and talent to either steal the show or carry it to the box-office herself. Along the way she also crafted a new kind of female persona one usually reserved for male comics like John Belushi or Jonah Hill the crass slob with a heart of gold. McCarthy wrote and produced ""Tammy"" with her husband Ben Falcone who also directs. It plays to all her strengths which turns out to be exactly the problem. Without a strong story or well-defined character to guide her McCarthy resorts to old tricks and repeated routines. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Shes aided by some fine actors though theyre as random as their roles Susan Sarandon plays Tammys alcoholic grandmother Pearl who insists on joining the journey and she cant help but sparkle even in gray-frosted hair and high-water pants. Kathy Bates does a little show-stealing herself as half of a wealthy lesbian couple (with Sandra Oh). Mark Duplass underwhelms as a bland cutie named Bobby though its somewhat amusing to watch a man struggle in the kind of thankless love-interest role that young actresses have endured for decades. Allison Janney Toni Collette and Dan Aykroyd also get a few lines. What sinks ""Tammy"" even more than its shaggy script -- a loose collection of light slapstick and colorful encounters -- is Tammy herself. McCarthy plays her as a thoroughly toxic combination bossy whiny hostile and dim. A few soul-bearing scenes the kind that endeared us to McCarthy in other movies have been forcibly inserted into the story but they never ring true. Rather than burnish McCarthys newly-minted star ""Tammy"" takes off some of the shine.

"Tammy not much fun and talented Melissa McCarthy needs to wise up - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Tammy not much fun and talented Melissa McCarthy needs to wise up ""Tammy"" Michael Tackett / Warner Bros. Melissa McCarthy stars in ""Tammy."" Melissa McCarthy stars in ""Tammy."" (Michael Tackett / Warner Bros.) Per BetsySharkey Tammys not the only one who needs tough love Melissa weve got to talk Oh ""Tammy."" Can I call you Tammy? I hate to break it to you but the thrill is gone.Id like to say its me not you. But I really think its you. As the latest loudest R-rated plus-size incarnation of Melissa McCarthys comic psyche you had such promise. But the partys over. The fun has officially left the building.And let me make this clear -- its the shtick not the size thats the problem. Ben Falcone McCarthys significant other makes his directing debut with ""Tammy"" and shows hes blinded by love. Thats sweet. Warms my heart. You can sense his adoration in every scene because he doesnt so much direct as watch and wait until the object of his affection is finished with whatever bit of madness she happens to be into at the moment. Photos Celebrity photos taken by Los Angeles Times photographers. Unfortunately all that love does not translate into an amusing or poignant movie -- both of which the couple is going for in their screenplay collaboration. There are some laughs and at least on screen more than a few tears. But it doesnt come together with the kind of satisfying punch a comedy should deliver.A lot of very good actors have been pulled into this train wreck. But with the exception of Susan Sarandon who plays Pearl Tammys trash-talking whiskey guzzling sex-crazed grandmother they are mostly wallpaper part of the set dressing on the stage thats been created for McCarthy. Related story All hail Melissa McCarthy Hollywoods indestructible comic superwoman Neal Gabler It is a good time to be Melissa McCarthy. McCarthy was nominated for supporting actress for her performance in ""Bridesmaids"" two years ago won an Emmy for her TV series ""Mike amp; Molly"" was second to Jennifer Lawrence in a recent poll of best-liked actresses and she has just launched ""Tammy""... It is a good time to be Melissa McCarthy. McCarthy was nominated for supporting actress for her performance in ""Bridesmaids"" two years ago won an Emmy for her TV series ""Mike amp; Molly"" was second to Jennifer Lawrence in a recent poll of best-liked actresses and she has just launched ""Tammy""... (Neal Gabler) It all begins on a very bad day. Tammys late for work driving too fast and sure enough theres a deer in the road. Honestly and it pains me to say this pay attention to the deer-crash scene. Brutus or whatever his name is uses those big brown beautiful buck eyes to do the best emoting you will see in the entire film. And Im not being even slightly sarcastic. The deer on the grill is just the beginning of a run of bad luck. That bump in the road makes Tammy even later to her job at a typical fast-food joint where her officious boss Keith (Falcone) summarily fires her. Hell need some McCarthy-styled humiliation first a blend of wild gesticulation and verbal barrage that have become the actress comic trademark which is the films raison detre and its fatal flaw.Long story short car breaks down on the way home. Tammy finally arrives to find her hubby Greg (Nat Faxon) sharing a romantic dinner with Missi (Toni Collette) a neighbor. More McCarthy-styled humiliation this time mixed with some seriously hurt feelings ensues.Next stop is Moms. Allison Janney as Deb administers a little tough love which sets out the movies theme -- its time for Tammy to grow up stop acting out get her life together and stop blaming other people for her problems.A road trip is required.As it happens Pearl wants to break out of a rut too. And with a car and a wad of cash she has the means to do it. After some insult trading grandma and granddaughter are on the road to self-empowerment. But make no mistake ""Thelma amp; Louise"" this is not though Sarandons wind-blown curls and infectious smile are a constant reminder.There will however be good men -- Earl (Gary Cole) for Pearl and his son Bobby (Mark Duplass) for Tammy -- a lesbian Fourth of July party thrown by cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates) and her girlfriend (Sandra Oh) a robbery a few stints in jail a lot of whiskey and beer a lot of dancing and a lot of personal growth. Which is to say if theres a point or a punch line it will be hammered to death.While Tammy gets plenty of tough love along the way and not just from Mom McCarthy is clearly in need of some too.The sad truth is that we fall out of love with comics almost as fast as we fall in love with them. Few have escaped. Chevy Chases pratfalls were funny -- for a while. Eddie Murphys rap was hysterical -- until it wasnt. Vince Vaughns deadpan delivery was special -- then not so much. Jack Blacks eye-arching outrage was a hoot -- but short-lived. Adam Sandlers idiocy -- well Im not sure that was ever very funny its certainly completely lost whatever charm it had.Like other actors comics have to mix it up. Its what Bill Murray did with ""Lost in Translation"" earning a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. Murphy made an impressive dramatic turn in ""Dreamgirls"" Oscar-nominated as well. Robin Williams crossover began in earnest with ""Good Morning Vietnam"" in 1987. A decade and two more Oscar-nominated performances later he would win for ""Good Will Hunting."" And as much as Ive loved watching Sandra Bullock falling down over the years in romantic comedies like ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""The Proposal"" its been such a treat to see her push into different terrain -- from her Oscar-winning insistent mother in ""The Blind Side"" to her space engineer in ""Gravity."" McCarthy is clearly talented and there are certainly hints in virtually every role that shes got the pathos and pain to match the comedy. But comedy is her calling card. Her aggressive in-your-face physically fearless style was a refreshing surprise at first. It brought her success long before her breakout in 2011s ""Bridesmaids.""The problem is she just keeps playing the same card Opposite Jason Bateman in ""Identity Thief"" opposite Bullock in ""The Heat"" which theyll apparently reprise in ""The Heat 2"" at some point. There is the softer-gentler couples version in the long-running CBS sitcom ""Mike amp; Molly."" The bulk of her future projects appear to be dealing it too. Shuffling the deck wouldnt mean walking away from comedy. It just means occasionally giving us and herself a break. Whether or not the actress can make the leap to Oscar-level work is an open question but wouldnt it be nice if McCarthy tried to answer it?---------------------------TammyMPAA rating R for language including sexual referencesRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In general releaseTwitter BetsySharkey Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Melissa McCarthy Theft Crime Tammy trailer Melissa McCarthys star power helps her go out on a limb with Tammy Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-tammy-review-20140702-column.html,200,tammy23,tammy,latimes

Youre a hilarious and fearless actress with an Oscar nomination box office clout and gazillions of fans. But your latest outing a labor of love called Tammy is a dangerous step backward. Clunky and aimless its quite possibly the hottest mess of the year. PHOTOS Summer 2014 movie preview And it needs to never ever happen again. Most disappointing As the films co-writer and co-producer your fingerprints are all over this crime scene. Which means that the title character -- a foul-mouthed and clumsy fast-food worker who only speaks at high volumes -- is on you. So pathetic is Tammy that on the same day that she hits a deer with her clunker of a car and gets fired from her minimum wage job and catches her husband cheating on her with a neighbor and then proceeds to pack up her stuff the handle on her suitcase breaks and her clothes fall over the floor. Ha? PHOTOS Funniest female stars in Hollywood To escape her problems Tammy hits the road with her equally obnoxious and bored grandma Pearl. Grandma is played by Susan Sarandon and she dresses in pastels and wears a fright wig. The casting here is plain peculiar. Assuming Betty White and Cloris Leachman werent available theres no reason why she couldnt just play your mom. Tammy jokingly describes her as being 100 years old though she apparently did it back in the day with 70s rocker Duane Allman. Every moment of Tammy and Pearls endless drive through the heartland is visible from 100 miles away. Pearl likes the booze and the men . . . because alcoholic old ladies with healthy sex drives are apparently always comedy gold. Cut to a scene in the bar in which she slobbers all over a local and has loud sex in the back seat of the car. Cash-strapped and disgruntled Tammy meanwhile stages a haphazard robbery at her former fast-food joint -- only to flail trying to jump across the counter and having trouble locking the staffers in the fridge. PHOTOS Melissa and more stars with bangs Its not funny. None of it is. Not you crashing a jet-ski or you pounding a vending machine until the powdered donuts fall out. Only the most juvenile of moviegoers want to see a heroine fall on her face over and over physically and emotionally. Bad enough that Pearl selfishly kicks Tammy out of the motel room one night and she must sleep on cement -- a raccoon also has to nibble on her face. And thats before Grandma calls her ""a fat loser."" To her face. At a party. In front of hundreds of people. Melissa do you even like Tammy? After all when you finally get to kiss your drip of a crush (Mark Duplass) the camera immediately pulls back to the point where ants could play your stunt doubles PHOTOS Melissas style evolution As you proved in Bridesmaids and on Saturday Night Live and heck in Gilmore Girls your talent stretches far beyond silly pratfalls and cheap humor. (Its not a good sign when a throwaway joke about Obamacare earns the loudest laugh.) You dont have to resort to shouting and pouty faces and a makeover scene. But theres hope. Your character Megan in Bridesmaids put it perfectly Youre the problem and the solution. So for your next endeavor please create or pick a well-rounded smart character that will make us smile -- not sigh and look at our watches. Its either you or CGI robots every summer and we much prefer you.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TEA TIME? That is Long Island Ice Tea. (Michael Tackett) B Tammy Genre Comedy; Starring Dan Aykroyd Kathy Bates Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon; Director Ben Falcone Melissa McCarthy; Release Date Wide 07/02/2014; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 16 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Its hard out there for a Tammy. In the space of one terrible horrible no good very bad day she loses her car (totaled); her fast-food job (terminated for car-related tardiness); and her husband (stolen by toothy neighbor Toni Collette). In other hands -- say John Cassavetes or Charlie Kaufmans -- this could be the beginning of a small thoughtful drama about losing and finding yourself in failure. But because Tammy is cowritten and played by Melissa McCarthy its a broad helter-skelter farce whose best bits hinge almost entirely on the considerable charms of its star. Susan Sarandon as the boozy grandma Tammy brings along to bankroll her post-life-implosion road trip is game sporting a frazzled wig and diabetes-swollen ankle socks (shes only 24 years older than McCarthy in real life). She never seems totally comfortable with the rhythms of comedy though. And the script co-penned with McCarthys husband Ben Falcone (who also directed) is lumpy. Supporting players -- including Mark Duplass as the sweetly droll love interest Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh as a kind-hearted lesbian couple and Alison Janney and Dan Aykroyd as Tammys clueless parents -- never quite get to tap into what they can do. But the movie hinges of course on Tammy. We arent invited to admire her Shes lazy and imperious and thinks Neil Armstrong is the guy who rode his bike in the Tour de France. Still McCarthy is such a force of nature -- she barrels onscreen in a human hurricane of dimples and Crocs and pure unchecked id -- that she feels more genuine than almost any other woman whos been allowed (oh show business) to carry her own major Hollywood film besides possibly her Bridesmaids costar Kristen Wiig. Even when the material falls short shes never not worth watching.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 8 p.m. EDT July 2 2014Susan Sarandon left and Melissa McCarthy star in the comedy ""Tammy"" co-written by McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone.(Photo Saeed Adyani Warner Bros. Pictures)Tammy aspires to be a latter-day Thelma amp; Louise and since it co-stars Susan Sarandon one could say at least it has its Louise. But thats about it.Melissa McCarthy plays the title role and she and Sarandon as Tammys 70-something grandmother Pearl spend most of the movie ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Wednesday nationwide) on a road trip on the run from their disappointing home lives and from the law.But the similarities end there. Where 1991sThelma amp; Louise was funny and action-filled Tammys story is thin cringe-inducing and worst of all for a comedy not funny. Jokes land with a thud and the pacing is leaden.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesWritten by McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone who also directs and co-stars it feels like a pet project gone very wrong.Its hard to say which is worse the bad writing or the clumsy direction. To make matters all the more disappointing Tammy has one of the best casts of any comedy in recent memory though most of the actors are given little to do.Sarandons talent essentially is the only worthwhile element of the film. She at least has a vague character arc. But roles played by Toni Collette Allison Janney Kathy Bates Sandra Oh Dan Aykroyd Gary Cole and Mark Duplass might as well have gone to first-time actors or even extras.Collette plays Missi the neighbor who has an affair with Tammys husband Greg (Nat Faxon). She speaks perhaps two sentences and giggles a bit. Really? Thats what an Oscar-nominated actress (The Sixth Sense) is given to do?Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Melissa McCarthy plays the most ridiculous robber ever in Tammy. VPCThe pedigrees are noteworthy Will Ferrell and Adam McKay (Anchorman) produced the film and McCarthy can be a hilarious comedian. She is so raucously funny in Bridesmaids and The Heat and charming on TVs Mike amp; Mollyand Gilmore Girls. But her extreme brashness is mostly exhausting here.Falcones direction is particularly flat with bad edits and an awkward structure. But its the formulaic tin-eared script that is the source of the most egregious problems.The film opens with a particularly awful day for Tammy. She crashes into a deer loses her job at a fast-food restaurant and catches her husband with another woman. Time to hit the road.. She demands that her mom (Janney) hand over her car. Tammy presumably is meant to be in her 30s but McCarthy will be 44 next month and Janney is 54 so casting her as Tammys mom is a stretch. And Sarandons grandmother is meant to be elderly and infirm (an alcoholic with foot problems from diabetes) yet shes energetic enough to have a rambunctious roll in the hay with a farmer she meets in a bar (Gary Cole). Turns out that shes always been hot to trot having made a pass at her son-in-law (Dan Ackroyd).At least Pearl can blame her bad behavior on drunkenness. Tammy is just plain disorderly. She throws an obnoxious fit when shes fired and her mean-spirited obstreperousness doesnt end there. Shes downright ignorant for most of the film then for no apparent reason grows a lot smarter.Tammy is a woeful misstep for McCarthy and a joyless experience for the viewer. 113 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1lQ2CN5",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/01/tammy-review/10635497/,200,tammy26,tammy,usatoday
"Review Tammy - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Tammy  1/2 Video Passion project Tammy will definitely please Melissa McCarthy fans Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Melissa McCarthys 7-years-in-the-making comedy ""Tammy."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Melissa McCarthys 7-years-in-the-making comedy ""Tammy."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Small favors but in ""Tammy"" we have a less grating road-trip comedy than ""Identity Thief"" the one Melissa McCarthy did with Jason Bateman and a more deliberately heartwarming vehicle than ""The Heat"" featuring McCarthy and Sandra Bullock.In McCarthy we have a performer we can trust to deliver laughs even when they barely exist on the page. The ""Mike amp; Molly"" star and Oscar nominee (for ""Bridesmaids"") produced and co-wrote her latest with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed. The movie doesnt look like anything special. The number of reaction shots designed to cue audience adoration could choke a horse. Yet matters of visual craft story logic and tonal indecision are nothing up against a diversion that pounds its heroine with adversity while allowing her a romantic prospect in the form of a nice gentle fellow in this case played by Mark Duplass whose job in ""Tammy"" is mainly to beam and crack up at his co-star. This is what its like most of a typical movie year only with the genders switched. The overwhelming percentage of comedies are made driven and consumed by guys; the female roles limit actresses either to decoration or bland recessive supportive background maternal figures. ""Tammy"" at least lets McCarthy and Susan Sarandon run the show. You dont believe for a second that Sarandon is this protagonists broken-down alcoholic grandmother. (Allison Janney plays Tammys mother.) But the movie shoves McCarthy and Sarandon in a car together quickly without much in the way of expository set-up.Brash yet insecure Tammy lives somewhere in downstate Illinois (the film was shot in North Carolina) and when we meet her while shes having an epically lousy day. Bang her old car hits a deer on the way to the fast-food joint from which shes about to be fired. Boom she arrives home early to find her husband (Nat Faxon) dallying with a neighbor (Toni Collette). Tammy and her grandmother embark on a much-needed escape vaguely in the direction of Niagara Falls so the older woman can cross the waterfall off her personal bucket list. The bulk of the story unfolds in Missouri where grandmothers cousin played by Kathy Bates has a huge riverside estate and lives contentedly with her lover portrayed by Sandra Oh. A 4th of July party provides the film with its centerpiece as Sarandons wisecracker gets sloshed enough to humiliate Tammy in public. Family secrets spill like knocked-over beer. The movie exploits heavy drinking and working-class-shlub cliches for fun until it suits the plots dramatic confrontations to play them for pathos.The best bits care not for plot or forwarding the action or any other overrated screenwriting element. Theres hardly a whisper of politics or social satire in ""Tammy"" but when McCarthys working-class doyenne filling up the car at a gas station mutters sarcastically ""Four bucks a gallon? Thanks Obamacare"" the film blessedly makes room for a sliver of nonsense. My favorite moment has nothing to with story or even the title character Its a shot held longer than usual (director Falcone has a few things to learn about pacing and cutting less frantically) depicting Bates on the dance floor busting some moves resembling someone dealing with terrible back pain. As for Collette and Oh they have next-to-nothing or nothing at all to say to the point that you wonder if these characters are supposed to be mute or mimes in training.""Tammy"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for language including sexual references)Running time 136Opens Wednesdaymjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Reviews Tammy Melissa McCarthys star power helps her go out on a limb with Tammy Latest movie reviews Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-tammy-review-20140701,0,3307978.column",200,tammy27,tammy,chicagotribune
"Tammy hits the road with a splat review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTammy hits the road with a splat reviewThere is playing to your strengths and there is cringing overkill and with the road comedy Tammy Melissa McCarthy is getting awfully close to the latter. By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 1 2014Tammy Starring Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon Allison Janney Mark Duplass Gary Cole and Kathy Bates. Directed by Ben Falcone. At GTA theatres. 97 minutes. 14AThere is playing to your strengths and there is cringing overkill and with the road comedy Tammy Melissa McCarthy is getting awfully close to the latter.Her aggressive comic style works best in small bursts in an ensemble cast as her Oscar-nominated turn in Bridesmaids hilariously confirmed. She can also succeed if shes paired with an equally go-for-broke partner as she was with Sandra Bullock in last years summer hit The Heat. Article Continued BelowLeft to carry most of the laugh load however McCarthy just isnt ready for prime time especially since she has yet to move past the impulsive loudmouth character that brought her fame.Susan Sarandon 67 plays grandmother to Melissa McCarthy 43 in the buddy movie Tammy.She co-wrote this mean-spirited and talent-squandering film with her comedian husband Ben Falcone who also acts and makes his directing debut. The pair prove themselves tone deaf when it comes to family projects.McCarthys titular Tammy is a walking time bomb or rather a driving one.After nearly killing a deer she carelessly struck on the highway she arrives late for her job at a small Illinois burger joint and immediately gets fired by her martinet of a manager (Falcone).On her way out the door hurling oaths Tammy retaliates by contaminating trays of food -- and the ""fun"" has only just begun. She arrives tired and sweaty at her abode to find her husband (Nat Faxon) having a romantic dinner with their next-door neighbour (Toni Collette).Tammy gets precious little sympathy from her mother Deb (Allison Janney) when she tearfully shows up moments later at her childhood home demanding the keys to moms car so she can get the hell out of Hicksville. Deb refuses having seen too many outbursts like these in the past.But Tammy finds a willing co-conspirator in her grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) who not only has a car and a wad of cash but also a yen to see Niagara Falls before Deb shoves her into a nursing home.Before you can say Thelma and Louise the gals are tooling down the highway illegally hoisting brewskis to the tune of Canned Heats ""Going Up The Country"" (guess Steppenwolfs ""Born To Be Wild"" was unavailable).Howd you guess that Pearl would also turn out to be a troublemaker? Shes into booze and sex both of which are provided by a rowdy farmer (Gary Cole) much to the discomfort of his uptight son (Mark Duplass). Tammy meanwhile seems determined to continue making a public spectacle of herself as she rudely sets upon any person or machine that crosses her path. Brace yourself for confrontations with cops liquor store clerks water toy renters and burger stand drones along with the inevitable third act bid for redemption and romance.None of this is remotely mirthful -- as good as she is Sarandon lacks the comic timing of a Sandra Bullock or Kristen Wiig -- and some of it is painful to watch.Such as in a barroom scene where Tammy sets out to prove shes catnip to males boldly propositioning two men seated nearby. When they politely turn her down her response is to insinuate that they must be gay.Homophobic much? Theres a lot of such crude humour in the film which you expect from McCarthy but what are we to make of the unspoken ageism in the film? It reinforces Hollywoods implicit message that women over 40 have to play kooky or maternal characters.McCarthy is 43 yet Janney 54 is playing her mother while Sarandon 67 is her grandmother. How does this make any sense outside of Hollywood?The story could have been much better funnier had the three women played friends instead of multi-generational relations.And why stop there? Make the film a true ensemble comedy by making better use of the very funny Toni Collette and other amusing actors who are regrettably reduced to cameos Kathy Bates Sandra Oh and Dan Aykroyd.But then Tammy is really only about Melissa McCarthy which is where the problem begins and ends.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a reason that Melissa McCarthy the Oscar-nominated wrecking ball of Bridesmaids appears pretty much exclusively in buddy comedies. Her shtick a slapstick destructiveness laced with sarcastic obscenities requires a foil to play against--a David Spade to her Chris Farley a straight man (or woman) to balk at her bull-in-a-china-shop antics. Yet in Tammy her latest comedy the actress hasnt been paired off with some exasperated square a la Identity Thief or The Heat. Shes met her match and it arrives in the boozy amorous form of Susan Sarandon playing the worlds least responsible senior citizen. Losing her car her job and her husband over the course of one endless day from hell McCarthys titular fuck-up splits town with hard-drinking cash-flush Grandma Pearl in the passenger seat. Their destination is Niagara Falls but the two end up instead in Missouri their path of destruction paved in empty beer cans fast-food wrappers and totaled jet skis.Tammy in other words is a road comedy--one that gets some good mileage out of the rapport between its unlikely travelmates. Boasting a messy tangle of gray hair and a mischievous streak Sarandon removes some of the burden of outrageousness from the broad shoulders of her co-star freeing McCarthy to exhibit more of her sensitive side. Maybe too much of it actually Despite a couple of broadly comic mishaps--an opening encounter with a CGI deer an inept robbery--Tammy is a kinder gentler and tamer vehicle for its headliner. McCarthy co-wrote the film with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed and appears as the heroines wormy tyrant of a boss. Their collaborative mojo results in some winning sweetness but not a lot of hilarity. Tammy eventually makes eyes with a relaxed nice guy played by Mark Duplass and while its faintly charming to see the normally unhinged actress granted a low-key love story the cuteness cant compensate for the lack of laughs. McCarthy is going to need better material if shes going to transition into a rom-com career. Astutely aware of what a boys club big-screen comedy has become Falcone admirably packs his directorial debut with female talent The film is perhaps most endearing as a showcase for a fine ensemble of actresses including Kathy Bates Allison Janney Sandra Oh and Sarah Baker. And Sarandon again gamely embraces what could have been a stock role (the troublemaking octogenarian) leaning heavily on her underused comedic chops. (Putting the Thelma amp; Louise star back in an automobile for another femme-centric road trip is its own stroke of near-genius.) Ultimately the big problem with Tammy is Tammy herself Shes an ill-conceived underdog--a down-on-her-luck heroine who oscillates per the demands of the poky plot between typically caustic wit and an uncharacteristic defeatism. McCarthy just doesnt excel at wallowing self-pity; shes a force of madcap confidence not a wallflower in need of self-help seminars. Interesting though it is to see her try a different buddy-comedy dynamic the actress should probably leave the soggy life lessons to say Sandra Bullock. No personality this big needs to be ""fixed.""

A woman tries to restart her life on a road trip with her grandma. Director Ben Falcone (136). PG-13 Language. Area theaters. Inside of ""Tammy"" is a wilder crazier better movie trying to come out. The fact that it stars the extremely funny Melissa McCarthy is both its saving grace and incredibly frustrating. Following an Oscar-nominated turn in ""Bridesmaids"" and outrageous co-star roles in last years ""Identity Thief"" and ""The Heat"" this should have been McCarthys moment to grab the comedy-superstar reins. Instead she feels reined in stuck in a movie that feels half-baked. The ironic thing is that McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone wrote the script and Falcone directed. When we first see Tammy Banks (McCarthy) shes rocking out to 80s music driving down a southern Illinois highway -- and runs smack into a deer. Winding up late for work Tammy is fired by her snippy boss (Falcone in a fun cameo). At home she catches her husband (Nat Faxon) having a cozy dinner with their neighbor (Toni Colette). Deciding shes had enough the combustible Tammy walks two houses down and announces to her mom (Allison Janney) that she needs to take her grandma Pearls car and get out of small-town Murphysboro. She gets the car but doesnt count on Pearl (Susan Sarandon) coming with her on a road trip. The squabbling pair decide to head to Niagara Falls but make a wrong turn and go one state over to Missouri. Encouraged to ""have a little fun"" by her hard-drinking randy grandma Tammy takes a jet ski out on a lake wrecks it and is forced to buy it. Needing money Tammy robs a fast-food restaurant in the movies funniest scene. Melissa McCarthy goes for a ride with Susan Sarandon in Tammy. (Michael Tackett) Dan Aykroyd and Melissa McCarthy in Tammy (Michael Tackett) Mark Duplass and Melissa McCarthy in Tammy (Michael Tackett) Melissa McCarthy takes action in Tammy. (Michael Tackett) Melissa McCarthy and her real-life husband Ben Falcone in Tammy (Michael Tackett) Going east to Kentucky they stop at a honky-tonk bar where Pearl hooks up with smooth old Earl (Gary Cole) while Tammy flirts with Earls good-guy son Bobby (Mark Duplass). Later the women arrive at a ""lesbian Fourth of July party"" hosted by Pearls cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates) and her girlfriend Suzanne (the talented Sandra Oh who given little to do keeps stretching out her arms free-spiritedly). Its here that Tammy is given a pep talk by Lenore to stop whining and do something with her life as Pearl confronts her own alcoholism. ""Tammy"" had potential. McCarthys first moments are the classic comedy outcast-loser introduction similar to Bill Murrays in ""Stripes."" But it quickly meanders losing steam until the long sojourn at the lesbian party. Sarandon is up for anything as usual but her character Pearl is simply thrown up on screen a cliched old rabble-rouser in a dowdy wig. Duplass Bates Janney and Dan Aykroyd (in a cameo as Tammys dad) are similarly underused in roles that feel underwritten. We barely get to know Tammy herself for all her bitching and moaning. And yet when the movie sets things up right McCarthy delivers. Her goofy bad-ass dance moves as Tammy prepares for the robbery are a slow-motion ballet of silliness combining the gracefulness of Jackie Gleason with the cluelessness of Will Ferrell. She conveys a Middle-American stubbornness -- and a very real sense of everyday outrage -- that explodes when confronted by authority. Her willingness to look absurd for the sake of a sight gag is rare and admirable. McCarthy remains a force of nature. If only the shambling ""Tammy"" was worth her effort. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Pictures shows Susan Sarandon left and Melissa McCarthy in a scene from ""Tammy."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Saeed Adyani) Melissa McCarthy is undoubtedly rich and according to the supermarket tabloids she has conquered Hollywood ""on her own terms"" yet you cant help feeling sorry for her. Even though she co-wrote ""Tammy"" with her husband director Ben Falcone it feels like punishment -- for McCarthy and for the audience.By letting this undernourished nonsense crawl into theaters is Hollywood teaching McCarthy an ironic lesson about acceptable body types? And is the movie industry punking the public because McCarthys mediocre ""Identity Thief"" earned more money than Oscar nominees ""12 Years a Slave"" ""Philomena"" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and ""Nebraska"" combined?The latter film like ""Tammy"" is a cross-generational road trip but the difference is day and nightmare. Here Tammy is the mean-spirited simpleton who embarks on a pointless journey while old-timer Pearl (poor Susan Sarandon) is the ostensibly smarter co-pilot.Yet grandma Pearl is also a free-spirited ex-groupie and a drinker so she never bothers to resolve why Tammy would recuperate from a job loss and a broken marriage by driving a thousand miles from Southern Illinois to Niagara Falls.McCarthy and first-time director Falcone must have assumed that tossing a drunk and a dunce into a Cadillac would negate the need for a motive or even a script.But ""Tammy"" runs out of gas by the time it crosses the state line (into a mythical Missouri that isnt bounded by rivers). Even after the women wreck a Jet Ski hook up with father and son farmers (Gary Cole and Mark Duplass) and get tossed into jail for sassing cops at a convenience store the movie wont divulge what its about. If you expect that the burger-joint robbery depicted in the commercials will have any bearing on the plot you might be a little too logical for this lowbrow test of patience. And notwithstanding the obligatory scene where the slovenly unsympathetic protagonist gets a makeover the movie has even less heart than brains.In a low-bar comparison to ""Identity Thief"" its cheaply produced poorly directed and dreadfully unfunny.By presenting an outline on a greasy napkin as a finished movie ""Tammy"" is scammy.What ""Tammy""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 136  Content Strong language including sexual references Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Tammy"" Melissa McCarthys first starring vehicle is a shambling road trip that travels from broad slapstick to goopy sentimentality. Its more a pile of incidents than a story. Without a guiding focus McCarthys boisterous comic energy runs amok. The result barely holds together as a movie. Directed by her husband Ben Falcone and co-written by the couple ""Tammy"" follows the misadventures of a Midwestern fast-food worker whom we meet on a really bad day. In the course of an hour she wrecks her car gets fired from her burger-joint job and discovers her husband is having an affair with a neighbor. A run of bad luck typically will put us on the side of the underdog but here were not given a defined character to identify with. Tammy has traits -- shes blustering vulgar and essentially good-hearted the female Chris Farley -- but the script gives us no sense of her history. When she discovers her husbands affair were primed for a confrontation or shamefaced apologies something of interest. After all hes played by Nat Faxon and the other woman is Toni Collette. Frustratingly the script gives us no clue about what made him and Tammy a couple or pushed them apart. Its just another random bummer. Tammys collision with a deer had more emotional weight. Running away from her troubles Tammy and her hard-drinking grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) take to the highway. Pearl was a wild thing in her day a 70s rock n roll groupie whose personality may have influenced Tammys supersized appetites and undisciplined attitude. Thats pure conjecture; the screenplay never grapples with the idea in any meaningful way. Warner Bros. Melissa McCarthy as Tammy and Susan Sarandon as Pearl in New Line Cinemas comedy ""Tammy"" a Warner Bros. Picture release. Together the pair visit country bars campgrounds jail and long-lost relatives. Everywhere along the way they meet fine performers in throwaway cameos. Theres Dan Aykroyd and Allison Janney as Tammys gruff parents; Gary Cole and Mark Duplass as a father-son duo who might be right for Pearl and Tammy; Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh as a wealthy lesbian relation and her partner. Bates alone gets a worthwhile scene to play a ""get hold of yourself girl"" lecture to Tammy and she knocks it out of the park. But the overall design of her character makes no sense. Shes a pillar of the community one moment and a CSI-level expert on evading police and destroying evidence the next. The film has been sold as if its a zany crime comedy focusing on a stickup artist. The sequence where Tammy knocks over a fast-food franchise is just another aside in the lumpy narrative. The story doesnt use the incident to make a point. Its just another thing that happens in a story that stumbles along until it stops on the theory that every list of things has to end somewhere. Theres a lot of food-related humor in the film. In those terms ""Tammy"" is toxically stale like one of those decaying foodstuffs you dread finding in the back of your refrigerator. When forced to deal with it you take salad tongs in hand hold it at arms length and drop it in the trash. We all love Melissa McCarthy. But we mustnt enable her.

Tammy review Tears of a clown - not so funny 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Tammy Comedy. Starring Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon and Kathy Bates. Directed by Ben Falcone. (R. 96 minutes.) The temptation of great clowns to become sad clowns must be irresistible because sooner or later they all fall victim to it. But few have fallen harder and faster than Melissa McCarthy in ""Tammy."" Just three years after ""Bridesmaids"" made her famous we find her weeping and smiling through tears in a film she produced and co-wrote with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed. But ""Tammy"" didnt need a production. It needed an intervention. Perhaps the problem is that McCarthy has become a star. Thats an odd problem and a nice problem to have but McCarthy functions better as a supporting player or as an antagonist as someone relentless and unchanging that another character has to deal with. To make her the focus of a story inevitably means that she has to undergo some kind of transformation which means going from insensitive to sensitive from unaware to self-aware ... and from funny to not funny. Theres only one genuinely funny scene in ""Tammy"" and of course its the first. We find McCarthy driving down the road in a beat-up car dressed in the uniform of a fast-food restaurant looking clueless sweaty and vaguely hostile. As soon as we see her face we get ready for a good time and a minute later she delivers Her boss (Falcone) fires her and she has a tantrum in which she contaminates the burgers by licking her hands and touching them. ""Enjoy the special sauce"" she yells. But no that cant last. The first hint of trouble comes right after the credits when Tammy finds out that her husband is cheating on her. She starts crying and we realize that though we cant exactly take this seriously the scene isnt really being played for laughs either. The second hint of trouble is no hint at all but the full blast of bad news. ""Tammy"" becomes the story of a long road trip by Tammy (McCarthy) and her alcoholic grandmother played by Susan Sarandon in a gray wig. What makes the Grandma-Tammy pairing so unfortunate is that within this structure Sarandon is the zany and McCarthy is the straight man. Surely McCarthy and Falcone had to have realized this when they were writing it. So why didnt they just tear up the screenplay and start over again? Perhaps they were too busy thinking up more scenes in which someone tells Tammy how wonderful she is. As a first-time director Falcone has trouble maintaining a specific tone - the movie wobbles back and forth between sentimentality and silliness sometimes even within the same scene. The comic bits dont fly and even the road trips destination - Niagara Falls - feels arbitrary with neither interest nor meaning. But at least McCarthy gets to cry some more and look deeply hurt when people are mean to her. As a man who develops a romantic interest in Tammy Mark Duplass looks in every scene as if he hopes the ground will swallow him. Its almost worth seeing the movie just to see how uncomfortable an actor can look. Susan Sarandon has some redeemable moments but she is so enmeshed in this misbegotten movies machinery that its impossible to enjoy her. Actually the one standout is Kathy Bates. The character she plays is an exaggerated construct a lesbian businesswoman who throws lavish parties with hundreds of her lesbian friends but she has one scene in which she transcends the wreckage. She talks about her life and her struggles and if you were to just walk in those moments you might actually think ""Tammy"" is a good movie. But to maintain the illusion youd have to walk out a minute later. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com 350 p.m. MST July 1 2014Susan Sarandon stars as Pearl and Melissa McCarthy as the title role in a scene from ""Tammy.""(Photo New Line Cinema (Warner Bros.))Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 starsMelissa McCarthy co-wrote the movie her her husband who is also the films director.Huge cast of hilarious women Susan Sarandon Kathy Bates Toni Collette and more.McCarthy is hilarious but a little of her humor goes a long way.A charismatic personality can go a long way in patching over a films shortcomings. But its another problem when that charismatic personality is the sole point of a film.Melissa McCarthy collaborated on the script for ""Tammy"" with her husband Ben Falcone who also directed the movie. So it is more especially than any of McCarthys other projects (""Heat"" ""Identity Thief"" ""Bridesmaids"") a film thats tailor-made to suit the actress comedic strengths. But when that chief strength is being super good at being obnoxious a little goes a long way.INTERVIEW Melissa McCarthy on Tammy Susan SarandonTammys life starts out a complete disaster and gets worse from there. Shes a mess of a woman heading to her fast-food job in a rusted green Toyota Corolla thats older than the boombox in her passenger seat blasting the Outfields ""Your Love."" She smashes into a deer on her way to work further wrecks her already pretty wrecked car arrives to work late and gets fired then comes home in the middle of a workday to find that her husband has been cheating on her with a neighbor.Shes desperate to get out town and try something new but lacks the funds and transportation. So she strikes a Faustian bargain with her hard-drinking diabetic grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) whos also desperate for change -- if Pearl fronts the cash and her car Tammy will drive her to Niagara Falls a place Pearl has always wanted to visit.MORE July Movie GuideSo they set out on the road Pearl with her granny bag loaded with beer whiskey Oxycodone and hard cash itching to raise a little hell -- which she does in the backseat of her car in Louisville. Meanwhile Tammy starts to connect with Pearls paramours son Bobby (Mark Duplass) whos at first somewhat repulsed by Tammy but warms to her unpredictability.""My lifes boring"" he says ""and youre a very not-boring person.""And its a very not-boring film. In addition to McCarthy and Sarandon its packed with hilarious women in substantial roles Sandra Oh Allison Janney Toni Collette. The best is Kathy Bates who plays a rich lesbian who owns a chain of pet-supply stores and drives an RV with puppy-printed seat covers when shes not lobbing Molotov cocktails and flaming spears while screaming ""Valhalla""Theyre all fun yet digestible characters who strike a balance between humor and sincerity. But when it comes to McCarthy the film gets so distracted with the need to score laughs that it does so at the expense of developing her character and its a constant source of tonal whiplash.The film ricochets between Tammy being an oblivious cartoon goblin and a textured sympathetic human being who just wants to be loved. Perhaps if the film had catered a little less to McCarthys comedic gifts -- the curse-word fugue states the slapstick humor the non sequiturs -- the end result would have felt more balanced and rewarding.Yes that would mean cutting some of the funniest bits but sometimes youve got to kill your darlings. Is the film a slapstick comedy in which a CGI deer hoofs a woman in the chest and knocks her down or is it a thoughtful comedy-drama about a woman at a midlife crossroads attempting to change her trajectory? ""Tammy"" tries to be both. The result is equal parts funny and heartfelt -- but also less than the sum of its parts.Review Tammy 3.5 starsDirector Ben Falcone.Cast Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon Kathy Bates.Rating R for language including sexual references.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371. 20 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1lPb2UT More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

That isnt because all the other jokes in the movie are bad. Its because the rest of the movie isnt really a comedy. Okay this is an exaggeration but ""Tammy"" is far more serious than the gangsta-rap dancin jet skiing ads let on. Sure weve come to expect a few dramatic patches and force-fed life lessons in vehicles for strong comedic voices. Hell theres even a heart-to-heart in ""Meatballs."" But ""Tammy"" the first feature film directed by Ben Falcone starring Melissa McCarthy and co-written by both of them is basically a drama-in-disguise. Unfortunately its a formulaic and extremely uneven one albeit with a number of sympathetic performances. Things start out as you expect. McCarthys titular lead is introduced as an adult-child in the ""Step Brothers"" mold. A barely functioning disaster area whose slovenly behavior nearly kills a deer on the way to her gig at a fast food joint. When she loses her job and her car is trashed you may think this will be some sort of set-up for Tammy to be the goofy new face of the downtrodden 99%. Turns out she lives in a well-to-do suburb though she discovers her husband is cheating on her. That this cartoon doofus has a spouse in the first place is the first of many examples of ""Tammy""s core problem. Is this broad comedy or is this a real movie? Tammy turns to her mother (Allison Janney) who lives two doors down so again playing for silly laughs. After such a bad day Tammy decides to ""run away"" and Grandma (Susan Sarandon in old lady makeup) has the car and the cash to fund the trip. Crank the classic rock theyre on the road. There are the typical roadhouse joints and motels and diners and if it werent for the twinkle in Sarandons eye or McCarthys uncanny ability to squeeze a laugh from a throwaway remark youd likely drop dead of boredom right there in the theater. Theres a very funny sequence in which Tammy puts a bag over her head to knock over one of her old fast food restaurants - the added touch of Sharpie eyebrows are a source of genuine glee. However the scene (and its unmotivated dance moves) takes a moment to find its groove as it comes on the heels of a touching somewhat depressing scene with Grandma. Sarandons character you see is actually an alcoholic and as soon as Falcone decides he is making a Film With Themes Tammy snaps out of her dingus routine and grows 100 IQ points. Youd think this would be infuriating but heres the fascinating part. Once the film downshifts to its final third at a distant cousins lakehouse the Dr. Phil-esqu drama actually becomes. . .more compelling than the sub-par humor Blame this entirely on Sarandons inability to phone this one in I suppose. And also credit Kathy Bates (the cousin) and Sandra Oh (her wife.) Its enough to make you think that a fairly straight story about familial relationships with a few jokes tossed in might have been the way to go. ""Tammy"" is still better than ""Identity Thief"" but that movie is an all-time boondoggle. McCarthy was absolutely tremendous in ""The Heat"" so she should still make big silly comedies - still what ""Tammy"" is trying to be. She should just be cautious who she makes them with.

Its a question that co-writers Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone might have considered in ""Tammy"" since its never really clear who the title character (played by McCarthy) even is much less what her drives (and eventual goals) might be. I certainly wanted to like Tammy and ""Tammy"" since Ive been a fan of McCarthy going all the way back to her work on ""Gilmore Girls"" and at Los Angeles Groundlings improv theater prior to her dynamic Oscar-nominated turn in ""Bridesmaids."" But she and her husband Falcone (who also directed) have created a character comedy thats missing both comedy and character. See video Melissa McCarthy Gets Away and Gets Caught in New Tammy Trailer (Video) Tammy opens the film by hitting a deer with her car (not to worry its only stunned) which makes her late to her fast-food job. Her uptight manager (Falcone) fires her her car dies halfway home and she arrives at her house only to find her husband (Nat Faxon) having a romantic dinner with their next-door neighbor (Toni Collette). Going home crying to her mother Deb (Allison Janney) Tammy announces shes leaving town a vow shes apparently made and broken many times before. This time however her grandma Pearl (Susan Sarandon) is willing to throw in seed money and a car if Tammy will take her away from Deb and her threats to put Pearl in a nursing home. The two hit the highway and get into a number of scrapes -- ""Thelma amp; Louise"" this aint Sarandon or no -- and along the way we learn that Tammy felt abandoned at the age of 10 when Pearl suddenly packed up and left. We also discover that Pearl is a full-on alcoholic and diabetic who has left all her pills at home. (The prescribed ones anyway.) See photo Tammy L.A. Premiere Melissa McCarthy Ben Falcone Susan Sarandon Will Ferrell (Photos) Not that you cant introduce concepts like alcoholism and diabetes into whats supposed to be a raucous road comedy but ""Tammy"" is so lackadaisical in its pacing and in its character development that these big issues come crashing down on the movie like a meteor shower. Theyre as random and as awkward as the contrived romance between Tammy and nice-guy farmer Bobby (Mark Duplass) which also comes out of nowhere. McCarthy and Duplass have a charming chemistry together but the screenplay never provides the glue that makes them into a believable couple. In general this is a fine cast (Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh pop up later as a pair of wealthy lesbians) giving their all to material that isnt giving enough back. As for Sarandon shes clearly miscast as a character whos supposed to be a crotchety old granny. At age 67 shes still youthful and spry enough to come off like a teenage actress trying to teeter her way through a high school production of ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" in a grey wig and fake glasses. Also read Melissa McCarthy Allegedly Fires Extra from Tammy Set for Abusing Child Melissa McCarthy is the kind of singular talent who will have to chart her own course through Hollywood and shes to be commended for steering her own ship. That said she and Falcone might be wise to find someone trustworthy enough to take the helm and keep them away from leaky tugboats like ""Tammy."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Melissa McCarthy and Susan Sarandon star in the Ben Falcone-directed road-trip comedy with Kathy Bates Allison Janney Dan Aykroyd Mark Duplass Nat Faxon and Toni Collette. Several motor vehicles get totaled or badly damaged in the potholed and perilous Tammy which prompts analogous speculation as to whether this first feature outing as producer-writer-star for the normally hilarious Melissa McCarthy represents a major career wreck or just a quick moment in a ditch. Just as it was no fun being stuck in a small car on a road trip with Barbra Streisand in The Guilt Trip two years back so is it stifling to endure the same with another actress with a large shtick here; perhaps performers with such big personalities shouldnt remain confined to such cramped quarters. McCarthys legion of fans will likely sign on initially for her first film since last summers girl-cop comic smash The Heat but this ones legs will be short. LIST The Hollywood Reporter Reveals Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films The star plays the same aggressive foul-mouthed working-class slob shes mined for comic gold in previous outings but you can tell from the outset that somethings off; when she tells off the burger joint boss (director Ben Falcone McCarthys husband and the scripts co-writer) whos just fired her cursing and throwing things at him and contaminating kitchen produce whats been funny for her before no longer is. Nor is it amusing when she explodes upon returning home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) having dinner with another woman (Toni Collette) nor when she erupts at her mother for not giving her a car and then drives off with her grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon). And hold on there -- McCarthy whos 43 has a mom played by Allison Janney whos 54 and a grandma portrayed by Sarandon whos 67? Even at the early ages at which women were once-upon-a-time known to give birth in the South this is more than a bit beyond the pale. Especially when Grandma Pearl is still not only hot enough but hot-to-trot enough to provoke a randy gent Earl (Gary Cole) in a Louisville barbecue joint to pick her up and have hanky-panky in the back seat of her car while the mans ineffectual son Bobby (Mark Duplass) and Tammy chat in sight just outside the back window. Presumably were supposed to see the source of Tammys inherited bad behavior in Pearl who confesses to having slept with the ""wrong"" Allman Brother as well as having made a pass at Tammys own dad. But however hard Sarandon tries to trash herself down neither she nor Janney is a remotely plausible genetic contributor to the waddling disaster zone that is Tammy. Where are Marie Dressler and Shelley Winters when you need them? PHOTOS Pulp Fiction Thelma amp; Louise Stars Reunite Tammy messes up time and time again. She crashes Pearls Jet Ski holds up a different outlet of her old burger chain wearing a paper bag on her head in a laugh-free sequence and eventually gets thrown in the clink for further vehicular destruction. Tammy comes out indisputably older and allegedly wiser prompting a personality change that suggests that even a soul as seemingly unsalvageable as Tammys can be saved just as Pearl can be made to stop drinking thereby getting her diabetes under control and reducing the circumference of her ankles by two-thirds. In its final third the film makes a detour to take in a huge lesbian Fourth of July party thrown by Pearls cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates in bon vivant form) and her partner (Sandra Oh). Its an all-female affair except for the unlikely appearances of Earl and Bobby with the latter being proposed as a good prospect for Tammy despite the fact that hes terminally dim and doormattish. So the film progresses from merely unfunny to unconvincing to dull. Its a waste of a good cast as well as a serious trip wire for McCarthy who may know whats best for her talents but on the evidence needs a deft-handed outsider to make sure shes maximizing them.

"Tammy Review Melissa McCarthy Stars in Middling Misfire | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Tammy Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 18 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr July 1 2014 | 0800AM PT Melissa McCarthy wrote produced and starred in this ambitious but middling comedy misfire directed by Ben Falcone. A well-meaning personal project that never rises above the level of amiable mediocrity ""Tammy"" feels like the kind of picture that can happen only when a major talent -- here the unsinkable Melissa McCarthy who wrote the script with her husband and director Ben Falcone -- has amassed enough clout to try something different. Not that it looks all that different initially Playing a disgruntled Midwesterner who impulsively goes on a road trip with her boozy floozy of a grandmother (Susan Sarandon) McCarthy delivers another one of her patented loser-girl comic showcases all coarse displays of temper aggression and flailing ineptitude. That the performance and the movie ultimately aspire to something richer -- a compassionate look at midlife malaise and cross-generational female bonding -- turns out to be more admirable in theory than enjoyable in the execution by the end of this middling misfire. Still the fact that the public hasnt proven terribly discriminating in its embrace of McCarthys previous efforts (the lousy ""Identity Thief"" and the enjoyable ""The Heat"" both grossed more than 130 million) suggests the Warner Bros. release could still post respectable B.O. numbers at least during the July 4 holiday frame. After that initial wave a sense of deflation seems inevitable thanks to material that one suspects would never have attracted this level of talent -- from cast names like Mark Duplass Allison Janney Kathy Bates and Toni Collette to producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay -- were it not for the sheer amount of industry goodwill that McCarthy has generated over the years. Goodwill alas is not something the titular Tammy (McCarthy) tends to foster in others. We first encounter this hopelessly disheveled dirty-blonde creature on one of the worst days of her life After striking a deer on the highway and totaling her car in the process she gets fired from her job at a local fast-food joint Topper Jacks (Falcone plays her soon-to-be-ex-boss) then returns home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) romancing their neighbor (Collette wasted). Deciding that shes had it with life in her pathetic small town of Murphysboro Ill. Tammy packs a bag and hits the road -- something she manages only with the help of her similarly fed-up grandmother Pearl (Sarandon) who agrees to let Tammy drive her Buick and spend her 6000 or so in cash but only if she can come along for the ride. Sporting a frizzy gray wig to hide the fact that she and McCarthy are a mere 24 years apart Sarandon (whose casting in both this and the mother of all gal-pal road movies ""Thelma amp; Louise"" is hardly a coincidence) throws herself gamely into the role of the saucy and troubled Pearl. As this bickersome duo head in the general direction of Niagara Falls Grans personal problems threaten to eclipse even Tammys A hopeless alcoholic whos still as randy as she was in her wild and crazy youth Pearl wastes no time in seducing a handsome older barfly named Earl (Gary Cole) leaving Tammy to make idle chitchat with Earls cutely standoffish son Bobby (Duplass). Through a series of hijinks either too complicated or too idiotic to summarize Pearl somehow winds up behind bars prompting Tammy to rob the nearest Topper Jacks in order to post her grandmothers bail. Naturally she goes about this in the most dunderheaded fashion imaginable. But just when all seems lost theyre rescued by Pearls sage old friend Lenore (Kathy Bates) and her partner Susanne (Sandra Oh) who invite them to their riverfront mansion for a lesbian Fourth of July BBQ that provides an almost magical respite from all the shenanigans. Its during this interlude that Tammy will have to deal with the heavy emotional baggage of her broken relationship with Pearl and figure out how to get her own life back on track. Falcone and McCarthy clearly have some unusual goals in mind for a mainstream comedy from their refreshing decision to crowd the film almost entirely with female characters (while giving the men comparatively short shrift) to their focus on laying bare the personal wounds resentments mistakes and compromises that have come to define Tammys tepid existence. Showing interest in a characters emotional life while simultaneously subjecting her to comic ridicule requires a uniquely deft touch and fortunately the film doesnt go the easy ""Identity Thief"" route of squeezing McCarthy into the most annoying role imaginable only to redeem her by way of a sudden physical and moral makeover. Tammy to her credit isnt quite so neatly defined and shes well served by McCarthys versatility as a performer her quicksilver ability to slip from obnoxious and foul-mouthed one minute to tender and open-hearted the next. (Apart from the robbery and a jet-ski misadventure the gags at the expense of Tammys physical clumsiness are kept to a refreshing minimum.) But Falcones attempts to spin this generally flat formulaic comedy into an affecting character drama are frustrated by filmmaking choices that work against a sense of persuasive reality. The hard-working efforts of both actresses aside the tetchy grandmother-granddaughter dynamic never fully sparks to emotional life; scene for scene theres a weird lack of conviction or concentration at play here. Elsewhere the (mis)casting decisions are so surreal as to seem almost deliberate at times; when Allison Janney pops up early on as Tammys mother (Janney is 11 years older than McCarthy and 13 years younger than Sarandon) the sheer randomness of it -- and the sheer number of bizarre wigs being worn at any given time -- pulls you out of the picture never to fully return. There are charming moments here as when Duplass shy Bobby gradually opens himself up to Tammys more assertive romantic overtures but these feel like flickering exceptions to the rule. Falcone encouraged his cast to improvise heavily during production -- a strategy that never pays off insofar as the guffaw-worthy moments are few and far between here. Shot mainly in and around Wilmington N.C. the pic capably conjures a vaguely depressive Middle America milieu. Film Review TammyReviewed at Arclight Cinemas Hollywood June 30 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13.

Cary Opteris says February 20 2015 at 745 pm Such a long review for a movie that is not enjoyable to the point you probably cant finish it. I know we couldnt Reply therealstarwanderer says July 20 2014 at 801 am Not your mothers (or fathers) Tammy huh? If this was a ""reboot"" you can have it. Obesity is not funny. I wouldve been happier for her if ""Tammy"" got happy (and more attractive) out of town starting over someplace else instead of going home back to her mother. Reply Murphysboro School of Art says July 14 2014 at 634 pm I was really disappointed in this film for many reasons but most of all because it wasnt funny. The big name stars in the film seemed very uncomfortable in their roles and Susan Sarandon was miscast as the grandmother. And some of the dialogue was gratuitous not to mention the grade ""B"" set decorations. My Mom is 93 years old and doesnt wear a grey curly wig Clearly Melissa and Ben havent stopped by Murphysboro Illinois in some time or they would have seen a vibrant community nestled in the middle of the southern Illinois Wine Trail. Hey Mellissa if you are going to pick on a town in the part of the country you come from the least you could do is make it funny so we could have a good laugh FYI Murphysboro is not a shitty town"" Reply susan day says July 7 2014 at 824 am Its a comedy folks and the risk with doing improv is all unpredictable. Kudos to Newline for letting them make this film. Corporate filmmaking wants to predict the outcome with every film now from marketing to algorithms. Just because it works on paper doesnt mean it works in the real world. Im a tough critic being from the Midwest writer n filmmaker and I thought her performance was balls out. There were some howling scenes n some poignant moments were I really felt for her character. I like that they took risk while most people dont know that Susan Saraden preformed improv for a number of years. Regarding Bens first directorial debut kudos. If you dont take risk and put yourself out there how will you learn. Yes some of the set ups n pacing seem long but then again we are all use to corporate filmmaking pacing. I actually thought the pacing n comedy was better than Identity theft. Reply Sandy Hunter says July 6 2014 at 336 pm I loved ""Tammy"" Even though your bad reviews put me off however I remembered that if the critics hate it then I usually love it It was sweet and funny and I walked out of the theater feeling good - for a change. Reply Terri Persico Rimmer says July 5 2014 at 821 pm You sure youre not just picking on her because shes overweight? Reply Lucy says July 5 2014 at 813 pm Detail - Kathy bates is Susan sarandons cousin- Agee totally with the headline of tej review however- parts of this movie are funny- parts are pathetic- for the love if god- that lighting the jet ski on fire is ridiculous. Overall- the movie is embarrassing- making fun of Melissa Macarthy for being overweight- having her buy donuts- it is just sad- not the laugh riot you expect from the trailer Reply ezekiel says July 4 2014 at 1256 am a one note act she prob has a few more flix in her. Reply Steve Johnson says July 1 2014 at 1026 am Being a projectionist in a multiplex digital cinema I am exposed to both the very good and very bad cinematic efforts both domestic and foreign. I thought The Heat was perhaps the funniest domestic comedy of the year last year mainly because of Melissa McCarthys hard core crude rule breaking and overbearing character and how she played off of Sandra Bullocks buttoned up conservative rule following FBI agent. That film had a depth and a heart that is noticeably absent in this effort not for the lack of trying but for the lack of character development and the absence of anything the average audience can identify with. My best example is the scene in The Heat where McCarthy has to squeeze her car into a parking spot too small to allow her out the door something every driver can identify with and therefore can laugh over. I did not find similar situations in Tammy and even when there was a connect with the audience (the scene where she is trying to teach her grandmother how to sing ""Midnight Rider"") the filmmakers milked it far too long turning the scene into a boring almost irritating exercise. I worry for McCarthy because with all the talent she has she is in danger of becoming a one note performer. Tammy failed for me because she seemed almost muzzled trying to be the obnoxious crass rule breaker but without the necessary attitude needed to make that character convincing. My hope is for her next project McCarthy steers as far away from that type of role as possible to keep from becoming a one trick pony. She has much more to offer the public (and her resume) than this. Reply litalopez says July 1 2014 at 1020 am ""Falcone and McCarthy clearly have some unusual goals in mind for a mainstream comedy from their decision to crowd the film almost entirely with female characters (while giving the men comparatively short shrift)..."" Unusual? Crowd the film with women? Give the men short shrift? Does this hurt your feelings? Make you feel uncomfortable? Guess what... that is exactly what has USUALLY happened to women in most movies for the last 100 years Were lucky when we get just two women talking to each other in any film and does anyone ever call that ""unusual?"" No thats the norm. But McCarthy Wiig Rudolph Poehler Fey amp; more are changing that. Get on board and check your sexism at the door. Its no surprise to me that male critics love to knock McCarthy because theyve never seen anything like her before. So its easy to reject the unknown. Ask yourself if you would have ever made that comment about a male-driven comedy where the women serve only as objects of desire to unnattractive men. Would you even have noticed? Reply Justin Chang says July 1 2014 at 605 pm No the high number of women in the film doesnt hurt my feelings or make me uncomfortable. I actually find it refreshing for precisely all the reasons you noted though I can see how it could be misread as written. For the record Im going to amend that sentence accordingly. Thanks for the feedback. Reply litalopez says July 1 2014 at 615 pm THANK YOU Refreshing is a great word. Use that please Dorothy says July 1 2014 at 1041 am BOOM YES I KNEW there were other reasons this review grated on me...thank you for highlighting that Reply litalopez says July 1 2014 at 453 pm Youre welcome Most ""critics"" are men and most reviews of this movie will likely say similar things. Also notice how often Variety and other entertainment news sources refer to McCarthy as an ""unlikely"" ""unexpected"" or ""surprising"" star. Like they just cant believe a funny female exists much less one who is not a typical stick figure with tits. No one ever questioned the veracity (SAT word for ya) of stardom from say the Belushi brothers John Candy Chris Farley Jonah Hill Kevin James or even Jim Carrey (who actually plays the most annoying roles ever imagined) or Will Ferrel. No. Men get to look and act any way they want and never face the kind of harsh critiques that routinely get dumped on McCarthy. Shes breaking the mold and instead of being embraced for it there are still far too many out there who want to hold her at arms length. Maybe they think if they ignore her shell go away. Surprise Shes staying and so are many more talented women following in her footsteps. nimportequoi says July 1 2014 at 1134 am Ditto I agree with you 100%...the men arent in the front row so this critic doesnt like the film - utterly biased Dorothy says July 1 2014 at 953 am Yikes. I havent even seen this movie but the review reads more like an attempt to use SAT words like ""titular"" and ""milieu"" in a context it doesnt really belong. You should probably consider matching the writing or at the very least the TONE of the review with the piece being reviewed; this review is so highfalutin ((one of my fave SAT words)) that it makes me disagree with it before even seeing it. The kind of people that would enjoy a Melissa McCarthy movie are not the kind of people who enjoy being spoken down to-although according to this writer were probably too ""idiotic"" to get it anyway. Reply ThomT says July 1 2014 at 854 am Didnt she make the same movie with Jason Bateman and call it ""Identity Thief"". McCarthy is multi-talented but is going to typecast herself if not careful. Reply Sandra says July 1 2014 at 830 am I cant wait to see it.....my daughter and I LOVE Melissa McCarthy shes so funny and seems so sweet my daughter said shed give anything if she could meet her one day Reply See All 18 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Jason Bourne Targets 60M+; Bad Moms Gets Sassy With 26.5M...

Susan Sarandon. Road trip melissa-mccarthy-tammy-bag.jpg Melissa McCarthy gets ready to rob a restaurant or maybe audition for Alvin and the Chipmunks in Tammy (WARNER BROS.) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 01 2014 at 1101 AM updated July 01 2014 at 157 PM comments For a while now Melissa McCarthy has been the best thing in the movies shes made. Admitted it hasnt always been hard. (Stealing pictures like ""Identity Thief"" and ""The Heat"" was petty theft.) But shining in an ensemble piece like ""This Is 40"" or especially ""Bridesmaids"" - that took talent. But when is she going to get a movie that shows off all of her skills? A good movie of her own? ""Tammy"" is definitely hers through and through. But in it she makes a mistake that the truly great comedians rarely do Instead of making us laugh she concentrates on making us like her. The story stars McCarthy as the title character a minimum-wage slave in an unfulfilling marriage. But wait it gets worse. Because then she loses the job and the marriage. Its time to get out of town but her cars broken down and she has all of 63. Well why not buddy up then with her alcoholic grandmother who has a Cadillac 6800 and a real hankering to see Niagara Falls? I can think of a lot of reasons but then we wouldnt have a movie -- albeit a pretty sloppy meandering one whose problems probably began with its casting. True the ages are never spelled out and some suspension of disbelief is allowed. But how exactly is Susan Sarandon (68) supposed to be the mother of Allison Janney (54) whos the mother of McCarthy (43)? (It doesnt help either that Sarandon still doesnt look more than 60 even under a curly grey wig.) Although the movie isnt quite as dumb as its trailers make it out to be -- it does have one or two good scenes which could have been great with some pushing -- it also has a lot of uninspired slapstick much of which involves McCarthys weight. Thatll probably bring out some online tut-tutting from the concern trolls. They should save it for someone whos listening. McCarthy produced and co-wrote this movie; her husband directed. You may not like what shes doing but shes doing what she wants. And its not that the jokes are self-loathing; actually theyre sneakily empowering. (The one constant in all of McCarthys heroines is that no matter how they look they never lose confidence in their own attractiveness -- and so theyre rarely alone for long.) Whats actually more demeaning is a scene towards the end when Kathy Bates playing a character Tammy hardly knows shows up chiefly to (unfairly) call her out for being a whiner a talking-to which McCarthy meekly accepts. Yes youre right. Yeah its my fault Im uneducated and alone and stuck behind a deep-fryer. Yup my grandmother just publicly humiliated me but shes old and a drunk so I just need to learn to take that and not answer her back. Really next to advice like that the fat jokes barely sting. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. But the real problem with the movie is simple -- its just not funny enough and too worried about making McCarthys usual hilarious supporting character into a woman sympathetic enough (that is bland enough) to be the heroine. Oh theres a nice scene when McCarthy robs a fast-food joint (and what should be a funnier scene when she trashes another). But neither taps into the sort of crass motor-mouthed aggressiveness thats always been the most outrageous thing about McCarthys comedy. Instead we get a very disjointed road-trip movie with too many guest stars given too little to do. And a script which makes McCarthy a sad victim or a silly fool but rarely the kind of highly verbal attack dog that she does so well. Of course its terrific -- even kind of amazing -- that McCarthy has even become a star. Its great that shes now getting control over her own films. But ""Tammy"" is trying so hard to get us to like her it forgets the most important thing of all We already did. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse drunken driving and sexual situations. Tammy (R) Warner Bros. (96 min.) Directed by Ben Falcone. With Melissa McCarthy Susan Sarandon.
