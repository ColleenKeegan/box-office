A textbook example of the charm-free ephemera dumped by studios during the waning days of summer this slapdash trifle about itinerant teen skateboarders may wring small change from would-be extreme-sporters. Two sure signs that mid-August has arrived Back-to-school sales in department stores movies like ""Grind"" in megaplexes. A textbook example of the charm-free ephemera dumped by studios during the waning days of summer this slapdash trifle about itinerant teen skateboarders may wring small change from would-be extreme-sporters. After opening weekend however Warners release doubtless will fast-forward to homevid playgrounds. Working from episodic script by Ralph Sall who doubles as pics executive music producer first-time helmer Casey La Scala focuses on cross-country high-jinks of four Chicago buddies who yearn to be ""discovered"" as professional skateboarders. Earnest high school grad Eric Rivers (Mike Vogel of Fox TVs ""Grounded for Life"") firmly believes hell be a cinch for superstardom if he can earn a place on the skate team of legendary pro Jimmy Wilson (Jason London). When he fails to talk to his way past Wilsons gatekeepers during the pros appearance in Chi-Town Eric switches to Plan B He decides to follow Jimmys tour bus along the skateboard tournament circuit -- not unlike a stalker Eric admits -- in the hope of catching his idols eye with his own smooth moves and gnarly stunts. Among the good friends and fellow skaters who accompany Eric on his quest are Dustin (Adam Brody) an uptight workaholic whos browbeaten into bankrolling the trip with his college fund; Matt (Vince Vieluf) a raucous slacker whose aggressive horseplay comes off as barely disguised hostility; and Sweet Lou (Joey Kern) a laid-back ladies man whose inexplicably effective come-on line (""Wanna make out?"") indicates the degree to which ""Grind"" is attuned to the daydreams of hormonally-inflamed male adolescents. Pic follows four leads from town to town at a leisurely pace allowing plenty of opportunities for cameo appearances by semi-celebrities (Bobcat Goldthwait Tom Green various members of the ""Jackass"" ensemble) who make semi-fools of themselves. Randy Quaid figures briefly but prominently in pics only clever subplot a genuinely funny twist that explains why Matt chronically describes his parents as ""clowns."" A few real-life skateboard champs also are dropped into the mix though no one is permitted to upstage the four leads. Or to be more precise their stunt doubles. (Lenser Richard Crudo carefully maneuvers shots so that faces are either deeply shadowed or out of the frame altogether.) Wispy plot also involves under-developed romance between Eric and femme skater played by Jennifer Morrison. Unfortunately theres zilch chemistry between pair. La Scala tries to bring zing to their interplay with nervous camera movement during a key conversation scene but desperation tactic is too obvious by half. Worse a few mismatched shots look like jump cuts. Skating scenes are unremarkable and repetitious but bring welcome relief from interminable padding of scenes in which theleads crack wise swap insults and sing along with the radio in their van. (Latter action is curtailed mercifully when van is stolen by one of Sweet Lous one-nights stands.) The volume of gags involving flatulence projectile vomiting and malodorous bowel movements would seem to push ""Grind to the limits of PG-13 acceptability. Vogel and Brody do little to invigorate their stock characters. Vielufs full-tilt obnoxiousness suggests the wretched excess of someone who meticulously studied the performances of John Belushi and Jack Black but learned all the wrong lessons. Kern is the only lead who evidences any talent for underplaying even as he channels the cocky spirit of Matthew McConaugheys insolent Dave Wooderson from ""Dazed and Confused."" ""Grind"" often plays like a raunchier reprise of ""Extreme Days"" (2001) a fresher and funnier road-trip adventure that also pivoted on the unconventional athletic abilities of four venturesome young males. The big difference is PG-rated ""Extreme"" was aimed primarily (though not exclusively) at devotees of uplifting Christian-oriented pics. Also it managed to squeak by with only one flatulence joke.

Comments Grind Suitable entertainment for boys too young to shave this giddy skateboard picaresque follows a quartet of recent high school grads as they drive cross-country trailing the national tour of a pro skater and staging impromptu exhibitions along the way in hopes of getting discovered. Screenwriter Ralph Sall and director Casey La Scala both tyros chart some relatively fresh territory with their portrayal of pro skaters as pop stars riding around in tour buses and sampling the groupies but the heroes misadventures are numbingly familiar fraught with pimply sex humor and transparent teen fantasy (the love interest is a skater too and just as rad as the guys).

Nevius Peter Hartlaub Published 400 am Friday August 15 2003 Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 - - FILM CLIPS / Also opening this week 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE CUCKOO Fable. Directed and written by Alexander Rogozhkin . (Rated PG-13. 100 minutes. In Russian Finnish and Sami with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza Shattuck in Berkeley Rafael in San Rafael Aquarius in Palo Alto and Towne 3 in San Jose.) Gorgeous and optimistic ""The Cuckoo"" is a simple allegory about three people none of whom speak the same language who walk a road from distrust and devastation to friendship and rebirth. Its 1944 the waning days of World War II and Veiko (Ville Haapasalo) a Finnish soldier has been chained to a boulder and left to die -- his punishment for reluctance in battle. Ivan (Viktor Bychkov) a disgraced Soviet captain escapes a bomb attack and both men end up on an isolated reindeer farm run by Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso) a Lapp widow whose husband went to war and never came back. Russian filmmaker Alexander Rogozhkin opens his tale with a long nearly wordless first act Veikos efforts to free himself from the boulder then Annis discovery of the presumed-dead Ivan. Brought together at Annis lakeside compound the threesome struggle through language barriers partisan hostilities and the competition of the two men for for love-starved Anni. ""Cuckoo"" is what Ivan calls Veiko whom he mistakes for a Nazi officer because of the uniform he was forced to wear. Veiko in turn tries to convince the uncomprehending Ivan that hes in fact a pacifist that his true allegiance is to art and literature. ""I hope people look back in horror at what they did in the war"" Veiko tells Ivan quoting one of his literary gods Dostoyevsky. Theres a bit of Samuel Beckett austerity some Ingmar Bergman mysticism plus the war-as-ultimate-farce theme of ""No Mans Land."" But Rogozhkin also brings a sweetness and humanity and gives his tale a rarefied shimmer by setting it among the clear waters and vivid skies of Lapland. Shot by Andrei Zhegalov the landscape is transformed into a place of pristine enchantment a separate world where grown-up fairy tales such as this might spin out. Beautifully acted a pleasure to watch ""The Cuckoo"" is a rare gem that ought not to be neglected in the summer movie shuffle. -- This film contains partial nudity mild sexual references and violence. -- Edward Guthmann PASSIONADA Romantic drama. Starring Jason Isaacs and Sofia Milos. Directed by Dan Ireland. (Rated PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Passionada"" is a romantic drama a rare kind of film these days even though romantic dramas were once a dominant genre in America. Its the love story of two adults around 40 who each enter a relationship with some baggage. Location and culture add color -- the movie takes place in New Bedford Mass. within that towns Portuguese American fishing community. Sofia Milos plays Celia a widow and mother whose husband died in a fishing accident. British actor Jason Isaacs usually a dastardly villain (""The Patriot"") plays Charles a down-on-his-luck gambler who sees Celia singing in a club one night and finds a door to his soul opening up. He pursues her; she resists. He mounts a charm offensive that includes alas lying. He says that hes rich and most important that he loves seafood. It happens so often in movies and so rarely in life a relationship starts on the basis of a big lie. Perhaps its just useful in terms of plotting. A lie in the first act makes for a good third-act crisis. In any case director Dan Ireland enables ""Passionada"" to transcend formula by keeping the emotions strong and grounding them in a bright specific world. There are town festivals the sea and the sky and seafood everywhere -- and to jazz things up now and again theres the world of the blackjack table and the casino. Sofia Milos conveys Celias pride her loss her reluctance and her blossoming passion. In one scene we see her memories of herself as a young woman frolicking with her husband and then fade into the present day as she looks at photos and remembers. Just by moving in a certain way she is able to suggest in the memory sequence a woman some 10 or 15 years younger. That Isaacs is usually a heavy should not come as a surprise to anyone seeing him here. He may smile a lot in ""Passionada"" but theres yet something untrustworthy in his look. Still that works for Charles who has been a shifty fellow most of his life and spends most of this movie lying through his teeth. -- This film contains sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle STEP INTO LIQUID Surf documentary. Starring Ken (Skindog) Collins Laird Hamilton Rochelle Ballard and Gerry Lopez. Written and directed by Dana Brown. (Not rated. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A bubble wash for the senses an adrenaline rush for the mind ""Step Into Liquid"" will have even the most landlocked goofy-footers wondering why they never learned to surf. It certainly looks appealing here. Big curling waves jolly attractive folks and if things get too scary you just kick it down into slow motion. Men women and kids do it and all over the world too from Ireland to Vietnam. This is a valentine to surfing from Dana Brown son of the cupid of the sport Bruce Brown whose ""Endless Summer"" and ""Endless Summer II"" were the gold standard for surf flicks. What can Brown the Younger add? For starters surf-ology has changed. ""Tow- in"" surfing means that riders (and cameramen) can get out to the monster waves way off shore by hitching a ride on a Jet Ski. It isnt just bigger waves it is better footage of bigger waves and sound that will rattle your esophagus. Also it is the 21st century. Women are no longer sitting on the beach checking their tan lines. Even in the 1994 ""Endless Summer II"" the female surfers were conspicuously missing. Brown makes an effort to find a group of top female surfers and takes to Tahitis famous (in surf circles anyhow) Teahupoo Beach. These are no kiddy waves. As one surf veteran says in the movie in so many words after watching the women if they want to surf that good luck you aint getting me out there. Brown digs a little deeper into social issues than the ""Endless"" clips too. He follows the Malloy brothers to Ireland of all places where the three brothers Chris Keith and Dan not only introduce some of the local kids to surfing but also invite Protestant boys and girls to join Catholic kids for the lessons. It is a good thought. Frankly it is doubtful that an afternoon in the water changed the worldview of anyone but at least hes not pretending it is all fun in the sun. If there is any knock on the production that is it. To watch these gorgeous people skim across those magnificent waves youd think that surfing was a kind of cheerful watery commune where everyone loves the ocean and gets along. As we know well here ""wave rage"" is actually a serious and persistent problem. Having said that anyone who goes to ""Liquid"" for social commentary is in the wrong movie. This is not only escapist fare it is also heart-pounding stunning stuff. There is simply no sport that is anything like surfing. As Randy Rarrick director of Hawaiis famous Pipeline Masters surf showdown says onscreen ""How many people do you know who go out and gaze at a tennis court?"" -- C.W. Nevius GRIND Extreme sports film. Starring Mike Vogel Adam Brody and Jason London. Directed by Casey La Scala. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A grind is an impressive skateboarding maneuver that involves keeping balanced while running your axles against a ridged surface. Its also something your teeth will be doing during the majority of this movie which attempts to combine the extreme sports visuals of a good Warren Miller ski film with the plot of a bad Tom Green picture and doesnt come close to landing on four wheels. ""Grind"" is a series of punishments and rewards -- for every 15 minutes of recycled gross-out slapstick theres five minutes of skating to enjoy. Like every other film starring young people since ""Stand By Me"" the movie follows four old friends on a road trip of self-discovery. Except instead of running across interesting people and places they encounter as much excrement and vomit as is allowed in a PG-13 movie (its more than you think). Main skater Eric Rivers (Mike Vogel) and his responsible friend Dustin (Adam Brody) are benign in their roles as recent high school graduates who use Dustins college fund to follow a cross-country skating tour in hopes of getting discovered. Along they way they encounter a series of D-list actors whose cameos seem lifted directly from their previous movies. Bobcat Goldthwait Randy Quaid and the guy who played Ogre in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" dont have a funny line among them. The most humorous actor in the film Joey Kern as Sweet Lou the cradle-robbing ladies man gets laughs only because hes performing a note-for-note rip-off of the Matthew McConaughey character in ""Dazed and Confused."" The worst lines are saved for main comic relief Matt (Vince Vieluf) who is so incredibly grating youll keep hoping someone behind the camera will jump into the scene and give the character the beating he deserves. The payoff for all of the above is watching stunt skater Brian Patch who is carefully cropped throughout the film so you only see him from the neck down. Patch takes over skateboarding duties for Vogel in the movies excellent handful of skating scenes including the best sequence -- where our flatulent heroes turn their old beater van into a mobile skate park. And the tricked-out skateboarding finale does deliver even if the rest of the film doesnt. -- This film contains sexual situations crude language and violence. -- Peter Hartlaub Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 4 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 5 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 6 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 10 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

Avoid Uptown Girls an embarrassingly silly exercise that mostly serves as a platform for Brittany Murphy to model a fab wardrobe and glam hairstyles. Brittany Murphy stars in the lackluster Uptown Girls. By K.C. Bailey MGM Murphy stars as Molly Gunn the daughter of a rock n roll icon who died when his daughter was 8. This poor little rich girl has grown insecure and needy which coincides with her 22nd birthday as she spots the early signs of a dreaded forehead wrinkle. The club-hopping jet-setting Molly falls for sensitive singer-songwriter Neal (Jesse Spencer) seducing him in a scene were supposed to find adorable. As he bares his soul she bares her teeth cloyingly demanding he feed her Pez candies. There is absolutely no chemistry between Murphy and Spencer. In many scenes he seems to recoil from her. Though Molly complains about Neal hanging around her house when he leaves -- just to go to his apartment -- she whines that she has never felt more empty. And in a couple of days her bank account is empty too. Mollys duplicitous business manager absconded with all her money . Now the pampered Molly has to find a job. She eventually becomes a nanny to a preternaturally adult 8-year-old named Ray (Dakota Fanning) who has a sharper tongue and more smarts than Molly. Fanning who made her debut in I Am Sam is talented but her choice of movies has not been good. Still she is far more appealing than her older simpering co-star. Uptown Girls resembles a female version of the Adam Sandler hit Big Daddy. But unlike that inoffensive bore Girls sends troubling messages to children about male/female relations. (Molly sleeps with a series of men. Rays daddy lies in a coma while her mom fools around with young Neal Mollys guy.) Dont be fooled by the innocent-looking ad campaign featuring Murphy Fanning and a Babe-style piglet. This is not only unsuitable for children its a colossal waste of time at any age. (PG-13 for sexual content and language) Grind 1/2 Sitting through the teen skateboard comedy Grind is well a grind. Laughs are virtually nil despite a plethora of crude attempts at humor jokes about vomiting defecating flatulence bosomy babes. Grind has it all. Except actual humor. (Video See a trailer for the movie.) Granted adults are not the target audience. But even at a screening filled with teens laughter was a scarce commodity. Even the extreme skateboard rides are shot from dull angles. Skateboarding cutie Eric (Mike Vogel) is the most likable of a group of friends who have graduated high school and take a road trip hoping to get noticed by a touring pro skateboarder. Dustin (The O.C.s Adam Brody) the responsible one is railroaded into blowing 700 of his college fund on the odyssey. Along for the ride is the boorish Matt (Vince Vieluf) the most inane character in any summer movie including Gigli. The trio are joined by an older pal Sweet Lou (Joey Kern) a loser a few years out of high school who does nothing but hang around the local park and inspire parents to lock up their daughters. But he has the wheels so hes in the group. Eric meets a cute blonde skater Jamie (Jennifer Morrison). They fall for each other but their sweet romance is lost amid the leering and lousiness of the story. The boys are repeatedly told that if theyre good theyll get noticed. The same could be said for a movie. And this one is likely to pass by with little fanfare.

Posted August 13 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT In the braying teen sports fantasy Grind a high school jock a doofus a stud and a dork so uptight he thinks that getting into college actually matters learn life lessons through skateboarding. ""Were not losers anymore - were a team"" one mangy pal exults as the quartet chases after diploma-proof sponsorship deals. Eric (""Grounded for Life""s Mike Vogel) wants someone big-time to notice his talent for grinding as fancy axle work is known. Matt (""Rat Race""s Vince Vieluf best taken in small doses) wants to touch a girls boobs - any girl any boobs. Sweet Lou (Joey Kern) who has already touched many boobs wants to escape the wrath of some comely boob-owners father. Dustin (""The O.C.""s Adam Brody) worries about holding on to his crummy minimum-wage job to save money for his continuing education but one of his hilarious buddies gets him to lighten up by tossing the nerds college guidebook out a car window. Its a virtually adult-free universe these dudes inhabit and any parents who wander in are ridiculed either as literal clowns (Randy Quaid in circus makeup) or figurative ones (Christopher McDonald in a playboy bathrobe). Not exactly adult but long out of school Tom Green makes a guest appearance as a trippy skate-shop owner; other passing brand-name X-treme comics include Bobcat Goldthwait and various ""Jackass""-ers. Hustling for a piece of the cult interest in ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" Stacy Peraltas cool 2001 documentary about the 1970s SoCal origins of the showy sport ""Grind"" supplies stretches of actual skating footage by pros doubling for the stars. Its in these moments freed from the earthbound pull of its market-tested components that the movie briefly relaxes into the sheer thrilling audacity of flying into the air propelled by a board on wheels.
