Starring Bruce Willis Spencer Breslin Emily Mortimer Lily Tomlin Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They could have used a lot more Lily Tomlin in ""Disneys The Kid"" starring Bruce Willis as a stressed-out image consultant to celebrities and Tomlin as his obedient but amusingly caustic assistant. ""Disneys The Kid"" includes ""Disney"" in the title to differentiate it from ""The Kid"" a 1921 Charlie Chaplin silent film that lifted Jackie Coogan into stardom. If you have a choice . . . The PG-rated but essentially G film opens today at Bay Area theaters. Willis plays Russ Duritz a slick workaholic self-made guy who seemingly has it all with a career thats a nonstop L.A. schmooze with celebs many from the sports world. He wears a pleasant grin throughout and helps his high-priced clients tweak their images to keep themselves fresh and appealing to the public and media. Tomlin is a kick even in her all- too-minor role as Russ administrative assistant. She gets not much more than five minutes of screen time but her character has more comic flash than anybody elses in the production. The film is nearly all Willis -- not necessarily a bad thing -- and a chubby boy (Spencer Breslin) who plays Russ Duritz as an 8-year-old. Enough is enough with the kid who is never quite cute and keeps stuffing burgers fries and milk shakes into his face to support the scripts fat-person jokes explicit and implied. (The screenplay was written by former Bay Area radio personality Audrey Wells who also wrote ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs."") This slight predictable comedy has appealing moments as Russ blunders to romance with his pretty image-consulting sidekick Amy (Emily Mortimer of ""Scream 3"") and refuses to make amends with his stern father Sam (Daniel Von Bargen). The older Russ wont come to terms with his miserable childhood as an overweight dweeb always picked on by other boys. Thats why the 8-year-old version of himself appears suddenly -- but dont dwell on how. Nothing is very believable in the film. At first Russ thinks hes hallucinating when he sees himself as an 8-year-old. But apparently the kid is real. They compare scars and personal tics and gradually they become pals. A red biplane frequently flies overhead a symbol of Russ childhood dream of becoming an aviator. The problem is that Russ doesnt seem all that screwed up. He hasnt done badly for himself. He lives in a swanky barn of a house full of art and fine furniture wears 2000 suits drives a new Porsche hangs with celebs and is generally what he terms ""a chick magnet."" Sure hes high-powered a bit brash and full of himself. So what if he doesnt return the adoring gazes of Amy (who has an Audrey Hepburn neck and an Oxford accent) or take in a golden retriever puppy that would shed fur on his zillion-dollar living room furniture? Little Russ a tad whiny and pouty plays a guilt game -- big Russ should have a ""lady"" in his house and a dog. Then Amy guilt-trips Russ about being slightly unscrupulous in business. Theres a point at which the viewer almost wants Russ to tell them to take flying leaps. Among major lapses in plausibility is the training of little Russ by one of big Russ clients a boxer (Chi McBride) to turn the tide against schoolyard bullies who appear in what seems to be a flashback -- except that present-day Russ is there watching like a coach. Leaps in time go every which way. Viewers may struggle to understand how Amy can feel an instant affection toward the child Russ whom she says is adorable. The kid is so far from adorable that many viewers may contemplate making a beeline for the exit. In another era folks would have described this kind of movie as summer pap -- soft food with no taste but not unpalatable. We can only hope that other movie studios dont start putting their names in titles. We dont want to have to differentiate between ""Disneys The Kid"" and ""Warner Bros. The Kid"" or ""Columbia TriStars The Kid With Paramount as Co-Producer Distributed by Universal in 20th Century Fox Delivery Vans."" ..

Audrey Wells original script pirouettes on a reasonably intriguing fantasy premise -- that a child and adult version of the same person could meet and not like each other. But director Jon Turteltaubs insistence upon hammering every point home with giant closeups and relentless musical underlining makes this insufferably cloying and sickly sweet for anyone with the least intolerance to ""find the inner child"" saccharinity. But given the combo of Willis a good-natured pudgy kid dogs heavily manufactured feel-good moments and Disney actually putting its corporate name in the title its hard to wager that this wont be one of those awful movies that a hefty portion of the public embraces. Shifting gears yet again in his ever-eclectic career Bruce Willis lands in family-film slop in ""Disneys The Kid."" Audrey Wells original script pirouettes on a reasonably intriguing fantasy premise -- that a child and adult version of the same person could meet and not like each other. But director Jon Turteltaubs insistence upon hammering every point home with giant closeups and relentless musical underlining makes this insufferably cloying and sickly sweet for anyone with the least intolerance to ""find the inner child"" saccharinity. But given the combo of Willis a good-natured pudgy kid dogs heavily manufactured feel-good moments and Disney actually putting its corporate name in the title its hard to wager that this wont be one of those awful movies that a hefty portion of the public embraces because its designed to expose the vulnerability of even the hardest of men. Wells who first attracted attention with her scripts for ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" and ""George of the Jungle"" and made an excellent writing-directing debut last year with ""Guinevere"" came up with the clever idea for the present picture a decade ago. The central notion certainly provides something to work with Through a magical confluence successful arrogant 40-year-old workaholic ""image consultant"" Russ Duritz (Willis) is annoyingly confronted by his 8-year-old self Rusty (Spencer Breslin) who over the long run makes Russ realize how far astray hes gone from what he admired and aspired to as a boy. In other words hes become a mean insensitive materialistic bachelor rather than a people-and-animal-loving aviator and dad and it takes some quality time with the fun-loving Rusty for the man to realize the error of his ways. This is a theme that could support any number of approaches nuances and ironies but as the title proudly announces this is the Disney version -- in the most egregious possible sense. Everything is obvious when it could be subtle loud when it could be modulated ""cute"" when it could be appealing pat when it could be insightful contrived when it could be graceful. By so far does the film fall short of any meaningful objective that one might be excused from thinking that theres actually no reason for an 8-year-old to like or understand what he might become three decades hence. Opening reels have no trouble establishing Russ as the antithesis of Mr. Nice Guy. A no-nonsense type whose direct waste-no-words approach comes off as bluntly rude the nattily dressed Russ is in the business of telling the high and mighty (elected officials corporate bigwigs) how to sell the right image and wiggle out of bad PR situations. Approached on a plane for friendly conversation by a comely Southern lady (Jean Sharp) whos moving to L.A. for a TV anchor job he abruptly tells her everything thats wrong with her looks as well as one key personality trait thats very right. Russ is peculiarly abrasive to his admiring co-worker Amy (Emily Mortimer) and runs his assistant (an imaginatively cast Lily Tomlin) ragged even dragooning her into helping him get rid of his aging father (Daniel von Bargen) who simply wants his son to come over for a long-overdue family dinner. But the one thing he cant deal with is a chubby kid who suddenly materializes in his crisply architectural home and they both shortly realize is Russ younger self. An impish cherub with very normal boy interests (particularly planes) Rusty doesnt look anything like what youd imagine the child version of the very fit Russ to be but then Russ fastidiousness in diet might plausibly be a reaction to Rustys weakness for fatty foods. Like Dorothy Rusty would just like to go home particularly because Russ obnoxiously berates him for the longest time for interfering with his life. So disappointed is Rusty that he sadly concludes ""I grew up to be a loser"" because Russ so outwardly successful by adult standards doesnt have a dog a family and an airplane. Eventually of course the big man begins to thaw out due to the warmth of the little man to the point where he feels driven to look up his old plane seat mate who took Russ advice and has now caught on as a local TV personality and ask the obvious question ""You think hes here to straighten me out?"" Duh. But one good turn deserves another so Russ is able to drag Rusty back in time to 1968 when the crucial events that ""turned"" the boys personality took place and Russ stands by to guide his former self through them. Incidents go a long way toward explaining Russ problems with his father and avoidance of emotion but a subsequent apparition of Rustys idealized version of himself as a grown-up is over-the-top funny just as Russ seems to choose the wrong woman at the end when he finally decides hes ready for a step toward commitment. Willis goes with the flow of Turteltaubs strenuous simplistic approach broadly laying on Russ callousness and irritability before turning the key to unlock his softer side. His star power remains effective however and he plays effortlessly with young Breslin who one might safely say wont grow up to look like Willis but will charm many with his bright assertiveness and staying power opposite the forces of hardened adulthood. British thesp Mortimer (""Notting Hill"") comes off blandly in this context while Smart delivers the stand-out supporting turn here just as she did in Wells ""Guinevere."" Tech contributions are OK except for Marc Shaimans exceptionally intrusive score which never misses a chance to indicate to the audience exactly what it is supposed to be feeling.

But thats another movie. In the klutzily titled secretly intelligent Disneys The Kid chubby dorky vulnerable 8-year-old Rusty Duritz (Spencer Breslin) survives various traumas of comfortable American suburban childhood to mature into trim driven impermeable 40-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis). Russ is a man so armored in his lucrative career as an image consultant that he has no room for other living things in his big sterile mansion -- not a wife not a dog not even his own aging father. He refuses to get serious about a charming colleague Amy (Emily Mortimer) when the perfect lady offers all the dewy practicality of Donna Reed and Brit sparkle of Liz Hurley combined. (Poor Mortimer was previously rejected by Hugh Grant in Notting Hill.) His only meaningful human contact is with his forbearing executive assistant Janet (who as played with a cleansing spritz of lemon by the divine Lily Tomlin deserves a movie or TV series of her own). And for a while only the recurring twitch in Russ left eye suggests the stress of lovelessness. But soon enough this middle-aged workaholic is visited by a much less dismissable messenger of breakdown Rusty his childhood self still a gawky easily bullied fat kid dreaming of piloting a plane when he grows up. For Russ the fully manifest Rusty is a living nightmare a reminder of the pathetic little loser he thought he had out-jogged and a new twist on a Dickens classic in which the Ghost of Christmas Past is the worst apparition of all. To the boy meanwhile loserdom will be his Christmas Future if hes really going to turn into such a stuffy disappointment. Together in a newsworthy advance on psychoanalysis Rusty/Russ break old patterns and fly free as boy and man. The possessive Disneys has been appended to The Kid one assumes to advertise that children too will have fun at this optimistic fable. And by all means they will especially because young Breslin making his feature debut is such a natural funny unmannered boy. (He may grow up to be that bedeviled ham Mason Reese but for now hes got the exasperated dignity -- and squooshed rosebud features -- of Joan Cusack.) Yet The Kid is foremost a parable for adults -- particularly men particularly men who keep Slinkys and Koosh balls on their office desks and wear their baseball caps backward. (Oh wait those are Disney executives.) For every moment of telegraphed unsubtlety directed by Jon Turteltaub (Phenomenon) with his usual crayon box of primary colors bits of irrepressibly sophisticated honest dialogue by screenwriter Audrey Wells (The Truth About Cats amp; Dogs) break through. (Many of the best lines are uttered by Tomlin. ""Take your phone off -- youre with a human now"" she instructs Russ who is hooked up to a hands-free headset; ""Ill get the power taken out in Atlanta"" she archly promises her boss whos upset at the performance of a client appearing live on CNN.) For a Disney-brand feel-good movie about the importance of being true to oneself and yada yada yada and for a post-Peter Pan story following in the retro grooves of Big Mumford Pleasantville and Frequency The Kid is much more agreeably interestingly irritable and disconsolate than Turteltaub can handle. Hurrah for the guys emotional breakthrough the movie implies -- but what a jerk. And through it all Bruce Willis deserves full props. I can think of few huge Hollywood stars so carefree and unself-conscious about trying different genres win or lose. As it turns out this father of three has a valuable talent for uncloying interaction with child costars. The same unpatronizing respect he showed in The Sixth Sense -- gallantly ceding the spotlight to Haley Joel Osment -- is likewise palpable in his relaxed work with Breslin. Willis makes Russ a believable schmuck (smirk smirk) whos rotten to Rusty but never at Breslins expense. For that matter Willis is also in synch with Tomlin as well as with Jean Smart in yet another tasty small role as a Southern newscaster who receives blunt image advice from her airplane seatmate. That Willis has no chemistry with Mortimer is a problem. But then her character is more a symbol of nurturing lover/mother than an actual woman. ""You could have been a great man"" Amy tells Russ in one of the saddest sentences an adult woman could ever say to any adult whos not a politician. If The Kid convinces any 40-year-olds to rethink their walking-and-talking use of hands-free telephones thatll be greatness enough.
