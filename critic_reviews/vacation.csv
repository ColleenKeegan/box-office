"Holidays From Hell The Vacation Movies Now and Then << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Holidays From Hell The Vacation Movies Now and Then Warner Bros. Movies August 5 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print You cant do much worse at the movies than Vacation. Thats not only because one of the most soulful movies about writers (The End of the Tour with Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg) opened last week or because one of the years best documentaries (Joshua Oppenheimers The Look of Silence) might be playing somewhere near you. Ive written about both and my enthusiasm hasnt changed. Even Ant-Man and the new Mission Impossible are fun. Vacations not. Its a rebooting of the National Lampoon series that started in 1983 in which Chevy Chases Clark Griswold tied his Aunt Ednas dog to the rear of his station wagon and absentmindedly drove off. Thats this new Vacation empty leash tortured dog. This is one of those comedies that thinks gross is funny because its gross. It copies the originals postcard format for the opening titles except here the framing around the idyllic photos is pulled back to reveal boogers a fishhook in someones hair projectile vomit and a bath in raw sewage. An ATV obliterates a cow covering someone in viscera which a different cow is all too happy to lap up. Thats the level the movie is working on. Ed Helms is in Chases hapless-dad part playing Rusty Griswold Clarks son who in the original was played by Anthony Michael Hall bolting out of the holding pen of pubescence. This Rusty works as a pilot for a cheapo carrier. Hes got a dry dweeby personality that this movie holds up as an attraction. (How Hall turns into Helms is a social and genetic mystery. Even Jason Lively who played Rusty in the 1985 sequel was a stretch.) Rustys wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) longs to go to Paris like their perfect pals the Petersons (Keegan-Michael Key and Regina Hall). But Rustys limp imagination can only conjure an alternative trip to Walley World the destination of the cursed journey in the first movie. Debbies like ""Whatever."" (So is Applegate whose unbridled exasperation feels sadly like some of the easiest comedy shes done. Helms has his virtues. Keeping up with her isnt one of them.) But Debbie and their two sons (Skyler Gisondo Steele Stebbins) pile into their incompetently built Albanian hybrid rental. There are two gas tanks the charging plug wont retract and perks normally on the interior are on the outside. Its a dumbcar. The glove compartment bears a CB radio which the younger vulgar son uses to ask whether all truckers are rapists a non-joke that justifies the motif of a tractor trailer remaining on their tail for most of the trip. The drive leads to places like Debbies alma mater in Memphis where she drunkenly tries to reclaim her crown as a slutty party girl and to the Plano Texas estate of Rustys sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her lusty conservative husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth). The movie has one good casting idea and Hemsworth is it. He straps on some kind of Southern accent wears Farrah Fawcett-adjacent hair and appears to be enjoying all the zero-gravity comedy. But once he parades before Rusty and Debbie in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs that barely hides a serpent of a penis its obvious the movie reached its limit on gags for him. That scene is as bad as any that involved Christie Brinkley coming on to Chase in the original except that back then Brinkley was one of the biggest models in the world and she was in on the joke about the fantasy she represented. Who knows what joke Hemsworth is supposed to be telling. Vacation 2015 was written and directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein who also typed up the first Horrible Bosses together and are working on the next Spider-Man. This current movie has no excuse for itself. Theres nothing guiding it. The few good ideas have nothing to do with the adventure at hand like when Clark and Debbie sneak off for sex at the Four Corners and find scores of couples scattering when the authorities arrive. That bit turns into a pretty funny fight among the cops for jurisdiction but Helms and Applegate have long exited the scene by the time the joke climaxes. The original and its 1985 sequel arent masterpieces but theyve got a coherent badness especially the first which Harold Ramis directed John Hughes wrote and for which Lindsey Buckingham supplied ""Holiday Road"" a perversely catchy suitably off-kilter theme song. It was trying to be a farce of white middle-class family values. And it doesnt always know where the jokes are but sometimes its got them and theyre better than anything Daley and Goldstein have come up with. When Ellens batty Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) croaks Ellen (Beverly DAngelo) ends her eulogy saying ""I hope at least you kids have learned something about life and death."" ""Yeah"" says Audrey (Dana Barron) ""dont die unless somebodys home."" Thats the sort of superb average-kid line you got in the late 1970s and early 1980s when child actors werent precious per se -- they were simply natural and fully formed personalities. In the 2015 version when Stebbins doesnt have a vulgar line to detonate he looks mildly shocked like he cant believe hes being paid to say this stuff. In the original -- 80 minutes in with less than 20 left -- the Griswolds finally get to Walley World and the movie comes to new crazy life. The parks closed so Clark gets a very convincing pistol (a BB gun) and makes the owners security team (represented by John Candy) open the place up for his family. The montage of the cast on the rides looking both nauseated and over the moon with Chase mugging while holding his gun on Candy gets at a classically stupid Marx Brothers desperation. Fun is a right that turns into a blissful crime. This is where a strain of American comedy was in the early and mid-1980s wondering about the limits and privileges of liberal white and middle-class life. Albert Brooks was there and Martin Scorsese twice tapped into something like it with The King of Comedy and After Hours. Vacation was too sloppy to constitute an official exploration. It was a lark that happened to land in an interesting cultural spot. This new whatever-it-is doesnt care whether Walley World is special to Rusty. Nothing matters to it.

Calum Marsh Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 29 2015 831AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 31 2015 735AM EDT Comments AA Directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein Written by John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein Starring Ed Helms Christina Applegate and Chris Hemsworth Classification R Year 2015 Country USA Language English At a restaurant last weekend I happened to remark to a waiter that the piped music seemed heavy on nineties Number Ones. ""It gets the room excited"" he explained. ""Twenty years later people are happy to hear even songs they never used to like."" Theres wisdom in that. Nostalgia is aroused by recognition not affection and recognition is nonqualitative - past a certain age any old thing sufficiently remembered will do. National Lampoons Vacation has been a fixture of many childhood memory banks for three decades but there are several compelling reasons to doubt the films repute. First theres a conservatism that rankles all the more from a 30-year remove. Then theres a cruel streak that borders on misanthropy who wants to have a laugh about a dog being dragged to death at 60 miles an hour? But time has a way of smoothing over the excrescences. Even the bad is remembered dimly as good.Now we have a new Vacation a hybrid sequel-reboot in the fashion of the season designed with four-quadrant savvy to be enjoyed by millennials in reminiscence and by a younger crowd anew. John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein the writer-director team seem wary of nostalgia. Indeed they address the subject in an early scene the original films young Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) now married and a father of two proposes to his family that they embark upon a cross-country drive from Chicago to Californias Walley World for Memorial Day Weekend as he did as a child 32 years before. The clan is unmoved. ""You want to redo your vacation?"" asks wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) surrogate for a skeptical audience. ""My vacation had a boy and a girl"" Rusty retorts. ""This one has two boys. And Im sure there will be plenty of other differences.""The differences prove slight. I suppose we have Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to thank for this attitude of winking self-referential (and self-deprecating) cynicism their take on 21 Jump Street made it possible for the hip to reframe unoriginality as an ironic pose. So instead of working to persuade us of the need for a remake of a well-liked film Daley and Goldstein simply concede straight away that they cant. ""Ive never heard of the original vacation"" says Rustys son James (Skyler Gisondo) like a junior executive at a pitch meeting. ""It doesnt matter"" insists Dad. ""The new vacation will stand on its own."" At which point were assured that Daley and Goldstein dont believe it can.On the road nevertheless the Griswolds go whereupon calamity swiftly befalls them. Like Griswold vacations past the disasters zip past ludicrous toward the inanity of a Saturday morning cartoon; unlike Griswold vacations past the peril in which the family finds itself isnt leavened by anything funny - unless fist fights and curse words are your idea of a laugh riot. (Theres so much dead air in the film that I wondered whether punchlines had been cleaved out to secure a PG-13 rating but no its a hard inexplicable R.)Rusty Griswold never had a good vacation his childhood adventure to Walley World was ruinous but hes been deceived into thinking otherwise by time. Smarter filmmakers would have seized upon this point as a presiding theme. Daley and Goldstein can hardly be bothered. Their skepticism toward nostalgia goes only as far as it allows them to excuse their inadequacies - the deeper meaning eludes them. Meanwhile those inclined to look back fondly on the old Vacation may be pleased to enjoy the reminder. That it isnt any good doesnt matter. For that job any new Vacation will do.

Hopper Stone/Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Hopper Stone/Warner Brothers Pictures Skyler Gisondo (from left) Steele Stebbins Christina Applegate and Ed Helms star as the next generation of Griswolds in Vacation. Hopper Stone/Warner Brothers Pictures Those keeping up with the National Cinematic Lampooniverse (NCL) will be interested to know that Vacation isnt a remake of the three-plus-decade-old Chevy Chase comedy but a continuation of the series. It takes place in a world where the events of Vacation European Vacation and Christmas Vacation have happened and everyone has gotten older if not wiser. Now Rusty Griswold the grown son of Chases Clark Griswold wants to follow in his fathers footsteps and drag his own family on a cross-country misadventure. Such is the power of nostalgia Just as the 1983 Vacation is a bad movie thats remembered fondly Rusty longs to recreate an experience that he forgets was a complete disaster. (NCL sticklers will notice that Vegas Vacation and Christmas Vacation 2 Cousin Eddies Island Adventure go unmentioned. Alas history is written by the winners.) Written and directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein the writing partners responsible for Horrible Bosses and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone the new Vacation reasserts the hard-R raunch of the National Lampoon brand after the sequels drifted into more family-friendly fare. But while it roughly follows the Family Trucksters tire tracks to Walley World the film feels more like one of the icky spectacles that followed Theres Something About Mary when gross-out comedies were in a race to the bottom. Its as if Daley and Goldstein started with a list of disgusting topics -- outre sex acts human waste pubic hair projectile vomiting cow cannibalism et al. -- and constructed a narrative around them. Since Vacation is a road movie there are plenty of detours like a side trip to a secluded ""hot spring"" where the Griswolds immerse themselves in the sulfuric mist of raw sewage. As with his father however Rusty (Ed Helms) will let nothing deflate his relentless good cheer even as his optimism becomes indistinguishable from madness. Though his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) would prefer a romantic trip for two to Paris Rusty sees the trip as a chance to make up for his shortcomings as a husband and father yet turns a deaf ear to their griping. From the moment they leave the driveway in suburban Chicago everything goes wrong for Rusty who fails to recharge his love life and cant keep his foul-mouthed youngest son (Steele Stebbins) from bullying his guitar-plucking older brother (Skyler Gisondo). For all the films strained stabs at outrageousness its the Griswolds car that earns most of the laughs. The latest in Albanian technology the 2015 Tartan Prancer is like a contraption out of a Jacques Tati movie with two gas tanks a bewildering European hybrid plug and two sets of side mirrors facing each other. Daley and Goldstein have endless fun with the Griswolds mashing a series of mysterious buttons and key fob symbols and immediately regretting it. One causes the rear bumper to pop off another slowly rotates the drivers seat 360-degrees and a third is too ominous to press. The car brings a welcome note of whimsy and lightness in a film thats overeager to provoke and offend. The scenes of coitus interruptus between Rusty and Debbie echo the false starts of Clark and Ellen (Beverly DAngelo) in the original Vacation but theres a true ugliness to Rustys passive-aggressive treatment of his more sexually experienced wife. Its as if the world is bullying him with constant humiliation and emasculation and his response is to bully Debbie for her sorority-girl past and her mild crush on studly brother-in-law (Chris Hemsworth). It wouldnt be Vacation without pere Griswold facing setback after setback but the tone goes sour quickly. The episodic nature of the road movie gives each pit stop a fresh opportunity to make a good impression and a few actors take advantage particularly Hemsworth as a preening Texan and Charlie Day as a suicidally despondent whitewater rafting guide. But the center does not hold The Griswolds are a miserable bunch and their dysfunction smothers the comedy as much as it fuels it. This Vacation wants us to wince and laugh at the same time.

There are straight-to-DVD ""American Pie"" sequels that work better.Ed Helms who at one point is covered in the guts of a dead cow and later in human waste (the movie thinks these situations are hilarious by the way) plays a grown-up Rusty Griswold now a pilot for a budget airline.

Entertainment Inc Vacation is lazy idiotic and gross -- and I laughed my ass off at it. A totally unnecessary sequel to a long-dormant totally unnecessary series this latest entry in the Griswold Saga -- which kicked off back in 1983 with National Lampoons Vacation starring Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo -- doesnt even try to distinguish itself. It starts off with a version of the series signature tune Lindsey Buckinghams ""Holiday Road"" (have any horror films featured a serial killer who plays this song over and over again?) and demonstrates all the previous films (in)attention to production values craft storytelling and visual elegance.A This time its the Griswolds now-middle-age son Rusty (Ed Helms) who has to pile his family into an unlikely vehicle and travel across the country -- once again -- to Walley World. What might have been a scarring memory for any other family is for Rusty an example of the lengths to which one man will go to make sure his family has a good time. That Rusty wants to replicate what his father Clark (played by Chevy Chase who shows up late in a cameo) did so many years ago shouldnt come as a surprise as hes clearly not the kind of guy who can think or fend for himself. An entirely-too-nice pilot for a discount airline called EconoAir Rusty is an empty hole at the center of his family His bored but patient wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) is frustrated at never going anywhere special while his younger son Kevin (Steele Stebbins) is a mini-sociopath fond of tormenting and bullying his older son James (Skyler Gisondo) a sensitive soul fond of keeping journals writing poetry and softly strumming his guitar. Like the original Vacation has no real story to tell. It doesnt even do all that much with the heres-a-family-that-barely-tolerates-each-other-stuck-in-a-car-for-days premise. The road-trip concept is an excuse to string together a series of dumb random gags with a couple of convenient through lines. Rusty rents a special van for the cross-country road trip -- a bizarre Albanian hybrid with a variety of silly features that the film can mine for comedy whenever things slow down. (It even comes with a CB radio which Kevin uses to taunt a trucker on the road; that leads to a wholly useless truck-pursuit subplot one whose hilariously unsatisfying conclusion I think might be part of the joke.) We also get some occasional bits of fan service for Vacation diehards including not one but two shout-outs to the original films infamous Christie Brinkley cameo. I know that I am describing what should objectively be a bad movie here. But sometimes its the dumbest jokes that make you laugh the hardest and Vacation is a gold mine of such idiocy -- from Rustys backfiring attempts to be a wingman for his son at a discount motels hot tub to a pratfall-and-vomit-soaked side-trip to Debbies old sorority to a turn by Charlie Day as an aggressively cheerful river guide who loses the will to live after his fiancee dumps him just as hes taking the Griswolds white-water rafting to one of the all-time-stupidest jokes Ive ever seen involving a thorn bush and a fire hydrant. (I cowered under my seat in shame as I laughed at that one.) The films high point might be a visit with Rustys sister (Leslie Mann) and her comically hunky cowboy-weatherman husband (Chris Hemsworth) who at one point cant resist flaunting his junk in front of a clearly impressed Debbie. It helps that the actors are game and well cast Unlike the languid Chevy Chase Helmss blandness is propulsive constantly hinting at a barely veiled lunacy -- he could easily be a super-nice family man or a deranged pervert an uncertainty the film plays for comic effect more than once. And Applegate has a wide-eyed kindness that seems like it could easily boil over into jealousy and backstabbery. (She was after all Kelly Bundy once upon a time.) But perhaps the best way to describe Vacation and my response to it is to dive into what should have been one of the films worst gags. (Spoiler alert I suppose.) At one point Rusty and Debbie who throughout the trip have been getting frisky in an attempt to salvage their marriage sneak off to have sex at the Four Corners (the famed spot where Nevada Utah Colorado and New Mexico meet). Now as soon as they decide that you know that the big joke will be that there are other couples there looking to do the same. So you sit there cynically waiting for the inevitable predictable unfunny payoff. Sure enough there are other couples there and the initial reveal is humdrum and unfunny as the Griswolds are spooked in the darkness by another couple right beside them. But then the scene degenerates into something that looks like a found-footage horror movie with pale naked faces and bodies suddenly jumping out at the camera - a gag which while still not original has its own kind of stupid energy. And then it becomes something entirely different The police arrive everyone else flees and Rusty and Debbie are left standing there as cops from four different states show up and start taunting each other about their respective states until it all escalates into an insult-laden Mexican standoff with actual guns. Again not that funny to describe but onscreen in the heat of the moment I couldnt stop laughing at this scenes dynamic surreal devil-may-care foolishness. I could say the same for this evil hilarious movie.

Funny in spots there isnt enough new here to make it stand on its own.""Vacation"" can insist its a remake all it likes but that doesnt stop it from being all too familiar.(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsThe cast is funny but there isnt enough new brought to the table.Applegate in particular is a really good comic performer.Critics rating 2.5 stars out of 5Theres a smart bit in ""Vacation"" the comedy that is not a reboot or a remake those responsible for it will tell you.In it Ed Helms who plays Rusty Griswold the grown-up son of Chevy Chases character in the 1983 original informs his family that they will be traveling by car to Walley World -- the destination on the ill-fated first vacation of his childhood.""You want to redo your original vacation from 30 years ago"" his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) asks?""This will be completely different.""""Ive never even heard of the original vacation"" oldest son James (Skyler Gisondo) says.""Doesnt matter. The new vacation will stand on its own.""Thus we have a meta-reference that at once acknowledges what the new film is up to while offering a tip of the cap to the original. Wink wink nod nod were letting you in on the joke. Its a great idea and its funny at least to those who have seen the first one.Which they then proceed to more or less remake.Oh well at least they got one solid new element in there.Plenty of familiar scenes are present in the new ""Vacation."" (Photo Warner Bros.)Rusty has grown up to be a pilot for a bargain-basement airline. He lives in a nice home outside of Chicago with Debbie James and Kevin (Steele Stebbins an absolute scene-stealer). All seems well enough but things are growing a little stale with Debbie. Plus Kevin relentlessly bullies his older brother.A dinner with friends (in which Keegan-Michael Key shines) leads to Rusty learning that the family is sick of the same old vacation he cherishes. So he decides to shake things up Like his father before him he will drive the family to California to visit Walley World.And just like on that trip -- just like in the first movie -- the family must weather many obstacles most inflicted by Rustys incompetence.The familiar plot points are here a visit with dysfunctional relatives a fantasy woman in a convertible pulling alongside the car on the highway all manner of logistical troubles and incredibly bad driving. Writers and directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein put twists on things so that some of it plays more like homage than rip-off and they add a few new touches as well.For instance an impulse stop at Debbies college reveals a little more about her than she probably wanted her family to know. Which makes this a good time to note that Applegate is a terrific comedic actress playing the straight man (sorry but what else would you call it?) in films like this and the ""Anchorman"" movies right up until the point when she doesnt. Which makes it all the funnier when she takes the punch lines.AZCENTRALVacation (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThis is a funny movie in places. Stebbins is hilarious as Kevin his face filled with gleeful insanity as he smothers his brother with a plastic bag (""Go to sleep Go to sleep""). Gisondo has a nice turn as the tormented older brother patient with a purpose it turns out. Leslie Mann and Chris Hemsworth are amusing in small roles (Hemsworth proving to be a particularly good sport).But it falls to Helms to carry the movie and hes not quite up to it. Hes a really funny actor excelling as the well-meaning put-upon sort. That is one way to describe Rusty but Helms is best in supporting roles. Its not that hes not funny -- in the moment in set pieces he is. Hes not channeling Chase though there are similarities to the character (which makes some sense). Yet he doesnt bring anything new enough to the character either.The original ""Vacation"" (which is based on the brilliant John Hughes story ""Vacation 58"" from National Lampoon) was a funny romp putting to good use the talents of its star. The new one tries to do the same but its just not as good a fit.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Comments Vacation Rated R  99 minutes  2015 Rusty Griswold the son in National Lampoons Vacation (1983) is all grown up now and because fate is cruel hes turned into Ed Helms. This respectably funny sequel to the Harold Ramis comedy follows Rusty his sunny wife (Christina Applegate) and their two boys on a road trip from Chicago to southern California where Rusty hopes to renew their family bonds by returning to the Walley World theme park of the original movie. Writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein spend much of the movie tipping their hats to Ramis (numerous gags revolve around the familys ugly dysfunctional rental car) and the rest of it addressing the touchstones of contemporary movie comedy (male sexual embarrassment male professional embarrassment male physical embarrassment and poo).

Caption A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics. One star Sid (John Leguizamo) meets a female sloth (Jessie J) in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Midway through a recent screening of ""Vacation"" the lights in the theater unexpectedly came on leading this viewer to wonder Can I go now? Alas darkness descended once again leaving the audience stuck in the mindless hell that is the Griswold family bumbling toward Walley World. Part remake part sequel the movie follows Rusty Griswold the son in the original 1983 ""National Lampoons Vacation."" There he was played by Anthony Michael Hall; here Ed Helms picks up the baton portraying the now-grown Rusty as a dweeby pilot for a budget airline. Taking a break from puddle-jumping Rusty has decided to drag his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons on a road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles -- by way of Memphis for some reason -- simply to ride a roller coaster called the Velociraptor. We already know this story Misadventure ensues starting with the familys car rental a lunchbox-on-wheels imported from Albania with a navigation system that speaks only Korean. Lets hope Rusty bought the insurance. Writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein seem to think that the ""angry""-sounding Korean language is inherently funny. Its not. Neither are the films jokes about rape pedophilia and suicide nor the cameo by Chevy Chase who starred in the original film but who hasnt been funny in ages. Pushing the envelope is great but only when some intelligent thought goes into the nudging. Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) aims to top his childhood trip to Walley World as he drags his two boys and wife on a cross-country trip to the beloved theme park. (  / Warner Bros. Pictures) Instead we get items checked off of a to-do list. Along with the requisite gross-out humor cleavage shots and hot-pants-clad booty-shaking -- courtesy of a detour to a sorority -- we also get a half-hearted stab at sweeter sentiments. The trip is supposed to be a way for Rusty to reconnect with Debbie who has grown bored with their marriage. Rusty also hopes the drive will bring his sons closer. James (Skyler Gisondo) is a sensitive guitar-playing journal-loving teen who is perpetually bullied by his little brother Kevin (Steele Stebbins) a mini-terrorist with a mouth like a sailor. Kevin at one point puts a plastic bag over Jamess head in an attempt to suffocate him. Nothing says comedy like fratricide. And what bonds a family better than mistaking a reservoir of raw sewage for a hot spring? If the movies many other unsavory moments dont turn you off -- including pools of vomit orgies and a head-on collision that kills a woman in a convertible -- just wait until you see Rusty spraying a mouthful of sewage into the air while Debbie rubs therapeutic ""mud"" all over her face. There are a couple of mildly amusing moments centering on Debbies attempt to show up her younger sorority sisters by chugging a pitcher of beer and running an obstacle course. But the cleverest detour involves a quartet of police officers jockeying for jurisdiction at the Four Corners monument where Colorado New Mexico Arizona and Utah meet. For the most part ""Vacation"" is a sad cynical rip-off of writer John Hughess source material. No one expects originality but the new movie may end up making history Its already looking like the worst movie of the year. R. At area theaters.

Take National Lampoons Vacation which came out in 1983 and was written by the late great John Hughes. Three decades on that road-trip comedy remains a near-perfect mix of banana-peel slapstick taboo raunch and feel-good family sentiment. Trying to improve it is pointless. Then again maybe that was never the goal. Written and directed by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley the new Vacation is both better than Id feared and not as hilarious as Id hoped. Its intermittently funny and instantly forgettable. With the same dorky brand of sincerity he brought to The Office Ed Helms is the best thing in the film as Rusty Griswold the grown-up son from the original now an oblivious paterfamilias who could find the sunny side of any rotten egg that life or his resigned wife (Christina Applegate) or his bickering sons (Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins) might hurl his way. Hes a middle-aged middle-American pushover. Eager to bring his dysfunctional clan closer together Rusty decides to re-create the same 2500-mile odyssey to Walley World that he took with his parents 32 years earlier. Like then hes met at every detour by horrors and humiliations (the best of which like a dip in a sewage-festooned hot spring are spoiled in the trailer). Whats missing is the pent-up anger that simmered behind Chevy Chases doofus grin. His Clark was always on the verge of a nuclear-family meltdown. Helms lacks Chases passive-aggressive edginess. The new Vacation isnt bad in the same way Poltergeist was earlier this year. But if the studios insist on plundering their Reagan-era vaults for ""new"" ideas they should aim higher.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The most recognizably 2015 element of the 2015 edition of Vacation comes early in the film a shot of Debbie (Christina Applegate) stone-faced and mirthless as she comments on an Instagram post with an enthusiastic and exclamation-heavy ""LOL"" For a moment the movie taps into the playful sense of suburban ennui that powered the 1983 original in which Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) insisted that driving his family cross-country to the theme park Walley World would bring them all closer together. Thirtysomething years later Clarks son Rusty (Ed Helms the fifth actor in five films to play the part) has a family of his own and having apparently misinterpreted the original Vacation believes the same type of trip will perform the same type of magic.As Rusty hastily throws together this idea for a new vacation writer-director team John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein throw together some hasty jokes about a new Vacation giving Helms and Applegate dialogue about the degree to which this trip will resemble the previous one and whether doing it over will result in disappointment. ""The original vacation had a boy and a girl; this one will have two boys"" Rusty points out referring to the superficial difference between his sons James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins) and himself and his sister Audrey (played as an adult by Leslie Mann). Its an amusing line in the moment. This fleeting bit of cleverness also manages to casually sell out any sense that this movie might be a continuation rather than a retread with a few tweaks while announcing one of those tweaks will be a Jurassic World-style substitution ensuring that the newer film has even more male characters (a strange idea of novelty to say the least).And so the Vacation cycle begins anew in one of those sequels that also functions as an unnecessarily reverent remake. Once again wacky vacation photos appear on-screen during the opening credits to the strains of Lindsey Buckinghams ""Holiday Road""; once again there are comical problems with the family car; and once again the movie proceeds as a series of comic vignettes chronicling the familys various mishaps. The newer version offers some semi-clever flips Instead of visiting much poorer relatives the Griswolds make a pit-stop to see the much-richer Audrey and her strapping husband played by Chris Hemsworth and instead of Clark lusting after a mystery woman played by Christie Brinkley son James gets a less-sour crush on her teenage equivalent. Some of these episodes are funny while plenty more inspire indifferent half-chuckles and shrugs--and to be fair the original Vacation despite its now-vaunted Harold Ramis pedigree is just as slapdash in its construction. If anything some of the newer films travelogue skits feel a little more conceptually substantial than the sometimes-wan blackout style of the original; theres a particularly inspired bit of escalating silliness about jurisdictional conflicts at the Four Corners monument and the Griswolds Albanian rental car provides some funny running gags. Even Helms whose puppyish neediness can be trying finds a clearer persona for Rusty (optimistic and open-minded to a clueless fault) than Chevy Chase did for Clark who often felt detached from his on-screen family (he appears here briefly in more avuncular form).It wouldnt be impossible then to match or even improve upon the 1983 Vacation. Yet the 2015 model still cant manage it in large part because whenever Daley and Goldstein have the opportunity to make any biting observations or mount sustained original gags they floor it in the opposite direction. The original film at least contrasted Reagan-era dysfunction with one fathers picturesque and often-ridiculous ideal of an all-American road trip. The new one hints at modern complications with Debbies miserably dutiful social-media experience and James very millennial sensitivity but otherwise ignores its own set-ups. Rusty works as a pilot for a budget airline which is portrayed as an obstacle not because say the Griswolds John Hughes-style palace in suburban Chicago stretches the often-low salary of a commercial pilot but because he doesnt get as much respect as pilots for those fancy name-brand airlines. Later when the family visits Audrey they discuss beforehand how her husband (Hemsworth) leans further right than they do. Instead of then tweaking either his conservative values or the Griswolds good-liberal sense of decorum the movie offers a single running gag about his refusal to let his wife work and leaves it at that seemingly afraid of offending anyone (at least until a non-joking late-movie dismissal of Audreys entire marriage indicative of the movies willingness to toss aside its female characters to help the men self-actualize). All of this might matter less if Vacation had more and bigger laughs but Daley and Goldstein directing their first feature after a series of screenwriting jobs evoke the intermittent sloppiness of so many comedies from the 80s and beyond. They do a nice job of locking their camera to the dashboard in one shot featuring a looming truck but cant exercise the same discipline for a sequence that finds Debbie running through a sorority-made obstacle course and the different angles kill the slapstick momentum. Throughout they augment pratfalls and gross-out gags with bad CG and augment verbal jokes with lazy contradictory muttering. Their take on Vacation isnt laughless but its not really a take either. Its just a middling cover of a pretty good old song adrift in the present day.

In theaters Wednesday July 29 2 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) Early on in this reboot an adult Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) earnestly declares to his family (and to audiences) ""This vacation will stand on its own"" PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Sure. And station wagons can fly. Face it An update of the beloved comedy classic National Lampoons Vacation has nowhere to go but south. (Or to quote patriarch Clark Griswold ""This is crazy This is crazy""). Though the 1983 film spawned three sequels and a kitschy Old Navy ad no installment has come close tp matching the pitch black-humored wit of the original. And that poster art of Rustys family covered in poop is literally toilet humor at its worst. Still...a few chuckles can be found along this journey. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate in Vacation Hopper Stone/Warner Bros. Rusty Griswold is now captain Rusty Griswold a pilot for a low-rent commuter airline. Hes also a mild-mannered family man living in suburban Chicago with his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons. Like his dad Rusty isnt particularly respected on the home front and finds himself disconnected from the kids. (You would feel that way too if you came home and saw that the youngest kid wrote ""I have a vagina"" on his brothers guitar. Charming.) Theyre all supposed to go to a lake house in Michigan for their annual summer vacation but Rusty knows its time for a shake-up. PHOTOS Chris Hemsworths hottest moments As Rusty looks through some old family photos it hits him Walley World here we come. Holiday Rooooooaaaaaoooaaaoooaaad... Automobiles have come a long way since the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. The Griswolds head to L.A. in a blue Tartan Prancer minivan ""the Honda of Albania"" whose electronic controls include a dozen confusing icons (one of which resembles a Swastika). They have a GPS tracking device which means no accidental detours through East St. Louis. Leslie Mann and Christina Applegate in Vacation Hopper Stone/Warner Bros. Not that they dont experience a slew of disasters across America. The most amusing of which is that dip in a waste dump in Arkansas. A man who can only be described as a wily yahoo points them in the direction of a private hot springs. Debbie encourages them all to put mud on their face unaware that its really . . . well you know. (Its funnier than it sounds). The other gross outs and crass jokes are more of the meh variety as Debbie pukes visiting her sorority house in Tennessee and that bratty kid repeatedly calls a truck driver a rapist. PHOTOS Costars reunited Again nothing is going to compare to the genius of John Hughes original screenplay -- but surely cowriters/directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Horrible Bosses) could do better than having that twerp also telling everyone to ""f--k off."" Couldnt they just leave him on someones doorstep with an explanatory note pinned to his chest a la Aunt Edna? (RIP). Thank goodness for the pit stop at Aunt Audrey (Leslie Mann)s house. Shes now married to a super-studly not-totally-bright local meteorologist played by Chris Hemsworth. Thor likes to walk around in his underwear and um handle the remote control. In a rare comedic role Hemsworth puts on his best redneck accent and shamelessly steals the movie. Yup a definite step up from Randy Quaid. But if its nostalgia fans want they wont be disappointed. Starting from the familiar opening credits the filmmakers consistently tip their hats to the National Lampoons edition. Its telling that almost all the throwback bits work. Instead of Christie Brinkley in the red convertible flirtatiously smiling at Clark we see model Hannah Davis in a convertible flirtatiously smiling at Rusty. (The kicker is too good to ruin here). Father and son also engage in awkward sex talk by the hotel pool. (Slightly more groan-worthy). PHOTOS Stars rewear their most iconic costumes Ed Helms Christina Applegate Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo in Vacation Hopper Stone/Warner Bros. The most respectful homage though is the casting of Helms as Rusty. An aimless smart aleck as an adolescent (as played by Anthony Michael Hall) hes grown up to be just like Dad. Loving hapless well-meaning clumsy embarrassing and a guy who just wants his family to get along and spend some quality time together. (And if they could just sing along to Seals ""Kiss from a Rose"" in the car that would be swell.) When Clark (Chase) and Ellen (Beverly DAngelo) catch up with the fam its a treat to see multiple generations of Griswold DNA on display. And what of Walley World? They make it there and hurray its open for business. Indeed the big roller coaster is an apt metaphor for the film -- ups downs and ultimately a pretty fun ride. Just please bring back Hemsworth for European Vacation.

Vacation remake makes us wish the Griswolds would stay home review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesVacation remake makes us wish the Griswolds would stay home reviewA new generation of Griswolds on the road has little of the comic magic that made the original bearably funny.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentWed. July 29 2015VacationStarring Ed Helms Christina Applegate. Written and directed by John Francis Daley Jonathan M. Goldstein. 99 minutes. Opens Wednesday at GTA theatres. 14ALouder dirtier and with a lot more cussing its taken more than 30 years for a new family of Griswolds to make an ill-fated cross-country trip to Walley World.Article Continued BelowWorth the wait? Not really.Many have genuine affection for the original National Lampoons Vacation (1983). It was fitfully funny and rather subversive for its time boasting the talents of late great screenwriter John Hughes and the directorial skills of another late great Harold Ramis. Its probably just as well that neither is still around to witness this uneven and unsatisfying mess.No doubt director/screenwriters John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein intended this reboot of sorts to be something akin to homage. The result is merely ham-fisted.This time its Rusty son of Clark and Ellen who tries to pull his family out of a summer fugue by heading back to the theme park he once visited so memorably.A new generation of Griswolds go on a cross-country family trip with less satisfying results than National Lampoons Vacation (1983).  (Hopper Stone / AP)  Although Ed Helms (The Hangover) is a solid comedic actor comparisons are inevitable to original pater Clark (Chevy Chase) and theyre unlikely to be kind.Chase attacked the role with a kind of tooth-clenching bonhomie that barely concealed hair-trigger madness. Helms has the same big broad toothy grin but hes far too benign never coming across as dangerously unbalanced (or as funny) as Chase did.The script makes an effort to create a new dynamic between the two requisite Griswold kids so instead of brother and sister Rusty and Audrey we have older brother James (Skyler Gisondo) being bullied by profanity-spouting younger brother Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Its far more annoying than amusing.Most of the gags are merely gag-inducing such as the family swimming in a sewage-filled pond and the very prominent member sported by Uncle Stone (Chris Hemsworth) husband of grown-up Audrey. The screenwriters get some decent mileage out of a couple of original elements including the comically absurd Albanian-made vehicle used to make the trip a wry cameo by The Walking Deads Norman Reedus as a creepy trucker with a teddy bear stuck to the front of his big rig and a suicidal Grand Canyon river guide named Chad (Charlie Day).But too often the ride on the Velociraptor roller-coaster at Walley World -- which leaves the Griswolds suspended upside down for hours -- acts a metaphor for the film with the loops never completed and the audience left hanging in the air waiting for a joke to land.Since most of the films best moments such as they are are captured in the trailer why not watch them at home and spare yourself a trip to the theatre?Sequels National Lampoons European Vacation (1985)Co-written by John Hughes its the first sequel and quite a decent one at that including a memorable scene in which the Griswolds stay overnight with a German family who have no idea who they are.National Lampoons Christmas Vacation (1989)With Hughes back as sole screenwriter its probably the best of the three sequels featuring a Christmas lighting scene thats a gut-buster and the return of vile hillbilly Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid).Vegas Vacation (1997) Its the least funny of the series clearly missing both the National Lampoon label and Hughes comedic touch in the script with appearances from Sin City fixtures Wayne Newton and magicians Siegfried and Roy.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Credit Hopper Stone/Warner Bros. Pictures The kid with the potty mouth may cost Warner Bros. some business at the box office but in a strange way he elevates ""Vacation"" a very funny R-rated movie with a PG-13 heart.The film is a sort of sequel to ""National Lampoons Vacation"" the 1983 comedy in which Chevy Chase played Clark Griswold a father determined to drag his family across the country for a vacation at an amusement park called Walley World. One of those children Rusty has grown up and now embarks on the same ill-advised odyssey with his wife and two sons.Ed Helms and Christina Applegate who play the couple are skilled comedy veterans and Ms. Applegate has what is surely the summers best vomit scene. But the young actors playing their sons come close to stealing the movie Skyler Gisondo as James the older child and especially Steele Stebbins as Kevin who curses like a sailor and bullies his much bigger brother. The parents arent exactly oblivious to Kevins vileness but they seem to put it in the same class as say not asking to be excused from the table at the end of dinner. Video Trailer Vacation A preview of the film. By Warner Bros. Pictures on Publish Date June 6 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Kevin is not entirely responsible for the R rating -- the movie has sex gags and even a flash or two of nudity -- but he could have certainly earned it on his own. Some moviegoers might recoil yet ""Vacation"" would have been drab had it been populated with the same bratty-but-harmless youngsters as every other family movie. Kevin at least has a distinctive personality.In any case Rusty after procuring a ridiculous Albanian rental car that steals a few scenes of its own makes one mistake after another as he blunders toward Walley World with his reluctant family. There is a memorable stop at a hot-springs park where line-jumping lands the Griswolds in the wrong type of hot water in several senses. And theres a visit to Rustys sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) who has also grown up and whose husband (Chris Hemsworth of the ""Thor"" movies) is a weatherman who exudes a dangerous amount of sexiness.Strengthening of brotherly and marital bonds is the real agenda of course but happily the movie never stays on these laugh-killing themes long. Before an epic fight on a roller coaster wraps things up Mr. Chase and Beverly DAngelo have wandered through reprising their roles as the Griswold patriarch and matriarch grandparents who should be proud of what they have wrought.

"Vacation | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; vacation ) Vacation (United States 2015) July 28 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""No need to remember when Cause everything old is new again."" - Peter Allen amp; Carole Bayer Sager We live in an era of remakes reboots and sequels. Hollywood having apparently run out of new ideas (or more accurately being afraid of bringing anything unfamiliar to the screen) has come to a point where the path forward involves looking back. This summer multiplexes have brought back The Avengers Jurassic Park dinosaurs Tom Cruise and his IMF pals Arnold Schwarzeneggers Terminator and now Clark Griswold. When a rolling stone gathers no moss and makes a ton of money you can bet its only going to gain speed. When Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo made Vacation (full name National Lampoons Vacation) more than 30 years ago it was a surprise hit. Directed by the late Harold Ramis from a screenplay by the late John Hughes (yes that John Hughes) Vacation found the nexus between riotous humor and nostalgia tapping into the desire of every viewer to laugh and reminisce. Oddly this new version which could be considered a ""soft reboot"" (restarting the franchise without throwing away the past - sort-of like Jurassic World but without the dinosaurs) has much the same goal. The comedy has been ""upgraded"" to meet modern standards for vulgarity and raunchiness. And the nostalgia plays not on dimly-remembered family vacations but on our recollections of having a good time watching the Griswolds embark upon theirs in the 1980s. By throwing in cameos for Chase (who now looks suspiciously like Doc Brown from Back to the Future) and DAngelo Vacation 2015 connects the new movie to those that have preceded it. Ed Helms a Hangover veteran is a perfect choice to take over the reins from Chase. He plays Rusty Griswold Clarks son. In true ""Cats in the Cradle"" fashion hes grown up just like Dad. So he wants to take his wife and kids on a special Memorial Day weekend to L.A.s Walley World the Disneyland-inspired amusement park destination in the 1983 Vacation. And like Clark (and apparently not having learned anything from his childhood misadventure) he thinks driving from Chicago to California is the best way to promote family bonding. His wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) is skeptical.  His sons James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins) are downright hostile. And in true Griswold fashion Murphy rides shotgun and his rule takes over the trip. Vacation passes the most important test of any comedy its funny. Much of the humor is off-color and obsessed with sex and bodily fluids but thats par for the course in the R-rated genre. Vacation (1983) was considered risque for its era. By todays standards its tame but the sensibility has been maintained. The new film follows the template of its predecessor. Theres a lot of ""embarrassment"" comedy in which laughs come at the expense of the main character as he repeatedly makes a fool out of himself. Without aping Chases performance Helms captures the essence of the Vacation patriarch. Hes a Father Knows Best type who somehow manages to do everything wrong. Chases brief appearance as Clark emphasizes how right Helms is in the role. Christina Applegates Debbie is more wild and less grounded that Beverly DAngelos Ellen (although without the nude scene). The kids James and Kevin have a similar dynamic to the one that existed between Rusty and Audrey. Vacation has fun with call-backs to the original. In an early scene Rusty and Debbie discuss the merits of this ""new vacation"" versus those of the ""first vacation."" The subsequent road trip follows a similar trajectory with stops at an off-the-map ""hot springs"" rest area a house shared by Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her hunky weatherman husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth) a motel that only Norman Bates could love and (of course) the Grand Canyon. Theres a nod to the hot girl in a red Ferrari an incident involving a big rig and the reappearance of the most infamous vehicle to emerge from the 1983 film.  Plus Vacation opens with Lindsay Buckinghams ""Holiday Road."" Vacation doesnt quite come up to the level of the original (although to be fair the 1983 movie has not aged well) but its better than any of the sequels including the holiday favorite Christmas Vacation. It doesnt try to do too much. As with all episodic comedies this one is hit-and-miss but there are enough ""hits"" to keep most viewers entertained. Whether one considers this a reboot or sequel it argues that the old Wagon Queen Family Truckster still has some gas left in the tank. Vacation (United States 2015) Director Jonathan M.

"Rebooted Vacation could use a little work - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Rebooted Vacation could use a little work Newest installment of the Vacation franchise offers some updated bright spots but it drives a long way for just a few laughs Hopper Stone / New Line Cinema In the new ""Vacation"" are Skyler Gisondo from left Steele Stebbins Christina Applegate and Ed Helms. In the new ""Vacation"" are Skyler Gisondo from left Steele Stebbins Christina Applegate and Ed Helms. (Hopper Stone / New Line Cinema) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter ""So you wanna redo your vacation from 30 years ago?"" Debbie Griswold asks her husband Rusty with a look of bewilderment early on in the new comedy ""Vacation.""Debbie honey. Time for a lesson in Hollywood economics. A reboot of the ""National Lampoons Vacation"" film series launched in 1983 this new ""Vacation"" written and directed by ""Horrible Bosses"" screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley is the kind of movie that exists because greenlighting it is easier than thinking.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Actually pulling off the reinvention of a beloved comedy franchise on the other hand is tricky business. Despite a strong cast and a few solid laughs Goldstein and Daley dont succeed at the task relying too much on unexamined nostalgia and vile gross-out gags. The new ""Vacation"" turns out to be a mostly bumpy unpleasant trip. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link The original movie which featured John Hughes as writer and Harold Ramis as director wasnt exactly high art -- half the laughs involved Chevy Chases reckless driving many others his reckless walking. But there was something subversive about how the movie toyed with the enforced cheerfulness of the nuclear family and the sanctity of the all-knowing patriarch deflating the ""Father Knows Best"" era like a blown tire on the Griswolds Wagon Queen Family Truckster. At least three of the movies in the six-movie ""Vacation"" franchise are entertaining in a basic-cable-rainy-Sunday kind of way. Photos Celebrity photos taken by Los Angeles Times photographers. Enter the seventh film in which Ed Helms portrays a grownup Rusty in the role originally played by 15-year-old Anthony Michael Hall. A sweet ineffectual pilot for a regional airline Rusty proposes a family road trip to Walley World the very theme park where his father Clark Griswold (Chase) brought him as a child. Dads have changed a lot since 1983 -- now they wear Baby Bjorns and sometimes earn less than moms. One way to update ""Vacation"" might have been to play with those changes but instead the movie stays rooted firmly in the originals tired marital dynamics.Rustys long-suffering wife (and are there any other kind in movies like this?) Debbie (Christina Applegate) indulges him and their two children sensitive older brother James (Skyler Gisondo) and bratty little brother Kevin (Steele Stebbins) pile in the back of a peculiarly tricked out minivan called the Tartan Prancer (""the Honda of Albania"" Rusty calls it). The scripts sharpest jokes are topical takes on changing family life --- keeping up with the Joneses in the Instagram age talking to your kids about ""gender fluidity"" navigating an unfamiliar city as a rogue GPS system barks at you in Korean. As in the original the hapless dad just wants to show his family a good time and Helms excels at scenes of clueless exuberance whether belting out a Seal song while at the wheel of the Prancer or failing as a romantic wingman when James meets a girl by the motel pool.Theres a freshness to the relationship between the brothers too as the younger sibling for once is the bully and the older one a poetry-writing softie and both Gisondo and Stebbins have good timing and natural instincts as actors.Like the original this film is rated R but Rs are raunchier than they used to be. Where the original ""Vacation"" relied on slapstick for its laughs the new film is dragged down by something grosser and more hostile -- lets call it splatstick. In the course of the movies 98 minutes a pretty girl and a farm animal both get splattered the family ends up elbow deep in raw sewage and Debbie pukes her way through a visit to her old sorority. Its enough to make you say ""Dad pull over the car. Im gonna be sick.""Applegate does her best with whats on the page including the vomitous set piece that explains her college nickname ""Debbie Do Anything."" Its more comedic opportunity than Chases straightwoman Beverly DAngelo ever got in the original films but thats not saying much. Thirty years later funny women are still underused -- this time its Applegate and Leslie Mann as Rustys sister who seems to exist in the movie only to beam radiantly at her husband hunky local weatherman Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth).The guys are more fortunate Hemsworth has one of the movies most memorable scenes in an extended visual joke about his impressive anatomy and Charlie Day creates a delightfully unhinged character out of a river-rafting tour guide reeling from a recent breakup.By this point though the Griswolds have driven a very long way for a few laughs. When Chase and DAngelo appear in a short scene late in the film like Stan Lee in a Marvel movie its supposed to reward ""Vacations"" fan base with a moment of sweet recognition.Instead the effect is sort of sad -- a puffy Chase does some unfunny bumbling DAngelo barely says a word and they open the garage to reveal the mint-condition Wagon Queen Family Truckster ready for cruising by a new generation of Griswolds. Someones been taking good care of the old car but the franchise is pretty dinged up.rebecca.keeganlatimes.comMORE REVIEWSSouthpaw has solid Jake Gyllenhaal in ring but a contrived scriptOutrageous Sophie Tucker captures entertainers star powerPixels never comes into focus as a real picture Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Travel Chevy Chase Christina Applegate Chris Hemsworth See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt; Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-vacation-review-20150729-story.html,200,vacation17,vacation,latimes

Updated July 29 2015 201 PM By RAFER GUZMAN rafer.guzmannewsday.com + - From left Skyler Gisondo as James Griswold Steele Stebbins as Kevin Griswold Christina Applegate as Debbie Griswold and Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold in ""Vacation."" Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures / Hopper Stone advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Grown-up Rusty Griswold takes his own family on a road trip. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Lacks the wickedly funny spirit of the original ""Vacation."" CAST Ed Helms Christina Applegate Skyler Gisondo LENGTH 139 The bathroom jokes and phallic humor start early in ""Vacation"" as the opening credits roll against a backdrop of typical tourist photos marred by unfortunate accidents. That sets the tone for this raunchy but toothless follow-up to ""National Lampoons Vacation"" the 1983 comedy classic about a pleasant family road trip that spirals into insanity and death. Therein lies the difference between the two movies. The original directed by Harold Ramis and written by John Hughes (from his short story ""Vacation 58"") cast Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold a Midwestern patriarch determined to drive his family to a fictional Los Angeles theme park Walley World. What followed wasnt just a comedy of errors but a merciless savaging of the American family ideal; even elderly aunts and small dogs werent safe from the movies wicked humor. Long before ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) there was ""National Lampoons Vacation."" advertisement | advertise on newsday In the new version Clarks son Rusty has grown into a good-hearted doofus (Ed Helms to the manner born). Rusty has a supportive wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and two kids snotty Kevin (Steele Stebbins) and sensitive James (a very good Skyler Gisondo). For some reason Rusty remembers his old Walley World journey fondly and decides his own family should experience it. That they do re-enacting and slightly tweaking the first films more memorable moments a robbery a Grand Canyon misadventure a quick visit with kooky family members. (Leslie Mann plays Rustys sister Audrey while a game-for-anything Chris Hemsworth plays her cocky husband. Chase as grandpa Griswold also appears.) Many of the movies jokes fall into the ""oops"" category as in Gee this natural hot spring smells a lot like sewage. And so on. The original ""Vacation"" wasnt exactly highbrow either so why does this one pale in comparison? Partly its the script and directing both a little choppy by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. Mostly though its that American families are no longer the unassailable sacrosanct ideals they used to be so putting one through the wringer isnt funny in and of itself. The new ""Vacation"" scores a laugh here and there but it also proves the adage that you cant go home again. MoviesBig movies out this summer CORRECTION An earlier version of this review misidentified the relationship between Audrey and Clark.

""But that vacation had a boy and a girl and this has two boys"" Rusty says. ""And therell probably be other differences."" Its an inside joke that got a laugh at the screening I attended. And its also an early admission that yes this is a cynical exercise. Why not just forget comparisons and see whether its funny? So I must adhere to my rule that no matter how else I feel about a comedy it gets a passing grade if it makes me laugh - which I did several times. Really a joke exercise with tacked-on life-lessons Vacation shows the hand of a small army of gag writers some with conflicting styles - from scatological (a hot springs thats actually a sewage dump) to anarchical (things blow up from cars to animals) to sex jokes to a puke-filled college booze-up to interfamily-violence/slapstick to a suicidal Grand Canyon white water river guide. Anything even remotely relationship-related falls flat - from the war between the sensitive older brother James (Skyler Gisondo) and his bullying little brother Kevin (Steele Stebbins) to the frequent and ill-fated attempts by Rusty and Debbie to find an adventurous place to have sex. For all that the biggest laughs are car-related having to do with a crazed trucker and an Albanian automobile a GPS that can only give directions in angry Korean and a remote whose buttons feature mysterious logos of a top hat a swastika and other puzzlers. With no pretense that this is any kind of ""serious"" comedy the guest-stars can just cut loose - best example being Chris Hemsworth who plays a full-out Texas redneck TV weatherman named Stone whos married to Rustys sister Audrey (Leslie Mann). This proud lout takes pains to ""nonchalantly"" show off his Dirk Diggler bulge at every opportunity. The sometime Thor seems to enjoy every second hes on the screen here. Not that every second of the movie is similarly enjoyable. As with any road trip there are lulls in Vacation while we wait for the next scattershot sight gag or situation to land. Ultimately this Vacation is little more than a passable way to waste time on one. Follow JimSlotek Email Jim Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

If youre the type of person who needed a Vacation to recover from your Vacation your three-decades-plus wait is over The new but not necessarily improved edition is here to make you feel either very old or very relieved you werent around when the first one or any of its sequels hit. Either way youll need some time to recover after.This Vacation isnt a strict remake but more of an update Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is the grown-up version of the wiseacre son played by Anthony Michael Hall back in 1983. Having reached the gleaming shoals of middle age he now has a family of his own Theres sparkly agreeable wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and eternally bickering sons James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). James is the elder a sensitive lad who strums tranquil tunes on acoustic guitar and keeps multiple diaries full of his ruminations; Kevin is the hellion who makes Jamess life miserable the kind of kid brother who deserves a smack though James is too passive to give it.Film Details Vacation RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time99 min. More Info Trailer Rusty like his dad before him doesnt care what the rest of his family wants to do on vacation; he cares only about pursuing an elusive experience that will be satisfying to him -- in particular re-creating the disastrous yet ""fun"" family trip detailed in the earlier Vacation. So he buys a hideous car big enough for everyone -- an ungainly boxy thing called a Tartan Prancer which Rusty proclaims is ""the Honda of Albania"" -- and heads off on an adventure that includes a pit stop at a sorority keg party an accidental steer murder and lots of strangely misplaced homoerotic humor.The Vacation formula -- this time around particularly -- is somewhat odd to begin with. Some of the humor is slapsticky and kid-friendly like the superdumb Three Stooges moment when Rusty invites Debbie to slam the Prancers door on his arm -- he assures her that one of the cars fancy installed features will stop it. (It doesnt. Not on the second try either.) But most of the gags in Vacation -- which is rated R -- involve language most responsible parents dont want their tiny tots to hear as well as invocations -- though not depictions -- of things like glory holes and rimjobs. (In one of the movies many not-so-hilarious moments Rusty cluelessly and erroneously explains the latter to James.) Who exactly is Vacation for? Kids will end up seeing it of course -- they always do -- and it will hardly scar them for life. Its not smart enough for that. Still most of the jokes are just too vague and unshaped to be funny for anyone old enough to buy a ticket without a guardian. EXPAND Photo by Hopper Stone Vacation was written and directed by John Francis Daley (who got his start as an actor on Freaks and Geeks) and Jonathan M. Goldstein (one of the writers of Horrible Bosses both one and two) Its both shaggy and slack ambling from joke to joke like an old dude riding a decrepit golf cart. The original directed by Harold Ramis and written by John Hughes at least offered the occasional shot of big stupid energy -- todays filmmakers may be afraid of being too big and too stupid but this halfhearted stupidity is even worse. And its hard to know what to make of gags like the one in which Rusty interrupts Jamess courtship of a sweet young female acquaintance at a motel hot tub by making it look as if hes coming on to his own son. The joke is that Rusty is just trying to be Jamess ""wingman"" and taking the wrong tack; its not a mean-spirited or insulting bit but its weirdly opaque. Ditto Rustys eagerness to explain that ""glory hole"" to the kids before mom Debbie puts the kibosh on it. The joke exists only to reinforce a recurring riff in Vacation a thread of humor targeted to those 35 and above Our kids are getting old enough to ask us about this embarrassing stuff and golly were barely past being teenagers ourselves.Of course dads today are different from dads 30 years ago. Im reminded of that every time I see a heavily tattooed mid-thirties guy in board shorts and a baggy Batman T-shirt pushing a stroller People just dont want to grow up even after theyve started making other people. Rusty looks and acts more adult than that but as played by Helms theres still something of the prolonged adolescent in him just without the flippant sharpness of the young Anthony Michael Hall. Its unflattering and far from hilarious as if the character from the original had been replaced by a hapless pod person. Then again the seemingly endless Vacation sequels didnt treat the kids as distinct individuals anyway; they were played by whatever young actors happened to come through the revolving door. But Helms doesnt have even half the goofy charisma of Chase and that was limited to begin with. He keeps slugging away at the material gamely but hes too self-consciously earnest to give in to true madness.The best gags are the few that are gonzo including one in which Chris Hemsworth as Rustys hunky weatherman brother-in-law struts around in underwear too tiny to contain his considerable package -- the joke like the package is big and dumb enough to work. Leslie Mann shows up as Rustys sister now all grown up and married to that hunky weatherman. She too is funny and gets a few plaintive pointed lines about how her allegedly super-desirable (and staunchly right-wing) husband wont let her work outside the household. But this new Vacation is hardly an improvement on the old Vacation and may in fact be worse. Neither of them to borrow the immortal words of the Go-Gos is all we ever wanted.

Slideshow Review Vacation lacks sweetness of the original Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Vacation >> Thats one of the bigger differences between Vacation and its antecedent the beloved National Lampoons Vacation featuring Chase as a dad who during a particularly disastrous journey becomes obsessed with taking his family to theme park Walley World. Now one of those kids Russ (The Hangovers Ed Helms) has the same plan A family road trip to the storied theme park will bond his constantly fighting children and save his staid marriage to Debbie (Christina Applegate). ""Ive never even heard of the original vacation"" sensitive older son James (Skyler Gisondo) says to his father on hearing the plan. ""Doesnt matter"" Russ replies. ""The new vacation will stand on its own."" Its one of the cleverer moments in Vacation reflecting a meta quality that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum parlayed into successful comedies in the surprisingly funny and sweet Jump Street franchise. Vacation drops that irony as well as any nod toward sweetness. Instead writing-directing team John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein (making their directing debut after writing the similar-in-tone Horrible Bosses) prefer their Vacation hard R. That would be fine. Theres nothing to say that crass cant be funny - and it sometimes is in Daley and Goldsteins iteration - but Vacation loses any of the ooey-gooey family-friendly heart that made you really want Clark to get to Walley World to begin with. Vacation could stand on its own. And it does without the National Lampoon brand. But this Vacation still nods to the original Lindsey Buckinghams ""Holiday Road"" plays throughout and much like the Wagon Queen Family Truckster in the original the Griswolds current vehicle of choice nicknamed the Honda of Albania is a monstrosity that causes a lot of their problems. Some differences are good ones. Applegate a talented comedian actually gets to be funny unlike DAngelo who was rarely given the chance in the original 1983 film. As in that original - based on a script by the late great John Hughes (from his short story ""Vacation 58"") and directed by the late great Harold Ramis - the Griswolds move from one mishap to another. They return to Debbies old sorority where she lives up to her former Debbie Do-Anything nickname leading her to vomit all over the front yard. They go on a white-water rafting trip with a suicidal tour guide (Its Always Sunny in Philadelphias Charlie Day). The Griswolds even meet up with Russ sister Audrey (a wasted Leslie Mann) who is shacking up with a studly weatherman played by Chris Hemsworth who does well in his token pretty boy cameo. They even meet Chase and DAngelo who do little more than remind us of the sweet goofiness of the original. MOVIE REVIEW Vacation  (Out of four stars) Directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan M.

Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW Vacation Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (nudity profanity). ""You just want to redo your vacation from 30 years ago?"" Christina Applegates character asks in this dire sequel to ""National Lampoons Vacation."" ""Isnt that just going to be a disappointment?"" That is perhaps the summers biggest understatement -- and not just for Applegate who ends up covered with human excrement for her trouble. That sound you hear is John Hughes and Harold Ramis the writer and director of the original rolling over in their graves. And not from laughter which is in very short supply here. Christina Applegate and Ed HelmsPhoto Warner Bros. This one is called ""Vacation"" presumably because the National Lampoon -- which has licensed its name to a long line of terrible comedies (""Animal House"" is the only other exception) -- wanted to distance itself from something this toxic. Ed Helms plays Chevy Chases now-grown son Rusty (married to Applegate) in this latest needless extension of a series that included three previous sequels through 1997 and a direct-to-video 2003 spinoff starring Randy Quaid who perhaps not coincidentally has since exiled himself from the United States. Making their debuts as writer-directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (they wrote ""Horrible Bosses"") manage to pull off only a frighteningly tiny percentage of their gags partly because of poor timing and inept staging -- and partly because they seem to have put less thought into the script than the booby-trapped Albanian SUV that carries the Griswolds on their journey. Applegate bears the brunt of the humiliation her character slut-shamed and given a pair of drunk scenes. Among the many guest stars is Chris Hemsworth who demonstrates no gift for comedy whatsoever as a prodigiously endowed weatherman who is married to Rustys horny sister (Leslie Mann). ""Vacation"" tries again and again to up the ante from its classic predecessor before calling in Chase and Beverly DAngelo and even the original Truckster station wagon for brief appearances. But for all the F-bombs and references to ""rim jobs"" and ""glory holes"" the geniuses behind the new film just dont understand the difference between genuine subversiveness and pointless vulgarity.

But it doesnt function like a sequel either because all the actors are different with the exception of Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo who appear briefly. Think of the new movie as the retailoring of an old formula for a new generation taking the best of the old and combining it with the best of the new. The cute family setup is there but in place of the gentler 80s sensibility we get something harsh nasty and very funny. ""Vacation"" is consistently funny from beginning to end a piling on of dumb but inventive jokes and excruciating awkward situations. In place of Chevy Chase in the drivers seat we get Ed Helms as Rusty who still remembers the wonderful vacation he went on with his family back in the 1980s. Like Dad Rusty is an oblivious sort of guy who means well and wants his family to be happy. But where Chases quality was satiric Helms is more neurotic so that the marriage in ""Vacation"" really does seem in trouble. Its hard to see what his wife (Christina Applegate) could possibly see in Rusty who is needy and relentlessly chipper and does everything wrong. We know were in good comic hands from the first minutes when we see Rusty in his job as a pilot for a budget carrier. In that breezy all-American style that airline captains invariably master he thanks the passengers for flying ""Econo-Air -- were working hard to regain your trust."" This is followed by a sequence in which the elderly co-pilot who has dementia takes the plane up to 60000 feet. You were warned. John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein who shared writing and directing duties are merciless in pursuit of a laugh. Wanting to re-create a golden moment from his childhood and thinking it will bring closer a family that he senses is fragmenting Rusty rents an Albanian car (the car is a source for laughs in itself) and insists on taking a family road trip to Wally World an amusement park on the other side of the country. The rest of the film is just a succession of scenes in which the family stops somewhere and something ghastly happens. ""Vacation"" is not one of those comedies in which all the best jokes were in the coming attractions trailer. Viewers who saw the trailer for example might know that the Rusty and the family bathe in raw sewage thinking theyre at a hot springs. But the joke immediately before that is just as funny and the sequence right after that -- in which Rusty visits his sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Chris Hemsworth) -- is at least as good. Helms is particularly interesting here in that hes funny and yet really does make Rusty seem like a fellow with serious emotional problems. Applegate serves essentially as Helms straight man and her timing is first-rate. A running gag in which the tiny younger brother (Steele Stebbins) beats up on and terrorizes the sweet-natured older brother (Skyler Gisondo) brings the kids out from the periphery in a good way. As for Chase and DAngelo they dont do much but its nice to see them. Near the finish theres an attempt to inject some sentiment perhaps as a nod to ""National Lampoons Vacation"" but its an empty gesture and in a movie like this the emptier the better. We know it; the filmmakers know it and they know that we know and we know that they know When a family is in trouble a vacation from hell never helps.

"Vacation review Depressing remake of Chevy Chase comedy - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Vacation review Depressing remake of Chevy Chase comedy These zero-star movies of the past decade are so pathetic youll wonder how they found their way into production in the first place. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Ill trade one joke about your incestuous Cousin Eddie for a half-dozen gags involving molestation There must be some sort of Dr. Seuss contraption shared among Hollywood studios called the Unfunny-izer hauled out and set to sputtering when it comes time for the latest depressing remake of a comedy.The new ""Vacation"" mustve been run through it twice. This is a grim reboot of the franchise begun in 1983 with director Harold Ramis hit which was adapted and expanded by John Hughes from his own National Lampoon short story ""Vacation 58."" In the 83 movie Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly DAngelo) packed up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and set off with their son and daughter for Southern Californias most famous theme park ""Walley World."" In Hughes original short story he named names and called it Disneyland and the story ended with Clark hunting down Walt Disney and shooting him in the leg. (Lawsuit-wise you can understand the revisions.)Along the way the Griswolds encountered Christie Brinkley in a Ferrari; cousin Eddie; a dead-dog incident; a dead-aunt incident; and finally the exasperated limits of Clarks own optimism. The movie worked. It had an irresistible theme song (Lindsey Buckinghams ""Holiday Road"") and at least one foot in comic reality. Thirty-two years later it is one of the most widely known loved and referenced hits of the Reagan era and the station wagon itself remains a thing of slyly exaggerated design genius. The remake comes from writers-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein screenwriters of wildly uneven pedigree -- from ""Horrible Bosses"" (crude pretty good) to ""Horrible Bosses 2"" (crude pretty bad) and ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (total misfire). Ed Helms plays Rusty the now-grown Griswold a regional jet pilot based in Chicago. Stuck in a domestic and marital rut Rusty announces to wife Debbie (Christina Applegate playing somewhat less than a fully rounded character) that instead of the usual trip to a cabin in Michigan theyre going to re-create his childhood road trip to Walley World. Archive National Lampoons Vacation review from 1983 Chicago Tribune staff Chicago Tribune staff The filmmakers place a strange emphasis on jokes involving the sexual molestation of teens and preteens. Certainly the 83 ""Vacation"" pushed its luck here and there; if I hear one more person reference cousin Eddies daughters French-kiss line itll be the 490th person this week. Witlessly the new movie never stops pushing. Midair turbulence causes Helms pilot to stumble and fall head first into the crotch of a very young passenger. (The staging is beyond clumsy and a step or two north of icky.) In another scene Rusty appears to be seducing his own son. Later a trucker explains that the teddy bear stuck to his front grille is there to entice his victims.If any of this was surprising or cleverly timed youd laugh and then cringe. In ""Vacation"" you cringe first and ask questions later.Helms Rusty goes through the story in a sexual panic because his onetime party animal of a wife is more sexually experienced than he. Meantime hes conveniently blind to the toxic behavior of his younger son (Steele Stebbins) who nearly asphyxiates his sensitive wimpy sibling (Skyler Gisondo) using a plastic bag. Twice. Lingeringly.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review ""National Lampoons Vacation"" in 1983. See more videos Chase and DAngelo turn up for cameos as the elder Griswolds now running a bed-and-breakfast in San Francisco. That bits good for curdled nostalgia at least. Chris Hemsworth sports an amusing prosthetic penis as Rustys brother-in-law the soul of Texas Republican belligerence.The Griswolds rent an ungainly Albanian hybrid that comes with two gas tanks and a puzzling highly destructive series of key-fob functions. None of the resulting sight gags are handled with much finesse but theyre still the highlight. Male online commenters (a large subgroup of humans) have been whining for months about the forthcoming ""Ghostbusters"" reboot because it stars women not men. I suspect those guys will be satisfied with the new ""Vacation"" which ups the gross-out ante without actually bothering to bring the Griswolds into the 21st Century.

A family trip goes off course. Directors John Francis Daley Jonathan M. Goldstein (139). R Language. Area theaters. Everyone deserves a vacation. And everyone deserves a better comedy than ""Vacation."" If there was a reason to reboot the Chevy Chase lark from 1983 its not onscreen here. Chevy Chase was Chevy Chase and Ed Helms is not. Officially called ""National Lampoons Vacation"" back when the comedy magazine was a juggernaut the original worked because of Chases nonchalant wackiness. There was a subversive strain beneath the straight-laced Reagan era. This new ""Vacation"" sticks to the middle of the road instead. Helms plays Clarks son Rusty Griswold (played in the original by Anthony Michael Hall; two sequels had other actors in the role). Now a dull adult Rusty is looking forward to dragging his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) his wimpy older son James (Skyler Gisondo) and his foulmouthed younger boy Kevin (Steele Stebbins) to the same cabin where they go every year. Seeing how unenthusiastic they are Rusty decides to take them instead to Walley World the California destination from the original movie. His new plan sparks a scene full of self-referential jokes. (""The original vacation had a boy and a girl. This one has two boys"" riffs Helms. Groan.) There are other echoes and a few even land with a chuckle. More often though things run out of gas. Rusty gets a new Albanian car for the trip which comes with buttons he doesnt understand. They stop at Debbies old sorority where she tries to prove shes just as wild as she was in college. A Grand Canyon river guide played by Charlie Day wants to end it all while taking the Griswolds toward a waterfall. That last overlong bit isnt as funny as the quick canyon appreciation Chase did in 83. Helms is a fine sideman in ensembles like ""The Hangover"" and ""Cedar Rapids"" but anchoring a movie isnt his tempo. Still anything funny here is thanks to him including a moment with a drivers seat that rotates while barreling down a highway. He gives a slow horrified yell. Applegate is game for whatever the movie throws at her which sadly isnt much. By the time Chase shows up for Clarks cameo (alongside returning onscreen wife Beverly DAngelo) the movie stalls. Also chuckle-less is a scene with Leslie Mann as Rustys sister and Chris Hemsworth as her brawny husband. The ""Avengers"" co-star is eager to ham it up in a scene meant to recall the first films visit with Randy Quaid. But Hemsworth has nothing funny to do unless you count a silly accent. After a while ""Vacation"" starts to reek like a car when the kids have their shoes off. Really though that stench is a studio digging through its old titles trying to find something fresh to remake.

TWITTER Ed Helms plays the grown son of Chevy Chase in this raunchy follow-up to the 1983 movie created by John Hughes and director Harold Ramis. Probably everyone has had the discomfiting experience of sitting stone-faced at a comedy while others in the theater are whooping with laughter. And so it was for me at Vacation the gross follow-up to the Chevy Chase comedy from 1983 National Lampoons Vacation a smash hit that launched a franchise. Judging from the laughter around me this new movie should be popular though it remains to be seen whether the hard-R rating will hurt business for what is essentially a family comedy. In the original which was written by John Hughes and directed by Harold Ramis Chase and Beverly DAngelo played Clark and Ellen Griswold who took their son and daughter on a road trip headed toward the fictional theme park Walley World in California. Now Clarks son Rusty (Ed Helms) decides to mimic Dads adventure with wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons. The familys mishaps in the original movie were frequently hilarious thanks to the talents of Hughes and Ramis. The filmmakers here -- screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley -- making their directorial debuts substitute coarseness for genuine cleverness. (Their earlier writing credits Horrible Bosses and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 didnt exactly set a high bar.) These days it doesnt seem to take much to get audiences to yuk it up. A sequence in which Debbie visits her old college sorority which ends in a burst of vomiting is a prime example of this films mood of excess. The massacre of a cow which leaves Rusty covered in bloody bovine intestines is another scene strictly for viewers who confuse unprecedented grossness with delicious drollness. Then theres the bathing scene in which the Griswolds luxuriate in a hot spring filled with raw sewage. Read more Does Anyone Want to Buy National Lampoon? Amid the parade of tasteless zingers a few sequences actually hit the mark. The opening scene which shows Rustys job as pilot on an airliner called EconoAir does say something biting about the nightmare of flying on a bargain-basement aircraft. A sequence with a suicidal tour guide who takes the Griswolds rafting in the Grand Canyon is another pleasing bit of dark comedy. Best of all is a visit to Rustys sister (Leslie Mann) and cheerfully right-wing brother-in-law (Chris Hemsworth). Mann is wasted in this sequence but Hemsworth (Thor himself) reveals an unexpected flair for comedy as well as an impeccable Southern accent. His appearance in tight oh-so-revealing briefs is one of the movies rude scenes that actually generates guffaws though its overworked by the directors. In fact the filmmakers unsubtle style is responsible for killing many of the jokes. But they do succeed with several of the performers. Its a little hard to accept that Anthony Michael Hall (who played Rusty as a child in National Lampoons Vacation) would grow into Ed Helms but Helms actually channels Chase pretty effectively. He plays the same kind of bumbling doofus and his underlying sweetness always comes through. Applegate is appealing even if her role is sketchy.The directors hired two talented actors to play the kids Skyler Gisondo creates an endearing character as the older son a literary nerd who dreams of taking a road trip out of Jack Kerouac while Steele Stebbins is the foul-mouthed bullying younger brother funny even when his insults fall flat. The offbeat dynamic between the two is one of the movies better inventions. Chase and DAngelo pop up for cameo roles near the conclusion though one wishes the writers had come up with better comic business for them. As is often the case in todays raunchy comedies the filmmakers succumb to sentimentality near the end. (See Trainwreck for another example.) They arent willing to go all the way with the raucous juvenile jests that they favor. Some of the musical selections add wit that the script is missing. The studio is already contemplating sequels which is an even more frightening prospect than a ride on the rickety roller coaster at Walley World.

A rare reboot so foul and humorless it makes you question whatever attachment you might have to the original this lazy retread of Harold Ramiss 1983 Vacation sours everything thats made that film such an undying fixture of basic cable. Splitting the difference between a sequel and a remake this Vacation introduces the next generation of the hapless Griswold family by regurgitating the plot beats of the franchises first adventure. Rusty (Helms toxic) recognizing that his clan is in a rut decides to do the same thing his dad Clark (Chase awake) did when he was in this situation cram his wife (Applegate way too good for this) and kids into a car for a cross-country road trip to California theme park Walley World. These charmless characters are meant to learn that spending time with each other isnt so bad yet surviving 100 minutes with them is one of the great cinematic endurance tests of our time. Written and directed by Horrible Bosses scribes John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein Vacation evinces an overt appreciation for the original--the film treats Clarks Wagon Queen Family Truckster with hilarious reverence like its a valuable part of film history--but precious little understanding of why it worked. Whereas John Hughess script touched a nerve because he created a family that seemed like a funhouse mirror of your own this version is just a witless series of gross-out gags with Rustys wife projectile vomiting one minute and swimming in raw sewage the next. Mercifully theres also a steady stream of cameos as a reprieve from the insufferable cast (Hemsworth shines as Rustys emasculating brother-in-law) but nothing can save this cynical money-grab from its own shamelessness. At one point the Griswold gang watches in horror as a cow thoughtlessly eats the entrails of another cow. Prepare yourself to know just how they feel.

Given its pedigree -- writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein previously perpetrated the screenplays of ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" and both ""Horrible Bosses"" -- ""Vacation"" does occasionally spring to life delivering the kind of ouch-inducing humor of personal humiliation and bad luck that weve come to know from the ongoing adventures of the Griswold family. But while those laughs are welcome there arent quite enough of them to sustain the experience. See Video Vacation Spoof Commercial Advertises Griswold Familys 2015 Tartan Prancer Car (Video) Ed Helms stars as a grown-up Rusty Griswold who works as a pilot for a bargain-basement commuter airline that connects Chicago to far-off destinations like South Bend Indiana. (Its never mentioned that in his childhood photos he alternately looks like Anthony Michael Hall Jason Lively and Johnny Galecki from previous ""Vacation"" installments.) Feeling distanced from wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and sons James (Skyler Gisondo ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"") and Kevin (Steele Stebbins ""A Haunted House 2"") Rusty decides to pack the brood into a rented Albanian mini-van and schlep them cross-country to Wally World site of his never-forgotten teenage vacation. Also Read HBO Orders Funny or Dies The Gorburger Show Pilot Starring T.J. Miller He might never have forgotten the theme park part but clearly Rusty has mentally blocked the string of horrors and abasements to which his family was subjected back in the day because he stumbles wide-eyed into a new set of them from a ""Duel""-inspired trucker who seems to be in deadly pursuit to mistaking a sewage treatment area for a natural hot spring. Its a delicate balance to ask audiences to get invested in characters and also to enjoy their suffering and while many comedies have excelled at this sleight of hand Daley and Goldstein in their first outing as feature directors dont quite have the skill yet. Sometimes it works -- the family visits Debbies old sorority house where surprising secrets about her past clash with her current mom identity -- but more often than not the gags are either too dopey too predictable or too cringe-inducing to be genuinely funny. A game cast Helms and Applegate in particular often makes this material more successful than it has any right to be and the directors wisely pepper the film with comedic cameos which wont be spoiled here. Its no surprise that a little goes a long way Brief scenes involving a guided rafting trip through the Grand Canyon or hijinks at the Four Corners Monument play much better than a protracted one-joke visit to Rustys sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her swaggering weatherman husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth) in Texas. See Video I Am Chris Farley Trailer Features Humor Heartbreak Famous Friends (Video) ""Vacation"" wisely doesnt try to repeat the ""Parks closed the moose out front shoulda told ya"" climax of the original but it doesnt replace it with anything comparably memorable. By the time the Griswolds wrap up this trip youll feel like youve been subjected to someone elses slide show one that definitely featured some memorable moments but not enough to justify all that couch time.

July 27 2015 | 1113AM PT A new generation of Griswolds take to the highway in a miserably unfunny reboot of the venerable National Lampoon comedy franchise. Midway through ""Vacation"" the intrepid Griswold clan unwittingly takes a dip in a lake filled with human excrement which is roughly how most viewers will feel after enduring 90-odd minutes of this miserably unfunny mean-spirited and just plain wrong reboot of the much-loved 1980s and 90s National Lampoon comedy series. Corralling a new generation of family members for another ill-fated trek toward that theme-park mecca known as Walley World this new ""Vacation"" leans heavily on franchise nostalgia -- with multiple cover versions of Lindsay Buckinghams ""Holiday Road"" theme song and token cameos for original stars Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo -- but trades the earlier films endearing buffoonery for a cheap nastiness reminiscent of writers (and first-time directors) Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daleys ""Horrible Bosses."" A trip to the corner store with this cast of characters would be an endurance test -- which with any luck is as far as the movies box office returns will carry it. When he penned the script for the first ""Vacation"" (based on his National Lampoon short story ""Vacation 58"") the late John Hughes was riffing on his own memories of tumultuous family excursions in smoke-filled station wagons and of a suburban middle-class America that aspired to the gleaming perfection of the families in department-store Sunday circulars. Consisting of bickering but loving teenage siblings Rusty and Audrey impossibly patient mom Ellen and quixotic dad Clark (whose best-laid plans inevitably curdled) the Griswolds were like a live-action Flintstones or Simpsons (avant la lettre) and the good will of the first movie carried over into three lesser but enjoyable sequels (the best of which 1989s ""Christmas Vacation"" has since become a December perennial). But the Griswolds of the new ""Vacation"" really are the family from the Sunday circulars They seem to have met each other at a casting call a few minutes before the cameras rolled and the movie itself doesnt seem to like them very much. One good measure of whats off about Goldstein and Daleys approach comes right in the opening scene when the now-adult Rusty (Ed Helms) a pilot for a discount commuter airline takes an in-flight bathroom break leaving the plane in the hands of a senile co-pilot -- a gag that would feel gag-worthy even if it didnt arrive with the Germanwings disaster still making headlines. Another indicator comes a bit later when Goldstein and Daley give Rusty his own version of the first ""Vacations"" encounter between Clark and a Ferrari-driving babe (Christie Brinkley then Hannah Davis now) -- a scene in the new movie whose punchline is a violent head-on collision. Like the summers other tentpole movie set inside a fictional theme park ""Vacation"" shows us that it understands the burden of expectations that come with resurrecting an iconic franchise. ""Were not redoing anything. This will be completely different"" an exasperated Rusty assures his sons pint-sized bully Kevin (Steele Stebbins) and sensitive guitar-strumming James (Skyler Gisondo) in the course of explaining why hes decided to retrace the very route his own parents took to Walley World once upon a time. Unpersuaded the kids respond that theyve ""never even heard of the original vacation."" (A more direct nod to ""Jurassic World"" comes in the form of Walley Worlds newest and most popular roller coaster the Velociraptor.) From there ""Vacation"" proceeds as a scattershot mix of homage (a temperamental minivan known as the Tartan Prancer -- ""the Honda of Albania"" -- in place of the immortal Wagon Queen Family Truckster) and the sort of self-congratulatory vulgarity that seems to have spewed forth from the (junior high) locker room instead of the writers room. The Griswolds have endured a lot over the decades though this ""Vacation"" is the first one where theyve been road-raged by a pedophile truck driver and nearly taken over the falls by a suicidal river-rafting guide (Charlie Day). That generally depressive air is only compounded by watching so many gifted performers struggling to prop up such flaccid material (including no shortage of dick jokes gay jokes gender-identity jokes). The always game Christina Applegate such a spry comedienne in the ""Anchorman"" pics is utterly wasted here as Rustys long-suffering missus on hand mainly to projectile-vomit her way through a round of drunken sorority games during a visit to her Memphis alma mater. Still she escapes with slightly more dignity than does Chris Hemsworth on hand mainly to prance about in his skivvies as the vain Texas TV weatherman whos married Audrey (a similarly underused Leslie Mann). Least of all are Chase (looking frightfully bloated) and DAngelo (looking radiant at 63) whose 11th-hour appearances seem tacked on as a post-production afterthought. Key to the success of the ""Vacation"" movies was their underlying sweetness -- the sense that for all their foibles the Griswolds were a surprisingly functional lot. Families looked up at the screen and saw a version of themselves reflected back. Look at the new ""Vacation"" and all that stares back is a great comic void.

Jon Kramer says December 8 2015 at 1231 pm after a brief review on the revision I saved an evening to view the entire movie....personally I have a weird sense of humor....I have watched this movie from beginning to end TWICE and was not able to laugh at a single scene......SO i asked the rest of the family for their opinion .....GUESS WHAT....They came up with the same answer.....NOT ONE FUNNY LINE.....Stupid lines and bad joke but nothing really FUNNY Like in the original 3 versions....If you must pay to see this movieSAVE YOUR MONEY.....If it is FREE ....TRY IT....YOULL HATE IT....GUARENTEED Reply Alex Vantaggiato says December 1 2015 at 1110 am I dont understand why people didnt find this movie funny. It was hilarious from beginning to end and was in line with the raunchy humor of the original. I watched it with my wife and two kids (11 an 14) and loved it. Given I rented it on Redbox and didnt pay the full movie price so maybe thats why I felt it was worth it. I think its ridiculous that some people are commenting on the ""Violence"" and ""Vulgarity"" of this movie; the fact that this family is out of control is one of the funniest things about it plus the movie is rater R so what do you expect? Loosen up and dont take everything so seriously. Its good family movie if youre kids are not sheltered bumpkins. Reply Suz says November 18 2015 at 833 pm I was just appalled by the constant profanity during the entire movie and while I dont mind an occasional word thrown in here and there this was horrible ... and using the ""mother f"" word over and over....... ugh NOT FUNNY I mean putting a plastic shopping bag over his brothers head and trying to suffocate him? how is that funny? I loved the original movies and have watched them many many times I really expected this movie to be more like those..... it isnt anything like those.... I was so disappointed... sorry I watched it at all....... Reply Shawn says November 8 2015 at 610 pm This could have been a good movie but they messed it up real real bad by putting all the profanity and violence in it what were these film makers thinking just adding more stupidity to this world what happened to good family values? Not funny at all a total waste of time shows very bad behavior dont watch it Reply Tiffany Campbell says September 6 2015 at 947 pm I dont understand how these people were ever allowed to make such a vulgar movie? How was it ever allowed to be released for the general public to see? Is this suposed to portray how families function in todays society? My family and I as well as others around us were truly disgusted It is so sad that directors think that in order for a movie to be ""funny"" it has to contain so much vulgarity. Visually and verbally. Why lower our I.Q.s and influence the public by leading examples like this one? It it truly an insult to our intelligence and an insult to the movie it was supposedly mimicking. We give this movie ""Vacation"" the biggest thumbs down possible It should be wiped off the face of the Earth Please warn others especially with children not to watch this obscene movie Thank you. Reply Emmanuel says May 27 2016 at 437 am Totally agree This movie is an insult to the families should be banned Dont wast your money and precious time Reply Lyndon Hollar says August 30 2015 at 316 pm Vacation a relaunch no one demanded hits the road hoping to revive t ff8 he same spirit of family unity and hi-jinks of the beloved series starring Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo instead takes a wrong turn and gets lost on Painfully Unfunny Junction. Pretty glad I didn t bother clicking on that article ? Reply Jan says August 22 2015 at 622 pm Worse vulgar foul movie Ive seen. Walked out 15 minutes into movie. Its a shame someone would produce a movie like that and put young actors in that setting. Terrible Reply x says August 21 2015 at 1157 am excusame this is a reboot or remake Reply Mig says August 21 2015 at 1019 am Its a different world than 30 years ago. Get out of the past and embrace the present. Geezer. Reply derrickcon says August 17 2015 at 712 pm Very funny movie writer obviously has no clue Reply M.K. Hodge says August 15 2015 at 540 pm After enduring a very painful 30 mins if this God awful movie me and my husband my three grandkids a nd son in law walked out. There is absolutely nothing ""cute"" about a kidwho curses every other word. There is also nothing funny about dropping the f-bomb every five mins. I dont find it funny to see someone getting drunk and then throwing up. And I wont even get started on my grandkids seeing two women kissing. This was a horrible terrible disgusting excuse of a movie. Im glad the theatre gave me my money back to see a different movie. Reply Emmanuel says May 27 2016 at 438 am Totally agree This movie is an insult to the families should be banned Dont wast your money and precious time Reply derrickcon says August 17 2015 at 710 pm Genius its an R rated comedy. Its not supposed to be ""cute"" Reply Thomas says August 13 2015 at 1040 pm One of the highest compliments I can pay the movie is that theres no penalty for people who have not seen the original movies. Reply Marie says August 12 2015 at 1151 am We hated the movie. We agree with all the negative reviews. Although the bigger picture here is that we cannot imagine how Screen Actors Guild gets away with allowing under aged child actors to spew disgusting ""R"" rated dialog. And that unnecessary and disgusting nudity in the film. This was ""thought"" to be a family movie...NOT To believe that the child in the film didnt see the film in its entirety is very difficult to swallow. SAG is subjecting child actors to pornography. This was supposed to be a major movie...we can only imagine what other R rated movies are out there involving child actors. Very very disappointed in SAG and the parents of those child actors and EVERYONE involved in filming this trash. Reply donna says August 12 2015 at 837 am This movie was horrible The original vacation movies are funny and the whole family can enjoy. not the case with the new vacation. they have ruined the original film. this is more like Uncle Eddies kids than Rustys. Left the movie early couldnt watch the entire film because it was so bad the foul mouth kid is unbelievable and they took this movie in the wrong direction so disappointed Reply The Doctor says August 12 2015 at 1219 am Worst movie ever......... Reply Brittany James says August 7 2015 at 934 pm DONT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY. This movie was terrible. Is this seriously what cinema comedy has come to? Its not even funny. Just unrealistic and dumb. Cow cannibalsim really? Cow explosion? Im not even offended at the foul language just disappointed that this is what the writers and directors came up with. Such a let down. Wish I had gone shopping instead. Reply Sav Lio says August 9 2015 at 348 am Vacation is a poor taste in comedy Dont waste your money and time to see this movie. I read the reviews but wanted to make my own judgement. The foul language of the kid is terrible.Is this what our society has gotten to? Wrapping ones head in plastic bag is not comedy. There is nothing sweet about this. Head on deadly collision - comedy? wow. warped sense of humor. I could go on and on. But I think you get the point. Reply Deborah Shore Reavis says August 2 2015 at 558 am Please do not see this movie. My son (30 years old) I went to see the movie. This movie is terrible. The language and other scenes in the movie is very disappointing. We saw the movie in Winston Salem North Carolina. Within a few minutes several people got up and started walking out of the movie. We continued watching the movie for a few more minutes - thinking it has got to get better WRONG We were DEFINATETY DISAPOINTED  We wasted our money on this movie  Reply Bo Bixbie says August 1 2015 at 1214 pm I saw the movie last night. The theater was about three quarters full and the audience was laughing loudly throughout the entire film. At times you missed some lines of dialogue because the laughing continued well after the punchline was delivered. Whenever references were made to the original Vacation there were claps and cheers. Walking out of the theater I heard most people reciting lines from the movie and laughing. Reply Danny says July 31 2015 at 326 pm True if you want a wholesome movie teaching good old family values this is not the movie for you. But if you want an R-rated (yes that should offer some hints) with really good actors and just silly fun this IS a great movie for that. No 3D crazy effects just silly fun (like the writers have proved they could do in previous movies) with some fun homages to the original movies. And great on the mark cameos. Theres a reason why people next to me were laughing non-stop if you have the right idea about what the movie will be it is a great movie Reply Rex says August 2 2015 at 800 pm Sorry Danny NOT a great movie at all. And if a movie with FOUR predecessors forces you to LOWER you standards as much as you did just to tolerate it with a theatre part-full of like-minded sheep then it doesnt deserve to be called VACATION and lazily ride the coat tails of a classic. Just because something is old doesnt mean its collectively forgotten to such a degree that any franchise reboot automatically earns the right to pander to the most basic dim witted instincts in todays indiscriminate audiences with cheap and easy R-rated schtick. This one will be forgotten soon enough. The box office returns have already seen to that. ;-) Reply Brittany James says August 7 2015 at 938 pm Youre absolutely right Rex. Im amazed that anyone actually finds humor/entertainment in this movie. Complete lack of creativity in my opinion. Jackie Hulbert says July 29 2015 at 524 pm Was so looking forward to Vacation update. Unfortunately the first vulgar words spewing out of a 10 year olds mouth just really undid me. Mom said sush and Dad kept his mouth shut - come on really? So not funny people. In addition I would suggest that the writer director and producers stay out of all truck lanes in the future Reply Marie says July 28 2015 at 1132 am Being a child who grew up with the original VACATION movies I have seen the trailer to this one and it does not appeal to me. Something about Ed Helms is just not funny. I think they should have used the actor who played Rusty in VEGAS VACATION Ethan Embry. He has always had that sweet self-deprecating personality that would work much better for this movie. Reply Ivan Sicardo says July 27 2015 at 1129 pm I too have done a review for this film on my site but I wont be publishing it until tomorrow. I believe audiences will love this film. Having been to multiple screenings since the beginning half of the month I have caught the reactions of most audience members I have eavesdropped on their comments struck up little conversations with them to hear what they thought of the film and up until now I have to say your whole review does not even come close to what the general movie going audience thinks about the film. Unfortunately your point of view seems to stem from everything you know from the original franchise you expect it to be building on the other movies but fail to see that it is indeed a whole new Vacation in itself. Leans heavily on nostalgia? Sure to those whove seen the original. In fact its not too much different from the original but it is updated to fit the times and its also a little ridiculous. Thats what makes it appealing. Reply Rex says August 2 2015 at 807 pm Hey Ivan why dont you admit that a minor blogger who attends multiple screenings of a single film just to gauge audience reaction eavesdrop their conversations and actually strike up chats with these strangers about the film just to have what they foolishly believe is retaliatory evidence against any and all critics who dislike it is a flaming psychopath desperately in need of either a job or a hobby or both. Or a liar. Reply tammy says July 28 2015 at 321 pm Tel is totally obsessed. Judd Apatow is that you? Trainwreck is amazing too dont worry. Reply Tel... says July 30 2015 at 148 pm LOL..Obsessed? Have you seen the efforts the studio trolls are going to to slience anyone saying this film looks abysmal? You included? Pravda...is that you? Tel... says July 28 2015 at 802 am Actually Ivan Scott Foundas point of view seems to stem from the idea that he saw a really bad movie and then posted his review. The defenders of this film on this board are fascinating....youd think they just saw this generations Citizen Kane theyre just gushing over it. Youve eavesdropped on conversations of people whove seen the film and you can report that they all loved it without exception...gosh what an amazing coincidence ""pondwatch"" thinks its the sweetest movie committed to film since ET and hes a prude and saw no sexualizing of children in it..because you know..all children want to know about ""rim jobs"" and ""glory holes"" right?. ""legallybrunette"" works for another studio (natch) but she thinks this movie will become a family classic no less. You seeing pattern here at all ""Ivan""? Reply Tel... says July 30 2015 at 138 pm Fangirl....the fact that you actually bothered to give your critique of Citizen Kane rather than understand how its used to juxtapose with subsequent films and their level of quality tells me all I need to know about who Im dealing with here. The juvenile LOVE YOU JOHN DALY and the inane smiley face at the end of it cemented that perception. You and your college roommates (because apparently you felt the compulsion to tell me about them for some strange reason) all have my sympathy. Does it dawn on you that people just think that this attempt to resurrect the Vacation movie series stinks and just doesnt deliver? No seriously....can you fathom that a movie can look like it stinks and you know...actually does stink? Ask one of your roommates how they feel on the subject. (insert puerile smiley face here). fangirl says July 28 2015 at 316 pm Notice all the comments youve posted Tel. Youre obsessed with bringing this movie down. If it was actually bad you wouldnt have to try so hard ;) Agree w/ Ivans comment. These negative comment (amp; above review) are from old people who are way to attached to the old Vacation films to appreciate anything new. I totally get it. My first college roommate was the best chick ever And because of that the next one (no matter how hard she tried to be friends w/ me amp; how sweet she was) never measured up. Feel bad thinking about it... But judging the new ""Vacation"" the way you all are is like that. Its so wrong. Especially because this movie is so great And speaking as a millennial I believe this film is going to go down in history as a real favorite of everyone from my generation Daley amp; Goldstein are getting to write the Spiderman reboot for a reason ) fangirl says July 28 2015 at 309 pm Citizen Kane is one of the most boring movies ever. This generations Citizens Kane? haha Yeah Im sure theyd write something like that if they were less talented. Thank god that is not the case. LOVE YOU JOHN DALEY amp; JOHN GOLDSTEIN Was in tears at the premiere D Ivan Sicardo says July 28 2015 at 1117 am Well its definitely not going to be a family classic since it does carry an R rating but very much has the potential to be a classic comedy. I also didnt say the everybody loved it but that most people who have seen it did love it. Clearly you dont think that this is your type of film and theres nothing wrong with that because every movie is subjective. Shawna Waldron says July 27 2015 at 904 pm Tell us how you really feel..... Reply Lucky says July 27 2015 at 712 pm Well thats disappointing and very possibly bad news bears for the new Spiderman which is being written by these fellas Reply pondwatch says July 27 2015 at 430 pm this movie is amazing what are you critics on? smh. but to daley amp; goldstein in case youre actually bothering to read these reviews dont let it get you down remember what they say about michael bay? its happening to you )And so Id take it as the ultimate compliment if I were you. If I loved your movie as much as I do others are gonna love it that much too And at the end of the day as some comment below said if critics knew what they were talking about they wouldnt be critics but actually doing your job. You guys are on fire RESPECT Reply David says July 27 2015 at 424 pm So they took a light fun madcap comedy and turned into mean and nasty. Genius. Pure genius I gotta tell ya. Reply pondwatch says July 27 2015 at 441 pm the movies actually really sweet. and if youd seen it youd know that. are you seriously making comments based off some biased review? Reply Rex says June 7 2016 at 1037 am Thought Id check back into this comments section for giggles now that this movie is literally forgotten to the ages already was not a hit in any way shape or form and did not become a family or comedy classic. Boy do sheeple like pondwatch legallybrunette fangirl and Ivan Sicardo the creepy theater eavesdropper look pathetic in hindsight. Not that they didnt look pathetic back then but at least one could argue that time would tell. Well that options off the table now and Vacation has been certified beyond reproach as a mean-spirited justly-marginalized dud and these silly idiots-especially the millennials among them-have thoroughly lived up to the stereotypes of shallowness and inexperience most commonly used against them. Jimmy Rodgers says July 27 2015 at 145 pm legallybrunette This is going to be utterly painful for those to watch. Cmon Sue you guys should have shelved this POS the minute it was pitched. Reply legallybrunette says July 27 2015 at 211 pm Yeah its gonna be painful. Pain from laughing so much beatitbob Reply legallybrunette says July 27 2015 at 105 pm SCOTT FOUNDAS TAKE YOUR STUPID ARTICLE BACK. The script came in as a writing sample at my office amp; it was literally one of the best things Ive ever read Maybe the real problem is that you just dont have a basic sense of humor. Ever consider that? I mean really... ""Cheap nastiness""?? The only thing related to this movie that is cheap amp; nasty is the crap above - written by you. Youre welcome. (P.S. Hidden agenda much?) Reply Rex says August 2 2015 at 815 pm You know the appreciation of good film criticism has reached a new low when people pretend to be studio script readers in order to feel superior to a legitimate critic. Utterly pathetic. Reply jerry says July 27 2015 at 126 pm You cant handle the truth. Reply Chuck Ungar says July 27 2015 at 126 pm So whats your job at Warner Bros legallybrunette? Publicist? Reply Rex says August 2 2015 at 817 pm She has no job. Anywhere. warner bros publicist says July 27 2015 at 444 pm Hahaha. Loving this  Tel... says July 27 2015 at 234 pm Ease up on the hyperbole there ""legallybrunette"" youre making that ""but I work at a competing studio"" line very unbelievable. legallybrunette says July 27 2015 at 210 pm if it came in as a writing sample obviously its most likely coming from outside. but i work at a competing studio just to clear that up. and the truth jerry? the truth is that the writing was hilarious. and that goldstein amp; daley are two of the best screenwriters in hollywood at the moment. MARK MY WORDS. this movie is going down in history as a beloved film. maybe not by a few critics (aka ppl who dont have enough talent to write scripts/books themselves and so basically just write about other peoples stuff).. But it will be beloved by the people ) I look forward to it being played over and over on Comedy Central in a year or two. Btw publicist? Really? Is that the best you can do? Take a moment to let this sink in Chuckko. Im just a little fan ) And Hollywood is fueled entirely by people like me. Tel... says July 27 2015 at 1144 am When I saw shorts for this ""film"" in the movie theaters it was one awful joke after another that fixated on sexualizing the Griswold children. The children were seen asking about ""rimming"" and ""glory holes"" ad nauseum. I noticed for the TV spots they decided to keep those jokes out and instead focused on the nostalgia they want to evoke. For simply sexualizing the children in this film it should be avoided at all costs....its a putrid mess. Reply warner bros publicist says July 27 2015 at 447 pm Sorry Meant to comment on the thread above. But loving all of this. But you wanna know what I love more? gt;gt;gt; VACATION Great movie guys. Go and see it. And decide whether or not you agree with Mr. Foundas for yourselves. (My bet is that youre going to love it) Reply Rex says June 7 2016 at 1044 am Boy Im betting ""Warner bros publicist"" aka ""legalllybrunette"" sure feels like a dumbass now that her beloved Vacation travesty turned out to be a box office BOMB did NOT become any kind of comedy classic NOR go down in history as a beloved film and has been lost to the dustbin (or Walmart bargain bin) of time. Such a pathetic shill and not even a paid one who actually worked for the studio. Just a fan PRETENDING to be someone who mattered. Shame shell never have to justify her masturbatory fantasies but what can you do. Sav Lio says August 9 2015 at 356 am Plain and simple..THE MOVIE SUCKS. Dont waste your money at the box office. Tel... says July 30 2015 at 145 pm I dont care where you meant to comment...your suggestion was silly. Tell you what...Well wait for it to hit TV then decide if we like it. You wanna know what I love?gt;gt;gt;My money not being wasted on drek like VACATION Tel... says July 28 2015 at 808 am yeah nice sleight of hand warner bos publicist...pay the money for the ticket hike up box office sales THEN decide whether you agree with Foundas or not. Dont wait for it to hit TV or Netflix etc...pay now..right? Then if it stinks youve still got ticket sales numbers to quote so as to justify the all-too-obvious franchise aspirations of the studio for this soul less drek. bae says July 27 2015 at 1254 pm um hey tel... its rated R for a reason. youre a putrid Moron the jokes are fantastic. and dont act like the original national lampoon film was scripted by the pope. its was super raunchy as well. grow the  up amp; stop writing stupid comments. thanks. Reply Tel... says July 28 2015 at 753 am LOL...yes of course ""pondwatch""...youre considered a prude therefore you are to be taken at your word and not as some studio troll trying to prevent this noxious little movie from losing money. No kids were exploited you say? Yes thats why I saw kids on the shorts for this film asking about ""rim jobs"" and ""glory holes""..because you know thats not exploiting and sexualizing children in any way right? So in short...I shouldnt believe my lying eyes and just believe you right ""pondwatch""? Oh and I appreciate your attempt to silence any dissent by telling me not to post on this board...but I believe we still have freedom of speech in this country...at least for now right? pondwatch says July 27 2015 at 439 pm sexualizing children? really? are you crazy? next time try watch the movie before making such slanderous charges. theres a million times more sexualization of children on abc family. or on boy meets world or gossip girl. those adorable (amp; talented as heck) little kids were not exploited in ANY WAY. and thats coming from someone who everyone calls a prude. dont mess around on this comment board biotch. smh Tel... says July 27 2015 at 224 pm really bae? So an R rating makes sexualizing children perfectly fine with you does it? Wow...just wow. Andy Dursin (theaisleseatcom) says July 27 2015 at 151 pm The original VACATION isnt ""super raunchy"". It was R rated but made at a time when there wasnt a PG-13. Beyond one or two jokes the film is completely tame unlike most every vulgar comedy we see these days. This VACATION is obviously like every other lame Hollywood reboot we have going -- needless heartless and crass. I hope it crashes and burns. Bert Q says July 27 2015 at 1140 am First Ghostbusters now Vacation. We can only say no and spend the 11 elsewhere. Reply Pixworks says July 27 2015 at 108 pm You cant judge Ghostbusters yet its still a year away. Plus Ghostbusters is in much better hands (the director of Spy and Bridesmaids is directing) than Vacation was. Reply Cindylover1969 says July 27 2015 at 1137 am ""Another indicator comes a bit later when Goldstein and Daley give Rusty his own version of the first ""Vacations"" encounter between Clark and a Ferrari-driving babe (Christie Brinkley then Hannah Davis now) -- a scene in the new movie whose punchline is a violent head-on collision."" Isnt watching beautiful women get killed in car crashes HILARIOUS? Im reliably informed that bit was in the trailer - never mind skipping the movie I never want to see the trailer. Reply legallybrunette says July 27 2015 at 217 pm Oh chill out feminist Cindy. Im a girl and yes I thought that scene actually was actually really hilarious. I do thing the earlier car scene though is the funniest of all. When the little brother puts the bag over the others head. Freeeeeeking brilliant. But once again its rated R and not PG for a reason. If this movie is too much for you to handle you can always go watch Minions. (Which is also a work of genius Not in any way intended to belittle Minions w/ that last part. I think its such a cute amp; clever little movie) Reply Rex says August 2 2015 at 821 pm How lonely you must be. Eathan Edwards says July 27 2015 at 1124 am Simply put....An embarrassment. The Vacation series from the 80s was one of the great franchises. As much as the National Lampoon name has fallen in the decades since its lucky that the name is not attached to this waste. Harold Ramis and John Hughes must be turning over in their graves. Reply Chris Etrata says July 27 2015 at 1136 am With these writers doing the new spiderman film all hope is lost. Reply Tel... says July 27 2015 at 232 pm Why do I get the impression that ""legallybrunette"" works for this movies production in some capacity? legallybrunette says July 27 2015 at 109 pm Shut up Chris Etrata. Morons who blindly jump onto bandwagons are the reason things like ISIS exist. Have you seen Vacation? Have you read the script? Because the writing is genius. The guy who wrote this review is obviously up to something that has more to do w/ business politics than doing his job honestly. stevenkovacs says July 27 2015 at 1122 am Why? Why?
