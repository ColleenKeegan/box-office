The Girl Who Played With Fire << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Manning-Brady Face-off  Next Week 13 College Football Viewing Guide Not All Bits Have Equal Value Courtesy Murray Close Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities The Girl Who Played With Fire On the excellent Hunger Games sequel by Wesley Morris on November 22 2013 Its fair to show up for the second of these Hunger Games movies and feel confused. Girls are shrieking -- for scrappy Peeta and hunky Gale and the recently arrived pretty boy Finnick; for every kiss Katniss Everdeen plants on one of them; for the scene in which a brazen new Hunger Games contestant played by Jena Malone enters an elevator strips naked arrives at her floor then exits. Its an amusingly frisky encounter and it happens only hours before 24 people are dropped by the government into an artificial war zone and expected to slay each other for the nations entertainment. So its confusing. How can a movie be this good when it brings George Orwell so close to Aaron Spelling? Because it brings George Orwell this close to Aaron Spelling thats how. The Hunger Games Catching Fire is based on the middle entry in Suzanne Collinss trio of dystopic novels. And it isnt the threat of camp that makes this second movie an improvement over its interesting but stultifying 2012 predecessor. Its the threat of insurgency and reprisal. This new movie makes you believe that its building toward something explosive and that whatever it is (revolution apocalypse consummation) matters for the movies characters. This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movies kick of confidence. In fact the final image made me consider doing something Ive never wanted to do with any of these franchise series start standing in line for the next two. (Yes Lionsgate is on-trend; the final book has been split in half.) In Collinss novel the United States as we know it has been obliterated. The new country called Panem is now comprised of a dozen districts of varying poverty ruled by the Capitol a bastion of excess opulence technological advancement and cruelty nestled were told amid the Rocky Mountains. As punishment for a long-ago uprising the Capitol instituted the annual Hunger Games in which every district drafts two tweens or teens (theyre called tributes) to fight to the death on live television. There can be only one victor except in the first movie in which there were two. Catching Fire begins with the winners -- Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) -- visiting the towns of the young players they vanquished. Its the Tribute to the Tributes eulogy tour. The thrust of the new movie is that mean old President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears how much the Panemanians identify with Katniss who took the place of her younger sister in the 74th games. Maybe she could start a revolution that topples the Capitol. In one of the most strangely loaded scenes Ive seen in any movie all year Katniss offers her condolences to the families of the two black tributes. When shes done one old man raises his arm and extends three fingers. Its Collinss salute of revolution. But here it has an unmistakable black power tinge. The Capitols military storm troopers promptly blow his brains out. Later they lock Katnisss strapping white boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to a whipping post and lash him. The easy use of oppression iconography is disturbing without being sensationalistic or egregious. It helps that in some theaters 12 Years a Slave will be playing in the house next door lessening the likelihood that what happened to Gale will be mistaken for science fiction. In any case to further punish Katniss and calm the people President Snow calls for a very special Hunger Games the third Quarter Quell. Two of each districts previous winners lose their promised immunity and are thrown into a new round of killing. For a lot of the movie President Snow bearded maned and gray (he looks like the stone lion thats stationed outside important buildings) sits around with Plutarch Heavensbee the flagrantly named new game designer played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. These two are cartoon villains who dont know theyre cartoons. So as they plot how to discredit Katniss if not destroy her outright you can feel your blood boil. They hate her. We hate them. Collins writes in a manner friendly to movies. The ball is on the tee for a filmmaker to knock it out of the park. But you have to believe in the material for it to work. The first film which Gary Ross adapted and directed was both rushed and logy. He was either too close to this assignment or not close enough. So you could feel that awful modern creative phenomenon that compromises if not ruins so much mass movie entertainment the pressure to please both the readers and the bean counters at the studio. With the first film you never felt that you were watching a movie. Francis Lawrence the director of Catching Fire is a smarter choice because what you need with a film like this is an egoless visualist. This is Collinss show. Why complicate that? Lawrence came to prominence as a midtier music video director. He wasnt an auteur in the David Fincher-Hype Williams-Michel Gondry sense but he did handsome flattering work. It was the same story at the movies (Constantine Water for Elephants the very good I Am Legend). If theres a problem with his movies its not at all how they look. For Catching Fire Lawrence makes every shot look deliberate and expensive. He understands what say low angles and less editing can do for say Elizabeth Banks who plays Katniss and Peetas flamboyant chaperone. Shes built a real brittle character out of eye rolls throwaway lines and the amazing costumes of Trish Summerville who should take a bow at the end of almost every scene (the clothes are inspired by the likes of Rick Owens Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood). Seeing the kabuki body language Banks has come up with adds new comedy to her performance. No longer does she seem like a nightmare drag queen. Standing out amid the dirt and drabness of Katnisss coal-mining district she seems like an affluent woman wearing layers of institutional denial. Lawrences years of shooting Janet Jackson Britney Spears Alanis Morissette Destinys Child Shakira and Jennifer Lopez serve him well here. He knows where to put the camera and trusts his actors do their jobs. There are a few memorable close-ups but there are also a number of group shots in which each person in the frame gets to tell a piece of the story simply by how they lean or cock their head. This might not sound like much. But how much filmmaking can you recall in any of the Twilight movies? Lawrence didnt write this film. The sharp navigable frequently funny script is credited to Simon Beaufoy (assorted Danny Boyle movies including Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine Toy Story 3 Brave). Neither of them was crazy enough to overthink this. Collins has done the strategizing and has espoused a worldview. They just have to realize it. The new filmmakers have a great advantage over Ross who struggled to set things up and make the killing spree something youd dread watching as opposed to merely a chore to sit through. To be fair no one short of the Japanese director Kinji Fukasaku would leap at the chance to make a movie in which 24 kids knock each other off. So the first film had to cheat and the cheating made things stultifying. I always wanted to know what the ratings were for the 74th games. Whod sit through night after night of that? The advantage of this second film is that the participants of the third Quarter Quell are mostly adults including Jeffrey Wright Amanda Plummer and Lynn Cohen. Back from the first movie are Woody Harrelson as Katniss and Peetas alcoholic mentor; Lenny Kravitz as her wardrobe specialist; and Stanley Tucci as the intensely shallow Hunger Games emcee. And its this collection of good actors taking their roles just seriously enough that helps you take the movie seriously. This isnt something a 14-year-old would care about -- for them theres Malone and Sam Claflin as the pathological flirts Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair -- but theres a big difference between watching child actors think about what it means to kill and how a grown-up veteran performs that ambivalence. Adding Wright Plummer and Hoffman to the mix raises the stakes. Its true that the televised Hunger Games passage -- with its killer baboons toxic fog and other deadly contraptions -- makes no sense after the movies big plot twist. But its suspenseful and exciting thanks to the ingenuity of the writing the characters and the actors playing them. Of course if were being honest Jennifer Lawrence is all wrong for this part. Katniss isnt quite passive but she gathers strength cunning and fearlessness as she goes. Lawrence comes preassembled with those traits. Shes all bravery -- here emphasizing the characters fierce protective instincts. In all her roles shes best when shes charging at you either physically or emotionally. Theres nothing yet thats internal about her. The key to her stardom is the reckless bluntness that was always Julia Robertss secret weapon. So a movie about a woman whose directness is being suppressed doesnt cry out for Lawrence. But she wasnt a star when she took this part she was lucky. And we get it The Capitol is threatening the lives of Katnisss family and everyone else she loves. But now you watch Lawrence and wonder why she doesnt just tell President Snow to go fuck himself. That of course is the thrill of the films cliffhanger of a final shot. You believe she will.

"The Hunger Games Catching Fire - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Hunger Games Catching Fire Posted by Christy Lemire on November 24 2013 10 Comments Lionsgate PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language. Running time 146 minutes. Three stars out of four. Heres how effective ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is I read the book its based on I knew what was going to happen yet still found myself getting caught up in the action the suspense the twists. And I still found myself sighing a longing ""awww"" at the flims cliffhanger ending even though I knew it was coming. Director Francis Lawrences film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly it leaves you wanting more. As the second film adaptation of Suzanne Collins best-selling ""Hunger Games"" trilogy ""Catching Fire"" is in the potentially awkward position of simultaneously serving as a placeholder and moving the action and characters along of providing audiences with a substantive and satisfying ride while still teasing the climactic finale to come. And it achieves all this with both style and emotional heft and only a tad bit of lagging or padding. Taking over for Gary Ross who directed last years original ""Hunger Games"" Lawrence keeps the action buzzing briskly while also providing a clearer and more daunting sense of the totalitarian regime that has kept the citizens of dystopian futuristic Panem cowering in poverty and fear. Images from the individual districts are gritty bleak and sometimes gruesomely bloody while the towering Art Deco Capitol appears more awesomely over the top than ever thanks to improved special effects. But as the title suggests a spark has ignited among the people and Katniss Everdeen is the one who lit it. Once again Jennifer Lawrence serves as the formidable force at the center of this strange and dangerous world. Her Katniss is fierce but vulnerable mature beyond her years but accessible in her youthful vitality. By now we know that Lawrence can do pretty much anything from comedy and romance to drama and action. Fresh off her showy Oscar-winning turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" here she must function as a savior and symbol of hope a responsibility her character initially is reluctant to accept. At the end of ""The Hunger Games"" Katniss and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson vaguely more assertive this time) have cheated the system and both emerged as champions. Now theyre forced to travel the ravaged country on a victory tour an uncomfortable mix of propaganda-filled celebration and sorrowful remembrance of the fallen. At each stop Katniss must pretend to be in love with Peeta to please the suspicious President Snow (a chilling Donald Sutherland) although her heart belongs back home with her hunky childhood best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth little-used aside from one powerful scene). Along for the ride as always is the duos unflappably upbeat escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) who strains to keep them on message even as revolution rears its head wherever they go. Banks once again gets to wear a colorful array of truly inspired and garish costumes but she also gets to show some humanity and complex emotions as her true loyalties to Katniss and Peeta begin to shine through. Also accompanying them is the last Hunger Games winner from District 12 the perpetually inebriated but resourceful Haymitch (Woody Harrelson whos also afforded more shadings this time in the script from Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt). But just when they thought they were out President Snow pulls Katniss and Peeta back in. For the 75th Hunger Games -- the third Quarter Quell as its known -- he announces hes assembling previous winners to fight each other to the death in the arena. His new gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) promises to make the competition more difficult than ever before since hes dealing with more skilled players. Hoffman delivers a deadpan monologue in that deep rich voice of his in which he lays out his strategy for the president; its simultaneously hilarious and frightening and a great example of how excellent supporting casting helps elevate a film like this beyond the young-adult genre. Along those lines Stanley Tucci dazzles once more as the purple-pompadoured game show host who schmoozes the contestants and pumps up the audience. Hes wonderfully flamboyant (and a much-needed source of humor) but again hes only a notch above the typical television personality in terms of perkiness. And Lenny Kravitz brings warmth and earthiness once more to the role of Cinna Katniss stylist and confidant. (Real-life costume designer Trish Summerville truly outdoes herself this time especially with Katniss glittering transforming wedding dress. Its a stunner of a moment on live TV for all the world to see.) The prelude is so fraught the games themselves almost feel like a relief by comparison even though so many lives are at stake. Among the clever challenges that await these Hunger Games all-stars poisonous fog rampaging baboons and thick bloody rain. The competitors realization as to how to outsmart the system is a great a-ha moment. But what all these alliances and schemes are in service of is the real zinger and the promise of more dark thrills to come.

Having only read the first book of the series I was not prepared for various dramatic underpinings that would catapult me into this dystopian drama on so many levels of engagement. My goal is now to read the third book in the trilogy MOCKING JAY so as to help aleviate some of the suspense of what happens next to these characters Ive invested so much time with both on screen and off. Regretfully the final book will be split into two filmed scenarios so as to squeeze as much financial gain as possible from this blockbuster series. It is my understanding that Francis Lawrence has been assigned once again the same duties to direct the finale of the Hunger Games series which was a good decision on Lionsgates part. Reply November 28 2013  by  Nandi     Yes the ending is unexpected and not explained well.we as a viewer would love to stick to our chairs for 10 more mins .why shown so hurry to end the movie.Truly the ending wasted the chsrm of entire movie. Reply November 29 2013  by  Dengakuman     I agree; I was really enjoying the film and while it was a bit long I felt the final scene was so hectic I was a little confused as to what actually happened. Its my only real complaint and as a viewer I was invested enough that I would have actually been happy to see more of it. Reply February 1 2014  by  Levi     The reason the ending is abrupt and confusing is because that is the same way it happens in the books. It ends leaving you wanting more wanting know what happened. If you want to be alleviated of your confusion youll either have to wait for the next film or read the final book. I thought the ending was great and true to the books. Reply December 7 2013  by  Clai     so Right to this point. I felt up to the ending that it was perhaps the best movie I have seen in some time. However the ending left me with such a incomplete feeling I felt that it would be my review to wait for the next movie before seeing this. Its great theater but tot a great movie per say. Reply January 10 2014  by  Ernie_jena     Great movie with 2 flaws in it. They shouldve shown the removal of the tracker by Johanna from Katniss and the captivity of Johanna and Peeta by the Capitol. This is a more important thing to show in a movie than just by saying it i mean youre watching a movie not reading a book. Reply November 27 2013  by  Rush sangs     Such a well written review. Truly awestruck by Mr. Roys words. Compels me to watch the movie with even more curiosity and impatience. Great review Reply January 10 2014  by  Ernie_jena     Please people its a nice review BUT there is NO bloodrain scene in the movie only the result of itYou only see Johanna Mason covered in blood thats all. So Christy Lemire which version did you see then? Reply November 27 2013  by  Rush sangs     My apologies. Christy lemire. I was looking at the comment instead of the review author  Reply March 23 2014  by  Laken     I love this movie love drama and a lot of action it got a great review to  Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

But they were games.""This is the warning offered to Katniss Everdeen by a frostily whiskered President Snow early in The Hunger Games Catching Fire the sequel to the 2012 franchise opener. But it works pretty well too as a critique of the first film and a promise that this one will be better. Which it is better directed better scripted better cast. Perhaps most important Catching Fire does a more faithful job of capturing the grim vision of Suzanne Collinss source novels than its rather tepid predecessor. This movie feels hungry.To recap Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a resident of District 12 an impoverished mining province held in thrall by a remote and tyrannical Capitol. Every year in punishment for a past rebellion the Capitol requires all 12 districts under its rule to supply two teenage ""tributes""--one girl and one boy--to participate in the Hunger Games a televised to-the-death tournament with only one survivor. In the previous movie Katniss was selected to represent District 12 along with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) a sweet young baker who also happened to be in love with her. Pretending to love him back Katniss succeeded in engineering a scenario whereby both she and Peeta were allowed to survive the Games.Related Story Designing The Hunger Games Which brings us to the present film. Katniss and Peeta now celebrities as a result of their (genuine) win and (counterfeit) romance are preparing to act as show ponies for the Capitol on a nationwide ""victory tour"" when President Snow (Donald Sutherland) waltzes in with his warning. While most of the viewing public may have been taken in by Katnisss show of love in the Games Snow explains he recognized it for what it was an act of defiance. And he was not alone. There are embers of unrest flaring up across the districts and many would like to hold Katniss up as a symbol of their rebellion. Anything she does that might encourage this association Snow threatens will result in dire consequences for her family and her district.Thus are the stakes set Be a good girl and no one gets hurt (at least beyond the customary pains and privations inflicted by the Capitol). Be a bad girl ...Anyone familiar with the books the movies or the obligations of blockbuster cinema will have no difficulty guessing which path Katniss winds up taking. She is after all not terribly good with that whole ""authority"" thing. It is likewise little surprise that the story will ultimately wind its way into another installment of the Hunger Games. (Its right there in the title)But from the start Catching Fire feels more consequential than its predecessor. In The Hunger Games the violence was mostly confined to the arena and the film (for obvious commercial reasons) shied away from depicting it too graphically. For a film about children murdering children it was remarkably unshocking. This time out too the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. But now the violence is not merely physical but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative--supporter of the Capitol lover of Peeta--from which she may never escape. As her mentor the former tribute Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) explains to her on the victory tour ""You never get off this train. From now on your job is to be a distraction.""Francis Lawrence who inherited the directing reins from the first movies Gary Ross delivers a film that is at once weightier and more nimble. Though the storyline has begun to sprawl outward (which will prove an escalating challenge for the next two films) Lawrence consistently maintains clarity and momentum. Hes aided tremendously by a lean but faithful script by pros pros Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine Toy Story 3) and Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty Slumdog Millionaire).As Katniss Jennifer Lawrence again pulls off a tricky balancing act angry closed off and occasionally sullen yet still likable admirable and relatable. Yes like her counterpart in the Twilight series shes a tad fickle in her affections which she divides between Peeta and her longtime District 12 confidant Gale (a rather dull Liam Hemsworth). But the film wisely chooses not to waste much time on her romantic dilemmas. Who can afford such luxuries when the world is burning? The rest of the returning cast (which also includes Elizabeth Banks Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz) once again offer solid if not terribly memorable support.Hoffman recognizes that the best way to get noticed in a movie full of urgent incident and outsized characters is to dial down his own performance. The newcomers to the franchise by contrast offer immediate dividends. Though theres a whiff of been-there-done-that to the tournament that takes up the latter portion of the film Katnisss fellow entrants include a brainy bespectacled Beetee (Jeffrey Wright); a spacey-intense Wiress (Amanda Plummer); a diligently self-loving Finnick (Sam Claflin); and a mad-as-hell-not-going-to-take-it-anymore Johanna (Jena Malone whos rewarded with perhaps the films most gratifying moment).Best of all however is the Capitols new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee--yes I hate that name as much as you do--played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. As he did in Mission Impossible III Hoffman recognizes that the best way to get noticed in a movie full of urgent incident and outsized characters is to dial down everything in his own performance. Though his screen time is limited Hoffmans portrait of understatement classes up the entire movie. At one point as circumstances are spinning out of the Capitols control he reassures President Snow ""Theres a way we can still win. Its what we Gamemakers call a wrinkle."" Casting Hoffman was itself a wrinkle and a win.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

And so as the well-paced and sturdy sequel to 2012s big-screen adaptation of Suzanne Collins best-selling dystopian trilogy begins Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are learning theres no such thing as a win-win in Panem. Sure the pair may be embarking on a state-directed Victory Tour but the guarantee theyd never have to enter the lethal arena again proves false. And now a quick refresher Panem its gleaming governing decadent Capitol; and outlying ""districts"" are all that remain of the United States after cataclysmic years of war. The competitions of the title are the televised death matches in which male and female ""tributes"" -- ages 12-18 -- are chosen from each district. In the 2012 blockbuster Katniss volunteered for the games when her beloved younger sister Prim was selected in the lottery called the Reaping. That sacrifice alone might have ignited the hearts of the oppressed but during the games Katniss out-maneuvered the Gamesmakers and avoided killing fellow District 12 denizen Peeta. Katniss may not have wanted to be a revolutionary but her instincts tend toward the rebellious. She just cant help herself -- and the people in the districts respond. She has become even more dangerous to the status quo. President Snow an icy Donald Sutherland devises a 75th anniversary edition of the Hunger Games that will pit previous winners against one another. Its cruel. Its cynical. It makes great TV ""Catching Fire"" delivers on the grim roiling promises of the original. Lawrence and Hutcherson remain compelling as the District 12 denizens who continue to do a romantic minuet dictated by necessity but also authentic fondness. Oscar-winning writers Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine"" credited here as Michael deBruyn) deepen the themes at the heart of Collins novels What are the differences between allies and friends? How does one trust not only others but also ones own feelings? Which adults can be confided in and are there any institutions worth believing in? Its heady stuff in a PG-13 film albeit one that depicts the violence and coercive force of an oppressive regime. Philip Seymour Hoffman arrives as Plutarch Heavensbee the new Gamesmaker. His philosophizing about strategy with President Snow keeps us guessing. Is he fiend and foe to the beleaguered people of Panem or something more wily? Other worthy newcomers include Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as tech-savvy former victors. Of course the Capitols unabated decadence continues apace. Stanley Tucci does a good job being the grating perma-tanned TV host Caesar Flickerman. Tuccis turn is apt but the character is beginning to feel like too much of a parody in a franchise of impressive nuance.

Geoff Pevere The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 22 2013 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 22 2013 1036AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Francis Lawrence Written by Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Donald Sutherland Country USA Language English Deepening and darkening the implications established in The Hunger Games a year ago The Hunger Games Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.  The result is not only a dramatic improvement over what was already an unusually smart and satisfying pop-cultural parable (based on Suzanne Collinss best-selling novels) of insurgent 99-per-cent rebellion but a very likely candidate for the all-time-great-sequel sweepstakes. Brought to the screen by the Austrian-born Francis Lawrence whose previous credits include I Am Legend and Constantine and who is currently shooting the trilogy-capping two-parter Mockingjay the second instalment in the saga also marks the arrival of a filmmaker well be watching closely in the future. The Associated Press Video Video Weekend movie pick Hunger Games Catching Fire surprisingly meaningful exciting JCT Kitchen amp; Bar Multimedia The Hunger Games loved Atlanta so will you. Heres where to go Opening a year after the events of the first instalment - and on the eve of the 75th-annual Hunger Games - in which the lethally resourceful Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) survived the made-for-mass-media survivalist ordeal staged by the authoritarian regime of Panem as a means of keeping a brutally oppressed populace both cowed and entertained Catching Fire establishes from the outset that the first games at least compared to whats to come were mere warm-up exercises. Indeed by the time Katniss is again released in the Arena as a result of circumstances generated by her own dangerous status as symbol of hope she will face cruelly customized tests and terror that will make the first round seem about as deadly as minor-league dodgeball.Now returned to live in closely monitored celebrity comfort in a posh new home Katniss is nevertheless as restless as a caged panther. Shes plagued by PTSD flashbacks of what she did in order to win and her clear contempt of the status quo and especially its insistence that she maintain the carefully constructed public facade of her devotion to her fellow surviving tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is catching. Restlessness is rumbling throughout the Districts and the powers-that-be are worried that this charismatically discontented young woman - despite all efforts to remake her into a lovestruck poster girl for national pride - is providing precisely the wrong kind of inspiration. This is why the frostily ruthless President Snow (a smoothly menacing Donald Sutherland) sees fit to pay a visit to Katniss to remind her whos in charge.At first he threatens Katnisss family then throws in the possibility of entire District 12 annihilation for added incentive. Then just to ensure that protocol is properly observed he concocts a special edition of the Games for the upcoming Third Quarter anniversary of the regime The coming round will include only past winners which means Katniss and the dutifully besotted Peeta are to be thrown back into an even deadlier ring.Although it takes more than an hour before the cannons blast announces the start of the games Catching Fire wastes no time getting there. On the contrary the time taken to delineate just how unremittingly evil the spectacle-driven Snow regime is - including the summary execution and public flogging of dissidents - and just how much fire Katniss must muster not to be doused simply makes the movie that much more irresistibly dramatic. Since the weight of hopelessness hangs so heavily over the land the faint flickerings of whatever hope is left is carried by the movie like a candle in a tempest.But as pointed as Catching Fires political barbs are its the films status as a highly effective and entertaining popcorn diversion that qualifies it as so fascinatingly subversive. (But not as subversive as it might have been. Like the first Hunger Games Catching Fire curiously omits any scenes of how the televised version of the ordeal is playing back in the Districts an omission that denies us the experience of just how propaganda in Panem actually plays.) Make no mistake this is one powerfully involving movie from the opening-act clampdown on the grumbling masses to Lawrences remarkable despair-defying look of there-will-be-blood resolve at the very end. Even at 21/2 hours Catching Fire burns like a fuse.And if Lawrence her marble-goddess face and eyes that radiate quiet rage and unwavering intelligence again proves shes one of cinemas brightest rising stars shes smartly complemented by some equally formidable co-stars especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as the dubiously motivated Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee Sutherlands President Snow and Jena Malones defiantly impertinent fellow combatant Johanna. But this added performative gravity only makes Lawrences transcendent authority over the movie all the more intractable not to mention potently feminist This is a mans world in which a woman will rise to change the rules of the game.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story Catching Fire shows how to build a brave new world - of marketing Liam Lacey Hunger Games and the power of merch TIFF 2012 Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence make cute together Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Murray Close/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence makes her second appearance as the savvy steel-spined Katniss Everdeen in the dystopian Hunger Games series. Murray Close/Lionsgate The Hunger Games Catching Fire Director Francis Lawrence Genre Action adventure Running Time 146 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language With Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Philomena Director Stephen Frears Genre Drama Running Time 98 minutes Rated PG-13 for some language With Judi Dench Steve Coogan (Recommended) Its a fact of Hollywood life that the movie industry is dominated by men. Male stars make more money. Male executives make more decisions. And the vast majority of films are about what men do or think or blow up. But this weekend two heroines are the backbone -- the impressively sturdy backbone -- of two very different pictures. When it comes to dystopian fiction there arent a lot of characters Id rather have on my side than Katniss Everdeen. The 17-year-old warrior heroine of Catching Fire -- Part 2 of the four-part Hunger Games ""trilogy"" if you can get your head around that -- may wear more eye shadow than Cleopatra this time but that doesnt mean shes not fierce. Sent to do battle in the life-and-death TV ritual her totalitarian society uses to help subjugate its citizens Katiss (Jennifer Lawrence) is an archer who can take out a saber-toothed baboon at 50 paces -- and a strategist who you just know will get the better of Donald Sutherlands evil dictator President Snow and his new strategist Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The first Hunger Games movie was a jittery hand-held-camera affair but Catching Fire has a new director Francis Lawrence and plenty of money for special effects. (Taking in 700 million will do that for a series.) i Philomena (Judi Dench) proves to have her own strength as she and journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) set out on a search for her stolen son. Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company Philomena (Judi Dench) proves to have her own strength as she and journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) set out on a search for her stolen son. Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company Being a sequel it starts in the middle without much exposition though theres still an hour-plus of flaming-costume fittings and chariot parades before Katniss gets to kick behind. Personally Ill be happier when she ditches the eye shadow for the revolution but thats the third Hunger Games book not the second; its going to be split into two movies and given the strength of this installment Id say the box-office odds continue to be in that Hunger Games catchphrase ""ever in its favor."" Katniss tends to look skeptically at the men in her life but she does take advice from a hard-drinking fatalist Haymitch played by Woody Harrelson. And in Philomena a true story about battling a dictatorial society in the recent past the title character (Judi Dench) also has a male fatalist around to nudge her into action Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) a journalist turned government spokesman whod fallen on hard times in 2004. Once the BBCs ""man in Moscow"" Sixsmith has been reduced to scrounging at cocktail parties for a way back into journalism mostly hearing story ideas he immediately resists. One story though sticks with him an unmarried Irish teenager sent by her Catholic family to have her baby in a convent. The child is then taken from her and put up for adoption and the nuns stonewall her questions for decades. The two meet and click -- awkwardly -- and there they are a humor-challenged working-class grandmother yearning for her long-lost son and a snarky upper-crust writer yearning for redemption. Matched recovery stories Hows that for human interest? Director Stephen Frears working from a book by the real Martin Sixsmith isnt about to let the Irish church off the hook for a monstrous (and well-documented) chapter in its history. In flashbacks he pictures the young Philomena as a sort of proto-Katniss doing battle with a tyranny of nuns. That this rebel grew up to be Denchs chatterbox of an older Philomena does exasperate Coogans Martin. But hell discover theres steel in her too. And that allows a story that might have been mined purely for tears and anger to inspire both laughter and a startling degree of forgiveness.

Take our quiz Video The Hunger Games Catching Fire Monitor Movie Guide Catnip - I mean Katniss - Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) gets more than she bargained for in ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire."" After winning the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games and looking forward to some well-deserved Ramp;R back home in District 12 she and co-winner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are sent on a ""Victors Tour"" of the districts. Worse nefarious President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fearing Katnisss prole appeal to stir the oppressed masses seeks to eliminate her by staging an extra-special anniversary Quarter Kvell - I mean Quell - Games in which previous victors face off against each other. In other words for Katniss its back to the drawing board - and the archery range.This second in the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy directed by Francis Lawrence has many of the virtues and somewhat fewer defects as its predecessor (which was directed by Gary Ross). The action is smoothly sustained the dystopian weirdness is alternately creepy and somewhat less cloying and Jennifer Lawrence is if anything even stronger in the role. Shes a movie star who can really act - a fearsome combo. Stanley Tucci is back his teeth bigger and whiter than ever as TV personality Caesar Flickerman and theres a welcome new addition to the zoo Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Gotta love these names.As teencentric franchises go I much prefer ""The Hunger Games"" to the blessedly expired ""Twilight"" films. For one thing they employ much better actors. My favorite Amanda Plummer one of the best and most underused actresses in America as one of the Quell contestants. Like Jennifer Lawrence she can transform pulp shenanigans into something soulful. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language.)

"The Hunger Games Catching Fire starring Jennifer Lawrence reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Its Too Bad the Hunger Games Movies Arent as Dark as the Books Its Too Bad the Hunger Games Movies Arent as Dark as the Books Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 21 2013 655 PM The Hunger Games Catching Fire Needs more kindling. By Dana Stevens Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games Catching Fire. Courtesy of Lionsgate The Hunger Games books and films come to fill a psychic void left by the Twilight series. For whatever reason it seems our culture right now needs a mega-selling YA franchise built around a beautiful stubborn teen heroine who waffles endlessly between two inexplicably patient lovers as she battles to save the world from malevolent forces. Im not being facetious; this is an enormously appealing fantasy and a refreshing change from the male-dominated comic book universe that supplies most blockbuster franchises with material. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Of course there are sharp differences between the two series Katniss Everdeen the fiercely independent bow-and-arrow-wielding protagonist of Suzanne Collins Hunger Games books (played on screen by Jennifer Lawrence) is a world away from Bella Swan the passive lovesick heroine of Stephenie Meyers Twilight. Also Collins books attempt to take on larger social and political issues than Meyers narrowly focused domestic melodramas Though the Hunger Games trilogy is set in the repressive futuristic dystopia of Panem the materialism and celebrity culture Collins books satirize are recognizably contemporary. Between the covers of a book I vastly prefer The Hunger Games to Twilight--Collins prose is vivid and sensorially precise with end-of-chapter cliffhangers to beat the band while Meyers endless static descriptions of glittering vampire skin seem to make each page weigh a hundred pounds. But on screen the Twilight movies pulsed with a weird pulpy energy that only got weirder and pulpier as the series went along. The Hunger Games films on the other hand have yet to take a tip from the subtitle of the just-released second installment and really start catching fire. Theres something a bit cautious and prestige picture-ish about both movies so far as if the filmmakers were afraid to explore the darkest implications of their kids-killing-kids premise (or maybe just afraid to get saddled with the PG-13 rating that would drive away their most eager audience). Jennifer Lawrence is a one-woman charisma factory who somehow projects supreme self-confidence and humble vulnerability. Advertisement That said The Hunger Games Catching Fire directed by Francis Lawrence of I Am Legend is in many ways an improvement on the first film which was directed by Gary Ross. The shaky you-are-there documentary-style cinematography has been replaced by a smoother steadier camera (wielded by Jo Willems) that takes time to linger on faces and intimate exchanges among characters. Much of the complicated world-building exposition is out of the way by now allowing us to spend more time encountering the creepy plutocracy that is Panem. And a new costume designer Trish Summerville has been brought on--a crew position that means a lot in a film in which fashion plays as large a role as it does in Catching Fire. After all the revolution that begins to spread throughout Panem in this middle chapter takes as its secret emblem a piece of Katniss jewelry--a gold bird pin she was given at the beginning of the first film--and one of the movies emotional high points involves a flaming wedding dress that converts spectacularly into a symbolically significant winged black gown. Insofar as Catching Fire does ignite the match to the flame is Jennifer Lawrence who gives Katniss layers she lacks even in the books fairly rich characterization. When the first Hunger Games film came out I wrote that it was with this role that Lawrence officially acceded to the title of movie star. Shes been one for a while now and hauling around the little gold statue she won in February for Silver Linings Playbook has only built up those movie-star muscles. Lawrence is a superbly intuitive actress who never settles for a conventional line reading when theres a fresh off-kilter one to be had and she lifts up a lot of this movies sometimes less than sparkling dialogue. But shes also a one-woman charisma factory who somehow projects at once supreme self-confidence and humble vulnerability (as demonstrated in her absurdly winning fall up the stairs on her way to accept her Oscar). Though the movies last third is devoted to the gladiatorial games of the title The Hunger Games Catching Fire is in large part a movie about learning to be a celebrity and J-Law has plenty of material to draw on in that department. Katniss and her fellow Hunger Games champion the besotted baker Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) go on a victory tour of the country pretending to be in love for the cameras that follow them everywhere. Meanwhile Top Comment Good lord woman pick up a book. She doesnt ""waffle endlessly"" - shes simply not interested in either until the third book.  More... Join In Katniss best friend since childhood nature boy Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) waits for her back in their native blighted District 12. Gale grows more and more radicalized as he watches the elites of the Capitol--led by the nefarious President Snow (Donald Sutherland)--manipulate Peeta and Katniss celebrity to distract the masses while the police state cracks down on even the mildest protest with ruthless violence. When Peeta and Katniss begin speaking truth to power at their public events President Snow and his chief gamesman Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decide to design a special Games that will take out the rebellious couple while also turning public sentiment against them. After the young contestants enter the arena--a huge expanse of jungle watched over by hidden cameras and enclosed by an invisible dome--both the political and romantic plots are shelved while Peeta and Katniss along with a few fellow contestants who become their wary allies contend with poisonous fog twice-a-day lightning storms and packs of crazed mandrills. Though some of the chases and escapes are thrillingly filmed this last section of the film feels indistinguishable from plenty of other video-game-style avoid-the-obstacle action climaxes. I preferred the scenes in the decadent vaguely fascistic Capitol especially those involving Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) Katniss and Peetas magnificently garbed image consultant/brand stylist and Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) the flamboyant ever-smiling TV host who interviews the doomed game contestants on the eve of their likely death. In the trilogys final chapter Mockingjay (which I havent read yet but plan to before the first installment of the two-part movie based on it comes out in 2014) I suspect this hypocritical pastel-wigged lot is going to get their revolutionary comeuppance. May the odds be ever in their favor. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

By David Denby Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen in the second installment of the trilogy directed by Francis Lawrence.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka The basic premise of ""The Hunger Games"" the first volume in Suzanne Collinss trilogy of young-adult novels never made much sense to me. How could a totalitarian government keep its people down while forcing some of their children to fight to the death in a yearly competition? What could be a greater goad to revolution than the anguish of seeing children die? There were other mysteries and not a few hypocrisies the filmmakers who adapted the book shrugged off the gladiatorial issues implicit in the spectacle. They wanted to create indignation over the horror--children forced to hunt one another with arrows swords lances--while staging the violence in the most anodyne manner possible to achieve a PG-13 rating. The teens I know accepted the combat as a given while their elders bewildered and looking for a little meaning interpreted the story as a representation of how kids felt about the competitive traumas of high school; or as a metaphor for capitalism with its terrifying job market and winner-take-all ethos; or more simply as a satiric exaggeration of talent-show ruthlessness. The premise of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" an adaptation of Collinss second volume doesnt make a lot of sense either. Having survived the competition through daring and ingenuity Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her admirer Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) receive riches and acclaim from the vicious overlords in the Capitol. Yet rebellion is breaking out in the twelve districts of the country called Panem and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his new head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) cook up a fresh scheme they will choose among the survivors of all the competitions some of them now middle-aged or elderly and throw them into a new struggle which will somehow quell the rebellion. Distraction is supposed to work miracles. Along with this gang of heavies Katniss and Peeta are pushed back into the woods to fight again. Gary Rosss direction of the first movie with its wandering jiggling camera and its fragmented messy staging was pretty much an embarrassment. Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") working with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn has taken over and parts of ""Catching Fire""--at least the first forty-five minutes or so--are impressive. The scenes in Katnisss home turf District 12 have the feel of life under totalitarian control. The mood is Eastern-bloc depression a gray world drained of vitality. The images are large-scale and weighted menacing military vehicles charge through the demoralized cities; faceless storm troopers in white plastic helmets clobber people with truncheons. For Katniss the pleasure of victory never arrives. At the very beginning of the movie we see her in silhouette crouching at the edge of a pond a huntress poised to uncoil. She hates being a celebrity and she certainly has no desire to lead a revolution. Jennifer Lawrences gray-green eyes and her formidable concentration dominate the camera. She resembles a story-book Indian princess and she projects the kind of strength that Katharine Hepburn had when she was young. Two guys vie for Katnisss love--not just the doleful fair-haired Peeta but the faithful darkly handsome Gale (Liam Hemsworth). But happiness is not her fate. Shes tormented and wary. The film moves back to the Capitol for more of the extravagant decadence and purple-pink luxury that was so puzzling in the first movie. Why is everyone dressed in wigs glitter and eye shadow as if outfitted for a drag ball that never ends? The crowds are nothing more than seething bright-colored decor. Stanley Tucci returns as Caesar Flickerman and again brilliantly parodies beauty-pageant and talent-show hosts. Unctuous and hostile at the same time Tucci flashes enormous choppers that glisten in the light. Donald Sutherland with his satanic eyebrows and rounded insinuating voice is an entertainingly threatening presence. And Woody Harrelson as the hard-drinking realist Haymitch who guides Katniss through every terror is the core of intelligence in the movie; he is used more centrally here than in the first film and his glare and his acid voice cut through the meaningless fashion show. Yet despite the good acting the middle section of the film set at the Capitol is attenuated and rhythmless--the filmmakers seem to be touching all the bases so that the trilogys readers wont miss anything. In the woods Francis Lawrence recovers his skills at least for a while some of the starts and frights--a bunch of snarling devil baboons some enveloping poisonous smoke--work in a B-movie-ish way. But there are complications in the plot that the filmmakers cant sort out. Characters we barely know go chasing through the brush brandishing weapons. Who are Katniss and Peetas friends? Who are their enemies? Some of the confusion is intentional some of it the result of ineptitude and the grand climax whose elements include a long piece of wire a lightning bolt and an electronic force field is an incoherent rapid blur that will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out whats supposed to be going on. Cinema can provide explosions of light and terrors bursting through the foliage but when it comes to basic exposition of complicated physical events literature--even a calculating young-adult novel--may have the movies beat. In some ways Lance Armstrong is a familiar American type. A handsome man he has strong regular features a ready smile a finely honed slender body; he also has an unblinking military gaze that would melt a steel girder. As he admits in Alex Gibneys documentary ""The Armstrong Lie"" his life has been damaged by the need to win every encounter be it personal or professional. Armstrong lied until it was impossible for him to lie anymore and Gibneys movie unexpectedly hinges on that moment. Seven-time winner of the Tour de France world-famous exemplar of physical courage (he survived testicular cancer in his twenties) Armstrong having beaten back countless accusations that he was doping retired in 2005. But in 2009 he attempted a comeback. The point was to prove that he was ""clean"" and to validate his earlier titles by winning another. Gibney usually a skeptical liberal filmmaker (""Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room"" and ""Taxi to the Dark Side"") was determined to make a positive movie about an American hero. During the 2009 Tour de France he joined Armstrongs entourage with a camera crew. Armstrong as it turned out didnt win; he finished third. And in 2010 fresh accusations were made against him. Cornered he finally confessed to Oprah Winfrey last January that he had been doping since the nineteen-nineties. Gibney then reshuffled his footage and put himself as a self-confessed patsy in the movie. ""The Armstrong Lie"" goes on forever perhaps because Gibney cant believe that like everyone else hes been had. Again and again he looks for elements of moral clarity (never mind remorse) in Armstrong and the cyclist looks back at Gibney (and at us) as if he were a fool. His attitude is Dont you get it? What we dont get is how often winners will do whatever it takes to win. Gibney interviews Armstrongs former teammates who say that in the nineties many cyclists were doping and that they had no choice but to do the same if they were to maintain a competitive edge. An event like the Tour de France is mostly ""suffering""--a three-week slog through the Alps and other difficult terrain. Doping increases the amount of oxygen in the blood delaying the moment when the muscles become exhausted and quit. Armstrong like many others took testosterone and the drug EPO. He also refreshed his own blood now and then transporting the elixir to various tournaments and transfusing it back into his depleted system. (Gibney speculates that he withdrew blood after cycling in the Rockies.) One of the greatest athletes in the world became a kind of ghoul feeding on his own body. For Armstrong success creates its own benediction absolution and redemption; after all as he reminds Gibney his victories and his personal story brought extraordinary levels of attention and money to the cycling world--competitors cycling associations bike manufacturers media coverage. Many people benefitted from his victories. From our point of view however its hard to overstate his cynicism. The bitterest parts of Gibneys movie are the interviews with the former teammates who were caught doping and whom Armstrong when he was still officially clean viciously turned on. These men took the fall. In competition they literally covered for him--providing protection from wind resistance by riding around him until he could burst from the pack at the last minute to win. For most of his professional life Armstrong lived in a safety zone created by others. Gibney doesnt get much out of him; his admissions are as brief bald and dismissive as his lies. Whats most alive in him is his contempt for ""dickheads""--anyone who has ever held him responsible for anything. The most determined person in the movie apart from Armstrong is Betsy Andreu whose husband the cyclist Frankie Andreu was an Armstrong teammate and a victim. She told the truth about Armstrong under subpoena and refused to be rattled when she was attacked by him and his supporters. In front of Gibneys camera shes both defiant and regretful. Armstrongs fierce desire to predominate created fear and loyalty. In Betsy Andreu he seems to have met his match.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Whenever she needs another Katniss Everdeen simply reaches over her shoulder knowing one will be there. Thats not to quarrel with her self-replenishing quiver. It contributes to the pace of action sequences that hurtle along with exuberant style and authority. Better still its a fitting accessory for the star Jennifer Lawrence who has so many arrows in her actors quiver that they seem to be multiplying from one movie to the next. Watch a clip from ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson. (Photo/Video Lionsgate) In this second installment of the trilogy Ms. Lawrence stands runs shoots and suffers at the center of a production thats worthy of her formidable gifts and of the Suzanne Collins novel on which the film is based. That wasnt the case in the first one which started sluggishly then worked itself into various lathers without enhancing the dramatic core of sacrifice and personal integrity in a struggle for survival. This time all the elements--the garish spectacle the devious politics the kill-or-be-killed combat under a vast invisible dome--work in concert to heighten Katnisss plight as the pawn of a repressive government that stages the games in the form of a television show to distract its citizens from their miserable lives. ""Catching Fire"" is exceptional entertainment a spectacle with a good mind and a pounding heart. Francis Lawrence directed expertly from a sharp lucid screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn. The cinematography by Jo Willems is especially spectacular in IMAX. The film opens with a striking image Katniss seen from behind bow in hand crouching watchfully in a forest. Soon shes swept up in an ironic celebration. Having survived and prevailed in the previous years games Katniss and her friend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) must criss-cross their wretched nation of Panem by train on a victory tour. When one of her handlers tells her to enjoy the experience because shes earned it Katniss replies ""Yes by killing people."" She speaks as a person of conscience struggling to be her authentic self yet forced to be a government symbol and to pretend for purposes of feel-good publicity that she and Peeta are madly in love rather than the rebels theyve become. And killing more people is what she must do in an ever more lethal round of games played out in a rain forest where the weather swings between bad and worse and poison fogs blister exposed skin. All of this is potent stuff and much more so for the absence of frenzy that infected the first film. The director and his colleagues havent dialed down the intensity or the lurid humor. Rather theyve staged their big set pieces with well-founded confidence that the material will speak for itself. The Capitol proves that resplendent and tawdry can co-exist in the same city. Stanley Tucci is funnier than ever as the game-show host Caesar Flickerman teeth and eyes gleaming madly from a skinscape of bottled tan. Donald Sutherlands President Snow is at least as suave as before and even more evil. Elizabeth Banks as the heroines grotesquely costumed escort Effie Trinket gets to show Effies human side however briefly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the new gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee takes treachery to intriguing levels of complexity. And in the wardrobe department a drop-dead gorgeous gown worn by Katniss suddenly morphs into something no less gorgeous and vividly symbolic in the bargain. Yet none of it would work--not the action the adventure the political subtext or the humor--without the strength and beauty that Ms. Lawrence brings to the central role. Whenever shes on screen the camera studies the contours of her face with a gaze that might be fawning in other circumstances but seems properly attentive here. The lovely simplicity of her technique might have gratified James Cagney whose reputed advice to actors was ""Learn your lines find your mark look em in the eye and tell em the truth."" Its hard to believe how far this young star has come in the three years since her breakout role in ""Winters Bone"" but shes an archer in her own right. Everything she does flies straight and true. Watch a clip from ""Philomena"" starring Judi Dench as a woman who works with a journalist (Steve Coogan) to find the child she gave up for adoption years earlier. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) Philomena Even though the plot of ""Philomena"" follows a familiar pattern this drama of a woman searching for the son who was taken from her half a century ago can catch you by surprise. Thats a tribute to the storys essence its invisible skein of emotional connections but also to the eloquently understated performance of Judi Dench in the title role. ENLARGE Judi Dench and Steve Coogan star in Philomena Weinstein Co. Philomena Lee the retired working-class Irish nurse whose life inspired the film had become pregnant out of wedlock in the early 1950s when she was in her teens. Banished by her family to a convent in County Tipperary she gave birth then went to work in the convents laundry where she and other girls with similar histories were treated as slave laborers. She was allowed to see her son Anthony for one hour a day during the first three years of his life after which the boy was removed against her will and sold to American parents for adoption. In real life as in the movie which was directed by Stephen Frears Philomenas trials came to the attention of an ex-BBC reporter and former spin doctor named Martin Sixsmith. Hes played by Steve Coogan who with Jeff Pope based the screenplay on Mr. Sixsmiths book. Martin and Philomena make an odd couple--hes a world-weary sophisticate shes a sweet old provincial with a remarkable memory for the potboilers she loves to read and to recount at exhaustive length. The oddness is fine and so is the storys opening up when Philomena accompanied by Martin extends her search to America. But Mr. Coogan lavishly talented as a comic and a comic actor is fairly monotonous in the mostly serious role he wrote for himself. That leaves Ms. Dench to carry the picture which she does up to a point with her usual delicacy and grace.You cant help but be moved by the depth of Philomenas devotion to the memory of her son or by the doggedness of her refusal as a good Catholic to blame the sisters of the convent for what turned out to be the systematic sale of children for adoption; the going price for a baby at that time was about PS1000. But the picture outspoken through Martins mouth on the subject of the Churchs sins neglects to say that abuses of young women werent confined at the time to a single convent--the Magdalene Asylums combined reformatories and commercial laundries as late as the 1990s--and that some Protestant-run institutions were guilty of the same appalling practices. With ample blame to go around a piece of fiction comes up short on facts. Watch a clip from the film ""Approved for Adoption."" Comic-book artist Jung returns to Seoul for the first time since he was abandoned at the age of five. (Photo/Video GKIDS) Approved for Adoption Superb films can be anything they want to be. This exploration of adoption takes the unlikely form of an animated memoir with evocative segments of home movies complementing the sepia-toned drawings. In French with excellent subtitles its the work of Jung Henin--an illustrator and graphic novelist known professionally as Jung--and his co-director Laurent Boileau. Born in South Korea in 1965 Mr. Jung was sent as a young boy to Belgium where he says in the film adopting Korean children had become chic. The family that adopted him had four children of their own so an easy entry into a new Belgian life was never in the cards. When his adoptive mother tells him hes a bad apple he visualizes himself as such an apple with all the dark imagination at his command. ENLARGE A scene from Approved for Adoption GKids Visualizations are Mr. Jungs province and theyre what make his movie so deeply moving as well as literally illuminating. (Its a linguistic coincidence of course but his most powerful drawings are classically Jungian.) Using the heightened reality of animation--of unusually expressive animation--hes able to get at the inner turmoil so often experienced by adoptees the existential question of identity; the uneasy idealization of unknown biological parents (the ethereal mother in Jungs drawings lacks a face); the yearning for acceptance and failing that or indeed along with that the search for specific information about ones past. Its troubling to see Mr. Jungs slim dossier which raises more questions than it answers and haunting to see those home movies of the hero as a flesh-and-blood child. ""Approved for Adoption"" is tough and tender a rich resource for anyone who has been adopted and anyone who plans to adopt. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Winters Bone (2010) The start of the phenomenon that has become Jennifer Lawrences career. The setting is the Ozark mountains of southwestern Missouri at the present time though many of the faces might have been photographed by Dorothea Lange or Mathew Brady and the themes are timeless--love kinship the struggle to survive. The 17-year-old heroine Ree Dolly is played by Ms. Lawrence whom I described when the movie opened as a professional actress who doesnt seem to act so much as achieve a state of grace that combines intelligence with fierce resolve. ENLARGE The Trip (2010) Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden riff on celebrity voices while playing approximate versions of their real--their surreal--selves. The pretext for this cheerful nonsense is a newspaper assignment to review upscale country restaurants in Englands Lake District and Yorkshire Dales. Both men brilliant mimics do Sean Connery Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore as James Bond plus Woody Allen Ian McKellen and Alec Guinness. Most deliciously even bewitchingly they whisper sweet Michael Caines to each other doting on subtle deviations in timbre volume and pitch. All that and scallops too. Michael Winterbottom directed. ENLARGE The Magdalene Sisters (2002) Peter Mullans fiction film purportedly based on fact seems straight out of the 19th century. But the time is the 1960s when Irish girls are still being incarcerated in Magdalene Asylums run by the Catholic Church where inmates are forced to work long hours in commercial laundries under appalling conditions. Mr. Mullan evokes a nightmare world of sadistic nuns and predatory priests a world in which religious tenets have been twisted into pitiless tyranny. The cast includes Nora-Jane Noone as a headstrong beauty and Dorothy Duffy as a girl giving birth out of wedlock.

Murray Close/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Lionsgate Effie Trinket taps Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence right) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) for the Hunger Games arena again -- but this time the rules are different and the stakes are higher as rebellion brews in Panem. Murray Close/Lionsgate The Hunger Games Catching Fire Director Francis Lawrence Genre Action adventure Running Time 146 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language. With Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Donald Sutherland Theres a moment of chilling violence in Catching Fire the second of four planned movies adapting Suzanne Collins dystopian Hunger Games novels a moment in which the difference a director makes becomes immediately clear -- and one that should give hope to readers who might have felt some disappointment with the first movie. Its the first significant bloodshed in the film a scene in which the young heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is made to fully realize the capability for cruelty inherent in the government of Panem. Thats the post-apocalyptic future America in which a wealthy technologically advanced Capitol squeezes labor and resources out of 12 subjugated districts through force and fear. Director Francis Lawrence holds the victim unflinchingly at the center of the frame and were spared seeing the full impact of an execution-style bullet to the head only by a closing door. Contrast that to the jittery unparseable hand-held close-ups that director Gary Ross employed as a means of obscuring violence in last years first installment. Ross stylistic choice was all ostentatious distraction distancing the viewer from the horrors onscreen until they lost their power. Lawrences calm control over the images we see never allows us that distance. i The third point of the movies love triangle Katniss hunting partner Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) remains stranded in District 12 without as much to do as the other two. Murray Close/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Lionsgate The third point of the movies love triangle Katniss hunting partner Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) remains stranded in District 12 without as much to do as the other two. Murray Close/Lionsgate The focus turns in Catching Fire though from the disturbing notion of kids killing kids in a gladiatorial competition to the direct violence of totalitarian governments. While the new movie does feature another iteration of Panems annual bloodsport most of the competitors are adults this time with entrants culled from past victors instead of children from each district. Its a twist devised by the scheming President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the head of the games (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to allow them to kill off both Katniss and her revolutionary image; it was her defiance of the rules remember that determined the outcome of her first Hunger Games. Since then her win has managed to spark unrest and rebellion within the districts. Everything that felt clumsy in The Hunger Games has been improved upon here. Thats most apparent in the clarity of the action but it also extends to how efficiently the film establishes so many new ensemble members. The middle section in which the fighters train and form alliances before the games doesnt feel as haphazard as before as the director and co-writers (Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt) focus on just the right moments to quickly define the cast of supporting characters -- brash ego-driven Finnick (Sam Claflin) angrily rebellious Johanna (Jena Malone) introverted tech genius Beetee (Jeffrey Wright). The character of the Capitol city itself is more efficiently defined largely through a set design that draws direct lines to the Third Reich with banners and Teutonic architecture looking like Technicolored outtakes from Triumph of the Will. Even the barely functional alcoholism of Katniss mentor (Woody Harrelson) seems more like an actual part of his character than the quickly forgotten quirk it registered as in the first film. Only Katniss romantic confusion remains unconvincing and thats largely owing to the lack of screen time for Gale (Liam Hemsworth) the hunky object of her affections back home. Establishing why she shares such a connection with Gale -- as opposed to with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who won the games with her last time -- is difficult when theyre not together much. Plus Hemsworths stoic swagger and square-jawed good looks make pulling for him feel a little like rooting for the personality-deficient quarterback to get the girl. Lawrence takes full advantage of Catching Fires status as the middle chapter to make things as dark as possible. Like The Empire Strikes Back or The Dark Knight before it the film is freed from having to provide satisfying resolutions or neatly resolved plots. Even if characters make it out of Chapter 2 alive theyre often much worse off than they were at the start. Katniss in particular is punished relentlessly and isolated throughout even being forced to accept almost certain defeat and death. (For an example of how thoroughly Jennifer Lawrence elevates her performance above that of a run-of-the-mill action hero watch for how she wordlessly conveys the complex emotions of that acceptance in only a split second.) This is the Hunger Games movie that the first one failed to be as dire and punishing as Collins books often are. While it wouldnt be accurate to call it uncompromising -- the necessity of its PG-13 makes that impossible -- Lawrence works around the necessary compromises without letting them undermine the film. The series may never get better than this but its clearly in the right hands now.

Related links By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 504pm on Thursday Nov. 21 2013 Thursday Nov. 21 2013 Thursday Nov. 21 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram What a difference a director can make.The first Hunger Games directed by Gary Ross (Seabiscuit Pleasantville) was a middling adventure not an embarrassing translation of Suzanne Collinsf hit young-adult novel to the big screen but nothing transcendent either. The sequel from Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend Constantine) is darker in tone more explicitly political and more kinetic in style making for a much more compelling involving experience.In theory life is good for our heroes at the opening of Catching Fire. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the controversial victors from the last Hunger Games now live in relative luxury compared to their downtrodden fellow citizens in District 12. But all is not well. Because the world which watched the Hunger Games on TV believes Katniss and Peeta are deeply in love Katniss cant be with the guy she really wants working-class Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Her real life cant conflict with her contrived ""reality TV"" life.And underneath the veneer of police-state calm things are starting to boil. As one of their duties as victors Katniss and Peeta must go on tour speaking to the masses in all the districts about the glory of the games. If they donft do as their told their families could suffer.But the twosomefs burst of defiance at the end of the last film -- they threatened to commit suicide together depriving President Snow (Donald Sutherland) of any Hunger Games victor -- has put them on thin ice with the powers-that-be. The pairs action also sparked a flame of revolution among the populace turning Katniss into a symbol of resistance. The people enjoyed their circus; now they want their bread.Snow becomes even more brutal -- sending in goons to all the districts to lay down the law -- and believes winners of all the previous games may be a threat. So he decides to thin the herd. What better way than to stage an all-star Hunger Games in which the combatants would kill each other thus saving Snow the trouble of having to do it himself?Thatfs how our winners find themselves back in ""the arena"" -- an island surrounded by a force field -- to battle it out with teams that are much fiercer opponents than those in the moviefs first incarnation. Not to mention this time therefs poison fog and watch out for that army of angry mandrills.Though the romantic triangle of Katniss Peeta and Gale provides the storys heart itfs the films wry take on media as social control (Stanley Tucci returns as the unctuous Hunger Games TV host Caesar Flickerman) sharp sense of action and smart peformances that give Catching Fire its soul. Lawrence shows much more range this time around and Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a hint of evil genius in his role as the game designer Plutarch Heavensbee.Written by Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael Arndt (Toy Story 3 Little Miss Sunshine) from the novel by Suzanne Collins Catching Fire is entertaining enough that it doesnt feel like its 2 1/2 hours. In fact when it ends rather abruptly you may find yourself wanting more.But dont fear. Lawrence is on board for the next two installments.

David Brewster Star tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint COLIN COVERT colincovert Anyone who felt that the workmanlike adaptation of the first ""Hunger Games"" missed the bulls-eye take heart. ""Catching Fire"" is the new ""The Empire Strikes Back"" a smashing sci-fi sequel that takes its blockbuster franchise into deeper smarter more dramatically engaging territory. New director Francis Lawrence has a solid grasp of science fiction (as demonstrated in ""Constantine"" and ""I Am Legend"") and romance (proven with ""Water for Elephants""). The conflicts are clear the characters fully fleshed the lethal adventure urgent and the tender interludes poignant. Suzanne Collins bestsellers set in a fascist North America after a civil war and the extinction of the middle class are a potent sociopolitical allegory. In dystopian Panem (Latin for ""bread"" a nod to the Roman Empires policy of distracting citizens with food and circuses) young warriors must kill each other to survive. The battles are packaged as gladiatorial reality shows designed to keep the populace disengaged and submissive. The spectacle is undeniably impressive. An attack against players on a tropical island by a troop of ferocious mandrills tops anything Ive seen this year for sheer get-me-out-of-here chills. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen a stoic rural teenager who entered the Games in the first film to save her younger sister from certain death in combat. The role showcases Lawrences uncanny ability to make a tiny apprehensive furrow of the brow speak volumes and to tackle bigger-than-life scenes without going over the top. No matter how many times shes called on to display desperation and resolve (and its a lot of times) Lawrence makes it fresh and convincing. She can pulverize you with a glance. Having survived the first round of reality-TV carnage Katniss has become a national celebrity. Her public life is scripted as a romantic fantasy and played out for countless TV viewers. Katniss a coal miners daughter hates the pretense and glitz of stardom. She resists play-acting a manufactured faux-romance with her Games teammate/pretend boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) That reluctance adds tension and irony to the slow-burning attraction between the two survivors offstage. Her unprecedented popularity has made Katniss a political figure representing underclass hopes. Concerned that she could become the figurehead for an uprising President Snow (silky evil Donald Sutherland) orders his games designer to create a competition that will eliminate her and ruin her heroic reputation in the process. Plutarch Heavensbee (inscrutable calculating Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes ""what we designers call a wrinkle"" an All-Star Game featuring the survivors of earlier combats. When the action moves to the arena unexpected alliances and hidden agendas reveal a hedge-maze of new wrinkles. Murray Close Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen from foreground to background Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy in ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire."" Working from a script by Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael Arndt (""Oblivion"") director Lawrence leavens this fundamentally serious movie with bleak caustic satire. Stanley Tucci returns as soulless TV host Caesar Flickerman whose awesomely stilted stage presence raises insincerity to high art. Elizabeth Banks wears ever more bizarre couture as Katniss and Peetas image consultant; one memorable outfit is composed of monarch butterflies. It takes skilled filmmaking to walk the line between ghastly realism and cranked-up absurdity and this movie has the creative vitality to make both aspects of the story work. Theres a clarity and purpose to every shot. Stunning retro-futuristic set and costume designs draw a vivid line between the worlds of decadence and deprivation. In contrast to the overblown artificial pomp of the capital city the films real melancholy beauty appears whenever Katniss returns to her hardscrabble home district. Katniss contempt for the Darwinian backstabbing of the entertainment/government cabal meshes nicely with Lawrences real-life anti-Hollywood pronouncements. On every level this movie works. I was entertained by the first ""Games"" film. This one gripped me.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Murray Close) Murray Close This image released by Lionsgate shows Donald Sutherland as President Snow in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire."" (AP Photo/Lionsgate Murray Close) The sharpest thing about ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" may be the arrows fired back at critics who William Tell-it like it is.The first ""Hunger Games"" movie earned almost 700 million worldwide and while it was not a great film it was better than anything in the ""Twilight"" series it allowed us to forget. It had life-and-death thrills an undercurrent of social commentary and one of the best young actresses in Hollywood Jennifer Lawrence.Based on the middle child in Suzanne Collins book trilogy ""Catching Fire"" has an annoying ""me too"" quality. Although provincial teen Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) won a televised fight-to-the-death tournament and is now the toast of the post-apocalyptic country called Panem she and her family dont get to enjoy the meager spoils for very long. To pacify the huddled masses President Snow (Donald Sutherland) forces Katniss and her former friend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) to take a victory tour of the provinces and pretend to be the lovebirds they portrayed on TV. So Katniss boards the propaganda caravan to spare the lives of her sister (Willow Shields) her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her unrequited love Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Under the watchful eye of flamboyant ditz Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and the drunken eye of tournament legend Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) Katniss delivers canned speeches to crowds that are hungry for revolution.By the time the train reaches the glittering capital Snow and obstacle-course designer Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman) have concocted a new competition one that will enlist a co-ed pair of champions from each of the 12 districts in an all-star death match. So Katniss and Peeta must bunk in the capital for a regimen of training and publicity.As in the first movie the costumes and sets are like a mushroom vision of Versailles designed by Lewis Carroll but this time we dont get to linger long among the one-percenters. Nothing much happens for the first hour of this overlong film and the middle section is a rote introduction to the large cast of competitors. They include devious hunk Finnick (Sam Claflin) spitfire Johanna (Jena Malone) middle-aged nerds Beetee and Wiress (Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer) and even a mute granny called Mags (Lynn Cohen) to pull on our heartstrings in lieu of the little kid who was killed in the previous movie.The idea of hunting humans still gives Katniss nightmares but in the hands of journeyman director Francis Lawrence (""Water for Elephants"") its not particularly shocking here. Katniss and Peeta form an alliance with the aforementioned hunk spitfire nerds and granny and they spend the ostensible climax of the movie hacking through the jungle and firing arrows at colorless adversaries. With potential villain Finnick on the side of our heroine Katniss is continually reminded that the real enemy is Snow and the faceless stormtroopers who keep a lid on the little-seen rebellion. In better movies no one needed reminding to fear Darth Vader and Voldemort.The ingredients are in place for a potent finale but ""Catching Fire"" is watered down.{hr /}What ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 226  Content Intense sequences of violence and action strong language and some frightening images Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Murray Close) Photo Murray Close Associated Press Hunger Games Catching Fire review 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Hunger Games Catching Fire Action drama. Starring Jennifer Lawrence Donald Sutherland Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (PG-13. 146 minutes.) ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" doesnt settle for halfhearted gestures. Its dystopian society isnt somewhat horrible but truly horrible in the way of real-life totalitarian states - soul-killing unreasoning and thuggish. The people who carry out the governments dirty work are perpetually angry because psychopaths rise to the top in such an environment and because anger must be nurtured so as to ward off guilt. And were not merely told that the president is evil; we see him operate and hes a smiling genial monster. In the lead role Jennifer Lawrence does not act like someone in an action movie but like someone in a life-and-death drama that happens to have lots of running and jumping. Director Francis Lawrence makes sure that not a single performance is tossed off. Every effort is made to portray this awful future world as something real and to have the actors react with the right sense of terror and entrapment. These are all solid virtues and they take the movie far. But ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is based on the middle book in a trilogy and that means that it doesnt really end. Instead it stops just as its getting interesting. Also it relies too much on the success of the original story with a plotline that calls to mind its contours. There are empty action sequences that contain no suspense at all When Jennifer Lawrence is attacked by a pack of orangutans does anyone worry that the orangutans might win? Still ""Catching Fire"" always revives and its only in two or three places that the movie dishes out action for the sake of action. It runs 146 minutes and would have been better at 130 but 110 would have been too brief. The movie takes place not long after the end of ""The Hunger Games."" Katniss (Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have returned to their blighted home district. Having survived the Hunger Games they are the darlings of their country Panem and a potential rallying point for revolution. This places them in a dramatically compelling situation Either they become stooges for the evil regime the Capitol or the Capitol will have them killed. Katniss knows this because the president (Donald Sutherland) tells her in so many words. In the world of Panem we are left in no doubt of the governments willingness to kill entire districts full of people. These leaders are evil - and not in the grand way of Darth Vader but in the small scared way of despotic politicians. In the face of this Katniss spends much of the first part of ""Catching Fire"" in a state of barely suppressed panic. That she sees no way out feels real and it makes it easy to connect with her plight Shes not trying to do anything besides keep herself and her family alive. An early scene captures the double tyranny of technology and propaganda. At one point Katniss and Peeta stand together in their desolate poverty-ridden neighborhood. But through some holographic magic their images are projected onto a glitzy soundstage where a grotesque game-show host - played by Stanley Tucci in an homage to Joel Grey - interviews them. Such is the difference between reality and illusion. In a way Tucci with his white teeth and wig and his party-time-in-hell manner is the scariest figure in ""Catching Fire"" not unlike the Indonesian talk show hosts in the documentary ""The Act of Killing"" who are shown merrily praising death-squad murderers. The depiction of a craven television medias employing all its flashy insincerity in the service of power comes so close to modern-day reality that its chilling. Its hard to see why the Capitol is so scared of Katniss. Shes frightened enough to be ripe for corruption. All they have to do is move her and her family to a nice place and leave them alone and shed never be heard from again. But no that would be too easy. And that would be half a movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a strong new addition as Plutarch Heavensbee the new master of the games and the presidents closest collaborator. Like Sutherland Lawrence and the rest of the actors he isnt slumming. He brings a magnetic and elusive calm to the role. ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is best in its first hour when it concentrates on the politics and the specific horrors of Panem. It becomes more conventional in the second half and loses steam but its always heading somewhere. One might say that the next installment should be even better but as has become typical these days the third book in the Suzanne Collins trilogy is being made into two movies not one. So theyre going to milk this until its dry. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Grade A- Just how much of a feminist heroine is Katniss Everdeen? Lets just say that in the course of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" she literalizes Hillary Clintons accomplishment of making 18 million cracks in a glass ceiling. Katniss a country girl whos adept at bringing down game with her archery isnt ideological or programmatic. She simply doesnt want anyone telling her what to think and feel or how to live. Her battle-hardened purity is the reason she can win support in all the districts of a post-apocalyptic plutocracy called Panem including the decadent Capitol where citizens embrace her as a passionate incendiary celebrity. If theres one thing Katniss cant stand its friends and allies withholding information. In ""Catching Fire"" good people like her grizzled funky mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) do it only to protect her - and because they trust shell do the right thing anyway. At the climax of ""The Hunger Games"" Katniss pretended that she loved Peeta the male contestant from their Appalachia-like District 12. She signaled that she would rather commit suicide with him than kill him prompting authorities to proclaim them the Hunger Games first joint winners. In ""Catching Fire"" - the second vastly superior film to come from novelist Suzanne Collins Hunger Games trilogy - Katniss faces the consequences of breaking the rules of the Games. Near the start President Snow (Donald Sutherland) demands that Katniss and Peeta persuade their countrymen that they really are romantic lovers - or be killed with their families. For a girl who thinks her true love is rugged coalminer and hunter Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) rather than personable bakers son Peeta that pressure proves dizzying enough. Katniss soon learns that the oppressed people of the districts see through her charade and cheer it on as an act of defiance against the Capitol. Shes the target of an evil government a symbol of righteous revolt and for most of the movie a mystery to herself. With the bulk of the action outside the arena the challenge for this deft compressed adaptation is to pull you into Katniss struggle for grace under pressure. With Jennifer Lawrence the filmmakers have the right gal for the job. Rather than play an inchoate personality as someone pallid and wishy-washy Lawrence puts a precise vivid sheen on each facet of Katniss developing awareness. Of course shes bracingly alert on the hunt. Shes equally thrilling when in a moment of shattering street-wise disdain Katniss confronts the Hunger Games designers with their legacy of carnage. Lawrence achieves her own kind of rooted regality as Katniss blooms into a revolutionary icon. Like Katniss Lawrence turns out to be a splendid team player. She brings out the best in the actors who play the men in her life. Harrelson is alternately hilarious and electrifying as Haymitch a soused nutty uncle figure who comes off crazy like a fox. Hemsworth wears his big-lug allure lightly and doesnt overplay his suffering. Hutcherson brings Peeta boyish energy and manly dignity; he calls Katniss out for looking at him as if hes wounded then blames himself for acting like hes wounded. You can see why Katniss amorous impulses are a jumble. The director Francis Lawrence (no relation) conjures a credibly frightening future and he does it the old-fashioned way by building detail upon detail. The camera shakes less and takes in more of the landscape than it did in the first film. You better understand the districts separate functions. The depiction of District 11 as a sprawling latter-day plantation is particularly evocative - and chilling. Stanley Tucci is now actually funny instead of air-quotes ""funny"" as the Games host Caesar Flickerman. The actor is wonderfully amusing when this not-so-mighty Caesar confronts unruly life invading the artificial life of his TV program. Elizabeth Banks brings some off-kilter humanity to Effie Trinket Katniss and Peetas fashion-crazed escort. She remains a dithery fashion plate all pouffy dresses and outre wigs but shes now touching as well as risible. This featherbrain has a heart She exhibits exemplary group loyalty. She gives each representative of District 12 something golden like Katniss mockingjay pin. These gifts help create a profound surprise during the games. In the storys turning point President Snow unconvinced by Katniss romantic act and agitated by her growing popularity re-crafts the Hunger Games for its 75th edition. It will be a contest more like ""Top Chef Masters"" or an all-star year of ""Dancing With the Stars."" The list of male and female competitors and mentors are drawn from surviving victors - so its inevitable that Katniss will fight again. Haymitch gets called to compete but Peeta volunteers to take his place. Its as if theyve been called up on a stop- loss. (Haymitch will once more be on hand to guide them.) Because the competitors are veterans rather than mostly untested kids they emphasize strategy and teamwork rather than individual might and bravado. Instead of the panic-driven horror shows of the first movie director Lawrence manages to create textured multifaceted chases and battles varying them to suit a host of supporting scene-stealers. Jena Malone is superbly feisty as Johanna Mason an axe wielding Amazon from the timberlands of District 7 and Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer kindle eccentric chemistry as brainiacs from the technological industries of District 3. Watching over all of them is Plutarch Heavensbee the new Head Gamemaker played by Philip Seymour Hoffman with his inimitable air of tension rippling beneath calm. No actor is better at promising revelations to come. The timing for this movie couldnt be better. Liberals should embrace its condemnation of elites who view society as their rumpus room. Conservatives will argue that it warns against the tendency of central governments to become tyrannical. Everyone will connect to its vision of a surveillance society spiraling out of control. Movie lovers should applaud this sequel for improving on the best parts of the original. What ""Catching Fire"" really ignites is the power of imagination.

Comments click to enlarge The Hunger Games Catching Fire -- The IMAX Experience Rated PG-13  146 minutes  2013 Having offended the despotic central government future world every-teen Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is forced to re-enter the title competition in which strangers fight to the death on national TV. Like The Hunger Games (2012) this sequel is a triumph of production design Philip Messinas settings are so detailed that they convey how the movies dystopic U.S. functions beyond the story at hand and Trish Summervilles costume design shows a similar degree of invention. Director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) and cinematographer Jo Willems maintain the house style established in the first film respectively by Gary Ross and Tom Stern frequently disrupting the effects-heavy sequences with handheld close-ups. Its refreshing to see a Hollywood franchise so invested in creating a sense of intimacy even if that intimacy feels hackneyed.

Jon Furniss/Invision/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday November 21 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""Shes done shes lovely we must feed the monster."" Thats Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) publicity maven and doyenne of sadistic mayhem in ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" as she prepares the series heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) to meet her adoring public. Fans will remember that Katniss and her fellow ""tribute"" Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have just won the 74th Hunger Games the gruesome Darwinian ritual designed to pacify and terrorize the citizens of Panem a grim futuristic society thats one part ancient Rome one part fascist Germany and one part fin de siecle France. As ""Catching Fire"" gets underway Katniss and Peeta are touring the benighted districts of Panem where a restive populace is spoiling for revolution. Urged on by the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) they ratchet up their ginned-up romance distracting the starving impoverished masses with hints of a wedding and just maybe an impending baby bump. Despite their obvious historical allusions the ""Hunger Games"" films -- based on the cult hit series of novels by Suzanne Collins -- are very much about America today from the consumerist decadence and obscene disparities in wealth enjoyed by Panems smug one percent to a reality-show culture of competition thats been taken to murderous extremes. Taking its cue as much from ""Project Runway"" as from ""Survivor"" Collinss universe is one in which couture dresses carry as much meaning and empowerment as weaponry. In this installment its a full hour and a half before Katniss embarks on a new set of games providing lots of time for her to simmer angrily at the injustices she witnesses. While she reluctantly goes along with Snows bread-and-circuses ruse she acts as model and muse for her unfailingly on-trend stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) who once again can be counted on to come up with sartorial showstoppers that may or may not burst into flames at the wearers command. 1 of 38 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Jennifer Lawrence Her red-carpet style is Catching Fire View Photos Heres a breakdown of the Oscar winner and emerging fashion icons red-carpet looks.

Academy Awards 2014 Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 86th Academy Awards on March 2. Lawrence who was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in ""American Hustle"" wore a red Christian Dior couture gown. Mike Blake/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Cue Alicia Keys Whereas for some of us the confounding cosmology of kids killing other kids for pleasure and political expedience reeks of cynicism and downright perversion fans of ""The Hunger Games"" should find ""Catching Fire"" a superlative advancement of the franchise. Director Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") taking the reins from Gary Ross smoothly steers the characters through their latest course of depredations and abuse allowing plenty of moments to simply sit back and groove on the eye candy. Filming in icy blues and greys Francis Lawrence evokes the despair of Katnisss world back home where jack-booted thugs (a.k.a. ""Peacekeepers"") routinely whip torture and shoot dissenters. Keenly aware of his adolescent audience the director always manages to look away before the violence becomes too icky. Once Katniss Peeta and their fellow competitors reach the giant terrarium that serves as their latest ""arena"" they face a series of desert island risks that include toxic fog squalls of blood explosive lightning and a tribe of the most terrifying monkeys since ""The Wizard of Oz."" At nearly two and a half hours ""Catching Fire"" may well strike non-""Games"" players as insufferably sluggish especially during the interminable run-up to the games when host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci doing his best Martin Short) introduces the new cast of players. Newcomers include the spiky Johanna (Jena Malone) the bespectacled Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Finnick (Sam Claflin) each of whom will figure prominently in Katnisss new challenge. Once again Katniss and Peeta are coached by the lovably goofy duo of Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie whose outfits still call to mind Vivienne Westwood run gleefully amok. And a new more mysterious figure has also appeared on the scene Plutarch Heavensbee a malevolent game designer played with rumpled seriousness by Philip Seymour Hoffman. As has been proved in the Marvel ""Avengers"" series having such genuinely accomplished actors channel such outlandish fantasy makes all the difference. Everyone hits their marks with gusto and believability in ""Catching Fire"" -- even Liam Hemsworth who has next to nothing to do as Katnisss hometown squeeze Gale. But the engine of the entire operation is Jennifer Lawrence who in Katniss has found a character that chimes perfectly with her own persona as an earthy blunt-speaking ingenue suddenly thrust into a world of celebrity and media-fueled idol worship. Somehow managing to look like a real flesh-and-blood girl even in ""Catching Fires"" most bizarre tableaux Lawrence is never less than compelling her rounded cheeks suggesting innocence but her sharp alert gaze suggesting otherwise whether shes aiming her notorious bow and arrow or scrutinizing Cinnas latest incendiary creation. Much like the young heroine she doesnt play as much as inhabit from the inside out Lawrence is a force of nature. Even viewers who watch ""Catching Fire"" unwillingly wont be able to resist her gravitational pull which in her case isnt a function of conventional movie-star looks but character and command presence. Her final steely stare at the camera says it all suggesting an actress fully equipped and ready to navigate her brave often depraved new world. Ive got this the look seems to say. The monster must be fed.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and profanity. 146 minutes. ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" opens in theaters around the world and fans everywhere are celebrating. (Reuters) goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com The Hunger Games Catching Fire Share Comment Books good. Movies better. Wait what? A sequel that unexpectedly improves on its predecessor ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is a muscular engrossing powerfully bleak epic directed with urgency and a skilled eye by Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend""). Starring Jennifer Lawrence as reluctant heroine Katniss Everdeen the movie takes pains to show its young mass audience what living under a totalitarian dictatorship might look and feel like. And the spectacle of a future society amusing itself to death--of ""reality games"" and the vapid media hysteria that surrounds them--stingingly references our own televised bread and circuses. At its best ""Catching Fire"" is a blockbuster that bites the culture that made it. With Josh Hutcherson Philip Seymour Hoffman Woody Harrelson and Jena Malone.

"The Hunger Games Catching Fire -- let the mind games begin Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Hunger Games Catching Fire -- let the mind games begin ReviewTeen scrapper Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is forced into battle again yet blockbuster sequel is no dull replay. Jennifer Lawrence returns to her starring role as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Catching Fire.  (Murray Close)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 20 2013The Hunger Games Catching FireStarring Jennifer Lawrence Woody Harrelson Josh Hutcherson Donald Sutherland Philip Seymour Hoffman Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer. Directed by Francis Lawrence. Opens Nov. 22. See Star listings for theatres and show times. 145 minutes. PGNo need to get a cannon ready for The Hunger Games Catching Fire.This is no dull replay of the first movie even though noble teen scrapper Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is forced into gladiatorial combat again.Article Continued BelowThe stakes have gotten larger and also vastly more interesting with the title games stretching from the battlefield into the mind. Katniss finds herself with many more admirers and enemies and its becoming harder to distinguish between the two.These welcome complications following directly from the franchise starter and faithful to the bestselling teen novels by Suzanne Collins help rescue Catching Fire from blockbuster boredom.So does a creditable cast of returning and new players. The latter include Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as nerdy plot movers and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensee the Machiavellian rule maker for the Hunger Games which have been amped up for their 75th edition.With Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) smoothly taking the directorial reins from Gary Ross the sequel narrative reunites victors of previous games -- even though theyd been promised by the despotic rulers of dystopian Panem that theyd never again be ""reaped"" for this Darwinian death match. Thats what you get for trusting a fascist.Cue Survivor All Stars comparison. Deadly archer Katniss and her deadly serious District 12 teammate Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are obliged to rejoin the jungle fray which has been made more lethal with the addition of acidic fog killer monkeys blood rain and ferocious lightning.Rival combatants are also more dangerous since they now know how to play for keeps. One woman has filed her teeth into vampiric spikes all the better for ripping out a mans throat.Haunted by her near-death experiences in the first film Katniss just wants to return home to impoverished District 12 like Dorothy going back to Kansas. But shes become the symbolic leader of a growing resistance movement whose members defy authority with a three-fingered salute and Mockingjay bird call.Her proletarian appeal doesnt go unnoticed by Heavensee or by Panems suavely sinister President Snow (Donald Sutherland) who along with their fellow pampered inhabitants of Panems gilded Capitol fear a revolt by starving peasants more than they do bad ratings for their televised Hunger Games.If all this isnt enough for a gal to think about Katniss also must fret over two would-be lovers and maybe three. Peeta is still carrying a torch for her and her childhood best friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) is angling for an upgrade. And what about new guy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) he of buff bod and roving eye?In the romance department Catching Fire and its predecessor are as chaste as the opening chapters of The Twilight Saga but the action sequences are far superior to that dreary vampire slog -- and also more frightening. Parents are advised to take that ""parental guidance"" rating seriously. The emotional anchor remains Katniss who Lawrence skilfully portrays as brave and resilient but also headstrong and vulnerable.But its less of a one-woman show than before. The film also develops secondary figures previously met who dont always act the way youd expect.They include Hutchersons surprisingly resourceful Peeta; Woody Harrelsons well-oiled mentor/agitator Haymitch Abernathy; Elizabeth Bankss peacock-attired Games mascot Effie Trinket; Lenny Kravitzs soulful dressmaker Cinna; and Stanley Tuccis purple-haired TV pitchman Caesar Flickerman.Capable actors all they encourage us to care about characters whose very names scream cartoon.Were never quite sure what any of them are up to but they make us want to find out -- and for a blockbuster sequel thats the best way to win the game.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Jennifer Lawrence dominates a gripping second chapter -- but is ""The Hunger Games"" for the left or the Tea Party? Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Donald Sutherland Editors Picks Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence Liam Hemsworth Movies Our Picks Our Picks Movies Philip Seymour Hoffman Science Fiction and Fantasy Stanley Tucci Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games The Hunger Games Catching Fire Entertainment News Jennifer Lawrence in ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" (Credit Murray Close) Much of the genius of the ""Hunger Games"" franchise lies in its portrayal of a dystopian future society that lacks any specific ideological character. Panem the deep-future dictatorship that has apparently replaced present-day America after an unspecified combination of civil war social meltdown and ecological catastrophe has the semiotic appearance of fascism - white-helmeted storm troopers and barbed-wire walls - but is really more like an old-fashioned feudal society concerned entirely with maintaining its internal order. In reviewing the first ""Hunger Games"" movie I observed that the relentless media onslaught of the Information Age has been rolled back in author Suzanne Collins fictional universe to one TV network and one reality show. Politics has been stripped down too There is nothing except Empire and Resistance.I have no idea whether Collins understood while writing her best-selling trilogy of novels that this would allow Tea Party libertarians to embrace Katniss Everdeens incipient rebellion against the tyranny of the effete aestheticized and affluent Capital as easily as could Obama liberals or left-wing anarchists. Is this a story of the 99 percent rising against their corporate overlords or of real Americans ""taking their country back"" from the cultural elite? Of course its more likely Collins was seeking narrative clarity and simplicity for a young-adult audience -- a situation where the good guys and bad guys appear clearly delineated as in World War II or apartheid South Africa. (Collins has been understandably cagey about her personal politics although she has said the idea for ""The Hunger Games"" came to her after encountering reality-TV and Iraq War coverage on the same night.)Theres a naivete to the politics of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" the second movie chapter thats simultaneously appealing and troubling. ""This is the revolution"" someone announces near the end of the film with stentorian certainty. (I wont tell you who.) Yes OK the revolution. Great But a revolution led by whom conducted how and with what goals in mind? No one in the story or in the audience has any idea. None of which detracts much from the gathering momentum of this ripping yarn or the charismatic tomboy presence of Jennifer Lawrence Hollywoods irresistible It Girl in a role that is likely to define her entire career. Perhaps the most useful thing I can tell you about ""Catching Fire"" is that I went in dreading its 146-minute running time especially after the messy and often undercooked first film and was so captivated by the vibrant spectacle -- seeing the movie in IMAX is actually worth it this time around -- that I was startled when the closing credits began to roll. Its a middle chapter for sure but a vigorous and fast-paced one that leaves you hungry for more. (Theres only one book left to go ""Mockingjay"" but as is customary these days its been split into two films.)In the first installment Katniss (Lawrence) and fellow District 12 ""tribute"" Peeta Mellark (the perennially wounded-looking Josh Hutcherson) successfully stood up to the voyeurism and sadism of the Hunger Games by staging a not-entirely-fake romantic subplot and refusing to kill each other for the entertainment of millions. Now they live in the sterile luxury of Victors Village alongside drunken former winner Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson with a Lord Byron haircut) largely unaware that their act of defiance has sparked rebellion in many of the enslaved proletarian districts of Panem. Katniss remains rather boringly torn between love-struck Peeta and brooding coal miner Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) neither of whom is really up to her standard. In some ways her most interesting relationship in ""Catching Fire"" is with Donald Sutherland as the leonine unctuous President Snow a sinister father figure who yearns to exploit distort and/or destroy Katniss. They forge a short-term alliance in which Snow promises to keep Katniss family safe if she and Peeta stage a lovebirds victory tour of all the districts that will help him keep the peace. You Might Also Like Katniss is unwilling to read the prepared texts given to her by her Capital minder the marvelously named and attired Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) but going off the script only worsens the tension and violence - one of the first notes of political ambiguity in this entire series. (As those whove read the books already know that tendency will accelerate in the two movies yet to come.) Having executed last years game designer Snow turns to a cynical new adviser named Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman marvelous as ever) who assures the president he has a new ""wrinkle"" that will destroy Katniss credibility as a symbol of rebellion. Its the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games - time for a special ""reaping"" that will bring together a collection of previous victors in a new contest and thereby wipe out all but one of them.There was no particular reason to think that Austrian-born director Francis Lawrence (of ""I Am Legend"" and many music videos) deserved to take this franchise over from Hollywood veteran Gary Ross who directed the first film. But ""Catching Fire"" is much crisper more driven and more balanced than its predecessor and while the Hunger Games themselves remain a what-the-hell series of ludicrous adventures - poison fog Tsunami waves Killer baboons Hillary Clinton (OK one of those things isnt really in the movie) - Lawrence keeps the pedal to the metal. Perhaps more important the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn never loses track of the fact that the game action is metaphorical and the real drama is happening outside the arena (revealed conclusively on this occasion to be an arena). The most enjoyable supporting characters from the first movie are back including Haymitch Effie and Stanley Tucci as ponytailed TV host Caesar Flickerman his tanned skin and fluorescent teeth emitting a radioactive glow. Best among the new Hunger Games tributes are Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as a pair of autistic-coded technical geniuses along with yet another Katniss-distracting tormented hunk the excessively noble Finnick Odair played by English actor Sam Claflin. Ultimately the entire ""Hunger Games"" franchise is self-contradictory as is nearly all of pop culture. In fact its precisely the thing it claims to criticize or oppose a work of symbolic and quasi-therapeutic violence designed to make us feel better about oppressive conditions. That doesnt mean the disaffection it channels isnt real or that this shared pop-culture pseudo-revolution has no meaning. Only that we dont know what it is and that when Katniss finally has to pick between her two boyfriends well all be disappointed. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1005 p.m. EST November 20 2013The Oscar-winning actress beautifully conveys stoicism and bouts of emotional turbulence.Jennifer Lawrence returns as heroine Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Catching Fire.(Photo Murray Close Lionsgate)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  1/2 out of 4Stars Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Woody Harrelson Elizabeth Banks Donald SutherlandRated PG-13; runtime 2 hours 26 minutes; opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwideIts almost as if the role of Katniss Everdeen the sad-eyed but steely heroine of the best-selling series The Hunger Games was written expressly for Jennifer Lawrence.With The Hunger Games Catching Fire (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13 opening Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide) Lawrence has evolved believably in the role of the increasingly rebellious Katniss. The Oscar-winning actress can nimbly pull off the dazzling fashion-show moments in this futuristic drama as well as the considerable action exploits and emotional shadings required of her tortured character. Whether on the runway or shooting an arrow Lawrence is powerfully convincing.Based on the books by Suzanne Collins this second in the series follows Katniss after she has returned home from winning the fight-to-the-death competition along with her partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). (Its a grim game of sheer survival pitting pairs from each of 12 oppressed districts.) Katniss and Peeta have been handsomely rewarded their bleak poverty-stricken lives replaced with physical comforts courtesy of the totalitarian regime they live under. But there is discontent brewing.REVIEWS The latest reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHOLIDAY MOVIE CALENDAR NovemberKatniss and Peeta are ordered by the tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to embark on a Victors Tour to distract the increasingly agitated public from its oppression The sinister leader is convinced that proof of their abiding love will conquer all thoughts of revolt. As if.When revolution seems imminent the government institutes public floggings and executions to quell the populace. Still insurrection simmers.In turn Katniss grows more radicalized but shes compelled to keep her instincts under control -- or harm will come to her family. She must find more insidious ways to fight the power.Thanks to pointed changes in the rule book Katniss is drafted into a special anniversary Hunger Games contest. Again she faces a cutthroat challenge with Peeta as her partner. This time previous winners compete so the all-star stakes are tougher. The structure of this sequel remains similar to the first film as per Collins novel but it also fits neatly into Hollywoods tendency to recycle successful formats.The glitzy talk show hosted by the lavender-haired Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) re-surfaces as does ultra-flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) who oversees Katniss and Peeta. The capital city of Panem is as gleaming as ever but legions of military police look like theyre wearing dusted-off Star Wars Stormtrooper costumes.The post-apocalyptic story starts slowly building momentum. It begins to lag about two hours in. More judicious editing would have improved it. Also the moral implications of the bloodbath seem less troubling to the contestants which is a distressing turn.Overall the sequel to last years Hunger Games is grittier and the atmosphere more brooding which suits the increasingly dystopian theme of the stories. But it also feels like a re-tread.Katniss starts out haunted by the games and Peeta is disillusioned that her part in their romance was apparently just for the cameras. She is torn between two would-be lovers--Peeta whom she fought with and admires and her childhood friend and beau Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). The teen love triangle remains front and center to keep youthful book fans engaged. But the films social commentary on celebrity obsession is more intriguing than the bland teen romance.While sci-fi special effects like blood rain vicious baboons and a poisonous fog are striking a cliffhanger ending comes almost abruptly.Still The Hunger Games Catching Fire is crowd-pleasing and compelling most of all because of its fiery charismatic heroine. 732 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c3MXSCHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

Its on stage in the Capitol of Panem that future American dystopia -- in fantasy fiction is there any other -topia? -- the night before the 75th Hunger Games when Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) the TV host with the Guy Smiley smarminess and the phosphorescent teeth is interviewing Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) the expert archer from District 12. Outfitted in a spectacular white chiffon wedding dress with silver metal wings Katniss strides down the runway and commences to spin. The gown bursts into flame and morphs into a slinky black outfit also with wings that represents the mockingjay the icon of Panems rebels. I am not your plaything Katniss quick change says to the Capitol swells; I am the dark surging spirit of revolution. Scandal. Sensation Show biz Rarely have a political declaration and a fashion statement merged so stunningly. (READ Lev Grossmans conversation with Suzanne Collins and Catching Fire director Francis Lawrence) Bravo to costume designer Trish Summerville and to Tex Saverio the Indonesian who created that gloriously gaudy wedding gown. (Saverio has also coutured for Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian and you can tell.) But it says something about the mixed pleasures and longueurs of this erratically entertaining movie that one wants to applaud the dressmakers before mentioning the director Austrian music-video grad Francis Lawrence or the screenwriters Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and ""Michael deBruyn"" a pseudonym for Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3 scripter Michael Arndt. The climactic third Quarter Quell a televised Most Dangerous Game pitting victors of the previous killer Olympics against one another has its kicks and surprises. But the real fun is glomming the glam in the frocks sported by Katniss her competitors and her dizzy escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) whose gaiety is strained nearly hysterical and whose outre garb is so tight it seems ready to crush her like a Lycra python. Youll come for Survivors All-Stars and stay for Project Runway All Stars. (READ The Katniss Conundrum Is She Okay For Young Kids?) Last years The Hunger Games a box-office champ with nearly 700 million worldwide introduced the notion of an annual killer Olympics. Two ""tributes"" representing each section of Panem from posh District 1 all the way down to Katnisss Appalachian disaster zone District 12 hunted one another for televised sport. Volunteering in place of her kid sister Primrose (Willlow Shields) and leaving her hunky stammering beau Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth -- Thors younger brother) back home Katniss managed to save herself and her fellow 12er Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Her winning ruse she only pretended to eat the fatal berries. (READ Corlisss review of The Hunger Games) Vexed to the max that two Victors had emerged and both from his least favorite District President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) is pleased to proclaim the Quarter Quell a kill-off pitting past Victors who had been told that winning a Game earned them a lifetime sinecure of luxury and well not dying in gruesome combat. Under the direction of new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose Cheshire Cat smile conceals no end of connivance Katniss will vie with Peeta against some expert foes including  the preening hunk Fiddick (Sam Claflin) and the punkster Johanna (Jena Malone). May the best Victor live. Portent outweighs action in an episode that builds tension and marks time until the movie series conclusion Mockingjay which -- following the lead of films based on the final books in the Harry Potter and Twilight Saga series and honoring the older Hollywood tradition of greedily extending popular franchises -- will be made as two films for release next Nov. and in 2015. Then finally all Panem-demonium promises to break loose and the war games will burst into real war. (READ Eliana Dockterman on 5 Ways Katniss Is Better Than Twilights Bella) ""Would you like to be in a real war?"" whispers President Snow at the beginning of Catching Fire as if hes offering poisoned candy to a child. ""No"" replies Katniss and Snow says ""Neither would I."" In a rebellion of the serfs Snow could lose his post as the purring tyrant of Panem and Katniss could lose her life. Yet the war drums perhaps as imitated by that chimerical creature the mockingjay start to throb in this middle-child installment. The coded message is urgent but the movies tempo is languorous. Collins has said the books were inspired by the Greek myth of the Minotaur (who demanded the sacrifice of seven boys and seven girls until Theseus killed the beast) and the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome -- here less bread for the poor provinces more circuses for the one-percenters. The Hunger Games is no less indebted to a zillion other action movies and their sequels in which the hero or heroine of the first movie must then confront another star adversary. Katniss tangling with Fiddick and Johanna echoes the battles of Alien and Predator Freddie and Jason. (READ Collins -- ""I was destined to write a gladiator game"") The series also puts you in mind of reality shows and their TV kin that go heavy on the up-close-and-personal aspects of the players. Like Super Bowl Sunday when more TV time is wasted on pre-game folderol than is spent on actual football Catching Fire moseys through half of its 2-hour-and-26-minute running time setting up Katnisss rivalries and dropping hints of things to come before the Quell Games begin. The first half concentrates on Katnisss post-Victor stress disorder (""I should have eaten the berries"") her shock at the grim reality of the other Districts she tours and her resolve to join the rebellion. ""Im not going anywhere"" she tells the faithful Gale."" Im gonna stay right here cause all kind of trouble."" Once in the jungle the movie sparks to life with pools of scalding water attacks by evil monkeys and Katniss complicated relationships with Johanna (two alpha females vying for queen of the pride) and Fiddick. (This warrior woman has more potential suitors than any Disney princess.) She also befriends an older couple Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Wiress (Amanda Plummer). The two-time Tony winners (he for Angels in America and Topdog/Underdog she for Agnes of God and Pygmalion) could have been content slumming in genre fare. Instead they invest their roles with intelligence and urgency. As in so many films Plummer is again the feral lady; some day she may get a movie role that allows her to speak in complete coherent sentences. (READ Lev Grossmans review of the Hunger Games book) Francis Lawrence who replaced Gary Ross to direct the last three Hunger Games films previously made the vigorous Constantine (Keanu Reeves vs. the antichrist) Will Smiths post-Apocalypse vampire movie I Am Legend and the soppy period drama Water for Elephants. Taking advantage of the bigger budget (130 million to the first films 78 million) he brings scope if not grandeur to the early section size if not sizzle to the Games. Theres a natural lapse in tension from The Hunger Games -- when the strategy was kill-or-be-killed and a human or synthetic predator could emerge at any moment -- to Catching Fire where theres more alliance-building than manslaughter. We also wish the Caesar segments sashayed with a more divoon decadence. But that for the producers of Catching Fire would be quibbling. The directors main job is to find a hundred ways to film his leading lady in closeup Lawrence shooting Lawrence. (READ Corliss on Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook) Thats fine with us since watching this actress from her breakthrough role in Winters Bone to her emergence as a star has been an eerie fulfilling pleasure. Since the first film the 23-year-old has won an Oscar (for Silver Linings Playbook) and cemented her rep as Americas most watchable young star. Her sullen face sponges up the emotions of other characters and of the viewer. Spinning in that wedding dress or glaring in wary repose Lawrence catches fire on screen. Shell make a superb La Pasionaria when Panem has a real war in the Mockingjay films. Maybe they will transcend fan fodder and offer the wonder of superior popular entertainment. Whatever Katness wears heres hoping that third -- and fourth -- times the charm.

"The Hunger Games Catching Fire 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Hunger Games Catching Fire 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Nov 19 2013 1236 PM Well this was unexpected ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is a good movie. Not an OK movie like the first one which seemed flat and somehow listless even while tributes from 12 districts were slaughtering each other for the amusement of the masses. An actual good movie; having Jennifer Lawrence at the center of things helps immeasurably. Yes the film based on the immensely popular Suzanne Collins novels for tweens has plot holes and head-scratching motives galore. Like the ""Twilight"" franchise it never forgets its target audience and if the grown-ups have to raise an eyebrow every so often so be it. A switch in directors helps. Francis Lawrence takes over for Gary Ross and immediately you realize that this somehow feels more like a big movie. Ross overdid it with the handheld cameras striving for realism that instead felt herky-jerky and cheap. Lawrence treats the film more like an event and it shows. ""Catching Fire"" picks up where ""The Hunger Games"" left off. In case youre not up to speed In a dystopian future in a place called Panem every year each of the 12 districts that make up the country offer up two tributes. These are young people who compete in a reality show that is in fact a fight to the death. Last person standing wins. Its an ill-disguised way for the fascist government led by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to keep its citizens oppressed. In ""The Hunger Games"" Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) the tribute from dirt-poor District 12 managed to both win the games and engineer a way for her friend and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) to also survive. As Snow points out in a visit to Katniss home early on she is now a symbol of hopefor many of the downtrodden. This wont do so she and Peeta are sent on a winners tour of all the districts pretending to be in love. Its a disaster touching off riots. Katniss growing popularity is becoming a threat to the government so Snow and new game designer Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) scheme to take her down one way or another. This leads to a sort of Hunger Games All-Star Edition in which winners of previous games are forced to compete again. It seems like a pretty obvious way to get Katniss and Peeta back in the arena and the set-up is the films weakest segment. One stretch plays like a repeat from the first film. But the competition introduces some welcome new additions such as Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as a couple of high-I.Q. odd ducks Jena Malone as a woman vividly unhappy to be called back and Sam Claflin as a handsome winner who has cashed in in big ways. Back from the first film are Woody Harrelson Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci; the latter is especially good (again) as the effusive host of a talk show about the games. His blindingly white teeth and purple hair are not what make him ridiculous; his manner somehow cynical and sycophantic is. Knowing the competitors a little better helps a lot. We have people to root for and against and never lose that nagging feeling that no one can be trusted (because in fact no one can). There can be only one winner after all at least this time. Then again there are two more sequels to come (theyre splitting the third book into two movies) so not everything will be resolved by the end of the film. Quite the opposite actually. Things are however established and reconfirmed. One is Lawrences continued screen presence which is considerable. Another is Francis Lawrence ability to get his arms around so unwieldy a story. (Hes signed on for the final two installments.) ""Catching Fire"" is a great leap forward for the franchise. Seeing as its all about hope and what it represents heres hoping the next two are just as good if not better. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Review Hunger Games Catching Fire burns bright with fiery Katniss - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Hunger Games Catching Fire burns bright with fiery Katniss The Hunger Games Catching Fire (Trailer) Trailer 3 for The Hunger Games Catching Fire Trailer 3 for The Hunger Games Catching Fire Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Second movies in a series can be such a comfort We already know the key characters we have a sense of where the plot is going we just have to hang on and enjoy the thrills. Which is what happens with ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire.""An effective piece of melodramatic popular entertainment that savvily builds on the foundation established by the first ""Hunger Games"" movie ""Catching Fire"" layers in increased visual brio while remaining faithful to the essence of a trilogy popular enough to have more than 50 million copies in print. That brio comes courtesy of director Francis Lawrence who took over the series from Gary Ross. Though hes directed features such as ""I Am Legend"" and ""Water for Elephants"" it is Lawrences music video work thats won him multiple awards including a pair of Grammys and the expansion in size and scope this projects larger budget allows proves well within his power.PHOTOS The Hunger Games Catching Fire Los Angeles premiere That expansion is necessary because there is more at stake than ever in the world of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). While the first film took her from small town huntress to victory in the kill-or-be killed national tournament called the Hunger Games ""Catching Fire"" potentially gives her -- much against her will -- the possibility of a bigger role in the political landscape of the totalitarian future state known as Panem.Lawrences intertwined strength and vulnerability as Katniss were the sine qua non of the first film and she is the sequels biggest asset as well. Now an Oscar winner for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" Lawrence has clearly taken this role very much to heart throwing herself into it to such an extent that she creates genuine emotion from what is essentially pulpy material.Two capable screenwriters have adapted the Suzanne Collins novel Simon Beaufoy (an Oscar winner for ""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael deBruyn (a pseudonym for ""Little Miss Sunshines"" Michael Arndt). While the dialogue has an unavoidable signpost quality at times (and at 2 hours 26 minutes the film is longer than it needs to be) the script is structured in a way that emphasizes the qualities that have made the novels so successful.For what Collins adroitly did was place a kind of High School Confidential in very particular circumstances. Katniss the very picture of self-sufficiency cant make up her mind between two very different very cute guys vying for her affections old flame Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and new guy Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) whom she had to very publicly pretend to love in order to survive the games. Worse than that Katniss is so stressed out by her experiences in the games she cant decide if shes in love with anyone. Whats a girl to do? QUIZ Test your Catching Fire knowledgeAlso very appealing to the intended demographic are two key aspects of Katniss personality. On the one hand theres her youthful idealism Katniss burns with fury at the depredations of Panems ruling class epitomized by the oily manipulative President Snow (Donald Sutherland). On the other hand her natural self-effacing modesty restrains her from taking a leadership role in the incipient rebellion that her actions in the games seem to have precipitated. Again whats a girl to do?""Catching Fire"" begins with Katniss and Peeta scheduled to start on a Victory Tour of all of Panems districts to celebrate their joint Hunger Games triumph. This despite the fact that the aftereffects of their romantic deception has put both of them into very bad moods.Katniss mood is not elevated by a visit from President Snow. No fool he Snow is hip to her deal he knows that she and Peeta are far from lovebirds. But because Katniss willingness to take poison in the games has been viewed by some as an act of defiance rather than undying love he insists that she intensify her fake passion for Peeta or face the extermination of everyone she loves. This guy is no fun at all.But the country does not quiet down and Panems devious new gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decrees that its time for a Quarter Quell a special version of the games in which 24 former victors very much including Katniss will have to face off.PHOTOS See Jennifer Lawrences Hunger Games red-carpet looksThis new round of games allows for the return of key protagonists from the first film including Woody Harrelsons Haymitch Elizabeth Banks Effie Stanley Tuccis Caesar and Lenny Kravitzs Cinna. The success of the first film has also enabled the hiring of strong actors for new characters. Besides Hoffman these include Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as older odder victors Beetee and Wiress and Jena Malone and Sam Claflin as the younger considerably more physical Johanna and Finnick.Also new is the input of costume designer Trish Summerville who has upped the ante on clothing outrageousness for instance putting Effie in an Alexander McQueen monarch butterfly creation that defies belief and a fantasy wedding dress by Tex Saverio that morphs into something entirely different. It is the transformation of Lawrence however into a Katniss we can believe in that continues to make this franchise a success. kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------------------Hunger Games Catching FireMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and languageRunning time 2 hours 26 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Francis Lawrence The Hunger Games Catching Fire Reviews Suzanne Collins Philip Seymour Hoffman The Hunger Games Catching Fire Los Angeles premiere Fans mass expectantly at Hunger Games Catching Fire premiere Hunger Games Divergent The new wave of strong female-led sci-fi Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hunger-games-catching-fire-20131121,0,6371408.story#axzz2lCTpTaPD",200,thehungergamescatchingfire29,thehungergamescatchingfire,latimes
"The Hunger Games Catching Fire (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hunger Games Catching Fire (PG-13) The second installment in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise is a radical improvement. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) must once again fight for their lives. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com11/20/2013 Editor rating 3 Catching Fire is a work of thoughtful emotionally engaging sci-fi -- everything that its predecessor The Hunger Games was not. Filmmaker Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend Constantine) who took over the reins of the franchise from director Gary Ross uses the same approach Alfonso Cuaron did when he elevated the Harry Potter series with The Prisoner of Azkaban. He doesnt settle for just cutting and pasting Suzanne Collins novel onto film Lawrence makes an actual movie with characters who are much more than mirror reflections of the protagonists in the book. For example the budding love triangle between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) her fellow Hunger Games winner Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and her District 12 neighbor Gale (Liam Hemsworth) which in the first movie felt like a contrivance cribbed from Twilight now comes off as genuine and complicated; you fully understand how and why the young womans affections have been divided by two equally worthy suitors. Part of the reason may be that screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn arent burdened with having to introduce and establish these characters They only have to build on what came before. But the quality of the performances in Catching Fire is noticeably stronger -- Lawrence in particular seems much more concentrated and invested as the conflicted Katniss -- and the acting sells the human elements of this enormous movie anchoring the spectacle with characters you actually care about. Catching Fire will be utterly incomprehensible to anyone who didnt see the first film or read the books Lawrence doesnt coddle the audience with helpful exposition or backstory. The premise is simple The despot President Snow (Donald Sutherland) troubled by the increasing rebellion Katniss and Peeta have inspired amongst the populace after circumventing the rules of the annual kill-or-be-killed competition holds an all-star 75th anniversary of the games with all the contestants plucked from the pool of winners from previous years. With the help of his new assistant (a devious Philip Seymour Hoffman) Snow intends to make sure neither Katniss nor Peeta survive this time. The cast of Catching Fire has expanded allowing us to get to know more than just than a handful of the competitors. Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer are wonderfully strange as a pair of eggheads known as Nuts and Volts who use science not violence to compete in the event. Jena Malone is terrific as the prickly impatient Johanna and Sam Claflin exudes A-list charm as the handsome Finnick who may or may not be trustworthy. The basic structure of Catching Fire is almost identical to Hunger Games The first half of the movie is devoted to the ramp-up to the event and the second half concentrates on the deadly olympics. But the film never feels repetitious Instead our familiarity with the pageant invests the movie with subtle social commentary. Like President Ronald Reagan did when he appropriated Bruce Springsteens Born in the U.S.A. for political purposes Catching Fire illustrates how governments can use and manipulate entertainment in order to trick the hearts and minds of people. Catching Fire was made on a budget of 130 million -- a 50 million raise from the first movie -- and Lawrence puts all the extra money on the screen. Gone are the chintzy stage-bound feel and lousy CGI of the first film. The chariot sequence in The Hunger Games looked like it was shot against a green screen It was cheesy and unconvincing. The chariot sequence in Catching Fire looks like it was shot on location which may just be the result of better special-effects work. But the improvement in production values and shrewd changes in costuming and set design make the movie less cartoonish and more grave (Elizabeth Banks Effie Trinket still has a thing for ridiculously elaborate makeup and dresses but this time theyre not so garish that they make want to you look away from the screen). Even the violence while still rated PG-13 is more effective and brutal without being explicit. Catching Fire is the second chapter of what will be a series of four films so the fact that it ends on a whopper of a cliffhanger should surprise no one. The difference this time is that you come out of the theater eagerly awaiting the next picture. Suddenly this franchise has gotten interesting. Unlike so many other recent attempts to capitalize on the success of popular young adult novels Catching Fire plays as well to adults as it does to teenagers. Start lining up now.

Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen in the pleasant sequel Catching Fire. (Murray Close) B The Hunger Games Catching Fire Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Elizabeth Banks Woody Harrelson Liam Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson Jennifer Lawrence Donald Sutherland; Director Francis Lawrence; Author Suzanne Collins; Release Date Wide 11/22/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 146; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Lionsgate Posted December 4 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Last year in the avidly faithful but ultimately rather flat-footed screen version of The Hunger Games we saw Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) triumph in a Survivor-meets-gladiator teen war to the death. How did the stoic archeress from District 12 win the Hunger Games? By making herself over into a lethally clever (but never murderous) scamp of the woods. Now its out of the frying pan and into the even hungrier games. In The Hunger Games Catching Fire Katniss has become a star a lightning-rod symbol of the early stirrings of a peoples rebellion. But shes still the superwarrior girl next door; she wears her rebel impulses lightly if not politely. On a Victory Tour of the 12 districts she and her fellow champion Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have to carry on the charade that theyre in love and the first sign of Katniss insurrectionary fever is that shes not very good at faking it. (Or maybe its just that Hutcherson with his captain-of-the-cricket-team geek hunkitude isnt much of an inspiration.) As the two speak rebel miscreants are subdued by stormtroopers and the crowds just get angrier. So the ruling powers led by the velvet-voiced fascist President Snow (Donald Sutherland) figure its time to nip Katniss -- and the rebellion -- in the bud with the Quarter Quell a special once-every-25-years edition of the Games in which past winners compete against each other. In other words Its all badasses. Up on stage with Stanley Tuccis purple-eyebrowed gleaming-white-smiled Caesar -- the Ryan Seacrest of Oz -- Katniss shows off her wedding gown and the outfit burns down to reveal a stunning black Mockingjay dress. Its the revolution as fashion statement -- a wink to the masses watching her on TV. But in the presidential lair Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the sinister Games designer predicts that the blood sport to come will squelch her popularity. He smirks ""Lets watch her get her hands dirty"" Yet Katniss Everdeen does not get her hands dirty. She competes in ruthless kill-or-be-killed contests using her speed and wits but she never has to do anything too ugly or brutal -- or for my money too surprising. Theres a ritualistic quality to these films thats key to their appeal but it also limits their capacity to truly wow us. Catching Fire is more energized than the first Hunger Games movie; its been directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) with a darkly sustained verve. The Quarter Quell is more openly a contest between Katniss and the Capitol powers and in its gimmicky way its more gripping -- a lethal jungle fun house with Katniss and her allies facing down a toxic fog a vicious tribe of baboons even the arena itself. As newcomer Johanna Jena Malone delivers her lines with a scene-stealing screw-it-all nastiness and Sam Claflin nails the role of the wicked-smart former champion Finnick. As for Lawrence she more than holds her own turning her face into a dreamy-pale Valkyrie mask. You react to every wave of sadness and fury roiling around inside Katniss even when Katniss isnt allowed to show it. Catching Fire is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease. It gets mileage out of setting up the Quarter Quell as some ultimate Fear Factor version of Deliverance yet there isnt a moment of real dread in it. The film also sets up Katniss with her sizzling (in every way) costumes and goth-Cleopatra makeup as the feral face of revolt but the cliff-hanger finale reveals that she is thus far a passive agent in this revolution. Lawrence plays her as a riveting icon of girl power but I hope that in the upcoming sequels Katniss gets to show another dimension or two to go along with her precocious defiant strength.

Excessive over-produced obscenely over-budgeted and utterly pointless this second installment in the overrated trilogy of books by Suzanne Collins is nothing more than recycled ideas and stale CGI effects that seemed fresh and exciting the first time around the track but now hobble through the paces with the energy of a plow horse. As a wearer of distance glasses I hate the revival of 3-D a silly gimmick for kids from the 1950s that blighted everything from Bwana Devil to Kiss Me Kate then mercifully died out with House of Wax. So I was glad to watch the first Hunger Games without the discomfort of one pair of glasses worn over a second and I didnt miss a thing. I can live without another flying spear. This time I saw part two in IMAX a format that is a great advancement over 3-D but did nothing to improve this movie. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the original idea--a lethal combat in some distant world called Panem that was once America before the capitol was defeated in some unexplained apocalyptic war. The wreckage was divided into 12 districts. Every year each district sent one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 chosen by lottery to compete in a nationally televised event called The Hunger Games. The purpose a mass killing spree with only one survivor. The survivor was Jennifer Lawrence who became a star. O.K. we got the message. Now we get the sequel in which everything happens all over again. The 74th games are over and the 16-year-old lovers from District 12--a pretty girl named Katniss (Ms. Lawrence) and an even prettier boy named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)--are home but not for long. Dispatched on a ""victory tour"" to launch the 75th Hunger Games they have no idea they are marked for death by the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his bloodthirsty game planner Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). For reasons that are never satisfactorily explained its every man for himself with no winners. The rest of this interminable yawn drags everyone marching through hell most of all the audience. Here come the special effects. It rains blood. A poisonous fog rolls in eating the flesh of anyone it touches. Man-eating monkeys chase the gladiators through the jungles. There are holograms and people bursting into flames. Of course the indestructible Katniss survives it all and is guaranteed the rest of her life in peace. But the rules are broken every 10 minutes and nobody knows what will happen next. (Theres a third installment on the way.) If you didnt see the first movie you wont understand anything thats going on. I saw it and I still didnt understand it--except the violence and torture which were better the first time. This movie is so boring even the villains are no fun. The actors are uniformly awful but who can blame them with everyone saying lines like ""What does it mean?"" and ""Its not possible"" that inadvertently describe the film itself. Woody Harrelson is back in a long blond hippie wig and the TV master of ceremonies is once again Stanley Tucci in mascara and lipstick a campy cross between Liberace and one of the trashy Kardashians. Enough is enough. One good thing The jungle scenes were shot in Hawaii so at least they all got a paid vacation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Strangely enough one of the least interesting things about The Hunger Games last years dystopian YA smash was the Hunger Games themselves. Blame PG-13 for starters Suzanne Collins nightmarish conceit--Battle Royale meets Shirley Jacksons ""The Lottery"" with a reality-TV twist--was sanitized for multiplexes resulting in a weirdly bloodless blockbuster about kids killing kids. (In other words its hard to make a proper death-match movie for the whole family.) The bigger issue however is that once Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) the iron-willed archer from District 12 rose into that arena for battle moral ambiguity basically fell by the wayside. Suddenly there were rooting interests with the unlucky contestants cleanly divided into heroic or villainous camps and the film--once a satire now simply a run-of-the-mill action survival yarn--bent over backwards to assure that its heroine never faced any truly tough choices. It became clear in retrospect that the real drama had happened before the games in the bizarro-world media blitz that led into them. Thats true again in Catching Fire a sequel that manages thanks to a loophole in Panem law to mimic the basic structure of the original. Getting that bow back into Katniss hands required a little cheating on Collins part and reliable sources report that the second Hunger Games novel plays like a pale imitation of the first. Onscreen however the opposite is true Catching Fire may follow a recycled trajectory moving inevitably from the talk-show circuit to the battlefield but it does so with much more panache and wit than the last film did. Partly thats because directing duties have passed from Gary Ross (Seabiscuit) to Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) and Lawrence demonstrates a much steadier hand--figuratively and given the blessed lack of shakycam literally--than his predecessor. But it also has to do with the understanding shared by screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt that Collins post-apocalyptic setting is most fascinating as a kind of cracked-mirror reflection of our current celebrity age. Picking up months after the events of the previous installment Catching Fire finds Katniss still haunted by painful memories of the games and torn between two jealous suitors hometown boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) a little sore about seeing his beloved make out with another guy on national television and fellow competitor Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) similarly hurt to learn that his love affair was a show for the cameras. None too pleased about the way the winners gamed the Games forcing the powers that be to allow a draw President Snow (Donald Sutherland) imparts upon Katniss the importance of keeping up smitten appearances. Much of the films superb first hour thus plays like a high-stakes politicized dramatization of The Bachelorette with Katniss and Peeta forced to tour the districts as a happy couple smiling and waving to an increasingly unruly populace. But will they stick to the script? Theres danger and yes real drama in the way Catching Fire turns each public appearance into a propaganda war or what new Gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) calls a game of ""moves and countermoves."" Even more so than in the original the satire--of media as distraction of celebrity as power--has considerable heft. If but the same could be said for the love triangle. So commanding is Lawrence in her reprised role which requires both action-heroine steeliness and movie-star charisma that its a shame to see her paired off with a couple of duds. Surely there are better options for an eagle-eyed asskicker like Katniss than Gale brooding endlessly on the sidelines or Peeta with his clinginess and guilt trips? (Do any Hunger Games fans fall into Team Neither?) Aside from the bland love interests though Catching Fire is filthy with stellar backup--from Woody Harrelsons tough-love mentor figure to Stanley Tuccis leathery host to Hoffmans mysterious careerist. Like the Harry Potter series the Hunger Games films double as showcases (and easy paychecks) for a supporting cast of fine seasoned pros. Inevitably Catching Fire morphs into an action movie jettisoning the media skirmishes in favor of more running hiding in or around trees and dispatching underdeveloped rivals. Even in that respect however its an improvement on the last go around Lawrence stages the violence with less skittishness and more precision and the film keeps throwing new obstacles--a deadly fog a flock of ominously screaming birds--at its weary combatants. It also populates the games with a few actual personalities including an enjoyably unhinged Jena Malone. As for the ending it seems destined to tick off the non-diehards Like too many franchise installments Catching Fire builds to more of an ellipsis than a period teasing the next chapter instead of providing closure. But isnt that true of The Empire Strikes Back as well? At least casual fans will only have to wait a year not three to see what happens next in this galaxy not so far away.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Murray Close) (AP Photo) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on November 18 2013 at 336 PM updated November 18 2013 at 342 PM comments JAKE COYLE AP Film Writer A considerable upgrade over the first ""Hunger Games"" movie ""Catching Fire"" comes across more like a remake than a sequel. In the adaptation of the second installation in Suzanne Collins young adult trilogy theres certainly plenty that has changed. Rebellion against the totalitarian rule of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the 12 districts of Panum is growing. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is now a beloved hero with the weight of celebrity on her shoulders. And Philip Seymour Hoffman bless him has found his way into the proceedings. Yet the general plot -- a journey from Katniss poor hometown of District 12 to a climactic game of human hunting in ""the arena"" with high-speed train rides and training sessions in between -- is identical to the first ""Hunger Games."" More has shuffled behind the camera and ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is much the better for it. Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") has taken over directing from Gary Ross whose poor handling of the first film didnt stop it from becoming a sensation. Lawrence has given the film (the budget was nearly doubled) a more settled environment heavy on greys and a more appropriately grave emotional atmosphere. These are kids being forced to kill other kids the franchise seems to have realized. ""Catching Fire"" opens with Katniss back in District 12 haunted by the experiences of her first Hunger Games. There too is her flame Gale (Liam Hemsworth) whos slaving away in the mines. (Hemsworth a nonentity in both films makes about as convincing a miner as Ben Stillers Zoolander did.) But Katniss success in the Hunger Games was partly due to her for-publicity-sake romance with her co-winner Peeta (Josh Hutcherson who seems about half the height of the screen-dominating Lawrence). President Snow aware of the put-on insists they keep up the charade to help pacify the uprising. Theres an ironic satire of modern celebrity somewhere in ""Catching Fire."" Katniss has become famous only to find it a trap. As her Hunger Games coach Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) says ""You never get off this train."" Lawrence isnt so different. ""The Hunger Games"" along with her more interesting work in ""Winters Bone"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" has made her an enormous star. She is quite literally ""the girl on fire"" as Katniss is nicknamed. When shes trotted out with Peeta on a victory tour of the 12 districts to ""feed the monster"" -- that is to distract the masses with their tabloid romance -- one cant help but see ""The Hunger Games"" as the same kind of diversion. Its dystopia-lite a bloody tale of oppression watered down for a PG-13 rating. The act doesnt work as Snow intended. On the tour we get glimpses of protesters emboldened by Katniss swiftly snuffed out by Storm Trooper-like guards. (Any actual dying in ""The Hunger Games"" always happens just off screen). With his plotting new adviser (Hoffman adding a dose of intrigue) Snow announces a twist The next Hunger Games will be fought between former Games winners. He hopes these Hunger Games will reveal -- in the reality show broadcast of the event -- Katniss as a killer not a symbol of populist hope. The most pleasing moment in ""Catching Fire"" comes when these other former Victors -- a motley crew of veteran warriors -- is introduced. Among the bone-crushing murder professionals is of all people Jeffrey Wright. He proves a cunning brainiac. Back are Elizabeth Banks (as the Capitol escort Effie) Lenny Kravitz (as Katniss pyrotechnic stylist) and easily the high point of both movies Stanley Tucci as the campy broadcast emcee Caesar. Among the newcomers Sam Claflin as the arrogant Hunger Games veteran Finnick Odair has a mischievous charm. But ""Catching Fire"" is to be sure Lawrences show. The exaggerated world of ""The Hunger Games"" with its cartoonish decadents teenage Roman gladiators and theatrical allegory would overwhelm most young actors. But Lawrence (convincingly tormented in this film) has a calm sincerity and steely determinism that cuts through it all. Katniss rise is hers too. ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" a Lionsgate release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language. Running time 146 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. ___ MPAA definition of PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

(Murray Close/Lionsgate) BY Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Monday November 18 2013 1150 PM Title The Hunger Games Catching Fire Film Info With Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Philip Seymour Hoffman. Katniss Everdeen sparks a revolution. Director Francis Lawrence. (226) PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. In IMAX where available. Opens Thursday night. The double or even triple meanings behind ""Catching Fire"" -- the subtitle as if you didnt know of the second ""Hunger Games"" movie -- burns through this exciting thoughtful adventure drama like a torch to tinder. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) the rural huntress dubbed ""The Girl on Fire"" in last years ""Games"" is the spark of a revolution against the vicious ruling class of future America aka Panem. Her outfits are designed to ignite. And the movie would have to light up the sky like fireworks to live up to its fans huge expectations. Katniss District 12 love Gale (Liam Hemsworth) again fails to register in the second installment of the ""Hunger Games"" series. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) The good news is it comes very close and does it without sacrificing its soul. Despite its sense of been-here-slayed-that director Francis Lawrence expertly delivers thrills ideas and spectacle. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) has it out for Katniss and her friend and will employ new scheme with help from Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the designer of the Capitals malevolent new game. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) Ideas are what worry the serpenty President Snow (Donald Sutherland). He warns Katniss that she and her fellow District 12 tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are in his sights after they feigned love to win the murderous games Panems Capital imposes on its powerless constituents children. Katniss with fellow District 12 tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). As the seeds of rebellion spread Panems 99 percent endure beatings and killings at the hands of the Capitals militia. Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the designer of the Capitals malevolent new game with snarky soul-sick Haymitch (Woody Harrelson). (Murray Close/Lionsgate) For the 75th Hunger Games Snow and his Capital cronies concoct a ""Quarter Quell"" in which former victors angry they must kill again are the contestants. So onto an island of horrors go Katniss and Peeta battling mutated mandrills and poisonous mist while making unpredictable allies including the trident-wielding Finnick (Sam Claflin) ax-pro Johanna (Jena Malone) and genius Beetee (Jeffrey Wright). Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) is the TV host our society is surely headed toward. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) Its here where our loyalty to Jennifer Lawrence is crucial. Though ""Catching Fire"" may hit some beats like clockwork she never lets us lose sight of Katniss fear guilt horror and conscience. Without sacrificing a steely backbone Lawrence beautifully tags the tragedy. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) (center) competes with zany Lady Gaga getups. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) She sets the pace as the first half of the film goes deep into a despairing tone. Hutcherson matches her with intelligence and solid presence though Liam Hemsworth as Katniss District 12 love Gale fails to register again. Off to the side but crucial to this world are Woody Harrelsons snarky soul-sick Haymitch and Stanley Tuccis sublime Flickerman the TV host were surely heading toward. Bringing a mysterious tinge is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee designer of the Capitals malevolent new game. Unlike Elizabeth Banks Effie Trinket with her Lady Gaga-on-acid getups Hoffman Tucci and Sutherland capture the ""Survivor goes to Ancient Rome"" tone perfectly. The fact that ""Catching Fire"" a tense cliffhanger before the upcoming two-part conclusion ""Mockingjay"" is an arrows breadth from perfect doesnt diminish it. Its absolutely outgrown its teen origins. In fact its dark satirical action is what the sci-fi of the 70s -- ""Rollerball"" ""A Boy and His Dog"" ""Logans Run"" -- did best. That DNA is here. And as its lead actress shows when the right elements mix its explosive. Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710-AM and at wor710.com.

"The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" Movie Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Director gives Hunger Games franchise and heroine a solid score November 18 2013|Michael Phillips""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is a lot like its own celebrity heroine Katniss Everdeen who begins this second ""Hunger Games"" movie fulfilling a public relations tour as penance for her killer -- literally killer -- popularity. She is adored by millions; the books are too. The three Suzanne Collins novels to be spread across four films are being adapted with both eyes on fidelity to the source material. All ""Catching Fire"" had to do was to show up look good and not screw up to succeed.Consider ""Catching Fire"" an example of successful franchise installment delivery on time and in sturdy condition.Some interesting shifts in tone and texture this time out. The film looks nothing like the first Gary Ross-directed ""Hunger Games"" which I slightly prefer to the solid well-paced No. 2. ""Catching Fire"" features director Francis Lawrence behind the camera and already he has signed for the next two. Ross favored hand-held shaky-cam stylistics in his depiction of futuristic totalitarian America a police-state mess known as Panem. Lawrence by contrast shoots ""Catching Fire"" with a steadier gaze and a sleeker touch offering a little bit of everything and not too much of any one thing.For newbies The games of the title are battles to the death between cunning resourcefully murderous representatives of Panems beaten-down districts. Through her wiles her bow-and-arrow skills and her bangin fashion sense Katniss triumphed mournfully in the first movie surviving to the end and cleverly engineering a life-saving maneuver for her friend and fellow district competitor the bakers son Peeta.""Catching Fire"" opens in the script by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn with Katniss and Peeta pretending to be sweethearts for a rabid TV audience embarking on their 12-day victory tour culminating in a big show at the Capitol. President Snow connives to crush this fearsomely famous woman whose ability to foment revolution among the oppressed masses is nothing to dismiss. The movie is part treatise on the hardships of unwanted notoriety part blood sport revisited the games this time played by an all-star cadre of past winners.Ways to die? Oh so many. This time theres creeping human-made poisonous fog which gives its victims a miserable case of acne as if there werent already enough points of identifcation for teens. There are electrocutions stabbings and other classics. Shooting in Hawaii which gives this sequel a distinct ""Lost"" look director Lawrence traffic-manages with considerable effectiveness. The simian attack for example which is plenty scary recalls Lawrences work with the computer-generated beasties in his remake of ""I Am Legend"" the one starring Will Smith.Like that picture ""Catching Fire"" has the bonus of a genuinely charismatic performer at its center. Jennifer Lawrence now an Oscar winner thanks to ""Silver Linings Playbook"" emotes like crazy throughout ""Catching Fire"" but you never catch her acting. It feels real and Lawrence sees to it that we rarely experience the dramatic set-ups in terms of cheap revenge or conventional movie blood lust.Josh Hutcherson returns as Peeta; his romantic rival for Katniss preoccupied affections (shes got a lot going on after all) is once again played by Liam Hemsworth. Woody Harrelson Elizabeth Banks and Lenny Kravitz buzz around engagingly as Katniss entourage. You keep waiting for better zingers which never arrive but ""The Hunger Games"" isnt about wit; its about blunt lessons in hypocrisy and class warfare about to be waged but good.Newcomers to the franchise all welcome include Philip Seymour Hoffman as the game designer with the ambiguous motives and Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as a Mutt-and-Jeff pair of unlikely competitors more about brains than brawn. The violence in ""Catching Fire"" can get pretty rough but the reason these first two movies work relates to our ability to take the carnage seriously. Lawrences Katniss doesnt Bruce-Willis her way through the events of the rather thinly spread story. Each time she witnesses a killing state-sanctioned or otherwise it hurts. It means something. Were not talking about highly dimensional or evocative mythmaking here; the films are more about hitting the marks and setting up the next part. But they work.Postscript A I find the rampant fashion merchandising tie-ins with ""Catching Fire"" pretty strange given the outre drag-queeny excess of costume designer Trish Summervilles clothes. At times the results verge on ""Priscilla Queen of the Hunger Games."" But for many the costumes are part of the dystopian blood-stained fun.Postscript B Stanley Tucci reprises drolly his role of the oily reality-TV host from the first picture. If his teeth get any whiter were going to need special glasses to watch the third one.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language)Running time 226Opens Thursday evening MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHunger Games Teaser The Mockingjay LivesJuly 9 2014Lionsgate Pushing Mockingjay Toward Iron Man 3AC/?A2 Box...January 22 2014CoverGirl Pretties Up Hunger Games Catching FireMay 17 2013Hunger Games sticks with director Lawrence for sequelsNovember 1 2012""Hunger Games"" sticks with director Lawrence for sequelsNovember 1 2012Find More Stories AboutHunger GamesJennifer LawrenceKatniss EverdeenSuzanne CollinsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-hunger-games-catching-fire-1122-20131118,0,3107407.column",200,thehungergamescatchingfire36,thehungergamescatchingfire,chicagotribune

Photo Credit Lionsgate advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a dystopian future the victors of a deadly competition become symbols of a populist uprising. BOTTOM LINE Sluggish pacing plagues this mid-series installment but Lawrences tough performance once again carries the day. CAST Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Philip Seymour Hoffman Sam Claflin LENGTH 226 Second-act problems plague ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" but thats what happens when the entire movie is a second act. By definition this sequel cant feel as fresh as the first movie ""The Hunger Games"" and its prevented from delivering whatever rock em sock em moments are being saved for next years finale. It spins its wheels while giving us the illusion of movement. It succeeds just barely and mostly thanks to another tough performance from Jennifer Lawrence returning as the reluctant warrior-hero Katniss Everdeen. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The rules of this movies fanciful world -- a tyrannical regime whose annual Hunger Games force children to kill each other -- have already been established which means ""Catching Fire"" can immediately start adding wrinkles. Still new director Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") takes his time doing so. The first hour sets up a convoluted plot in which Katniss popular support begins to concern the sinister President Snow (Donald Sutherland). As a result Katniss and co-survivor Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson vague but improving) are drafted into another competition the Quarter Quell. Their competitors will be past champions like the cocky Finnick Odair (a charming Sam Claflin) brainy Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and oversexed Johanna Mason (Jena Malone). All these colorful characters including new Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (a slippery Philip Seymour Hoffman) help hold our interest during the slow moments. Sucking up way too much screen time is Katniss inability to choose between two suitors Peeta and her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Here as in ""Twilight"" this romantic waffling may be precisely what attracted many fans but it trivializes our heroine. As Katniss strings the guys along (a kiss here a snuggle there a teary plea to understand her confused heart) she seems less like a strong-minded woman than a coquette wallowing in male attention. All this passive manipulation may have suited Bella Swan but not a steely survivor like Katniss. Once the new Games begin ""Catching Fire"" gets the adrenaline pumping and puts Lawrence back on solid footing as the athletic archer with the deadly aim. If the cliffhanger ending seems sudden its only because the movie was just starting to get good. 231 MoviesThe Hunger Games Catching Fire trailer PLOT In a dystopian future the victors of a deadly competition become symbols of a populist uprising. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Philip Seymour Hoffman Sam Claflin LENGTH 226 BOTTOM LINE Sluggish pacing plagues this mid-series installment but Lawrences tough performance once again carries the day.

Suzanne Collins ""The Hunger Games"" began with a less fantastical foundation as young warriors found themselves pitted against one another in a ruthless arena for the world to see but ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" suggests that this franchise is already looking to deal as much in media manipulation and bureaucratic fear-mongering as it is in teenage bloodletting. When last we saw Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) they were threatening to commit suicide on live TV rather than sacrifice themselves for the sake of the 74th Annual Hunger Games having its lone victor. The bluff worked and with Katniss and Peeta setting out on their Victory Tour under the guise of a passionate romance (he feels that way; she remains partial to Liam Hemsworths Gale back home) President Snow (Donald Sutherland) seeks to smother the hope that these young champions have instilled in the downtrodden borderline defiant populace of Panem. With the arrival of the 75th Hunger Games -- also known as the third Quarter Quell -- Snow and new gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) orchestrate an event for which participants are chosen from a pool of past victors which means that Katniss and Peeta are thrust once more into danger against more experienced foes as an increasingly oppressive government bears down on the lands 12 Districts. ""Enjoy your time in the spotlight"" advises Katniss ever flamboyant handler Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) early on. ""Youve earned it."" As our young talented protagonist makes the rounds with a plastered smile at every event its not especially hard to see the parallels between Katniss PR tour and the Oscar winners own recent awards season duties sure to continue this fall with the arrival of ""American Hustle."" Lawrence sells the constant glad-handing and hardly hidden post-traumatic stress disorder as well as her characters legendary archery prowess enough so that her scarcely compelling dalliances with either Peeta or Gale feel like an understandable afterthought. She has a family to consider if not her entire District so it only seems right that at least one of her romantic relationships is a false one just there to appease the masses. (Take note ""Twilight."") Taking the reins from Gary Ross director Francis Lawrence - no relation - preserves the established on-screen look and feel of soot-stained Panem and the far more lavish Capitol where everyones hair garb and very names fall somewhere between the worlds of ""Marie Antoinette"" and ""Southland Tales."" Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz have returned as Katniss and Peetas mentors as has Stanley Tucci as impossibly vivacious emcee Caesar Flickerman. Fellow competitors include Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair Jena Malone as Johanna Mason and even the esteemed likes of Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as two more tech-savvy participants in the Games and each gets to make their own colorful contribution to the story. Ross reportedly bowed out due to the shoots time constraints but once the action gets underway Lawrence (""Constantine"" ""I Am Legend"") demonstrates a welcome eye for steady-handed action coverage that alone elevates this film above its predecessor. For all this talk of fire much of the new arena heavily involves water more than any other element the recurring motif eventually evoking strong baptismal imagery (not to mention an off-screen rain of blood). The fact that an attack by a pack of angry monkeys feels intense rather than laughable in the wake of the first films rabid dog creatures marks a due amount of commitment from the main players and effects teams alike. Despite new writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt adapting Collins second novel ""Catching Fire"" is still frustratingly beholden to a structure identical to the first film an hour of blue-collar handwringing a half-hour of mandatory training and twirling followed by an hour of the Games themselves. With any luck the last novel -- to be released as two separate movies naturally -- will see a change of pace with its escalated stakes. If the cliffhanger ending of this one is any indication for the next two ""Games"" all bets are off.

Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have won the Hunger Games the first dual champions in the bloody battle royales 74-year-old history. Now they have to deal with the soul-sucking expectations of celebrity something that has already all but done in the pairs alcoholic mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). So they put on their best game face smooching plenty for the cameras--even though Katnisss heart also yearns for strapping coal miner Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth)--and robotically reading cue cards that emphasize the greatness of the totalitarian nation of Panem. Theres rebellion in the air however--everywhere the troubled Katniss goes someone is guaranteed to raise their hand in a three-fingered salute of solidarity and get a bullet to the brain for their troubles. Panems nefarious leader President Snow (Donald Sutherland) knows revolution is on the horizon so he and his spectacularly monikered henchman Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) cook up something special for the games 75th edition Pit as many past winners as possible against each other and quell this fire before it burns out of control. Conversely the conflagration that is the Hunger Games franchise is already well beyond full scorch. Novelist Suzanne Collinss dystopian YA trilogy is a bona fide publishing and moviegoing phenomenon to the point that everyone involved could easily rest on their laurels and let the preordained cash roll in. Credit series newcomer Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) and his collaborators for pushing things ever-so-slightly past tentpole-blockbuster indifference. In Catching Fires first half especially theres a palpable sense of unease and world-weary regret weighing on our plucky heroine. An early confrontation between the aggressive President Snow and a terrified Katniss has more purposeful charge than anything in Gary Rosss weak-tea first installment of the series. Even when the rote action sequences inevitably take over--these bigger badder Hunger Games now come with poison fog and killer CGI monkeys--the film still makes room for some slyly humorous supporting work by Jena Malone as an ax-wielding cynic and Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as scatterbrained science whizzes. A Matrix Reloaded-like cliffhanger reminds that this is only the second installment out of four (good lord) but at least the flick leaves us with more than a tinge of interest in whom the odds will favor next.

"Review Jennifer Lawrence hits target in The Hunger Games Catching Fire - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Jennifer Lawrence hits target in The Hunger Games Catching FireBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 11/19/2013 100927 AM PSTUpdated 11/19/2013 010621 PM PST Related StoriesNov 22Review Hunger Games Catching Fire better than the originalNov 18The Hunger Games Catching Fire with Jennifer Lawrence Is it as good as the first film?Hicks Jennifer Lawrence had social anxiety as a childDefiant arrow-slinger Katniss Everdeen and her Oscar-winning alter ego Jennifer Lawrence have once again nailed their target.With Francis Lawrence stepping in as director and a fresh round of richly developed secondary characters ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" averts the curse that plagues most sequels.In many ways ""Catching Fire"" is a better film than its impressive 2012 predecessor. The rough edges have been smoothed out -- gone are those confusing fast edits -- while the acting directing and writing is sharper. The only advantage the first film had over this one is that it got to introduce the audience to the Games. The sequel replays them. So while the second installment in Suzanne Collins best-selling dystopian trilogy may be thrilling and sets the stage for even more rebellious mischief afoot it cant help but seem a bit like a rehash. Thats because Collins basically yet effectively hits the restart button and sends Katniss the upstart co-winner of the 74th Hunger Games into a new survival-of-the-fittest showdown this time going mano-to-arrow against previous Games victors. These Tributes hail from the 12 districts of the post-apocalyptic Panem nation.The future Collins has created is grim ruled with bloody fist by a totalitarian government that orchestrates a reality-TV-like annual duel that pits teens against teens who fight to the death. Why? So the government can brainwash and inspire fear and subservience in its downtrodden minions.Advertisement Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) her fellow District 12 Tribute -- the rules call for a boy and a girl to be selected by lottery from each area -- were co-victors from the previous year and eventually both won by craftily pretending to be lovers. As ""Catching Fire"" opens both are prepping for their Victors Tour with Katniss saying goodbye to her best friend and minor love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth who has a little more to do this time).While on tour Katniss and Peeta further rankle the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland so conniving) as they go way off script and start fanning the fires of rebellion. Their behavior unwittingly puts the district population in danger.Snow realizes he must quash Katniss so hes tapped a new gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman heavensent in the part). And since this is a sequel after all -- and everything needs to be bigger and more threatening -- Snow demands a more dangerous version of the game for the Quarter Quell which marks the death matchs 75th anniversary. Plutarch delivers.Up to that point ""Catching Fire"" is refreshingly different with director Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") and production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Trish Summerville further enhancing the look and feel of Panem. The Capitol sequences in particular add more texture and depth mirroring the Third Reich and gladiator competitions with flourishes of Oz that last one in the form of commentators including the toothy TV host Stanley Tucci as Caesar.Even when the script reboots itself and sends us back into the Games familiar structure theres more refinement and detail not just to the obstacles but the former Games winners who Collins and screenwriters Michael Arndt and Simon Beaufoy have created. Each Tribute comes into sharper focus a more developed character. Theyre all well cast too particularly Jena Malone whos outstanding as the feisty and flirty Johanna Mason and Sam Claflin as the pretty boy with a soft side Finnick.The cast of supporting actors from the first film are a hoot again from Woody Harrelson as the drunken but surprisingly sharp Haymitch to Elizabeth Banks as the flashy Effie.The cast never misses a beat including Hutcherson who gets to be more bold. But the reason ""Catching Fire"" works so well can once again be attributed to its strong central female character and talents of Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence the perfect actor to play her. ""Catching Fire"" plays on that fact with the camera locking on Lawrences face as she conveys tidal waves of conflicting emotions.She sets the screen on fire and so does ""Catching Fire"" one of this years best and most thought-provoking blockbusters.

Try being the middle film. Trilogies -- even ones that actually greedily split what should be the third installment into two -- assign roles to each episode. The first introduces us to the characters and the situation. The finale answers all questions avenges all wrongs and wraps everything up. But the middle? The middle is about complication. The middle is about ambiguity. The middle is about starting with the story already underway and then making things much worse. And then after its provided all our heroes with new challenges to overcome -- it ends. See you next time This can provide for some dark and challenging fare (which is why ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the center of the original ""Star Wars"" trio is a favorite with so many fans). Or it can just be a little unsatisfying drawing us in and then leaving us dangling still hungry and only thinking about the next installment. Which is pretty much where the new ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" falls. It starts with our heroine Katniss suffering a little PTSD after surviving the murderous government competition that pitted teens against teens in the last film. It explains that the regime sees her as a threat because of her personal example of cooperation and self-sacrifice. Jennifer Lawrences Katniss starts making the personal political in ""Catching Fire"" the story of the making of a revolutionaryLIONSGATE And it shows us that Katniss has begun to see herself that way too as she notices how the downtrodden of the Districts respond to her and wonders if there isnt a way to turn the Hunger Games on their head and bring the real fight to the Capitol itself. But then -- being a middle film -- it just sort of ends with Katniss personally resolved but all the real struggles still to come. Most of the cast returns -- including star Jennifer Lawrence who frankly carries this entire franchise on her back -- but this time theres a new director Francis Lawrence who is no relation. (And if he were and I were Jennifer Id deny it considering his credits include ""I Am Legend"" ""Constantine"" and ""Water for Elephants."") He is no genius but at least he holds the camera steady -- which is all that many fans wished Gary Ross would have done in the last film. He also does a good job of staging the new perils waiting for our competitors in the Arena -- particularly some nasty baboons and an acidic fog. So if you loved the first film youll like this one. But if you had problems the last time around -- well the same problems remain. The scenes in the impoverished Districts are unimaginative relying on anachronistic ""Grapes of Wrath"" style poverty; the costumes and set decoration in the lush Capitol are fatuous (which theyre supposed to be) without ever being truly fantastic. Theres also a major romantic failing. Katniss is supposed to be full of tumult and confusion; does she love hunky Gale back home or Peeta the bakers boy whos followed her on this adventure? As this part of the story goes on its ever clearer she loves both. But neither -- the wooden Liam Hemsworth nor puppyish Josh Hutchinson -- seem to really deserve her. Nor does Lawrence -- running through the woods all cheekbones and arrows like a sci-fi Diana -- seem to need either. Why would she? These callow boys would only slow her down. Smirk all you want at the barechested werewolves and glittery vampires of ""Twilight"" but at least that series got some melodrama out of its love triangle and even occasionally some heat. ""The Hunger Games"" movies while far more sophisticated dont deliver on that level. N.J.

They do feature better actors though. The flinty-eyed Lawrence is terrific -- the last shot in the film is a wonderful closeup where you see a range of emotions from confusion to determination pass slowly across her face. Donald Sutherland continues to play his fascist ruler with relish Stanley Tucci calculates the camp perfectly as a TV host and Jena Malone adds a jolt of energy as a slightly butch new warrior. But the games themselves feel sketchy and rushed; the vast majority of the other contestants remain practically unknown. And while nothing is more dramatic than the change at the core of this film -- Katniss move from survivor to leader -- its not enough on its own to comfortably sustain a two-and-a-half-hour film. But then ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" is after all the middle child. And ignored or underappreciated as it may turn out to be it still does its real job -- of setting up its older sisters to take this saga of bread-and-circuses reality TV and carnivorous celebrityhood to a satisfying end.

Photo AP More On the hunger games catching fire Why Katniss Everdeen is the female superhero for our times 7 superior movie sequels that topped the original A guide to the MTV Movie Awards for those who dont care Hunger Games to digitally recreate Hoffman MOVIE REVIEW The Hunger Games Catching Fire Running time 146 min. Rated PG-13 (violence language). At the Empire 34th St. others. ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" opens on a shot of Katniss Everdeen shooting arrows at turkeys which is perfect As embodied by the surefooted smart Jennifer Lawrence the hero of this dystopian saga does not suffer fools gladly. Too bad about that because Katniss is now an indentured servant to the barbaric reality-TV franchise that is her country of Panems ""Hunger Games."" As the winner - along with her on-camera love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)- of that televised battle to the death shes now obligated to embark on a cheery promo tour of the nations districts all home to fellow ""tributes"" who were slain in the games. Or else President Snow (Donald Sutherland silken and poisonous) will have her family killed. Fans of the trilogy of books and the first movie - that is to say the vast majority of this movies audience - will be happy to find their expectations met with great fanfare in this bigger and louder follow-up which hews closely to the book while making the most of the novels visual possibilities. Yes its the middle chapter and feels like it but its never dull. First there are romantic complications a kiss from best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) throws Katniss into turmoil just as shes set to head off with Peeta and their garish handler Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). Katniss dreams of running away with Gale but hes a burgeoning radical he wants to stay and fight with the insurgents who are inspired by Katniss defiant gesture in the last films games (""The odds are NEVER in our favor"" reads one scrawl of graffiti in a neighboring district.) Director Francis Lawrence taking over from Gary Ross brings a nightmarish severity to the downtrodden district visits particularly a scene in which an old man in a crowd is executed by the Capitols stormtrooper-like cops for making the three-fingered gesture of solidarity as Katniss and Peeta are addressing the crowd. Similarly the cops raid on Katniss home district which sees Gale being publicly flogged is visceral and harsh. In contrast scenes of the Capitol - can we just call it Rome 2.0? - are even more delightfully over-the-top. Effies costumes become progressively insane - a dress and headpiece made entirely from monarch butterflies stands out - while Stanley Tuccis talk-show host Caesar Flickerman now sports purple eyebrows and a maniacal tooth-whitened laugh. Lenny Kravitz makes a welcome return as low-key stylist Cinna whos got more sartorial subversion up his sleeve. In the midst of all this froth its amusing to see Philip Seymour Hoffman appear looking as if hed insisted in his contract that there would be no funny business with his costumes or facial hair. As Plutarch Heavensbee the new gamemaker hes got a blunt take on the Gatsby-like party at which he meets Katniss ""Its appalling"" he says. ""Still if you abandon your moral judgment it can be fun."" Hes the one wholl run the ""Quarter Quell"" a competition in which the winners of previous Hunger Games will battle one another - to the death how else? - to celebrate the countrys bloody 75th anniversary. Its the Hunger Games all over again only in wetsuits and with more notable contestants Jena Malone as a saucy malcontent named Joanna who casually disrobes in an elevator with Katniss and Peeta; Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer as a nerdy duo the other players dub ""Nuts and Volts;"" and Sam Claflins Finnick Odair a hunky trident-thrower who ends up becoming a valuable ally. Ironically its when the games start that the action bogs down a bit as one adversity after another is thrown at Katniss Peeta and their allies - poisonous fog Evil monkeys Birds that sound like your relatives being tortured - yet the violence between contestants is racheted way down from the first film which really drove home the horrifying nature of young people being forced to murder one another for the nations entertainment. Overall though it commendably continues this fable about the decline of a society built on the subjugation of the poor. Subtle it aint but you may find yourself thinking queasily about your ""Real Housewives"" addiction when Woody Harrelsons drunken Haymitch mutters to a heavily made-up Katniss ""Your job is to be a distraction so people forget what the real problems are.""

"Hunger Games The Catching Fire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hunger-games-the-catching-fire ) Hunger Games The Catching Fire (United States 2013) November 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Have we reached a point where the term ""young adult literature"" has become pejorative? Have books like Twilight and its ilk promulgated a negative connotation? If Stephenie Meyers scribblings represent an exhibition for the prosecution perhaps Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games trilogy could head up the case for the defense. These novels and their movie adaptation offspring tell captivating stories that are in no way limited by their supposed target demographic. Collins books have much in common with the longstanding tradition of so-called ""dystopian future"" tales which comfortably straddle the science fiction adventure and even horror genres. The screen translation of Catching Fire the second volume of the series offers its audience many of the elements that made The Hunger Games compelling but adds to that by deepening the themes and emotional currents and traveling to darker destinations. Theres irony in recognizing that a ""young adult"" narrative can prove to be bleaker than the average ""adult"" fare. One of the criticisms of The Hunger Games was that human life was too cheap. The ""happy ending"" was achieved through the deaths of 22 young people. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) triumphed by being better at killing and survival than the other contestants. At times she seemed almost machine-like in eliminating opponents. Catching Fire which begins shortly after the conclusion of The Hunger Games with Katniss and fellow winner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) about to embark upon their victory tour shows that Katniss didnt escape her ordeal without deep emotional scars. Suffering symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder she at times has difficulty functioning. Something is broken within Katniss. The first act of Catching Fire forces the viewer to reassess all of The Hunger Games. Catching Fire continues to follow Katniss story while expanding on the social upheaval in the wider world. Shes no longer a pawn being ground to dust by the gears of an unstoppable corrupt government. Now she has become the means by which that engine can be destabilized and broken. The Hunger Games provided us with glimpses of the oppression existing in some of the 12 districts of Panem. Catching Fire goes into greater detail as disaffection with the government builds to overt rebellion and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is forced to become increasingly inhumane in his methods in order to maintain a slipping grip on power. One stock YA element that Collins embraces is the love triangle. In this case the three participants are Katniss Peeta and Katniss longtime best friend Gayle (Liam Hemsworth). Its handled in a more sedate and adult manner than in the whiny Twilight series. The focus isnt on Katniss losing her virginity; its about the emotional cost of her journey and the need for some kind of human warmth along the way. Peeta and Gayle dont snipe at one another. They dont bare their fangs and growl. They understand the situation and move forward. They both love the same girl and are willing to sacrifice to save her and perhaps each other. While Catching Fire doesnt shy away from some nearly R-rated scenes - the persecution and murder of dissidents being a prime example - it offers a strong dose of what made The Hunger Games compulsively watchable another battle-to-the-death contest involving 24 ""tributes."" The tone however is different grim cynical and tragic without a hint of exultation. In The Hunger Games we rooted for Katniss to win. In Catching Fire its apparent that any victory will be pyrrhic. Here the tributes are all returning champions - a kind-of Ultimate Hunger Games All-Stars. The secret goal privately agreed-to by President Snow and the new game-runner Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is to kill Katniss in a manner that will invalidate her as a symbol of freedom and rebellion. Once the new game begins Katniss finds herself allied with some other ""outsider"" players like the attractive athletic Finnick (Sam Claflin); the angry loner Johanna (Jena Malone); the nerd who wins by his brains Beetee (Jeffrey Wright); and of course Peeta. But things arent as simple for Katniss as in The Hunger Games. Here she has to wonder about the fidelity of her so-called allies and what the end game is. Is she fated to lay down her life for Peeta or he for her or is there some greater goal? Is there a way to strike out at President Snow from within the game? The movie ends with a brutal cliffhanger that mirrors the way the 2009 novel concludes. The talent involved in Catching Fire is impressive. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy has three Oscar nominations and one win (for Slumdog Millionaire) on his resume. Co-scripter Michael Arndt (writing under the pseudonym ""Michael deBruyn"") has two nominations and one win (Little Miss Sunshine) to his credit. Although director Francis Lawrence has thus far received no recognition from the Academy he was a well-regarded music video director before turning his attention to movies in 2005 with Constantine. The cast can boast a collective nine acting Oscar nominations and two wins (the numbers go much higher if Golden Globes are considered) and none of the performers can be accused of going through the motions. Jennifer Lawrences portrayal of Katniss attains more emotional depth in Catching Fire as she is forced to cope with the consequences of her win in The Hunger Games and what she had to sacrifice to achieve it. Lawrence proffers a strong multi-layered character who displays all the frailties of humanity to go along with her physical prowess. Woody Harrelson commands the screen in his limited number of scenes; the same is true of Donald Sutherland who generates a villain worthy of despite. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth provide able appealing support. And all the newcomers - Philip Seymour Hoffman Jena Malone Sam Claflin Jeffrey Wright - are in peak form. Special mention goes to Patrick St. Esprit whose Commander Thread is so utterly despicable that in just a few scenes he makes viewers thirst for his comeuppance. Halfway through a proposed four-film cycle The Hunger Games has proven to be one of the few franchises where additional chapters are anticipated rather than merely accepted. Catching Fire is a better movie than its predecessor and elevates the series into that rarefied atmosphere where it must be considered as something more substantive than just another fanboy/girl-friendly means by which a studio can fatten its coffers. Catching Fire brings the heat and doesnt flame out.

One of the significant new releases coming out this week deals with the plight of an innocent woman fighting against the restrictions of a society that has forced her to reckon with terrible circumstances. Many moviegoers undoubtedly associate this description with ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" the latest blockbuster adaptation of Suzanne Collins young adult science-fiction series in which Jennifer Lawrence plays an impromptu warrior forced to battle her peers in a dystopian civilization. However its not only new adaptation to delve into the aforementioned subject matter In ""Philomena"" (which opens in limited release Friday) director Stephen Frears chronicle of journalist Martin Sixsmiths experience writing the non-fiction tome ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" Steve Coogan portrays Sixsmith as he uncovers the history of a woman separated from her child at an Irish convent in the 1950s. There are no fights to the death in this tender story. Judi Dench portrays the guilt-ridden Philomena who is haunted by the mystery of her sons fate for decades and finally is willing to speak out about it. Nevertheless Philomenas courage to re-engage with the religious institution that deprived her of her offspring provides a realist alternative to the bloody exploits of ""Catching Fire"" star Katniss Everdeen. On the surface ""Catching Fire"" and ""Philomena"" exist on two wildly different planes. But when considered in light of their similar themes the connection hints at the way compelling ideas can travel through vastly different forms of storytelling. Co-written by Coogan and Jeff Pope the script for ""Philomena"" starts at a point where both lead characters have accepted their frustrating circumstances. Sixsmith once a successful BBC journalist before shifting into politics was forced to resign after a private gaffe went public. Early scenes find him comically attempting to assert his intellect even as he has too much time on his hands. He tries jogging and contemplates writing a book on Russian literature but initially wont consider investigating Philomenas plight when her daughter approaches him about it turning up his nose at the prospects of a human-interest story. Eventually however hes drawn to Philomenas soft-spoken manner and solemn gaze. Shes similarly at war with herself first seen coming clean to her daughter about her lost half-brother on his 50th birthday and eventually ecstatic about the possibility of tracking him down in the United States. As the duo follows the clues to the upbringing her son received from American foster parents they eventually become aware of a complex network of events that preceded the onscreen circumstances to the point where ""Philomena"" eventually turns into a thoughtful treatise on the way the past has the power to dictate our actions and feelings in the present. As ""The Hunger Games"" franchise barrels forward it invokes similar ideas on an admittedly louder flashier scale. Much happened before Katniss (Lawrence) became the leading warrior of a twisted lethal competition that forces teens to kill each other and the series mythology gradually reveals how the dark scenario came together in the first place. The latest installment is an unquestionably tense return to the grim setting of the first movie with a fair share of slickly devised action sequences that raises the stakes with the prospects of a greater rebellion. But its also clearly one piece of a larger equation and inherently incomplete as a result -- the best moment arrives when it sets the stage for the next sequel. Still the ideas remain potent throughout Katniss and her fellow survivors are victims of a system assembled without their consent that bears down on them at every moment but all they can do is keep moving ahead. And thats also the case for Philomena a religious woman aware that her childs birth out of wedlock led to her situation even though she never rejected him. Frears movie capably finds a balance in her willingness to accept her circumstances while experiencing a deep-seated anger for a situation she can only resolve by confronting it head-on. Theres a reason for this unlikely connection. ""Catching Fire"" is unquestionably a Hollywood product that has been chiefly designed to rake in untold millions of dollars worldwide following in the path of its predecessor. ""Philomena"" is a potential Oscar contender directed by a respected British filmmaker. Yet both movies have garnered acclaim for achieving entertainment value while dealing with bleak situations. Their characters willingness to push forward against seemingly impossible odds results in engaging survival tales. The plight of the beleaguered hero has offered enticing possibilities ever since Homers ""The Odyssey"" so its no surprise that its particular incarnations in these new releases prove the scenario has timeless allure. However if one were to single out the movie that grapples best with sophisticated problems ""Philomena"" would have to win out. Its not a ""Hunger Games""-level competition here but ""Catching Fire"" thrills more than it provokes and ""Philomena"" remains pensive throughout. Of course theyre blatantly pitched at audiences with different sensibilities. But no matter which one you choose to see youre bound to have a lot to debate afterward. So why not make it a double bill?

Youd expect Catching Fire to be misshapen onscreen too and a comedown--except The Hunger Games was relentlessly misdirected by Gary Ross with his tiresomely indiscriminate handheld camera and inability to wring much emotion from child murder. Relatively speaking Catching Fire is terrific. Even nonrelatively its pretty damn good. The new director Francis Lawrence and co-screenwriter Simon Beaufoy (Danny Boyles frequent collaborator) front-load Catching Fire with anguish. Back in her impoverished home district Jennifer Lawrences Katniss takes aim at a flock of wild turkeys and nails a human being--Marvel (Jack Quaid) who died in the first movie. Its a vision of course It reminds her shes a killer. Theres a heavy pall over the action--and an awful duty. Twin victors Katniss and her pretend boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are forced to tour the districts and pay tribute to ""the Capitol"" closely monitored by the saturnine President Snow (Donald Sutherland) whod love to put them six (preferably 60) feet under. He tells Katniss that some of the populace viewed the ""little trick"" that saved both her and Peeta from death at the end of The Hunger Games as ""an act of defiance not love."" For the moment he needs them to dampen the fires of revolution. Katniss has become a symbol--the Mockingjay--and her wings must be clipped. The vibe is martial and chill. The Imperial Roman-like Capitol has a frightening splendor; it teems with helmeted Star Wars-like troopers in formidable (muscular) breastplates. The new Hunger Games overseer is Plutarch Heavensbee (the name hate it) played by Philip Seymour Hoffman whose low-key pragmatic delivery makes the evil even scarier. He and Snow arrive at the diabolical plan of tapping Katniss and Peeta for a special Hunger Games this time featuring victors from previous years in an especially spectacular fight to the death. A second Hunger Games. A bigger Death Star. Another shrubbery. Okay theres not a lot of invention there. The governments machinations are a mite confusing the whys and hows of the new game murky and the thinking behind Katnisss desire to sacrifice herself for Peeta a head-scratcher. In the latter case the fault might lie with Hutcherson whose face doesnt draw the camera--hes tight and inexpressive--and who gets no help from his director. But Lawrence (Francis not Jennifer) does well with the films mighty set pieces. A scene in which Katniss trains by shooting arrows into oncoming cyberfoes composed of flaming blocks is rousingly well done. Katnisss self-immolating wedding gown on the eve of the Games is a gorgeous effect. Used judiciously this time the handheld camera in the Hunger Games amps up the terror immeasurably--especially in a sequence featuring killer baboons thats shot and edited (and presumably computer-generated) with ferocious skill. As ever Lawrence (Jennifer) is a treat her face is that of a warrior who kills in sorrow rather than anger. Her new Cleopatra look is most becoming. Liam Hemsworths Gale remains deadwood but Woody Harrelson doesnt phone it in this time as that cunning sot Haymitch; Lenny Kravitz half-suggests (as opposed to never suggesting) the scintillating presence that is the wardrobe-meister Cinna; and Elizabeth Banks adds plaintive human notes to the drag-queen-like busybody Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci returns--huzzah--as the prime-time pageants emcee Caesar and its a masterly study in calculating camp Caesar capers with one beady eye on his government masters. The new additions are even more fun. Jeffrey Wright (dotty brainiac) and Amanda Plummer (dottier seer) make an adorable team and Jena Malone gets a role thats worthy of her prickly charm as the Hunger Gamess emo girl Johanna whos royally pissed off at having to return to the arena. As the enigmatic contestant Finnick Odair the Brit Sam Claflin supplies all kinds of subtext Is he a popinjay a devious Loki or a Dear Sweet Boy? Brits (the males) can pull off that sort of role in their sleep because they tend to be all of the above. Its too bad that like its predecessor Catching Fire doesnt convey the full horror and injustice of each combatants death at the moment of killing. Thats what you feel in a great war movie whereas in the end The Hunger Games trilogy is just good dystopian pulp. Its likely that the violence has so little sting because of the studios need for a PG-13 rating which has the paradoxical effect of making murder less upsetting and therefore more family friendly. (Bring the kids why dont you?) Its also of course that in Catching Fire the killers and killed are of age. Rightly or wrongly once they can legally drink theyre action fodder and fair game. At least Jennifer Lawrence does nothing casually. Her face conveys what PG-13 keeps offscreen. The Hunger Games Catching Fire directed by Francis Lawrence. Lionsgate. PG-13.

No longer do the genres bright young women sit around waiting for one Mr. Right to notice them. Both Stephenie Meyers Twilight and Suzanne Collinss Hunger Games sagas invert Jan and Deans Surf City ideal. Two boys for every girl That ought to double the fun but really it only multiplies the headaches. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Jennifer Lawrences earthy enchantress Katniss Everdeen is just figuring that out in The Hunger Games Catching Fire the second entry in the film franchise based on Collinss bodaciously successful novels. Catching Fire directed by Francis Lawrence (taking the reins from Gary Ross) picks up exactly where the first movie left off. And I mean exactly. If you havent seen the first picture or read the books youll need a 14-year-old girl to explain the intricacies to you Theyre just way too 2012 for me to go into right now.See also The Hunger Games North Americas Next Top Killer Is Finally Here (2012 review)Film Details The Hunger Games Catching Fire RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time146 min. More Info Trailer But basically you should know that in the dystopian futuristic country of Panem the 1 percent live in luxury while the 99 percent toil like the exhausted drones in Metropolis to keep the elite in the style to which they are accustomed. There are 12 districts worth of those underlings and once a year each territory must offer up two of its young people to participate in a televised event known as the Hunger Games in which the unfortunate chosen ones are forced to kill one another off in an elaborate controlled stadium environment. The prize enough money (and food) to lift the winners family out of poverty.Katniss an entrant from District 12 has survived the games thanks to her crackerjack archery skills and even more impressive disdain for authority. Her neighbor and co-competitor Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is not-so-secretly in love with her has survived too but Katniss isnt sure how she feels. Shes been best friends forever with another District 12 lad Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and as Catching Fire opens he catches her off-guard and plants one hell of a confusing kiss on her lips. Katniss is the sort of young woman striding hither and thither with her ever-present archers bow who may not have room in her life for one guy. Whats she supposed to do with two?As it turns out mere survival takes up most of her time. The evil elders of Panem -- led by Donald Sutherland a naughty big-daddy silver fox if ever there was one -- recognize that her rebellious streak and celebrity status threaten their omnipotence. Their solution forcing her to her compete in a sort of all-star Hunger Games playoff devising even deadlier challenges than they did last time. Poison fog blood rain killer baboons with scary painted faces The new mastermind behind all these Outward Bound exercises is Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman looking ordinary and pudgy and all the more sinister for it).Catching Fire suffers from the movie equivalent of middle-book syndrome The story is wayward and rangy on its way to being something maybe but not adding up to much by itself. Still its entertaining as civics lessons go and its a more polished assured picture than its predecessor. Director Lawrence as in his adaptation of Richard Mathesons I Am Legend merges the naturalistic with the fantastic so gracefully that you cant see the seams. Those hyperrealistic baboons mean business when they come charging out of their man-made jungle environment snapping their jaws and baring their deadly teeth. Instead of being allowed to cavort in the wild theyve become tools of the state and theyre none too happy about it.The circus of reality TV the emptiness of celebrity culture the horrors wrought by oppressive governments that rule by fear If you feel like rummaging around the fridge for tropes there are plenty here. Theres also a wackadoodle roster of supporting actors many -- like Stanley Tuccis Caesar Flickerman with his glow-in-the-dark choppers and Elizabeth Bankss Effie Trinket flouncing around in her feathery false eyelashes like a space-age Phyllis Diller -- returning from the first movie. There are newcomers too most notably Jeffrey Wright and the great Amanda Plummer as a duo of competitors who like Katniss rely more on brains than brawn. Neither has much to do but Plummers channeled-from-Neptune timing is a plus in any movie.Jennifer Lawrence of course is the real draw. Female role models come and go and Lawrences Katniss is one of the better ones. Katniss is clearly a Champion of the People but theres no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her. She gives the appearance of listening more than she talks the opposite of what we usually get from todays feisty heroines. Somehow Lawrence -- even though her character is a proactive Diana the Huntress -- makes thinking look more dynamic than reacting. Her eyes say lots of things ""Get over yourself;"" ""Im not buying this;"" and ""OK show me."" But sometimes they also say ""I dont know what I want."" Which guy which path which life? Lawrence is a movie star whos still believable as a girl. Shes both on fire and in the process of becoming and its magnificent to watch.Also read Sam Claflin and Jena Malone on Keeping The Hunger Games Catching Fire PG-132 Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson left) Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks center) and Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence right).Murray Close Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Like Katniss Everdeen ducking a poison-tip arrow the keepers of Suzanne Collinss trilogy of fantasy novels have dodged the perils of the sloppy second franchise film. The Hunger Games Catching Fire is leaner gutsier and smarter. In hand-to-hand combat it would have the first film on the floor trapped in a headlock whimpering for mercy. Over two-and-a-half heart-pounding hours it doesnt drag for a second. A hefty chunk of the story is similar to the last one - except this time theres more to lose. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss whose defiance has revolution a brewin in the districts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland playing evil Santa) can hear the howl of fury rising. Would you like to be in a real war? he threatens shark-eyes glinting. Snow puts his snakish sidekick (Philip Seymour Hoffman) on the job of devising a new version of the Games to eliminate Katniss - a champions championship. J-Law burns the screen. Shes stunning suggesting a storm raging behind her eyes and powerfully conveying Katnisss terror of leading the revolution. Shes no Bella Swan. Instead of batting her eyelashes at love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson less drippy this time) she shoos them away to focus on staying alive. The Games are more fun to watch this time around. In The Hunger Games we got a bunch of samey-looking teenagers fighting to the death. This is the Olympics of Hunger Games with the best of the best up against each other like Usain Bolt with daggers in his Pumas. One past winner who ripped a male tributes throat out with her teeth bares her sharpened fangs. Perversely though its a less violent film as the plot drives forward with a terrific pulse of energy. Whats thrilling (if you havent read the book) is that you never know which character is on Katnisss side. Who can she trust? Lawrence has first-rate support. Stanley Tucci gets the biggest laughs as the reality TV presenter with a spooky resemblance to Karl Lagerfeld. Even bubbleheaded ditz Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) shows her heart. Catching Fire looks and feels epic. Hands down its one of the most entertaining films of the year. But theres also something here-and-now about it - it taps the zeitgeist with its them-and-us society and the feeling that when money is in the hands of so few the odds are never in our favour.

Daily Edition Login to download The Hunger Games Catching Fire Film Review 729 PM PST 11/11/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The book literally put onscreen which will delight fans to no end. TWITTER The second big-screen installment of Suzanne Collins YA trilogy sees Jennifer Lawrence return as the heroic Katniss Everdeen with new faces Philip Seymour Hoffman Jena Malone Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin joining the franchise. As faithful as Argos or Old Yeller Snowy or Hachiko The Hunger Games Catching Fire runs no risk of disappointing its absolutely ravenous target audience. Serving up everything from Suzanne Collins eventful second installment in her trilogy about teenage warrior and rebel Katniss Everdeen that fans could possibly want to see this is a safe serviceable carefully crafted action drama in which the subversive seeds planted in the first story take welcome root. As before Jennifer Lawrence is the superb center of it all and the massive success of this Lionsgate release is as certain as the turning of the Earth. At this point the franchises clout is likely mightier than it was 20 months ago when the first film grossed 152.5 million in its opening weekend then good for third place on the all-time list. Lawrences cache is now greater the production values are notably better thanks to a 130 million-plus budget up from 78 million for the original and more than 50 million copies of the book are now in print in the U.S. There is also considerable room for improvement in overseas box office as the first film generated only 41 percent of its 691.2 million global haul from foreign territories. PHOTOS Hunger Games Catching Fire Meet the Key Characters Although Catching Fire had a rushed and tumultuous preproduction period due to the departure of original director Gary Ross and a quick search for a new one that settled on Francis Lawrence (no relation to the star) the film shows no signs of haste. The script by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn reflects the shape emphasis and incident of the book with almost scientific precision and the desire to deliver the expected goods is keenly felt. Some key personnel have returned -- production designer Philip Messina and composer James Newton Howard in particular -- while others including costume designer Trish Summerville and cinematographer Jo Willems -- are new. Across the board the new film boasts a noticeably spiffier more confident feel than the first even as the overriding impression is one of methodical responsibility to the source material. The root of the conflict here is betrayal while the storys underlying drive is subversion a strong dramatic combination. With Katniss safely back at home in District 12 her biggest problem would seem to be figuring out what to do with obvious match Gale (Liam Hemsworth) in light of her official romance with her Hunger Games co-winner Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). A surprise visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland) makes plain his own insistence that she play ball not only in maintaining the fictional love story but in satisfying his own suspicions of her loyalty to him and the Capitol. Its clear that hed use the slightest excuse to have her eliminated. Instead he develops a different ploy. After a traditional Victors Tour through all of Panems districts which reveals that public discontent could easily break out into revolution against Snows fascistic control its announced that the 75th anniversary of the Capitols ultimate victory -- the third Quarter Quell -- will trigger a new set of games to be played exclusively by former winners one man and one woman from each district. Many of these victors are old friends not to mention national heroes. In the case of District 12 it means that Katniss will be pitted against either Peeta or their old mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson). Its Peeta that volunteers. PHOTOS Hunger Games Catching Fire World Premiere Lights Up Red Carpet ""Last year was childs play"" Haymitch warns his proteges who need to sort out how they feel about one another as well as who between them should survive or die if it comes down to that. Katniss is fatalistic about it convinced as she is that President Snow will never allow her to live while others for that very reason argue that she must never give in as shes the face and instigation of the growing rebellion. Although dominated by gray wintery skies and the cold wind of totalitarian oppression the first 80 minutes of exposition and build-up are packed with incident ranging from Robocop-like soldiers assaulting or killing civilians over insubordinate acts big and small to the former victors rides on a luxury train all over the country their adornment for many television and public appearances (Lawrence gets innumerable costume and makeup changes) a grand entrance on chariots into the Capitol that would have pleased Nero himself and a training period in which the contestants test and display their skills. These interludes also provide for the returns of such actors from the original as Elizabeth Banks as the style maven and den mother Effie Trinket Lenny Kravitz as Katniss designer Cinna and most amusingly Stanley Tucci as the purple-eyebrowed ivory-toothed and irrepressibly sycophantic TV host Caesar Flickerman. A more equivocal new character turns up in the person of Philip Seymour Hoffmans Plutarch Heavensbee the freshly appointed chief gamemaker who will be overseeing an event thats inspiring an increasingly queasy feeling in the public given how beloved many of the former winners are and their unhappiness at being forced to participate. Given that the modern gladiators may be reluctant to kill one another and that some expedient alliances take shape (presumably to target hotshot newcomers like Katniss and Peeta) Plutarch is obliged to create an environment for the games thats unprecedented in its treacherousness. Rather paradoxically its here that Catching Fire falls a bit short of its predecessor in an almost subliminal way. In the first installment wary young warriors were forced to live by their wits and hunt one another in repeated do-or-die mano a mano situations. Here the unenthusiastic veterans are subjected to manufactured hazards -- invisible force fields a rolling fog of poison gas enraged fanged monkeys attack birds a spinning rock island to which some have retreated -- that have the cumulative feel of a designed theme park attraction rather than a confrontation with nature. STORY Hunger Games Catching Fire 5 Most Anticipated Scenes The climax centered on some stunning shots of a dazed Katniss and game-changing last-second revelations neatly whet the appetite for the finale Mockingjay (to be divided not surprisingly into two films directed by Lawrence the first of which will be released next November). Although less of her screen time is devoted to outdoor action than was the case the first time around Lawrence further solidifies her tenacious grip on this signature role as she explores Katniss tortured inner self. Hutcherson comes into his own more confidently than before while Hemsworth left behind in District 12 has less to do. Sutherland adroitly ups the odiousness of the tyrannical national leader while some of the newcomers cut particularly strong figures notably Hoffman has the hard-to-read wizard of hazards Jeffrey Wright as a brilliant tech geek Jena Malone as a kick-ass former winner and most arrestingly of all Sam Claflin as a madly charming handsome and self-possessed contestant who won the games when he was just 14 and effortlessly attaches himself to Team Katniss. Technical and craft contributions mark a step up from the original.

""The Hunger Games"" featured kids killing kids for sport. Its sequel the far superior ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" rewrites the rules which not only makes for a more exciting death match but also yields a rich sociopolitical critique in the process in keeping with the incendiary subtext of Suzanne Collins dystopian novel. Though technically just the bridge between the lower-budget original and the two-part finale still to come in director Francis Lawrences steady hands (gone are the previous films needlessly spastic camera moves) ""Catching Fire"" makes for rousing entertainment in its own right leaving fans riled and ready to storm the castle. Massive international interest should leave Lionsgate with coffers full and money to burn.This story first appeared in the November 19 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. If ""Catching Fire"" were a traditional studio sequel one could reasonably expect a bigger bloodier elimination contest to take centerstage -- more of the same presumably amplified by the extra 50 million or so Lionsgate poured into the budget this time around. Instead this film hews to the model established by the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" franchises where fidelity to the source material takes precedence allowing this fictional world to grow deeper and more complex with each successive installment. PHOTOS Catching Fire Premieres in London Unlike the authors of those book series Collins got her start in screenwriting which might explain her almost instinctively cinematic sense of storytelling in which characters and scenes are described so vividly fans can scarcely wait to see how they will be translated onscreen. On that level -- and despite its hefty 691 million worldwide  haul -- ""The Hunger Games"" was a disappointment clumsily shot and strangely cast (Jennifer Lawrence was nearly a decade too old while Josh Hutcherson was hardly the stocky bakers son readers had pictured). Good then that the reins have passed from ""Hunger Games"" helmer Gary Ross to Francis Lawrence -- a director with a firm grasp of large-canvas filmmaking equally skilled at tense white-knuckle sci-fi (""I Am Legend"") and bald unapologetic romance (as evidenced by his excellent yet underseen circus swooner ""Water for Elephants""). Both qualities come strongly into play here as the director finds the perfect balance between emotion and excitement. SEE ALSO Catching Fire on Track for Mega 150 Million Debut Fortunes have changed significantly for Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) since the starvation days of life in District 12. Making good on Scarlett OHaras vow she and her clan will never be hungry again thanks to a shrewd move that forced the game-makers to accept both her and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson) as winners. The countrys corrupt figurehead President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesnt take kindly to being outwitted however and his latest scheme to keep the people of Panem in check will pit the survivors of previous Hunger Games against one another. The story opens as Katniss and Peeta make their victory tour during which they are permitted not only to observe how the other 11 districts live but also to glimpse the nascent signs of rebellion throughout the country (an unspecified portion of the United States set in a not-so-distant future ably represented by location shooting in Atlanta). Having defied the capital once already the couple signifies hope to all those who feel oppressed just as their story galvanizes real-world auds into feeling the same way. More than half the film unfolds before the 75th annual Hunger Games actually begin. Much of that time is spent expanding our understanding of this ruthlessly oppressive society and raising the stakes for the uprising in store. As the couples CG train zips between districts we see how Snows stormtroopers buckle down on what little freedom remains offset by the empty frivolity of life in the capital -- a nonstop binge-and-purge banquet where wild hairstyles and lavish costume changes provide distraction from an idle existence. This is Oz reimagined as a fascist state nearly all of its color drained to an overcast brown-gray. It may seem like a small thing but choosing the right costume designer makes an enormous impact on the new film as Trish Summerville (2011s ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") crafts a stunning array of fashions to reflect the citizens show-offy attitudes (including a dress made entirely of monarch butterflies). Clothing plays a central role in Collins books and finally the crew seems capable of bringing her elaborate costumes to life including the impossible-sounding wedding dress Katniss wears to her big TV interview. Since many ""Hunger Games"" fans hang on every such detail director Lawrence paces the film accordingly giving audiences time to take it all in even if it means delaying the big arena showdown theyve presumably all come to see. The film does breeze through Katniss visit to the victors housing which might have yielded a bit more insight into the lifestyle she and Peeta could have hoped to enjoy had Snow and replacement game-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman a casting coup) not found a way to pull them back in. Instead the reigning champs meet their fellow survivors in the training arena forging alliances with the five people least likely to improve their chances in an all-pro slaughter. Theres pretty-boy hustler Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin devilishly charming) and his octogenarian mentor Mags (Lynn Cohen) an irrepressible rebel named Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and a pair of odd-ball inventors whom everyone calls Nuts and Volts (Amanda Plummer and Jeffrey Wright looking like escapees from a Terry Gilliam movie). By emphasizing the tentative trust among these seven characters as opposed to simply stirring up another every-child-for-herself battle royale ""Catching Fire"" lays the groundwork for the ambitious next chapter -- operating as a close-knit team in order to effect change -- and introduces friends too dear to eliminate. Still its not as if this installment skimps on violence. Rather the threats come in many new forms this time around from poison fog to bloody rain. As in Ray Bradburys 1950 short story ""The Veldt"" this exotic arena boasts its own sinister agenda unleashing fresh challenges upon the combatants at the top of every hour. As before the central duo strikes a balance between survival and selflessness as Katniss and Peeta prioritize others lives before their own. Though far older at 23 than the wide-eyed 16-year-old described in the book Jennifer Lawrence masterfully conveys the characters naivete while bringing a strength and resolve no preteen actor possibly could. In the time since the first movie she has become a bona fide star which suits a character who feels overwhelmed by her own celebrity. Behind Collins bestseller lies a shrewd social commentary. In ""The Hunger Games"" the author turned an exploitation premise on its head challenging the public to reconcile their moral outrage over a bad-taste killing contest with the bloodlust they felt in wanting to see Katniss survive. Here she reveals how widespread media exposure can be used to subvert the status quo even as she dismantles the allure of fame the hollow goal to which so many young people aspire. With its pseudo-war-photography shooting style the first film played jittery tag-along witness to Katniss ordeal. By taming the camera and focusing on the emotional truth of each highly charged moment the director and d.p. Jo Willems (""Limitless"") invite us into Katniss head which is where the first-person books unfolded. Through her eyes Peetas sacrifices seem even more noble (crucial for the big twist to work in the upcoming ""Mockingjay"") the threats that much more immediate. In Imax the widescreen aspect ratio expands to fill the entire screen during the Hunger Games portion of the film though its an unnecessary boost as helmer Lawrence and his team have calibrated the entire experience for maximum engagement. And while its pleasures cant touch the thrill of seeing the Death Star destroyed -- not yet at least -- the film runs circles around George Lucas ability to weave complex political ideas into the very fabric of B-movie excitement.

Jamie says November 23 2013 at 928 pm A banal exciting disturbing theatre of the macabre. Why? Because in 2020 it could possibly happen. We should be scared  Reply chad says November 23 2013 at 1026 pm Hunger Games is unwittingly a test pilot-show to see if kids killing kids was permissible and desired. They got their answer. Reply Matthew Palmer says November 24 2013 at 444 am A welcome positive review. Some film critics miss the point that this is a movie mostly faithfully from a book for adolescents/young adults and adults. Without the broad subject matter and without the spectacle of The Hunger Games there may not have been enough to draw in as demographically wide an audience which can then be provoked by the content and subject matter. The age of Jennifer Lawrence need not be in question - she is simply magnificent in the role and it seems unlilkely the character of Katniss would be as endearing and likeable nor the cliffhanger ending so jarring - afterall we leave our heroine out of jeopardy but emotionally overwhelmed had another actor been given the role. Erv Johnson says November 21 2013 at 229 am """"The Hunger Games"" featured kids killing kids for sport."" It is statements like the above that makes me seldom read reviews. The above statement could not be farther from the truth. Reply chadk says November 21 2013 at 620 am If by ""for sport"" you mean whimsy on the part of the kids no. But it is for sport. The ruling elite more-or-less said ""I have invented a tournament where kids kill kids for our sport for our amusement for sport. I call it the Hunger Games."" Reply Erv Johnson says November 21 2013 at 712 am You nailed it. I soon as started reading the book I saw America and Washington DC elites. Joseph Redmond says November 12 2013 at 756 pm Im an old film exhibitor and Debruges take on the second  Hunger Games -""Catching Fire "". has me looking forward to something special and a lot more than a good popcorn flick. Reply David says November 12 2013 at 520 pm THE HUNGER GAMES was filmed in May/June 2011 when Jennifer Lawrence was 20. That makes her 4 years too old not 10. And being 16 make you a teen not a preteen. If youre going to obsess over age at least get it right. Reply Bill says November 12 2013 at 509 pm The comment ""kids killing kids for sport"" is disingenuous at best. It is not the kids who are enjoying the killing but rather they are forced into it lest their families be killed as a way of the government suppressing rebellion. If you want to see kids killing kids for sport look at any street gang. Reply chadk says November 21 2013 at 651 am You cant just stop at the perspective of the kids and say it is not a sport. From the perspective of the elites who invented the hunger games it is for their amusement their sport. Also the throngs of millions of fellow citizens who whoop and cheer dont sound too left out. Complete with pre-show hoopla and sponsors. Think of gladiators. If the line had read ""Hunger Games features kids killing kids for bloodsport."" There would be no confusion. Child cockfighting. Reply Dennis says November 12 2013 at 249 pm I thought ""Underwater for Elephants"" was boring poorly cast and dragged as a film. Not read the book but the translation mustve been lost in the mix. Alas you know what they say about films and books. Reply Michelle Clark Miller says November 12 2013 at 1117 am I have to take issue with the jerky camera snark...the reason the camera was jerky was during the initial bloodbath. The producers were already being watched like hawks by the frothing at the mouth Harry Potter is the Devil parents groups because of the books premise...so they depicted the slaughter with those jerky movements. That way the audience would get caught up in the action and understand what was going on...without the producers being accused of glorifying the massacre. Walking the line they had to walk with the story line is probably the main reason this movie was as restrained as it was....had they not been worried about the parents groups and been able to move about a little more freely I bet the movie would have been even better. Reply hvsteve1 says November 12 2013 at 852 am A series of hit films aimed at kids...about kids killing other kids for sport. Can anyone reading Variety imagine this premise not being controversial a few decades back. I dont know if this speaks well or poorly about where the industry and society has gone. Reply Michelle Clark Miller says November 12 2013 at 1120 am The books are NOT for kids if by kids you mean the Harry Potter set. These books are for young adults...and in the section marked as such. Young adults these days who see PG13 and yes even R rated movies...and to whom violence is not such a foreign entity. Reply Ali Miller says November 12 2013 at 939 am The books are a critique of society media and our cultures desensitization to violence. A rather obvious critique at that. It continues to surprise me that people miss this point. Reply chadk says November 12 2013 at 1056 pm Human Centipede was particularly insightful and helps me reflect on the state of our society. Great. So you can just make a movie about anything horrid and excuse it by saying that it is a critique of todays desensitization to horrid things ? The Hunger Games is about a world of adults co-operating to make a movie about kids killing kids. Thats a commentary on society. U cant B Sirius says November 12 2013 at 834 am Most of these comments are missing the heart of this review. It sounds like this film one day may take its place beside ""OZ"" Especially if the series can maintain the standard this segment represents. Im NOT a fan either. Havent read the books BUT ""wow"" THIS REVIEW just got me ""interested."" This reviewer makes the film seem a ""must see"" and ""not to be missed"" EVENT. TWO on the AISLE please Reply guest says November 12 2013 at 816 am The monarch dress is Alexander McQueen. Reply Anny K says November 12 2013 at 624 am Wow Your review is so amazing It makes me want to see the film now more than ever. And Im not a fan in the least. Reply Mewoth says November 12 2013 at 504 am Uhm Lawrence is not a decade older than Katniss?? She was 20/21 when the first film was shot and Katniss is 16 in the first book... plus 4-5 years too old is hardly uncommon for Hollywood Reply George Valentin says November 12 2013 at 431 am I cant wait to see Katniss again Reply lea says November 12 2013 at 240 am Katniss is 16 in the books not 12. Her little sister Prim was 12. Katniss turns 17 halfway through the second book. Reply loriesouth says November 12 2013 at 425 am Jennifer Lawrence was age 22 when this movie was made.

This second installment of the film series based on the novels by Suzanne Collins hits all the bases for a genre movie -- whether youre there for thrills romance or even sociopolitical commentary youll come away satisfied. See photos Hunger Games Catching Fire World Premiere Jennifer Lawrence Sparkles on the Red Carpet Of course second chapters have it easy since the first movie does all the heavy lifting of establishing the world and its inhabitants but thats not the only reason ""Catching Fire"" seems like a step up from the perfectly fine ""The Hunger Games."" Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") takes over the directorial reins with Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael deBruyn (a pseudonym for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Toy Story 3"" writer Michael Arndt) handling script duties and what results is a film that keeps a multitude of thematic plates spinning. See video Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Are a Distraction in New Hunger Games Catching Fire Clip Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are set to tour the districts as their victory lap for having won the 74th Hunger Games even though the trip involves rubbing their win in the noses of the family and friends of the fallen contestants from the other sectors. The intimidating President Snow (Donald Sutherland) pays a personal visit to Katniss reminding her that her for-show romance with Peeta is the only thing keeping the two of them alive and that she had better step up their fake affection while in public. Whats really bothering Snow is that Katniss has become a symbol of hope for the oppressed and even when shes sticking to the official script her very presence becomes a beacon of revolt. In an attempt to keep her and her fellow champions in line Snow and new games planner Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) put a twist into the 75th Hunger Games using the every-25-years ""Quarter-Quell"" as an excuse to turn the existing victors into the pool of new contestants. Also read Jennifer Lawrence Lops Hair Off to Kick Off Hunger Games Catching Fire Press Tour As District 12s only female victor Katniss is automatically selected but Peeta steps up and volunteers in the place of boozy coach Haymitch (Woody Harrelson). Forced to train once again at the capitol Katniss and Peeta find themselves facing off against an even deadlier crew of opponents -- although now that all the players have nothing to lose what with their lives on the line a second time the new Games could become the crucible for revolution against the oppressive state. There are any number of readings available here from Katniss and Peetas relationship mirroring generations of Hollywood stars (closeted and otherwise) with fake publicity marriages to the oppression of the working classes by the greedy 1% to the vagaries and dangers of instant fame to bread and circuses and ""Catching Fire"" allows viewers to dig into or avoid the metaphors as much as they want. On its face we still have the compelling relationships -- Katniss love for Gale (Liam Hemsworth) continues although in the line of fire she discovers her feelings for Peeta arent entirely fictional -- and a richer sense of characterization this time around. See video Jennifer Lawrence Doesnt Want to Lead a Revolution in First Hunger Games Catching Fire Clip Either Elizabeth Banks bizarrely overdressed flack and Stanley Tuccis unctuous TV host are being played more subtly or real life is catching up to the absurdity of their characters but theyre much more interesting to watch this time around. Lawrence of course grounds the film with her intensity and her passion and Hutcherson and Willow Shields (as Primrose) get to be more complex and multi-dimensional this time as well. Backing them up are several worthy new additions to the cast besides Hoffman we get Jeffrey Wright Amanda Plummer Sam Claflin Lynn Cohen and Jena Malone as new competitors. Some ideas get raised that sadly arent pursued -- Katniss clearly has PTSD from her experiences in the previous Games and Snow and Heavensbee hatch a plot to turn public sentiment against Katniss by basically turning her into a Kardashian -- but at 146 minutes (which fly by) the movie has no dead spaces. Even this second go-round of the Hunger Games themselves feels excitingly different with Heavensbee lobbing everything from poisonous fog to killer simians at the combatants. ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" serves up food for thought and jolts of adrenaline in equal doses which is more than most YA adaptations have managed to deliver. Dismiss it as a popcorn movie if you must but at least theyve bothered to serve it with real butter and truffle salt. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

By NANCY CHURNIN nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 20 November 2013 0111 PM Updated 21 November 2013 0501 PM Related The top 10 movies to warm up winter this holiday season Watch the trailer for Divergent the movie adapted by Dallas Evan Daugherty Find a movie in Dallas-Fort Worth by theater Holiday movie guide Whats coming to Dallas theaters Do your homework before heading to The Hunger Games Catching Fire. If you havent read at least the first book in Suzanne Collins best-selling dystopian trilogy or seen the first film dont expect director Francis Lawrence to play catch-up.Hes too busy careening from ""moves to countermoves"" in one of the movies signature phrases to explain why President Snow (Donald Sutherland) wrests two children from 12 districts each year to fight to the death on a reality TV show called the Hunger Games.In fact newbies will be lost in the opening scene as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) aims an arrow at a bird she is hunting and then shakes when the bird takes the form of a young man.Those who know the story will understand shes suffering post-traumatic shock from the 74th annual Hunger Games which she and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) won at the expense of 22 dead adolescents killed while viewers watched on their screens.Those who understand the outrage that powers the books should also appreciate the blunt way it embraces Collins cautionary vision of how a ruthless privileged few can keep the masses down by dividing them and entertaining them -- in the case of this show literally to death.Sure electricity crackles in the romantic triangle of Katniss Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth). But just as Katniss tells Gale she is too busy trying to survive to think about love the film doesnt linger on romance. Instead the focus is on the rumblings of revolution.The chess game begins with Snow making moves to trivialize Katniss bravery as the impulsive actions of a besotted young girl. When people continue to see her as strong and defiant he looks for fresh ways to disillusion them forcing her into the 75th Hunger Games.Given his long and remarkable career Sutherlands ability to intimidate does not surprise. But given her youth (despite her Academy Award for Silver Linings Playbook) the knowing disgust Lawrence conveys as she stands up to him stuns.She also puts viewers through the emotional wringer in scenes where she tenderly embraces her sister leaps to take the lash for Gale and back in the hated killing arena screams in anguish at the electric shock that knocks Peeta to the ground.Director Lawrence spins the tale in steel blues charcoal and grays to keep the focus on grim choices. Theres no joy in the excesses of his Capitol as the fortunate feast while masses starve.With the exception of Katniss exhilarating dresses including a glamorous wedding gown the Capitol clothes that seemed so pretty in the first film come off as garish and crude the layered-on lashes and eyeliner sad and desperate.Yes there are details fans of the books will miss. They will no doubt be shocked that a film that leaves them breathless and wanting more clocks in at almost 21/2 hours.Follow Nancy Churnin on Twitter at nchurnin.THE HUNGER GAMES CATCHING FIRE (B+)Directed by Francis Lawrence.
