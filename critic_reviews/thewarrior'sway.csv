E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + And here the fanboys were thinking theyd have to wait for ""Cowboys amp; Aliens to see some preposterously hybridized western action. Turns out ninjas also spent some time on the frontier at least in the stylized re-creation cooked up in ""The Warriors Way by first-time filmmaker Sngmoo Lee and Korean star Jang Dong Gun (""Tae Guk Gi The Brotherhood of War). Jang is cast in dialogue-lite mode as Yang the top assassin in a martial clan whose name the Sad Flutes refers to the sound their targets make after getting their throats sliced.Cold stuff -- but when Yang shows enough warmth to spare the life of a baby the lone survivor of his clans sworn enemies hes targeted by his own people and forced into hiding. Yang and the baby land in a dusty American outpost called Lode less for any logical reason than because mash-up junkies might pay to watch when Yang inevitably clashes with outlaws and his estranged ninja brothers.Lee collaborated on the movie with a producer from ""The Lord of the Rings shooting the project on a New Zealand soundstage against hyper-stylized green-screen backgrounds. In publicity write-ups the filmmakers seem eager to draw comparisons to ""300 and its not a big reach. Theres definite zing to violent flourishes like Yang leaving a slow-mo trail of arterial mist in his wake or attacking gunslingers through a dynamite-triggered haze with only the ring of his blade and the gurgles of victims hinting hes there.Picture ""300 striving for a whimsical second act though and youll understand where ""Warriors Way goes wrong for a long stretch. Lode might look like a ghost town but its bustling with a host of characters and caricatures. Theres the spunky tomboy (Kate Bosworth ""Superman Returns) the boozy layabout (Geoffrey Rush repurposing his ""Pirates of the Caribbean saltiness) and even ugh a displaced circus troupe led by ringmaster Eight-Ball (Tony Cox Billy Bob Thorntons ""Bad Santa sidekick). The only genuinely amusing bits skew dark particularly Danny Hustons terrifically squirmy scene-chewing as a rogue Civil War colonel terrorizing the town with his volatility and fetish for gals with good teeth.While the movie seems designed to be a breakout for Jang its Lee whose work actually makes an impression. You guess hell be back -- hopefully playing it straight next time.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Daily Edition Login to download The Warriors Way -- Film Review 425 PM PST 12/3/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Media There are so many ways to kill a man in a samurai-gangster-spaghetti western. TWITTER Movie houses may have to expand their concession-stand choices to accommodate fans of movies such as ""The Warrioras Way"" to include perhaps Szechwan popcorn and kimchi pasta. For its Korean-born but American film school-educated writer-director Sngmoo Lee has tossed into the blender about as many different film genres and heroes as you can imagine. One ticket buys you cowboys samurais gangsters ninjas spaghetti Westerns Hong Kong martial artists knife throwers and even Fellini-esque circus performers. But like kimchi pasta some things arenat meant to mix. The ingredients here congeal into a gooey mess that is not without amusing moments thanks to a what-the-hell attitude that seems to have permeated the set. Certainly the designers cinematographer and digital crew went to town with an exotic ambience a kind of Arizona by way of the Mongolian desert that features arresting matte paintings and fabulous skies behind a desolate town that looks like nobody could possibly live there. The actors other than South Korean star Jang Dong Gun take turns mugging for all theyre worth with Geoffrey Rush and Danny Huston going toe-to-toe in a scenery-chewing contest. You can almost see wood splinters and nails spewing from their mouths. The multicultural mash-up pivots around the Korean star playing an Asian warrior and the worlds greatest swordsman. He flees to the American desert to escape his own murderous clan when he refuses to slaughter the last remaining member of a rival bunch a baby girl. He is a narrator explains in the beginning ""a warrior with empty eyes"" which may also be a description of Jangs acting style. To be fair this is his first English-language movie and when he occasionally speaks he acquits himself adequately before the movie reverts to combat mode. The warrior totes the giggly infant around in various bags and satchels until he reaches ""a town full of broken people at the end of the desert."" Unaccountably a carnival has taken up permanent resident in this town with scarcely enough citizens to form an audience. A Chinese friend he means to visit is dead but the warrior revives the mans laundry business with the help of the young knife-throwing redheaded heroine Lynne (Kate Bosworth) while the town drunk (Rush) watches everything with a jaundiced assurance that the script will eventually reveal his true talents as a gun-fighter. The town of Lode is plagued by a marauding band of bad guys lead by a colonel (Huston) who once tried to rape Lynn when she was an adolescent but had to settle for murdering her entire family instead. If youre guessing she wants revenge then youll also guess that the warrior will teach her the sword and knife tricks needed to fulfill this ambition. A climax brings together murderous cowboys and lethal ninjas along with guns swords knives dynamite Gatling guns and a new use for that Ferris wheel. When the body count goes way beyond the number of combatants that initially charges into town you gotta figure some are getting up to fight again when theyre supposed to be dead. Lee stages the carnage with enthusiasm and style making it clear in every frame that none of this is to be taken as anything other an artistic effort in composition and imagery. Bodies fly apart in silhouette warriors take to the air in slow motion and tumult is choreographed down to the tiniest detail. A credit crawl reveals a New Zealand-based production that uses partial sets and green-screen techniques along with CGI and matte paintings to achieve its mythological look. As befits the new order of globalized cinema contributions came from Australia Asia India Europe and the U.S. But you awaken from the films surreal reverie as from a dream experienced after a midnight-movie marathon in a grind house.

"The Warriors Way has the mind of a fifth-grader but not the soul. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Warriors Way has the mind of a fifth-grader but not the soul. The Warriors Way has the mind of a fifth-grader but not the soul. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 7 2010 418 PM Ninjas vs. Cowboys vs. Carnies The Warriors Way has the mind of a fifth-grader but not the soul. By Josh Levin The Warriors Way The ninjas-go-to-Tombstone slice-em-up The Warriors Way (Relativity Media) feels like it was conceived by a fifth-grade boy given free rein to write about his favorite things. Theres a dagger-throwing lady and a clown and a samurai warrior and cowboys and dynamite and guns and a drunk guy whose pants fall down and a dwarf named 8-Ball and then the bad guys come and the ninjas start to fly and theres blood everywhere and its all in slow motion and its totally awesome. Well not quite. The Warriors Way never achieves awesomeness mostly because it never fully embraces its elementary-school playground aesthetic. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. The movies opening scene introduces us to ninja-assassin Yang (Jang Dong-Gun a Korean star in his Hollywood debut). According to on-screen bubble letters hes ""The Greatest Swordsman in the History of Mankind Ever."" While Yang lives up to his moniker--he slays his adversaries so quickly that hes either mind-blowingly amazing with a sword or the other warriors went to a non-accredited ninja academy--the ""Greatest Swordsman"" gewgaw never appears again nor does any other bubble-lettered flourish. Its a telling discontinuity in a movie that never finds a consistent tone oscillating between self-conscious ridiculousness and unwarranted seriousness of purpose. Why so serious? Yang who says little and emotes less wields his weapon on behalf of the Sad Flutes a cadre of assassins on a mission to kill every last ninja in a rival clan. The Greatest Swordsman stops the slaughter when the Flutes have just one foe remaining a pudgy-cheeked newborn princess whos just too adorable to vivisect. Rather than commit infanticide he bundles up the little girl and takes her to America where he hopes to reconnect with an old friend and leave his stabbing ways behind. Yangs destination is a desiccated circus town replete with a bearded lady a dwarf ( Bad Santas Tony Cox in a role as thankless as you can imagine) and a floppy drunk (Geoffrey Rush who spends much of the movie with the Old West equivalent of plumbers butt). In this land of carnival cliches Yang meets a dagger thrower named Lynne (Kate Bosworth) with a similarly troubled soul. After the samurai seals his sword he teaches the Badlands lass some knife tricks tends a garden reopens his friends laundry and most harrowing of all learns to change a diaper. Advertisement First-time writer and director Sngmoo Lee who was born in Korea and went to film school in the United States conceived of The Warriors Way more than a decade ago when he lived in New York. ""Most of the laundry franchises [in America] were run by Korean men. Theyre just Mr. Lee the laundry guy "" he explained in a recent interview. ""I think that was the beginning What if that laundry man was the deadliest assassin?"" While Lees intention might be to rescue Asian men from anonymity The Warriors Way succeeds in perpetuating a different stereotype--Koreans can be laundry guys ninjas or both Yang is the same inscrutable Far Eastern warrior that weve seen in movies for 100 years dispensing Miyagi-esque advice--""I just taught you how to focus"" he explains to Lynne after forcing her to heave knives while blindfolded--to a less cosmically attuned Western pupil. Just as annoying and predictable is the sexless relationship between the romantic leads. While were supposed to believe that Yang and Lynne are in love they never steal away for a romp under the rickety old Ferris wheel. But at least theres a non-steamy kiss--an improvement over the ""tight hug"" shared by Aaliyah and Jet Li at the conclusion of 2000s Romeo Must Die. The presence of a romantic arc chaste or otherwise is a signal that The Warriors Way went way off track. Despite the overabundant Super Nintendo-quality CGI--by all rights the green-screen operator should get first billing--this could have been a riotous overcaffeinated genre mash-up. Instead the answer to the only question anyone really cares about--Who wins a three-way fight between ninjas cowboys and dynamite-wielding carnies?--comes far too late for any thrills.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Geoffrey Rush is both a great actor and a great overactor. Hes a consummate ham as comfortable mugging through ridiculous schlock as highbrow fare. So its altogether apt that Rush can currently be seen both going toe-to-toe with Colin Firth in The Kings Speech--the current favorite in the Best Actor Oscar race and likely to earn Rush a Best Supporting Actor nod--and staggering drunkenly through an Old West town made up of circus freaks in the culture-clash East-meets-Western film The Warriors Way. The egregious overacting of Rush and fellow well-seasoned ham Danny Huston fits the films campy ridiculousness just as neatly as Rushs wry wit and restraint suited his fine performance in The Kings Speech. A film that just might get overlooked come Oscar night The Warriors Way casts Jang Dong-gun as the greatest swordsman in the world an assassin so skilled that killing comes as naturally to him as breathing. But when Jang refuses to kill a baby belonging to a rival clan his mentor singles him out for assassination. Jang takes the baby and flees to a sleepy backwater in the American West where the circus came to town and never left. There he learns the mysterious way of the non-warrior over the course of a single becoming-domesticated sequence. But trouble looms in the form of Jangs vengeance-minded clan and a deranged disfigured military man played by Huston. Jang glides through the film with his stoic visage frozen in a perfect poker face Hes an oasis of purposeful calm in the midst of gleeful deliberate lunacy. Thankfully Rush Huston and Kate Bosworth help the film maintain a sense of equilibrium by overacting in direct proportion to Jangs underacting as respectively a drunk with a dark secret a scenery-chewing mass murderer with the ghoulish mask of a slasher-film villain and the rootingest tootingest knife-thrower in the whole dang town. The Warriors Way gets far on the sheer preposterousness of its premise and execution though the pervasive threat of sexual violence from Huston undercuts some of the goofy fun. Sngmoo Lee directs with tongue firmly in cheek and a winning sense of the films goofiness; to damn his agreeable campfest with faint praise The Warriors Way is easily the best circus-themed martial-arts-heavy action-comedy oater of the year.

Credit Relativity Media There are a lot of different movies jostling for our attention inside ""The Warriors Way."" In terms of formula it resembles the chop suey western ""Shanghai Noon"" an Asian princess and her protector are transported to the Wild West where theyre pursued by Americans with guns and Asians with swords. Jackie Chan has been replaced by the Korean star Jang Dong Gun and Lucy Liu by a remarkably composed toddler named Analin Rudd.On a conceptual level ""The Warriors Way"" is something altogether different and more self-conscious. Set in a fantastical ghost town with a resident circus troupe and filmed on studio sets it looks like a Sergio Leone epic as staged by Fellini or by Lars von Trier. The genre-mashing makes sense given the resume of the writer and director Sngmoo Lee who has a masters degree in cinema studies from New York University and helped found the film department at the Korean National University of Arts.The best way to understand the film though is in commercial terms as an attempt to use Mr. Jang to cash in on the audience that has come out for crossover action hits starring Mr. Chan and Jet Li. Mr. Jang has presence and a movie-star face but hes a latecomer to martial arts and swordplay; following a typical South Korean path he started out in soap operas and moved into crime and war movies building a distinguished (and highly profitable) filmography that includes the great action-crime drama ""Nowhere to Hide.""Generalizing brutally you could argue that Hong Kong movies require actors trained to be fluid and funny while South Korean movies like their male characters stiff and stern and Mr. Jang doesnt make the same kind of impression in ""The Warriors Way"" that his Hong Kong counterparts have in their American movies. The film also muffles him by keeping his dialogue to a minimum (even though his English is perfectly acceptable) filling the space with Geoffrey Rushs narration and the chattering of Kate Bosworths logorrheic female sidekick.Mr. Jang is not the problem with ""The Warriors Way"" however. That would be Mr. Lees screenplay a thin and unconvincing gruel of western cliches martial arts action and forced comedy that wouldnt make the grade in the graphic novels that have clearly helped form his vision. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Bosworth the phlegmatic Mr. Jang and a ragged occasionally amusing Mr. Rush -- the good the sad and the ugly -- face off against a cartoonish brigand (Danny Huston admirably restrained) and phalanxes of hooded swordsmen led by the usual mystical Chinese warrior (Ti Lung ditto). The sometimes impressive visual effects make these battles entertaining in a mindless way but its impossible to work up any feeling about them. The only thing supplying that is the occasional laugh pout or gurgle by Ms. Rudd.""The Warriors Way"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for increasingly intense comic-book violence.THE WARRIORS WAYOpened on Friday nationwide.

Although its more likely to be embraced by fanboys and film buffs than by mainstream audiences ""The Warriors Way"" is a visually inspired multi-genre amalgamation a borderline-surreal folly that suggests a martial-arts action-adventure co-directed by Sergio Leone and Federico Fellini. First-time feature helmer Sngmoo Lee working from his own wildly eclectic screenplay dawdles during an extended swath of his narrative and doesnt fully utilize some of his more colorful characters and dramatic conceits. Overall however this outlandish concoction appears capable of attracting an appreciative cult on homevid after a modestly lucrative theatrical run. Pic kicks off with a portentous bit of gray-toned slo-mo carnage briskly establishing the lethally graceful prowess of Yang (Korean superstar Jang Dong-gun) a master assassin bent on slicing and dicing his way through the remnants of a rival clan. But he cant quite finish the job when he confronts the sole survivor an irresistibly cute baby girl who melts the heart of the cold-blooded killer. In a cheeky hat-tip to the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" Japanese pics and mangas of the 1970s Yang takes the newborn along as he departs his homeland for America with his former mentor Saddest Flute (Ti Lung) and a hundred or so other assassins in relentless pursuit. Yangs travels bring him to Lode a decrepit Southwest desert town dominated by an under-construction Ferris wheel -- which thanks to lenser Kim Woo-hyung and production designer Dan Hennah serves as almost a full-fledged supporting player -- and populated mostly by career-stalled traveling carnival performers. Pint-sized ringmaster Eight Ball (Tony Cox of ""Bad Santa"" fame) warmly greets Yang and his infant companion but others in town -- including the chronically soused Ron (Geoffrey Rush) -- are more reluctant to welcome the newcomers. Yang ingratiates himself by learning to operate the long-shuttered local laundry with a little help from Lynne (Kate Bosworth) a tomboyish beauty who in turn seeks Yangs help in mastering the art of knife-throwing. Lynne hopes that someday shell be able to eradicate the savagely violent Colonel (Danny Huston) who murdered her family years earlier. Filmed almost entirely on New Zealand studio sets ""The Warriors Way"" transports auds to a familiar yet fantastical world where through various forms of CGI wizardry every sunset is a crimson spectacle and a ramshackle desert town is brightened by the trappings of a gone-to-seed circus. Lee takes maybe a smidge too much time charting the chaste romantic attraction between Yang and Lynne and surrounds these attractive opposites with vivid supporting characters who dont always get the screen time they deserve. The body count doesnt start to mount until the halfway point and steadily escalates through the final 40 minutes of vidgame-style gunplay and sword-swinging. The rough-and-tumble mayhem is suitably kinetic but the film is just as enjoyable in scenes focusing on Yangs gradual acceptance by a community of eccentrics (think Clint Eastwood in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"") and his initially wary interactions with the uninhibited Lynne. Jang provides more of a presence than a performance as Yang expresses himself with a minimum of dialogue (the actors command of English is adequate to the task at hand) but neatly balances stoic reserve physicality and sly bemusement. Bosworth is amusing in her flirtatious scenes with Yang and passably convincing as Lynne doles out rough justice in pics final third. Huston often seems to be channeling the spirit or at least the distinctive voice of his iconic father John Huston while expressing the Colonels lip-smacking devilry. Rush earns easy laughs with his characters drunken foolishness but becomes far more interesting when Ron reveals his own capacity for violence. Tech values are everything they need to be for the film to work as an over-the-top kung-fu Western romantic fairy tale. Javier Navarretes clever multifarious musical score encompasses everything from grand opera to slide guitar from Ennio Morricone-like themes to the jaunty nautical standard (""The Sailors Hornpipe"") that many auds will recognize from ""Popeye"" cartoons of the 1930s.

Samurais kill cowboys cowboys kill circus freaks -- all for no particular reason other than to give director Sngmoo Lee a chance to go buck wild with eye-catching visuals lifted nearly intact from the reels of Zhang Yimou (Hero) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Micmacs) among others. Backing up Jang is a cast of Hollywood vets phoning in plasticine versions of characters theyve done before the sexy tomboy (Kate Bosworth) the half-mad codger (Geoffrey Rush) the fully batty villain (Danny Huston). There isnt a shred of subtlety in their clowning -- or in any part of the movie which clumsily shoots for operatic highs and lows. But with so many borrowed bits and pieces the only feeling it successfully evokes is deja vu. D+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Movie review The Warriors Way - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Warriors WayJang Dong-Gun stars in Sngmoo Lees martial arts/western mash-up.December 04 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times For the most part ""Warriors Way"" an outdoor story shot... (Relativity Media )A master swordsman leaves his homeland of warring clans for the Wild West in the bloody wuxia/shoot-em-up hybrid ""The Warriors Way."" But South Korean filmmaker Sngmoo Lees debut feature is less a genre-spanning romp than a tiresome lab experiment in computer-generated tropes and green-screen oppressiveness. The human part involves quietly dashing Korean star Jang Dong-Gun as the stoic blade-wielding nomad Yang who brings his waylaid enemies lone survivor a baby girl he cant bring himself to kill to an American frontier outpost made up mostly of circus workers led by a welcoming ringmaster named Eightball (the always appealing Tony Cox). There Yang takes over a laundry grows flowers teaches the spiritual side of knife-throwing to a lipsticked yet still grime-laden Annie Oakley type ( Kate Bosworth working her own unfortunate hybrid of yeehaw and sultry) and tussles with a perverted colonel in a burn mask ( Danny Huston all leer sweat and tongue) who regularly terrorizes the locals while Geoffrey Rush regularly terrorizes us with his clichA(c)d town drunk. The real showdown though comes when our heros none-too-happy master makes a third-act appearance with an army of black-clad assassins who swoop ninja-style onto the rooftops like a murder a no make that slaughter a of crows. The aforementioned image is an admittedly nifty only-in-martial-arts-extravaganzas entrance cartoony but kicky and appropriately pregnant with mayhem which Lee then delivers with no lack of R-rated gusto. But for the most part ""Warriors Way"" a an outdoor story shot indoors ""300""-style a is a regrettable example of the cyclical nature of movie special effects. The digitized backdrops and blood sprays physics-defying stuntwork and micro-slo-mo tours of traveling bullets and slashing blades is technically admirable but this menu of action schematics has become as stultifyingly rote as rear-screen projection and stop-motion inevitably were to earlier generations of moviegoers. Whats missing like a hole is a visionary personality a think Stephen Chow or Johnnie To a who can turn comically violent Pop art on its head. Lees hunger to flamboyantly distract with his bag of tricks is never in doubt but ""The Warriors Way"" is a dead end and too often plays like a requiem for showoffs. calendarlatimes.com The Warriors Way MPAA rating R for strong bloody violence Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCapsule movie reviews The Fields and moreApril 20 2012Movie reviews Dont Go in the Woods is an undercooked...February 10 2012The Truth Is Way Out ThereJune 19 1998MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentHybridCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-warriors-way-20101204,0,666958.story",200,thewarrior'sway8,thewarrior'sway,latimes
