I dont know if anyone has mentioned this but its so obvious that Neeson Jansen and the daughter filmed their parts at different times not with each other. In the wife-hostage scene they even put a bag over her head for only one reason they probably did not have a Famke Jansen-like stuntwoman that they could tie up in that manner. The only scene where Neeson and Jansen appear to be together was the final rescue scene. Just look for the over the shoulder shots odd lighting changes shots with just one actor talking to the other off screen. They stitch together some shots where the actors appear to face each other. I wonder if they used two sets or green screen. It looks like they spent 10 million on a movie that grossed 140 million. I hear Taken 3 is in pre-production. Haha. Angelsaid on Saturday October 20 2012 40241 PMSpartacus did get a little better as the season progressed but it still has some serious flaws contrived plot-lines terrible dialogue characters you dont care about etc. As one person put it ""They took the best of Rome and The 300 and then made Spartacus with what was leftover."" At times its almost painful to watch. Ive cringed at how bad some of the dialogue is. And Spartacus constantly acts like a punk-ass which makes it difficult to empathize with him as a character. Jonathan Lemmonsaid on Sunday October 07 2012 83533 PMThe only thing I could think about when I saw the trailer in Dark Knight Rises was that they didnt even bother coming up with an original plot. Its basically the same story as the first movie only they kidnap the mother as well as the daughter. I knew it wasnt going to turn out right and it would just be another ripoff sequel. Ive also been enjoying Liam Neesons carreer lately I loved The Grey and the first Taken was awesome but this just seems like a desperate attempt for money. Hes much better than this They better think twice before making a third movie unless they find a writer who can actually pull the story into multiple films and a director who actually knows how to direct an action movie like Paul Greengrass or Christopher Nolan. And the writer could be someone like David Goyer or Jonathan Nolan. Combined with Liam Neeson kicking terrorist ss ninety ways out of ten that would be a movie worth seeing Devon`said on Sunday October 07 2012 10950 AMTaken 2 took 7.50 from me today. The dialogue was harsh; character development particularly the villain was laughable. The screenplay was below average particularly the ""solution"" that even Wilma from Scooby Doo could not figure out should have never been inserted in the movie. If you like Liam Neeson than see the movie. If you like movies that should have been on Lifetime--no offense watch the movie. StevenHAssesaid on Saturday October 06 2012 112724 PMYou know my girlfriend wanted to see Pitch Perfect and I ended up seeing that instead of Taken 2 and from what I saw of your reviews I think I made the right decision. Pitch Perfect was actually really fun. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Okay I realize the situation is a bit more complex than that. I dont want to wander into the ""people like me"" fallacy Everyone in my parents neighborhood in 1972 voted for George McGovern so he must have won easily right? But I do think its true that in recent years -- and arguably a good deal longer than that -- movies and TV shows about spies have reflected our increasingly bad conscience about the hidden world of Americas global secret police. Thats just as true or almost as true for overtly right-wing products like the odious but addictive ""24"" with its ludicrous litany of ticking-bomb scenarios and torture justifications as it is for bleeding-heart pseudo-sophisticated fare like the ""Bourne"" franchise.Like almost everything else about American politics and culture this goes back to the Cold War. Indeed when Dick Cheney urged us in the days after 9/11 to join him on the Dark Side of the Force - okay he didnt say ""the Force"" but he didnt have to -- he was only reasserting a postwar order that had been temporarily thrown into chaos after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A Manichaean and roughly symmetrical worldview in which your opponent is seen as infinitely evil and infinitely devious is extremely useful if your goal is subverting constitutional governance and replacing it with a permanent hidden shadow-state that stands outside electoral politics. Is that overly paranoid? Well I dont know. But if Id told you a few years ago that we would one day see a Democratic president claim the right to sentence any civilian to death anywhere in the world on secret evidence and with no pretense of judicial process that might have sounded pretty crazy too.Art and culture including popular entertainment is often where a societys doubts about itself can be most freely expressed and from its very beginnings the spy thriller has often presented espionage as at best a morally dubious affair. Even in a prewar classic like Hitchcocks ""The 39 Steps"" while the main characters decency is never in question the sense that the spy bureaucracy is a semi-competent half-sinister organism eager to blame its mistakes on others is a main plot driver. Pretty much every movie about a real or de facto agent on the run whos been framed for some murder or treachery he didnt commit is descended from that one right up to and including ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" ""Salt"" and the Bourne series.Indeed outside of the Bond franchise and its various imitators its not all that easy to come up with spy movies even from the height of the Cold War that present the world of espionage and counterespionage in straightforward or idealistic terms. Certainly John Frankenheimers ""The Manchurian Candidate"" from 1962 is the most effective piece of Red Scare propaganda ever applied to celluloid. But along with its ultra-conspiratorial view of the dastardly Commies - who have not merely brainwashed and trained an assassin but implanted a Joe McCarthy-type anti-Communist politician as a triple-secret agent -- that film paints a scabrous misanthropic and satirical portrait of American society as a zone of nutbars and sheeple barely worth saving from the incoming red tide.A year after that movie was released of course John F. Kennedy was killed and the official explanation involves a weird guy with ties both to the loony left and the loony right whose shadowy history included a visit to the Soviet Union. Ive never felt personally persuaded by the theories that Kennedy was killed by the CIA or by Soviet and/or Cuban intelligence - for one thing they cant both be true unless youre going nuclear with your paranoia - but theyve never gone away. All the unanswered questions surrounding the JFK assassination only strengthened our sense that there was an entire world that lay below the surface of the one we could see and that nothing about it was salutary.All the social division of the 1960s around the Vietnam War and Americas role in the world made the spy thriller seem increasingly problematic and except for the Bond series - which simply ignored all real-life current events - they often sought refuge in the reassuring past of World War II. A virus of existential doubt began to spread through the genre perhaps beginning with Martin Ritts outstanding 1965 adaptation of John le Carres ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold."" Starring Richard Burton in one of his least showboaty screen performances as a burned-out British agent sent into East Germany as a fake defector the film (and the book) are arguably closer in tone to Albert Camus than to Ian Fleming. Even more mundane British spy fare of those years like the trio of Len Deighton adaptations starring Michael Caine (""The Ipcress File"" ""Funeral in Berlin"" and ""Billion Dollar Brain"") drank deep from the same well of exhaustion and cynicism.But the year I really want to talk about is 1975 in the PTSD American aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate when spies and spying were very much in the news. Sen. Frank Church D-Idaho held a series of committee hearings that year that laid bare the extent of questionable or outright illegal conduct by the FBI and CIA ranging from widespread surveillance of both prominent and ordinary citizens to covert attempts to assassinate foreign leaders and overthrow hostile governments. The Church committee was widely demonized by conservatives at the time especially after a CIA station chief was killed in Greece and its work remains controversial in the 21st century. After 9/11 some commentators claiming that these revelations crippled U.S. intelligence gathering over the long term and enabled the creation of al-Qaida. (Funding and arming a bunch of loony-tunes jihadis to kill Russians in Afghanistan had nothing to do with it I guess.) You Might Also Like That year also saw two major spy movies featuring two of Hollywoods biggest stars which established a dichotomy within the genre that endures to this day. On one side we have ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway a fast-paced adaptation of a pulpy bestseller directed with style by Sydney Pollack. If the fashions and mannerisms of the movie - those sideburns - seem positively antique it holds up pretty well overall. Clearly an heir to ""The 39 Steps"" and a direct ancestor of both the Bourne films and Tom Cruises ""Mission Impossible"" series ""Condor"" tells a classic man-on-the-run story as Redfords bookworm character is forced to unpack a world of double-dealing insider warfare and government corruption. When confronted with the argument that the CIA plays dirty because it has to Redfords character turns New York Times whistle-blower.But the antidote for viewers who found ""Condor"" unbearable liberal pantywaist propaganda came in the virile mountaineering-espionage adventure ""The Eiger Sanction"" starring Clint Eastwood and his impressive mid-70s hairdo as a retired CIA assassin turned art professor (yes really) turned frequently shirtless freelance patriot. There are a lot of superficial similarities between the two films including the general atmosphere of government coverup and post-Vietnam blowback but the preening machismo of ""Eiger"" is pretty hard to take as is the obvious pandering to Eastwoods ""Dirty Harry"" fan base. It was Clints first big Hollywood production as an actor-director and seemed aimed at building a franchise around his character a lady-killing wisecracking Yank cognate to James Bond. But while ""Condor"" was a pretty big hit ""Eiger"" was middling at best and Eastwood dropped not just the franchise idea but the spy genre period. I would be the first to agree that audiences go see spy movies for the thrills and the action scenes not the politics and on that level too ""Taken 2"" (which was directed by Luc Besson flunky Olivier Megaton and no thats not his original last name) is incoherent relying on a boom-boom-chaka-boom musical score and repeated shots of random structures in Istanbul being destroyed by men in fast cars. A crucial plot element in ""Taken 2"" involves an American teenage girl roaming around the city chucking out live grenades to mark her progress rather like Hansel and Gretel with exploding breadcrumbs. As Neesons defrocked CIA assassin Bryan Mills might say in his overly flat Amurkin accent its Istanbul Kim -- stuff gets blown up every goddamn day. Indeed the citys only inhabitants appear to be scary Albanian sex traffickers and their henchmen ominous-looking Muslim women in full-face hijab and weird old blind guys playing the oud. Everybodys too busy being threatening to go work in a bank or buy eggs at the supermarket.Context matters and the context for ""Taken 2"" (a sequel to the 2008 hit in which the same Albanians kidnapped the same teenager that time in Paris) is a xenophobic ugly-American worldview inherited from ""The Eiger Sanction"" and still more from James Camerons ""True Lies"" pretty much the balls-out gold standard for this kind of dumbed-down pseudo-flag-waving thriller. I say ""pseudo"" because producer Besson and director Megaton (who also made the ludicrous drug-war thriller ""Colombiana"" a movie even stupider than this one but 20 times more enjoyable) are a couple of French dudes for Christs sake and exactly the kind of French dudes whose exaggerated love for the very worst kinds of American movies has caused them to stick their heads deeply up their own butts.Stand aside now because Im droppin the bomb on Mr. Megaton Luc Besson is officially being ""Taken 2"" the woodshed If these guys believe in anything about this movie they believe in it entirely as gesture mannerism and style. They may or may not be smart enough that theyre cackling up their sleeves the whole time; its not impossible that ""Taken 2"" is a meta-American movie a Godardian spoof of the whole genre an attempt to see how stupid and insulting a motion picture can be and still be a big hit. (See also ""True Lies."") They believe that removing the guilt from the spectacle of an implacable American with high-end hardware killing every funny-accent facial-hair-wearing foreign mofo in sight will pay off.

"Taken 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; taken-2 ) Taken 2 (France 2012) October 06 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The original Taken released in the United States in early 2009 was never intended to be anything more than a January throw-away. 145 million later Fox had a different opinion of the French-made film whose U.S. opening occurred months after it had bowed in Europe. Taken 2 one of those sequels that exists purely because its predecessor made money received A-list treatment. Pretty much everyone returned with enhanced pay checks. The one exception director Pierre Morel was replaced by Olivier Megaton who like Morel has a long-term relationship with producer/co-writer Luc Besson (the French Jerry Bruckheimer). Taken 2 was given a more prestigious October release date and North American viewers were not left waiting around for months to experience Liam Neesons latest adventures in ass kicking. Taken 2 is more of the same except a little bigger a little dumber and a little less invigorating. If Neeson seemed to be going through the motions in Taken thats doubly the case here where its apparent from body language and facial expressions that hed rather be anywhere else. But hey he could always be sitting behind a desk instead of getting a free vacation to Turkey. Neesons recent resume reminds me of Gene Hackmans in the 80s and 90s when he accepted nearly every role presented to him. Although Hackman is rightly remembered as a good actor he appeared in a lot of schlock. But because bad movies often pay well for the participation of respected talent he reaped the benefits and has been able to enjoy a long and comfortable retirement. Neesons trajectory appears similar and when his career is over Taken 2 will be nothing more than a footnote. The action in Taken 2 isnt exactly James Bond or Jason Bourne intense. Even Dr. No was more extreme. This offers little more than a guy running around shooting people with the occasional fist fight or car chase thrown in for variety. Standard stuff thats executed competently but with little flair. The first Taken was more energetic; this one seems obligatory in every detail. The villain is second-rate and too old for the final confrontation to be physical. Previously we had a detestable bad guy who made his fortune kidnapping girls and selling them as sex slaves. Now its his father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) whos out for revenge. His opportunity comes when ex-CIA super agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) is on vacation in Istanbul with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace who just turned 29). Krasniqis thugs chase and capture Bryan and Lenore while hunting Kim. Theres a little PG-13 torture before Bryan turns the tables on his kidnappers and starts whittling down Krasniqis seemingly endless army of henchmen. Neesons expression never wavers. Maybe hes calculating how many more Takens hell have to make before being able to follow Hackman into a life of leisure. Those looking for new or original material can give this movie a pass (not that anything along those lines should have been expected in the first place) although it is the first film I can recall that has a car chase featuring a back-seat driver. ""Go back"" ""Go forward"" ""Left"" ""Right"" ""Stop"" ""Faster"" Its pretty funny actually. You have to feel sorry for Kim who despite having failed her drivers test is being forced to speed through the winding streets of Istanbul as her father leans out the window and takes shots at a pursuing vehicle while issuing terse driving instructions. Its unclear whether this humor is intentional but its there. Those who enjoyed the first Taken will probably not be greatly disappointed by this one although it would be cheaper and more satisfying to stay home and re-watch the 2008 feature rather than paying money for a ticket to what amounts to a re-hash. Too many sequels are like this existing for no reason beyond their potential to fatten the coffers of everyone on the movie gravy train. Its easy to be cynical about them; what they offer is basic and creatively dead. Audiences appreciate them because theyre familiar and demand little in the way of attentiveness. One can send a few text messages surf the web a little visit the concession stand and not miss a damn thing. Luc Besson has often stated that his goal is to make European films that look and feel like Hollywood ones. When it comes to soulless derivative sequels he has achieved his aim. Taken 2 is Exhibit A.

"Taken 2 reviewed Liam Neeson returns as an Albanian-bashing superdad. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dana Stevens to Taken Producer Luc Besson I Have a Particular Set of Skills ... Dana Stevens to Taken Producer Luc Besson I Have a Particular Set of Skills ... Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 5 2012 625 PM Taken 2 I wasnt too taken with it. By Dana Stevens Liam Neeson is back for another round with the Albanians that kidnapped his daughter in the original Taken Still from Taken 2 by Magali Bragard/(c) 2012 Europacorp M6 Films/Grive Productions. All rights reserved. Liam Neesons over-the-phone speech to the Albanian sex traffickers who kidnapped his characters daughter in Taken (2008) has enjoyed a deservedly long pop-culture afterlife. Go up to an action movie-loving friend and growl in a steely voice ""I dont know who you are. I dont know what you want."" If that person knows whats good for him hell pick up the thread ""If youre looking for ransom I can tell you I dont have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills..."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. What made that speech so satisfying was how perfectly it exemplified the movies get-it-done ethos Like Neesons character ex-CIA-black-ops specialist Bryan Mills Taken had a matter-of-fact conviction about its own ruthless efficacy. It was nothing more nor less than a quick-and-dirty thriller about a former badass who comes out of retirement to wreak holy terror on some very scuzzy Albanians thereby proving himself--years of neglect be damned--the best dad ever. Usually action heroes tend to function as proxies for the viewer. Were meant to imagine ourselves in their place punching out Alan Rickman and rescuing Gwyneth Paltrow (or if I might conjure up an even better movie the reverse). But Taken didnt make you want to be Liam Neeson exactly--it made you want to be his daughter. (Or maybe his son There must have been male viewers also drawn in by the primal daddy fantasies that Taken tapped into.) The notion of an uber-competent unstoppably brave impossibly calm superdad who will find and protect you at all costs--and then when he finally flings open the sex-dungeon door and lifts you out its Liam Neeson--well thats powerful stuff. Advertisement Which is why Taken 2 I Cant Believe I Got Retaken (OK I made up the last part inspired by this HuffPo list of alternate titles for this boringly named movie) was such a wan disappointment. Im not asking for Chekhov here; I know any sequel to a successful action movie is going to ramp up the exploitation factor. But Taken 2 (co-written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by the providentially named Olivier Megaton) is so lazily put together that it relies on flashbacks from its predecessor for the majority of its character development. Remember that guy who would stop at nothing to get his daughter? Yeah its him again. Three years after that unpleasantness with the Albanians Bryan Mills is in Istanbul where hes just finished working a three-day private security gig for a billionaire. On a whim his college-aged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and newly single ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) decide to join him for a holiday--unaware that the families of the men Bryan killed three years ago have staked out their hotel and marked them for death. But in a reversal of the original plot this time its the parents who are captured by the thugs and its the daughter who must save them--guided by terse over-the-phone instructions from her micromanaging dad (""Go to my armament case ... get out a map and a grenade""). Cue a long string of indistinguishable choppily edited fistfights and chases through the back streets of Istanbul. (Those who enjoy traveling via theater seat will be disappointed Rather than giving us a Bourne-style tour of the citys intimate topography the camera just keeps returning to the same aerial establishing shot of the Hagia Sophia church.) Neesons victory is so foreordained his opponents so interchangeable--only one of them ringleader Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) gets any dialogue or back story at all--that the fight scenes start to feel detached from the main action like interpolated outtakes from a mediocre martial arts movie. And I understand that at 60 years old Neeson isnt doing all his own stunts but director Megaton could mask that fact a little more subtly--the alacrity with which he cuts away to a long shot the moment Neeson raises his fists becomes almost comical. The extent to which Taken 2 might be intentionally comical is open to debate. There are fleeting moments in which creators seem to grasp that the success of the original came in part from the then-unexpected casting of the middle-aged gentle-faced Neeson as a fearsome action star (a type of role he has now definitively embraced in movies like Unknown and The Grey). Intended or no there are some good laughs in this films climactic car chase as Bryan riding in the passenger seat sweet-talks his not-yet-licensed daughter into some very poor driving decisions. (As theyre about to cross the railroad tracks just yards in front of a speeding train he murmurs paternal encouragement ""You can do it"") Less amusing is the movies vague but pervasive xenophobia. Though the Albanians embrace of crude tribal vengeance is never explicitly linked to their Muslim faith the bad guys pretty much come off as an indeterminate horde of swarthy evildoers. Not that the innocent Turkish bystanders have it easy either. At one point Bryan encourages his daughter to run along the rooftops of the city chucking down grenades so he can listen for the explosions and figure out how far she is from the basement where hes being kept. Unintended casualties my eye--there are Americans in peril I dont know who Taken producer Luc Besson is or what he wants but it so happens that I and many other fans of the original Taken come equipped with a particular set of skills--skills weve acquired over a lifetime of discerning between good and bad action movies skills that make us a nightmare for people like him. If he stops churning out Taken sequels now that will be the end of it. We will not look for him we will not pursue him. But if he comes out with Taken 3 we will look for him we will find him and we will kill him. Or at least kill his movie at the box office.

Four years after Foxs low-budget ""Taken"" grabbed a surprise 225 million worldwide catapulting thesp Liam Neeson to unlikely action-star status producer-scribe Luc Besson chases another payday with ""Taken 2"" equaling the original in enjoyable silliness if not brutal nastiness. Shifting the action from Paris to Istanbul ""Taken 2"" promotes Maggie Graces serially unlucky teen from distressed damsel to plucky participant and also develops Famke Janssens ex-wife role decisions that could help broaden the pics appeal beyond action fans. Political correctness only extends so far however Depiction of Albanian heavies wont promote Besson as an apt candidate for U.N. goodwill ambassador. Two years after the events of ""Taken"" retired CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) hasnt lost any of his overprotective impulses toward his now 19-year-old daughter Kim (Grace) When she fails to show up for her driving lesson he tracks her down to her new b.f.s house via the GPS device he secretly planted in her cell phone. Meanwhile with relations between the divorced parents on the thaw Bryan invites former spouse Lenore (Janssen) and his daughter to join him in Istanbul for a holiday tagged to the end of his latest bodyguard assignment. Unluckily for them Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) still consumed with bitter rage over the death of his sex-trafficker son at Mills hands in the first pic seizes a chance for revenge. A last-minute change in the familys sightseeing plans helps Kim escape the kidnapping that befalls her parents and with the clock rapidly ticking she becomes their best and only chance of rescue. The pics enjoyably ludicrous highlight sees Kim armed with a city map shoelace marking pen and several hand grenades quickly locating and arming her father who barks orders at her from a tiny device he had concealed on his body for just such an eventuality. The success of this elaborate father-daughter communication and the events that follow hinges on some of the most lackadaisical hostage-guarding in the history of criminal endeavor; given Mills proven efficacy at wiping out adversaries it might have been advisable to have kept a significantly keener eye on their captive. The first round of action climaxes with a high-speed getaway in a stolen vehicle with inexperienced Kim fumbling at the wheel as bullets rain down. As Drivers Ed goes its what you might call a baptism by fire. Helmer Olivier Megaton (""Colombiana"") proves an efficient substitute for ""Taken"" helmer Pierre Morel without exactly offering a personal stamp rendering this just another product in the Besson hit factory. Photogenic locations including the Suleymaniye Mosque the Grand Bazaar and the Bosphorus are agreeably captured by d.p. Romain Lacourbas (also ""Colombiana"") nicely exploiting Istanbuls special quality of light. The shift to this more exotic locale requires considerable exposition however including the news that the city straddles Europe and Asia prompting a wide-eyed Kim to ask her father incredulously ""How do you know this stuff?"" Plenty of the dialogue co-scripted once again with regular Besson collaborator Robert Mark Kamen falls into the so-bad-its-good category and audience derision is presumably all part of the envisaged fun. Action is notably softer throughout sidestepping the certification issues that challenged the original film (""Taken"" required cuts to achieve a PG-13 in the U.S. and went out on a 15 certificate in Blightys cinemas and 18 on DVD). Gorehounds have already been disappointed to learn the British censor passed this less severe sequel as a 12A for ""moderate threat and violence."" Neeson despite having turned 60 in June looks spritely enough in the role and more than capable of another go-round should ""Taken 2"" match its predecessors success. Whether audiences would believe that Bryan Lenore or Kim could be kidnapped yet again is another matter.

Kim (Maggie Grace) tries to elude killers with her fathers help in ""Taken 2."" Photo Magali Bragard Twentieth Century Fox Taken 2 review Dad gets mad - again 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Taken 2 Action. Starring Liam Neeson Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace. Directed by Olivier Megaton. (PG-13. 91 minutes.) In ""Taken 2"" poor Liam Neeson doesnt ask for much out of life just a chance to worry over his teenage daughter like an old fusspot and maybe get back with his ex-wife. He wants to talk about basketball with his buddies and put his violent past as a lethal CIA operative behind him. But the bad guys wont leave him be. They keep showing up and forcing him to kill them. ""Taken 2"" is the sequel to ""Taken"" the utterly irresistible 2009 thriller that introduced Neeson as an action star in the Harrison Ford vein that of the fellow whos seemingly normal and reasonable - just dont get him mad. In the original Albanian slave traffickers abducted his daughter (big mistake). In the sequel the Albanians are grieving over their dead - lots and lots of dead - and decide that its payback time. Indeed they decide to take their revenge about two lines into the screenplay which is just the first example of why ""Taken 2"" is like a textbook on how to make beautiful successful and highly satisfying junk-food cinema. When its just a plot point the information gets tossed out as fast and as forcefully as possible. Time is lavished only on the things that matter. And in ""Taken 2"" the things that matter have all to do with character. If you see the movie this is something worth noticing As much as this picture is action driven - virtually conceived as a series of interlocking escalating sequences - its greatest delights are grounded in personality in the fun of having a protagonist who combines homespun values with velociraptor functionality. The movie commits to the character of Bryan Mills just as Neeson does unflinchingly with no compromise irony or winking at the audience. To give one example of how effective this can be take the scene in which Neeson chained up down in some hellish basement by the traffickers sneaks out a call to his teenage daughter. He instructs her to go into his suitcase take out two hand grenades and a gun and go to the roof to await a second phone call. For good measure he instructs her to ""Be casual."" This moment is grandly pleasing in a number of ways (1) In its sheer audacity as a plot turn; (2) In its insane and yet complete believability in terms of the Mills character - both in that hed give his daughter these instructions and that hed happen to have hand grenades in his suitcase; and (3) In the way it makes us anticipate more. What does he want her to do with those hand grenades anyway? It all starts as just a little vacation in Istanbul which looks stunning. Mills is pleased because his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) seems to be coming back around to him and their daughter (Maggie Grace) is there too. Theyre family again and all is well until he notices that their car is being followed. Never one unwilling to deny reality he snaps into survival mode - and he stays there angry and focused as well as irritated that these people keep forcing him to extremes. ""Taken 2"" is not about subtlety. At one point a fatherly looking man (Rade Serbedzija) tells Mills that he plans to sell Mills daughter back into slavery and that ""she will be abused by so many men that shell be nothing more than a piece of meat a dog would not have."" OK so thats the bad guy. Got it. Fortunately a good action film doesnt need subtlety but clean lines sure definitions big emotions and ideally economy. ""Taken 2"" has all these things. It also has the most genuinely nerve-racking car chase Ive seen in years. Yes for the record ""Taken"" was fresher and therefore better but not by a lot. As sequels go ""Taken 2"" is more than respectable and so enjoyable Id happily sit down right now and watch ""Taken 3"" if it existed. Someday it probably will.

Reprising his role as a former CIA operative who now runs his own private security firm Neeson is once again the stalwart center of this giddy entirely improbable and improbably enjoyable escapade in which he is abducted along with daughter (Maggie Grace) - again - and his ex-wife (Famke Janssen).It seems that the Albanian overlord (Rade Serbedzija) whose sex-trafficker son Neeson killed in ""Taken"" is out for big-time revenge. Accompanied by a cadre of goony thuggish Albanians (Albania should sue the filmmakers) he makes life miserable for the Neeson household assembled in Istanbul until dad does what he does best - punching maiming garroting etc. The director of this jamboree is appropriately named Olivier Megaton.

Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen Rade Serbedzija Leland Orser Luke Grimes Laura Bryce Aclan Bates Director Oliver Megaton Running time 131 Release Opened Oct 5 2012  Editorial Review Too-tidy sequel cant be savedBy Ann HornadayFriday October 5 2012""Taken"" about a former CIA operative who uses his considerable brawn and brain to rescue his teenage daughter from a bunch of sadistic sex-trade traffickers was a surprise hit in 2009. The nervy kid-in-jeopardy thriller opened quietly at the beginning of the year chugging along to make a respectable 100 million-plus at the box office. The appeal of ""Taken"" apart from its straightforward unpretentious approach to otherwise pedestrian material was Liam Neeson. As ""Taken"" protagonist Bryan Mills he infused an otherwise by-the-numbers procedural with an ineffable highly appealing blend of Celtic soul and 6-foot-4-inch heft. As an instantly sympathetic embodiment of paternal reassurance and alpha-male ferocity Neeson reinvigorated his career with ""Taken"" embarking on a series of similarly pulpy thrillers (""Unknown"" ""The Grey"") that seemed to surprise even him. You cant blame Neeson or the ""Taken"" producers for trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. What you can blame them for is ""Taken 2"" a sequel every bit as clumsy ham-handed outlandish and laughable as the original was sleek tough and efficient. ""Taken 2"" finds Bryan back in Los Angeles teaching his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace now officially past her sell-by date playing teenagers) to drive and gazing wistfully at his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) when he picks Kim up for their weekly Saturday tutorial. When Bryan travels to Istanbul on business circumstances conspire to bring Kim and Leni there in order to surprise him; soon all three are caught up in a nasty web of kidnapping sadistic torture and revenge spun by the very Albanian bad guys Bryan recently vanquished on behalf of his daughter. Its a perfectly acceptable setup but from its first set piece -- a low-octane chase through an Istanbul bazaar followed by a weirdly muffled awkwardly choreographed fist fight -- ""Taken 2"" possesses the perfunctory mark-hitting of a movie more invested in going through the motions than raising its own bar. The spook-tested tricks and superhuman powers of observation that Bryan trotted out in the first film are now played for maximum preposterousness such as an utterly laughable gambit involving hand grenades and eastward-blowing flags or a life-saving feat of deduction accomplished with a map a Sharpie pen and a shoelace. Bryan is still the man with all the answers the modern eras dream of competence and moral clarity rolled into one hunky package. But in the clunky hands of ""Taken 2"" director Olivier Megaton (working from a phoned-in script by producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen) hes become little more than a know-it-all who dispatches every obstacle as if hed anticipated it all along. Theres no crafty fun to be had watching him figuring it all out. By the time ""Taken 2"" stages a second ludicrously conceived car chase which leads to an equally absurd tableau of macho posturing in a Turkish bath the entire enterprise feels as false and tidy as the tasteful drop of blood that adorns Bryans chin. When Neeson visited ""The Daily Show"" earlier this week Jon Stewart eagerly asked if a ""Taken 3"" was in the works. The actor visibly recoiled his hand slashing his throat in a ""thats enough"" gesture suggesting that the star is painfully aware that sometimes lightning should stay in the bottle.Contains intense sequences of violence and action and some sensuality.

In the surprise 2009 box-office smash ""Taken Liam Neeson played a retired CIA operative who rescues his teenage daughter from Albanian white slavers and then goes all Mel Gibson on the culprits. In the inevitable -- if far less exciting and vastly sillier -- sequel Neeson quickly loses the daughter (Maggie Grace clearly pushing 30 in real life) again on a trip to Istanbul where life is cheap and the movie production subsidies are generous. A bunch of Albanians (led by Rade Serbedzija) want revenge on Neeson for killing and torturing their relatives in the first film. At various points they also kidnap Neeson and Neesons estranged wife (Famke Janssen whose double spends most of the movie with a sack on her head). But these truly inept killers never manage to hold onto the entire clan at the same time. In the interest of advancing the plot the idiotic bad guys conveniently ignore barking dogs and other warning signs that Neeson or the daughter are approaching as well as the miniature cellphone Neeson uses to repeatedly communicate with the daughter while in captivity. ""Act casually he advises her in a truly hilarious sequence -- sending the young woman out to toss grenades off Turkish rooftops so he can use the sound of the explosions to help direct her to where hes being held. There are other indications that screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen (""The Karate Kid) and Luc Besson (who also produced this one) didnt necessarily want the audience to take ""Taken 2 as seriously as say ""Taken. Like when the daughter -- who has failed her driving test back in California twice -- takes the wheel in a high-speed chase through narrow twisting streets to elude the killers while dad is directing her to ignore scurrying pedestrians. This sort of approach has diminishing returns in an alleged thriller There doesnt seem to be a whole lot at stake in a movie where you can crash your way through the armed barricades at the American embassy with a stolen taxicab and survive without a scratch. Four years ago there was novelty value in seeing an actor with Neesons gravitas turning mad action hero. But Neesons done it several times since with diminishing returns in other paycheck jobs. Olivier Megaton the wonderfully named Besson protege who directed stages action sequences clumsily and edits them so frantically it looks like the whole movie was run through a Cuisinart. When Neeson engages in bare-knuckle fisticuffs at the climax of the cartoonish ""Taken 2 I honestly couldnt figure out if the 60-year-old actor was actually present at all except for the close-ups.

Photo Credit Magali Bragard advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Former CIA agent Bryan Mills must once again save his family from harm. BOTTOM LINE A wimpy follow-up to the hard-hitting original CAST Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen LENGTH 131 In 2008 Liam Neeson left behind serious roles like Oskar Schindler and Alfred Kinsey to star in the action-cheapie ""Taken"" about a former CIA agent searching for his kidnapped daughter. It was an unlikely career move but Neesons hulking 6-foot-4 frame made him a brutally effective action hero and his steely line about possessing ""a very particular set of skills"" became an almost Schwarzenegger-caliber quip. A rougher-than-usual genre film ""Taken"" turned into a 145 million hit. In ""Taken 2"" Neeson returns as Bryan Mills as does Famke Janssen as his ex-wife Lenore and Maggie Grace as their daughter Kim. This time theyre in Istanbul being hunted by vengeful relatives of the Albanian thugs that Bryan so ruthlessly dispatched. ""He slaughtered our men our brothers"" fumes the patriarchal Murad (Rade Serbedzija of Angelina Jolies Bosnian War drama ""In The Land of Blood and Honey""). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Its a serviceable setup but returning writers Robert Mark Kamen and producer Luc Besson cant conjure up the no-nonsense thrills of the original. ""Taken 2"" is nearly all nonsense with villains so inept and slow-moving that theres little satisfaction in watching Mills take them out. The Albanians rig their victims for a slow death then conveniently leave them unattended (have they never seen an episode of ""Batman""?) and they sure take their sweet time responding to any threat. With a pistol in his face Mills calmly produces a cellphone and holds a five-minute conversation before anyone thinks to stop him. Replacing director Pierre Morel is Olivier Megaton (Bessons subpar ""Colombiana"") who favors cartoon car chases over grim combat thereby robbing Neeson of his menacing physicality. Theres nothing close to the originals hilariously shocking moment when Mills calmly shoots a woman at her kitchen table. Even Neeson seems tired of it all. You can tell because near the films end he sighs ""I am tired of it all."" PLOT Former CIA agent Bryan Mills must once again save his family from harm.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 05 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 04 2012 236PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Olivier Megaton Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen Starring Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace Classification 14A Genre action Year 2012 Country USA Language English If nothing else no one is likely to get took by Taken which neither pretends nor aspires to be anything more than what it is. To wit? Well in the cultural flatlands of diminished expectations this is moviemaking as a utilitarian low-rise - just a mediocre action franchise with a solid actor at the head and a travelogue in its heart. Last time out Paris was the destination where Liam Neeson - a kind of geriatric Bourne pensioned off by the CIA but with his ""particular set of skills"" duly activated - killed multiple baddies and slayed every last shred of logic to rescue his kidnapped daughter. Now its on to Istanbul. Different city same skill set identical premise - just add his ex-wife to the ranks of the imperilled. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Taken 2"" Movies Taken 2 The official trailer video Video Liam Neeson packs a punch in ""Taken 2"" Evidence for the slimness of the script (stamped out at the Luc Besson factory) can be found in the extended stall of the preface. Trading in the customary opening bangs for a prolonged whimper the thing marks time for a full 20 minutes States-side. There former spouse Lenore (Famke Janssen) shines back up to her former hubby while their offspring Kim (Maggie Grace) flunks her driving test and much to Daddys dismay canoodles with her new boyfriend. My without a bullet yet fired the domestic excitement is killing us.Finally the reconstituted clan heads off to Turkey for some sightseeing. And this too Seated with his daughter on a Bosphorus ferry pere Liam reaches deep into his bag of skills and pulls out the one marked Geography ""On this side is Europe and on that side is Asia."" Enthuses Kim without a hint of irony ""How do you know all this stuff?"" Fathers everywhere labouring under the illusion that its tough to impress an omniscient teenager can take hope.Lesson over peril arrives in the form of a less learned patriarch named Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) whose son figured among those multiple baddies bumped off in Take One. Out for vengeance Murad is quick to corral both Lenore and Liam shackling them in the usual dank basement where aged pipes leak onto mouldy concrete. Luckily in the Mexican standoff that preceded their capture with every drawn gun pointed at every drawn face Liam takes multitasking to impressive heights coolly deploying his free hand to make a cellphone call to warn off Kim. His next call proves more instructive Suddenly his darling little girl is racing across tiled rooftops lobbing grenades every which way and generally making it crystal clear that the CIA apple doesnt fall far from the CIA tree.Later with one parent liberated but Mom still in distress its time to retake that driving test - in a purloined car with a stick shift double-clutching like Ayrton Senna roaring through the citys labyrinthine alleys as Liam rides shotgun with his shotgun. Again fathers should take note. When engaged in a high-speed chase with men of homicidal persuasion etiquette demands that Daughter drives while Daddy shoots. Sticking with matters of etiquette Murad has the extremely poor taste to suggest to a cornered Liam ""Dont play the hero with me"" thereby threatening the livelihood of hard-working stars in every low-rent franchise. Tacky indeed.More worrisome that other solid thespian Istanbul is woefully underemployed here. Director Olivier Megaton (a nom de cinema be assured) makes scant use of its abundant charms settling instead for the standard typecasting - swarthy men veiled women narrow streets domed mosques. Such a waste of a major cosmopolitan talent.As for the climax it comes with a generous offer to end the cycle of violence - or as this concept is known in Hollywood sequels. Such heresy the suspense mounts and the future of the franchise hangs in the balance. What will it bring Taken 3 or Mistaken?

"Taken 2 the cleaners hilariously review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTaken 2 the cleaners hilariously reviewTheres no need to wait for the MAD magazine parody of Taken 2. Its already hilariously up there on the screen.Liam Neeson is back in fine head-snapping form in Taken 2.  (Magali Bragard / 20th Century Fox)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 4 2012Taken 2 (out of 4)Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen and Rade Sherbedgia. Directed by Olivier Megaton. 92 minutes. Opens Oct. 5 at major theatres. 14ATheres no need to wait for the MAD magazine parody of Taken 2.Its already hilariously up there on the screen. The first thing to be kidnapped is logic as the action moves to Istanbul from Paris and Liam Neeson ridiculously reprises his role of avenging ex-CIA dad Bryan Mills. Article Continued BelowThe vein-popping Mills has turned into a human GPS unit but hes now more cartoon than man. He tracks leads that would leave an ace bloodhound scratching its fleas and busts moves and baddies in ways more appropriate to a Scooby-Doo episode. He does this despite the fact hes the one who gets kidnapped this time along with his lovely ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Amazing what a man can accomplish while manacled to a metal pipe. People will call this a quick-buck sequel to Taken the surprise hit of 2009 and these people are absolutely correct. Unsubtle producer/writer Luc Besson knows this. So does his regular co-writer Robert Mark Kamen and their hired-gun director Olivier Megaton (Colombiana). They dont give a rats derriere about it as long as the cash register still goes ka-ching which it likely will. The irony is that the original Taken was supposed to be the cash grab. It was intended for DVD-only in North America after a desultory European theatrical debut. It had already leaked to the Internet months before it arrived on these shores almost by accident.But Taken added up to something more than the sum of its parts -- and those parts include 225 million in worldwide box office on an investment of 25 million. Neeson surprised a lot of people with his action chops and the story engaged on a primal level a man using his formidable spy skills to rescue his teenage daughter who had been kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers while visiting Paris.At 60 Neeson still has heroic form and also the serious actors discipline to keep a straight face while negotiating a ludicrous script that spent more time on a photocopier than in a word processor. His Bryan Mills thought he was done with Albanian sex enslaver Murad (Rade Sherbedgia agreeably evil) since hed left so many of Murads stooges in body bags after their last encounter. He didnt count on Murad wanting revenge since one of those stooges was his son. When events conspire to bring Mills Lenore and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) to Istanbul on an impromptu family holiday Murad hatches a payback plan to kidnap and torture all three. You know hes serious because he weirdly spends his days in a trashed hotel room with a ruined piano. He possesses a seemingly inexhaustible supply of swarthy thugs all lining up to get shot or head-snapped by Mills. (Murad also seems to have an endless supply of sons -- hello Taken 3)Some estrogen is added to the testosterone overkill. Kim becomes action girl by proxy following her daddyos barked instructions as she evades pursuers hurls grenades and drives a stolen taxi like a cabbie on crack -- and to think she doesnt even have a drivers licence yet""Do you know how to shoot? Then drive"" dad says when she reminds him of her unlicensed status.Lenore isnt so lucky spending much of the picture unconscious and getting inexplicably left behind on more than one occasion by the task-minded Mills. But she is fully alert in one of the films most MAD-ready scenes one where Mills gives her impossibly complicated instructions on how to evade their impending capture.And how can you not smile at the baldly stereotyped Murad? Sherbedgias greatest exertion must have been resisting the urge to twirl his mustache. When an enraged Murad asks Mills why he killed his son and Mills replies that the son kidnapped and abused Kim and dozens of other girls Murads response roughly translates as ""Details details""And dont let those details keep you from enjoying this so-bad-its-good experience which is funnier than most comedies. If you go to the theatre with this in mind youll avoid disappointment -- and you wont feel taken too.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Dont mess with Liam Neeson in Taken 2 Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Dont mess with Liam Neeson in Taken 2Neeson treads familiar ground in this action tale of a family being menaced by out-for-blood Albanians. Its greatly helped along by Neesons acting skills.October 04 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Liam Neeson returns to the role of an ex-CIA operative with ""a set of... (Magali Bragard / 20th Century...)The original ""Taken"" may have earned an impressive 224 million-plus in worldwide box office receipts but it apparently went unseen in one remote corner of Albania. That would be the home base of a group of men who not knowing any better feel compelled to menace Bryan Mills and his family one more time in ""Taken 2."" Talk about slow learners.Led by taciturn Murad (grizzled veteran Rade Sherbedgia) these men are the blood relatives of the folks master of mayhem Bryan killed back in the day while rescuing his daughter Kim from the clutches of nefarious white slavers in Paris. ""We will not rest until his blood flows into this ground"" Murad says helpfully speaking English at a picturesque Albanian cemetery. ""We will have our revenge."" Good luck with that guys.Because ex-CIA operative Bryan played once again by Liam Neeson is a virtuoso of violence who embraces murderous moves the way politicians take to verbal evasiveness. Bullets cant seem to find him knives miss their marks martial artists flail away in vain. When Bryan says hes going to do ""what I do best"" its not macramA(c) hes talking about.PHOTOS Liam Neesons career in picturesAt a beefy 6-foot-4 Neeson certainly looks physically imposing but it was the notion of casting someone who can actually act in an action hero role that was the counter-intuitive concept that made both films a ""Taken 2"" is more a remake than a sequel a so successful.Neesons empathetic performing skills put him in a different category than the usual suspects for this kind of a part. His acting makes him seem human and even vulnerable someone we cant help but worry over even though its those feckless Albanians we should be nervous about.Rather than take Bryan into new territory say rescuing a film critic trapped in a claustrophobic screening Luc Besson as producer and cowriter (with Robert Mark Kamen) the guiding spirit of the enterprise has wisely opted to pretty much tell the same story all over again.PHOTOS Liam Neesons career in picturesThe endangered parties have been expanded to include Bryans ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) as well as the by-now older and wiser daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) but self-named director Oliver Megaton has clearly been told not to stray too far from the well-trodden path of the original.So after Murads dirge-like threat we move briefly to Los Angeles where Bryan is revealed to be as obsessive as ever. When he gets his car washed hes fussy enough about the results to do the final drying himself and when he says hell pick Kim up at 2 p.m. for a driving lesson (shes failed the test twice) he shows at exactly the appointed time.Kim however is dallying with her new boyfriend and has blown off the whole lesson thing. Dad ever resourceful stealthily tracks her down and delivers a lecture about how ""when you make plans you keep them."" Some things never change.What has changed is that ex-wife Lenores new marriage does not seem to be working out. When mother and daughter find their long-planned girls getaway overseas has been canceled Bryan in a moment of expansiveness he will soon regret invites them to join him in picturesque Istanbul where he has a job guarding some fabulously wealthy sheik.Murad who turns out to be as well-sourced as Bob Woodward finds out about the trip immediately and before you can say ""blood oath"" a trio of sizable vans packed with swarthy guys who have not smiled since glasnost is headed to Istanbul with vengeance on their minds.Murads minions would like to quietly kidnap all members of the Mills family but Bryan the worlds most aware human being soon gets wise to their game. He tries to evade the evildoers as poor Lenore who likely did see the first movie wails ""I cant believe this is happening."" Believe it Lenore it is going down again.Bryan is initially no match for this Balkan horde even though his hyper-aware mind can literally memorize entire automobile routes despite being blindfolded. But Bryan has a secret weapon his adversaries dont suspect his daughter Kim.Yes he has to give Kim a classic ""I need you to calm down and listen very carefully"" telephone pep talk but once Kim gets a grip she is able to help her dad do what he does best. (Hint not macramA(c).) Kim also has those failures at the DMV notwithstanding an unlooked-for gift for driving an escape vehicle like a bat out of hell helped by a little browbeating from her ever-obsessive dad.---Taken 2MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and some sensualityRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments Latest movie reviews PHOTOS NC-17 movies Why they got the rating MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTaken 2 breaks necks not new ground critics sayOctober 5 2012Mondays Talk Shows Caroline Kennedy; Liam Neeson; Donald...September 30 2012Tuesdays TV talk showsJanuary 17 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowAlbaniansKimNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-taken-2-review-20121005,0,7729704.story",200,taken214,taken2,latimes

Credit Magali Bragard/20th Century Fox Opens on Friday nationwide.Directed by Olivier Megaton1 hour 31 minutesYoud think that after what happened in the 2009 film ""Taken"" Bryan Lenore and Kim would think twice about vacationing outside the continental United States. But in ""Taken 2"" they go abroad for some family bonding and -- wouldnt you know it? -- kidnappings again ensue followed by killings.In the first movie Kim (Maggie Grace) was abducted by Albanian sex traffickers. This time relatives of those traffickers want vengeance for those killed during the one-man rescue conducted by her father Bryan (Liam Neeson) a former C.I.A. operative. And their targets are Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) Kims mother.The family makes it easy for the villains by taking an impromptu trip to Istanbul where Bryan and Lenore are promptly snatched. (Albanian crime lords have a long reach and many connections in passport offices and such.) It falls to Kim to initiate their rescue. Doing so requires her to among other things set off hand grenades in the middle of the city something that causes surprisingly little concern among the populace.What follows seems like a nonstop car and foot chase with Albanian after Albanian falling victim to Bryans remarkable aim and hand-fighting skills. Foreigners bad Americans good box office busy.""Taken 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for many dead Albanians.

The inevitable - and unfortunate - sequel to 2008s surprise action hit starring Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA guy who must use all his wiles and skills to rescue his kidnapped teenage girl Taken 2 finds the Mills clan back home in Los Angeles safe and sound. For about 10 minutes. Bryan a bit of an obsessive-compulsive case (he buffs his own car at the car wash) is divorced from his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) but theyre still close and he still drops by to give his daughter (Maggie Grace) driving lessons. Then hes off for a quick trip to Istanbul a freelance security gig. And surprise Lenore and Kim decide to join him. The Turkish city - nestled on the Bosphorus between Europe and Asia - is a tourists delight (and a filmmakers too) and maybe the mosques and ferries the hotel spa and hot teas will help rekindle Bryan and Lenores relationship. Kim certainly hopes so. But thanks to an ominous prologue set in the Balkan hills - a grim mass funeral ending with a cry for blood and vengeance - we know that the family getaway is going to be short on rest and relaxation. Rade Serbedzija is the bereaved father of one of the abductors Bryan killed as he tried to save his daughter from sex traffickers and now the Albanian criminal and his gang of cartoon mugs are intent on revenge. Nothing short of Mills dead body will do. Taken 2 has been directed by Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3 Colombiana - I will resist the temptation to call Taken 2 a Megaton bomb) from a script by Frances hyperactive Luc Besson. When Bryan first suspects hes being followed he and Lenore are on their way to see the sights leaving Kim behind at the hotel. He spots the tail and urgently instructs his wife to leave the car and head for the arcade of shops (""When you exit the fabric store turn right. . . . And stay focused"") But one chase leads to another and soon both Lenore and Bryan have hoods over their heads hands chained to pipes. Luckily Bryan has a micro-cellphone tucked in his socks and he manages to reach Kim and warn her - and then guide her through a series of field-op exercises by which she can determine his location. Kim after all turns out to be her fathers girl bounding across rooftops lobbing hand grenades - not exactly fearlessly but full of pluck and determination. Grace is as convincing as the wobbly script allows and at least the actress has something to do. Once Janssens Lenore becomes a hostage shes relegated to the role of helpless victim spending a good part of the film in a state of semiconsciousness. Neeson is full of Neesonesque stoicism - a sad-eyed somewhat scruffy action hero who can snap an attackers neck with ease if he has to. And boy does he have to. The moral of Taken 2? If youre going on a family vacation be sure that the human-trafficking ring you put out of business in that far more satisfying and suspenseful thriller from a few years ago doesnt know how to find you. And teach your kid how to drive a stick. Taken 2  (out of four stars) Directed by Olivier Megaton. With Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen and Rade Serbedzija. Distributed by Twentieth Century Fox. Running time 1 hour 31 mins. Parents guide PG-13 (violence adult themes). Playing at area theaters. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Magali Bragard/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Magali Bragard/Twentieth Century Fox Taken 2 Director Olivier Megaton Genre Thriller Running Time 91 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and some sensuality With Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen Even though he has the face and build of a leonine Celtic warrior theres also something gentle and mouselike about Liam Neeson. Thats what makes him such an unlikely and invigorating action hero and its part of what made the 2008 thriller Taken so disreputably pleasurable Somehow watching this sad sweet galoot zap Albanian bad apples with a jillion volts of electricity just felt so right. So how could Taken 2 feel so wrong? For one thing this follow-up was directed by Olivier Megaton whose approach isnt as explosively brilliant as his totally fake name might lead you to believe. (The original was directed by Pierre Morel a filmmaker of far subtler gifts at least as far as action pictures go.) Watch Clips Take The Case Take The Case Credit Twentieth Century Fox In The Closet In The Closet Credit Twentieth Century Fox Listen To Me Listen To Me Credit Twentieth Century Fox And the plot mechanics of Taken 2 are so clunky and overloaded that even the eminently capable Neeson has trouble shouldering them This time around Neesons retired CIA operative Bryan Mills takes pity on his estranged wife (Famke Janssen) who has split with her husband and invites her and their perpetually clueless daughter (Maggie Grace) along on an easy-peasy freelance security gig hes landed in Istanbul. Meanwhile the relatives of the guy Neeson fried in the first installment have decided to take revenge on him and his family. You can tell theyre bad because they have scrubby beards and scowling expressions; you can tell theyre Albanian because theyre wearing pleated pants and oversized leather jackets from the Whos the Boss? era. (The Taken franchise is never going to win any prizes for political sensitivity.) They scheme and plot and bark sentences like ""He knows"" and ""Do it now"" into their cellphones. You just know whats going to happen Janssen is going to get nabbed while strolling through the market stalls doing a little picturesque souvenir shopping while Grace back at the hotel pool stretching her long limbs near the silvery water will be set upon by furry-faced creeps who scoop her up and sling her over a shoulder even as she kicks scratches and bites. i With help from her father Kim (Maggie Grace) plots a course of action to survive what has to be the worlds worst case of deja vu. Magali Bragard/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Magali Bragard/Twentieth Century Fox With help from her father Kim (Maggie Grace) plots a course of action to survive what has to be the worlds worst case of deja vu. Magali Bragard/Twentieth Century Fox Actually it doesnt quite go down that way -- Janssen never even gets to go shopping and Grace is told by her father via furtive cellphone communique to go into his hotel room and hide in the closet. Because thats the last place those people from Albania would ever look. OK no one wants realism or logic in a movie written by a certified French-roasted coffee bean like Luc Besson (the co-writer is Robert Mark Kamen who also collaborated with Besson on the first installment). Taken 2 must not be taken 2 seriously although at the very least Megaton could have found better ways to use all those glorious antique-looking Istanbul backdrops. On the plus side the action sequences -- desaturated chopped up and herky-jerky as they are -- are mildly thrilling The sight of gentle-giant Neeson walloping the heads kneecaps and nonmentionables of assorted thugs is pretty much enough to make the angels sing the Notre Dame Victory March. Its all the stuff around those scenes that needs a hefty rewrite. Or at least a little more shopping.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 5 2012 -- 718am Video (2313)  In this retired-guy action sequel the bad guys from ""Taken"" show that they have not forgotten Liam Neeson or forgiven him. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Taken 2"" stars Liam Neeson as Jason Bournes grandfather more or less. Fitting into the odd new ""Expendables"" genre of AARP-age action heroes he returns to the role of retired CIA agent Bryan Mills introduced in 2008s ""Taken."" Why an actor of Neesons ability would play this character once let alone twice is a mystery for the ages. There is nothing remotely intriguing about the man. He has no personality no humanity no past no interesting vulnerability. He never says anything clever. He is simply a slablike presence lumbering through action sequences. Neeson does perform the part with a morose expression but this does not strike me as the actor reflecting his characters inner pain. I read it as Neesons chagrin that he has traveled from ""Schindlers List"" to roles meant for John Cena. I can see him turning up his collar and pulling his hat brim low as he enters the check-cashing depot. In ""Taken"" Bryan rescued his virginal daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from Albanian white slavers who kidnapped her during a Paris vacation. This time he travels to Istanbul where he and his family are menaced by relatives of the men killed in his earlier adventure. Leading the reprisal is the ubiquitous Serb actor Rade Serbedzija the go-to guy for Foreignsylvanian wickedness out to avenge Neesons killing of his son. The film shortchanges the paradox of two aggrieved fathers in an eye-for-an-eye feud. This is a punchy shooty movie not a thinky one. As such it concentrates on the mechanics of reuniting the kidnapped Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) with Kim who evaded the bad guys. Bryan who sneaked a cellphone past his captors guides her like hes dictating a black-ops manual. At one point he instructs her to throw several hand grenades from rooftops. While this is probably not the safest thing to do in a teeming city it enables him to echo-locate her precisely like a dolphin. When she arrives at his cell to slip him a gun his escape is simplified by the fact that the bad guys forgot to put a guard in there with him. The Albanians are also outfitted with those Acme Machinegun Co. weapons that cant hit any target. There are moments here when you feel like the villains arent really trying. Then come episodes of florid stupidity like Kims instant transformation from timid student driver to demolition-derby getaway queen. Thats when you realize its the filmmakers who arent trying . But if you saw the original film you already know that. ""Taken"" once shame on Hollywood. ""Taken 2"" shame on you.

And those skills make him a nightmare for people who terrorize members of his family. Taken 2 Fair to good Director Olivier Megaton. Cast Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen D.B. Sweeney. Rating PG-13 for violence action and some sensuality. Since we learned all that about Bryan four years ago in the wildly popular ""Taken"" the question seems to be Do we care to see him utilize his specific skill set again? If the energetic results found in ""Taken 2"" are any indication the character could be in for a good long run. As with the first film a huge portion of the movies success is due to Liam Neeson whose Bryan is a sensitive single dad who is also an ex-CIA operative. Neeson invests a lot of sad-eyed gravitas into the role. Even when Bryan goes a little too MacGyver and the movie stretches its credibility to the breaking point the actor keeps things tethered to reality. Plus that whispery voice doesnt hurt either. In the first movie Bryans daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) was abducted by human traffickers in Paris. Now Bryan and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) are taken prisoner in Istanbul while Kim is on the lam from vengeful baddies. At times things come dangerously close to going over the top. Under Bryans direction Kim runs around Istanbul tossing hand grenades willy-nilly. Crazy? Sure but with Neeson barking out the commands who wouldnt follow his orders? If the movie doesnt sink to the dismal ""Its happened again"" level of ""The Hangover Part II"" neither does it try to reinvent the wheel. Instead director Olivier Megaton plays it right down the middle. If a viewer enjoyed the exotic locale and fast-paced action in the original film here they get a different city and even more amped-up happenings with a plot that intrigues enough to reel a viewer in. A frantic taxicab chase through the narrow streets of the city is particularly exciting as is a sequence in which one of the thugs goes mano a mano with Bryan (hes apparently a martial-arts wiz too). There is also a gruesomely inventive bit in which Lenore is turned into something akin to a human hourglass and Bryan has only 30 minutes to save her. Granted the film lacks the kicky element of surprise that made the first movie so enjoyable but its hard to gripe too much. ""Taken 2"" aims to be a fast-paced workmanlike sequel that shows off its charismatic leading man and thats exactly what it does.

This makes Bryan very very angry. He goes into commando mode and he gets her back (as he says ""I have a particular set of skills."" No kidding.). This makes the Albanians very very angry.Cut to the sequel (and I can hardly give away the plot when the trailers or simply having seen the first film have already done that) While visiting Istanbul Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) are kidnapped by the same Albanian baddies now bent on revenge for all the bodies that Bryan left strewn behind in the first film. This makes Bryan very very angry etc.Yes its the same movie second verse but unfortunately with far less suspense this time around.Screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen dont even bother to identify Mills as ex-CIA this time; they figure the audience already knows that or just doesnt give a flip.Its apparently just a few weeks after the events of the first film and the setup takes about five minutes Albanians at a hillside cemetery wailing beside a lot of open graves Mills being ultraprotective of daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) while carting her to drivers-ed classes muted sparks flying between Mills and his ex whos now getting divorced again. As a balm to Lenores and Kims wounded hearts Bryan offers a lovely family sojourn in Istanbul.Really? Wouldnt you think theyd just want to stay in the relatively safe U.S.A. for a while? But no. And were off.Taken 2 follows its predecessors basic structure -- one long chase sequence with short bits of dialogue interspersed to establish character motivation etc.One scene set outside the U.S. Embassy in Istanbul after Kim and Bryan have just crashed through the gate gives them an insane amount of quiet dad-daughter bonding time. Youd think armed soldiers might be surrounding the car shouting things like ""Get out with your hands up"" but apparently not.Lets be honest though any such scenes are mere filler until we can see Bryan in the form of hot-older-sensitive-macho-poster-man Neeson kicking Albanian butt with nifty martial-arts moves and shooting skills that would put an Army sniper to shame. Hes also got amazing batlike echolocation skills with the ability to figure out where hes being taken (blindfolded under a black hood) simply by the sounds along the way.Taken 2 boasts the same tight style as the first film with crazy car chases through itty-bitty Turkish alleys choppy fight scenes and barely a chance for the characters or the audience to take a breath.Its not a bad movie but given that its a virtual remake of the first it would have been nice if theyd at least have tossed in some witty self-references. Wit in fact is sorely lacking; Neeson occasionally gets off a zinger and its amusing to see the unlicensed Kim behind the wheel during an extended car chase but a movie this self-derivative shouldnt take itself quite so seriously.If you loved Taken youll probably love Taken 2. And yes theres a tidy setup for Taken 3 although one has to wonder who in the Mills family is still available for kidnapping. It seems unkind to keep abducting the same people.The movie does re-re-re-establish Neeson as an action star which is certainly a good thing (Oskar Schindler who?). If youre looking for thriller-ific originality however best wait and see whether Argo or Skyfall deliver.Follow Joy Tipping on Twitter at joytipping.TAKEN 2(C-) Directed by Olivier Megaton.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 1149 a.m. EDT October 5 2012The first half of Taken 2 is a serviceable action flick but the second half descends into cliches.Liam Neeson returns as our favorite middle-aged action hero with ""a very particular set of skills"" in Taken 2.(Photo Magali Bragard 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   1/2 out of fourStars Liam Neeson Famke Janssen Maggie Grace Rade SerbedzijaRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideFrom title to catch phrases Taken 2 (  1/2 stars out of four) makes no bones about being a follow-up to the 2008 French thriller that made Liam Neeson our favorite middle-aged action hero.And for about half of this sequel the approach works just fine. At times Taken 2 even steps from the shadows of the original with some terrifying imagery and an improved relationship between father and daughter.Alas the movie cant help but descend into a pat part two bereft of much suspense or tension.Its not enough to undermine Taken 2 as a serviceable action flick thanks to Neesons utter believability as a divorced dad trying to stay pertinent in his childs life. But what a sequel it could have been.Neeson reprises his role as retired CIA operative Bryan Mills a guy who could kill a man with a ballpoint pen but cant watch his little girl grow up.Neeson shines in scenes as an agent unable to shake his methodical ways. Hes still to-the-minute punctual and a bloodhound at heart. But his unshaven face and puffy eyes belie a tired spy and help make Mills painfully relatable.Video Famke Janssen gets TakenUSA TODAY Movies View the latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things filmTaken 2 starts with a simple chilling premise the legion of men Mills left dead four years ago had fathers sons and brothers. And they want revenge.Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (who teamed to write the first film) the intro bristles thanks to Rade Serbedzija who plays Albanian crime lord Murad Krasniqi. Hes got the sneer and scowl of a garden-variety Hollywood villain but hes also got a secret weapon real motive. His speech at the burial of his son is enough to suggest our operative is in real trouble.But then director Olivier Megaton (Columbiana) makes an odd call. A security job sends Mills to Istanbul where the film makes a hokey excuse to bring along Mills daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) both still traumatized by Kims abduction four years ago. Why not have these killers descend on Mills and his family at home a much more menacing proposition than meeting them halfway across the globe?Of course then you wouldnt have an excuse for the picturesque rooftop chase scenes of which this film has too many. And police in Europe dont seem to show up for explosions and gun battles like they do in the United States.The cliches ultimately overtake Taken 2. Mills pining for his ex-wife borders on the preposterous and the action scenes are cut so quick as to be hard to follow. Taken so desperately wants to be a Bourne-style franchise theres little doubt where the movie is headed.Still theres enough DNA from the original to keep Taken 2 afloat and Neeson has become a thinking-mans action star. Taken 2 is a rehash of the original. Fortunately theyre leftovers from a fine first course.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Irish actor Liam Neeson returns as a violently over-protective family man in Taken 2.

"Neeson has Taken us here before - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Liam Neeson has taken us here before Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 10.04.12 | 749 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Theres just not enough action-thriller camp -- at least not any that doesnt already have the perspiration or mania of John Travolta Nicolas Cage or Sylvester Stallone. Generally the genres too muscular for inadvertent ridiculousness to take hold. All you notice is the physical stuff the physics of the plot the physics of the fights the physics of the physics. These movies can be brilliant in that sense or just smart enough. The ""Bourne"" series for instance charts somewhere in between. Meanwhile ""Taken 2"" occupies a totally different quadrant on that graph. Its a stupid movie by smart people who arent smart enough to realize its stupid. The absurdity grows like mold in the dank dark of seriousness. So its fun for some of the right reasons but mostly for the wrong ones. This is the sort of sequel that seems to make perfect sense to the people who made it but none to us. The Albanian relatives of the men killed in the first movie by the former CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) are seeking revenge. Theres not a lot of parsing here of the moral particulars. Mills killed those men because they kidnapped his daughter and planned to turn her into a sex slave. He killed them because they succeeded in doing the same and worse to scores of other peoples daughters. He killed them because the movies tag line was ""I will find you and I will kill you."" This is all to say that the new movie is an eye-for-an-eye special. The new baddies are led by Murad (Rade Serbedzija) the mob father of the dead ringleader. Just so we know what were up against Murad says stuff like ""She will be abused by so many men that she will be nothing more than a piece of meat."" I took small pleasure in assuming that on the set there was someone whose job it was to make sure Serbedzija whos Croatian and a veteran of parts like this looked like he styled his hair with spit. Bryan is vacationing in Istanbul with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen looking good in a hard ""Real Housewives"" sort of way) when Murads goons find and grab Bryan and Lenore off the streets. The goons can never quite catch Kim whos back at the hotel and her mounting sense of self-defense is the partial source of the films comedy. Through the lazy magic of screenwriting -- Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen typed up both movies (the director is a Besson-factory regular Olivier Megaton) -- Bryan whos tied up in a dungeon gets his hands on a phone which leads to two legitimately magical calls to Kim. Heres a partial transcript ""Take a shoelace from one of my shoes in the closet. . . . Draw another circle with the market in the center. . . . I want you to go to the parking lot with the grenade. . . . I want you to pull the pin on the grenade. . . . Now I want you to draw a circle on the map. . . . I want you to take one of the guns and two of the grenades and go up to the roof. . . . Set off another grenade. . . . Drop the gun down the vent Kim and run. . ."" We already know at this point that Kim still lives with Lenore has a new 19-year-old-ish boyfriend and is preparing to get her drivers license -- even though she looks 30. Kim was the reason the first movie didnt work. She was so obnoxious that you almost didnt care what the Albanians did to her. Not this time. This time you watch her comply with her fathers wishes stealing a hotel workers clothes long-jumping across rooftops biting the pin out of grenades and maybe you think about outlandish action entertainments other Kim -- Kim Bauer from Foxs ""24"" (Taken 2"" is also a Fox release). That Kim might be the most disaster-prone character in the history of television. It was season after season of waiting to discover what national-security-compromising foolishness she would get into next. In ""Taken 2"" when Kim Mills has a moment of self-doubt while driving a stolen taxi cab alongside her father in a particularly egregious chase sequence you think ""Dont be that Kim Kim. Plow that car through those other cars and those people and that fruit stand. Plow that car past the security checkpoint all the way to the steps outside the American embassy. Be that Kim."" Besson has made a fortune from craziness like this. This movie more or less zooms straight from his production plant in Paris and is another that turns the developing countrys real estate into the first worlds jungle gym. The first Taken"" seemed to connect to men viscerally. It was a surprise hit in 2009 the divorced dads revenge fantasy done up as action-movie brutality. Eurobaddies are bad. But haughty ex-wives their affluent new husbands and ungrateful daughters are worse. Now Bryan and Lenore and Kim are almost a family again so the chip is off his big broad shoulders. He has nothing to prove anymore. Not to his family himself or us. The revenge has lost all its fantasy. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 125pm on Thursday Oct. 11 2012 Thursday Oct. 11 2012 Thursday Oct. 04 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Taken the enormously successful 2008 thriller in which a retired agent gets his kidnapped teenage daughter back was an explosion of middle-age machismo. Seeing Liam Neeson dish out some skull-cracking neck-snapping payback to every young thug in Paris proved to be a rollicking good time.Now theres Taken 2 which has the requisite abductions speeding cars and Americans in danger on foreign soil but the only ones truly taken for a ride here are those of us in the audience. All thats missing in this blatant money grab is a final shot of Neeson on a spending spree with his presumably large check.Neeson returns as Bryan Mills the ex-CIA guy living in Los Angeles where he hovers over his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) even though he no longer lives with her or her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen). But things seem to be reheating between Bryan and Lenore and he plans to spend more time with his family when he returns from a three-day freelance security assignment in Istanbul.But before you can say ""bad idea"" mother and daughter decide to surprise Bryan in Turkey just as hes ready to head home. Little do they know that Albanian crime boss Murad (the perpetually scowling Rade Serbedzija X-Men First Class) is still ticked off that Bryan killed his son who was one of Kims kidnappers. He vows revenge in Istanbul this time grabbing Bryan and Lenore.While the original was hardly more believable it got by on a propulsive energy from director Pierre Morel and a sense of surprise. This time out fellow Frenchman Olivier Megaton (Colombiana Transporter 3) working from a script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (both of whom wrote the first Taken) turns out a lethargic retread. Even the fight scenes are clumsily shot making it hard to follow whats happening.There are things in a movie like this that have to be taken on faith (all the bad guys are really bad shots) but there are some head scratchers here that are too big to ignore. Why wouldnt one of Murads many goons have someone watch over a chained-up Bryan instead of giving him enough alone time to figure a way out and communicate with his daughter? And how is it that Kim who just started taking driving lessons at the start of the film is able to maneuver a careening Mercedes through the byzantine streets of Istanbul like a stunt driver -- under a hail of bullets no less?To add musical insult to cinematic injury the film ends with one of the most overplayed songs of the year Alex Clares Too Close over the credits. But that really shouldnt come as a surprise. Its of a piece with everything else in this strikingly unoriginal film.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Youd think people would stop messing with Liam Neeson. They took his identity in ""Unknown."" He fought them all. They took his reputation in ""The A-Team."" He blew them away. The man faced down wolves in ""The Grey."" Battled the gods in ""Clash of the Titans."" (Then again he was Zeus so he had an edge.) Seriously Why do people keep picking fights with this guy? It starts all over again with ""Taken 2"" which as you might figure is a slightly late sequel to 2008s ""Taken."" In that one his daughter was kidnapped by Muslim white slavers. In this one he and his wife are kidnapped by the Muslim white slavers relatives. And what is he going to do about that someone asks him. ""What I do best"" Neeson answers. Funny I remember when what Neeson did best was making movies like ""Schindlers List"" and ""Michael Collins."" When the pictures he made drew a wonderful dramatic tension between his hulking size and rough ex-boxers face and the internal struggles -- and innate decency -- of his conflicted soft-spoken characters. Over the last few years though Neesons settled for being the go-to guy for action movies that need only an avenging patriarch. Instead of playing against his type hes playing down to it -- just another big simple stoic hero pounding the living daylights out of smaller villains. Hes become Sylvester Stallone but with a North Irish brogue. Theres a definite audience for that apparently and particularly for the ""Taken"" films which unabashedly play up the whole good-American-goes-abroad-and-kicks-the-hell-out-of-dirty-foreigners idea. But its a strange crowd for the genuinely gentle Neeson to embrace and an odd kind of movie for him to settle for. And ""Taken 2"" is definitely a who-cares kind of choice. French director Olivier Megaton -- and yes he picked that last name himself -- treats the few domestic scenes as jokes (full of corny pop songs and loud-plaid Americans) and the Istanbul ones as just a fetid swamp of stereotypes. Theres nothing fresh nothing striking. Even the action scenes -- supposedly this films reason for being -- are pro forma. No matter how many assault rifles the bad guys fire off they never hit our hero; no matter how bad the distance and angles he brings most of his targets down with a single shot. There are several car chases and one mano-a-mano fight; none of them does anything new. As for the performers Rade Serbedzija once an interesting actor walks through yet another of his greasy Balkan mobster parts; Famke Janssen spends most of the movie hooded or unconscious. And meanwhile the 60-year-old Neeson runs around and hits people (in slightly sped-up kindly edited footage) or shoots the hell out of everything. The movie moves quickly enough and lots of people get killed if youre keeping score (I lost count early on). But an arcade game provides pretty much the same ""entertainment"" and its a lot easier on the wallet. And kinder maybe to your memories of Liam Neeson. Ratings note The film contains constant violence and strong language. Taken 2 (PG-13) Fox (91 min.) Directed by Olivier Megaton. With Liam Neeson Famke Janssen Rade Serbedzija.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When Taken hit screens in 2008 it benefitted from the shock of the new. Not that its content looked particularly novel. Executive producer and co-writer Luc Besson had already spent a couple of decades turning out serviceable-or-better Eurothrillers made in the model he helped create with films like La Femme Nikita. The shock came from the star doing the Eurothrilling Liam Neeson an actor of the first order known for exuding introspective gentleness. Neeson was the last person most would think to cast as a pitiless killing machine but there he was carving his way through the Paris underworld in search of his suspiciously mature-looking teenage daughter (Maggie Grace) whod been abducted by the sex slavers who apparently run rampant in the City Of Light. Part of what makes Taken so entertaining albeit sometimes unintentionally is the way it portrays Europe as a pit of sin filled with snares for unsuspecting American innocents abroad. (Kind of like a Henry James novel but with a lot more forced prostitution.) The rest of its appeal comes from the unapologetic simplicity of its plot its propulsive pace and the way Neeson took to both bringing unsmiling gravity to what could have been a dull role. Since then the shock has worn off. Neeson continued to explore the action world in films that are striking (The Grey) dull (Unknown) or perfunctory (The A-Team). This it seems is what Neeson does now and his return to his Taken role offers few surprises. The film also lacks the efficiency and relentlessness of the original. Back in the States and mending fences with ex-wife Famke Janssen and Grace Neeson seems more worried about his daughters dating habits than the possibility of the Albanian father of one of the first films villains targeting him for revenge. That it turns out is a mistake as is Janssen and Graces decision to join Neeson in Istanbul where he has a few days to himself after finishing a security detail. What begins as a family outing with a hint of rekindled romance between the parents devolves into kidnapping (the word ""taken"" gets thrown about liberally) torture high-speed chases and other misadventures probably not smiled upon by the Turkish Board Of Tourism. None of it is particularly novel or exciting. Stepping in for Pierre Morel Olivier Megaton (The Transporter 3) brings a workmanlike mostly coherent approach to the action scenes and theres a clever sequence in which Neeson helps Grace find him through a crude form of echolocation involving a map a felt-tip pen and some hand grenades. The only real innovation is in making Neesons adventure a family affair but that mostly involves making him bark driving instructions at Grace as they tear through Istanbuls obstacle-strewn chase-friendly streets. Otherwise its business as usual for the Besson machine distinguished only by the star working the levers. Neesons Jason Statham-ization continues apace but its looking less and less like a welcome development.

Megaton the former graffiti artist who previously sank one Besson franchise with ""Transporter 3"" before giving the world the ludicrous ""Colombiana"" does to action sequences what a food processor does with an onion to much less appetizing results. Between the hacky plot points and the brain-punishing editing ""Taken 2"" is less a movie than it is a cinematic waterboarding. Liam Neeson returns as Bryan Mills the former CIA agent and overprotective dad who rescued his virginal daughter Kim (the vapid Maggie Grace) from the clutches of evil brown men in the first film. Unaware that Albanian crime boss Murad (Rade Serbedzija) has sworn revenge on Bryan for gunning down Murads son and other goons from the same village in the first movie Bryan invites Kim and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) to join him on a trip to Istanbul. Murad and a new group of Albanians (the only identifying characteristic the movie gives them is to make them swarthy and Muslim) turn up to kidnap the entire clan but after they grab Bryan and Lenore Bryan manages to warn Kim and tell her how to avoid the bad guys and aid in the rescue of her parents. While Bryans ""particular set of skills"" made him such a memorable bad-ass in the first movie his advice to Kim this time around seems less than professional. First he has her hide in a hotel room closet and only through sheer luck do the would-be kidnappers avoid opening the door and grabbing her on the spot. After that Bryans strategy for pinpointing his location involves having Kim set off grenades all over the city -- because you know who would notice? The films centerpiece involves Kim driving a stolen taxi through Istanbul while Bryan shoots at pursuers as police cars chase after everyone. Its been established that shes failed her drivers test several times but somehow Kim whips through traffic like a seasoned stunt driver and with a stick shift no less. And lest you think ""sports car plows through fruit cart"" had become such a cliche that youd never see it again on the big screen its back with a vengeance thanks to Megaton. If ""Taken 2"" had the same adrenaline-overdrive pacing as the original little things like believability and logic wouldnt matter. But while ""Taken"" director Pierre Morel knew how to stage gunfights and car chases and martial-arts combat Megatons trademark ADD turns all the excitement into a jittery manic episode that drains away all the movies fun. ""I am tired of it all"" says Bryan in his eventual face-off with Murad and by that point in the film audiences may be inclined to agree with him. If this is the best Besson and company can come up with they should leave the ""Taken"" franchise the way they do Janssens character through much of this sequel -- abandoned and forgotten.

Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) delivering his trademark crisis-control cell phone coaching to his much-imperiled daughter (Maggie Grace) commands ""I want you to go to the U.S. embassy. Youll be safe there."" Wrapped before recent embassy sieges spurred by the trailer for Innocence of Muslims--film is a battleground--this sequel to 2008s sleeper-hit programmer which had Neeson eliminating a passel of Albanian white slavers takes the reunited Mills family on vacation to Istanbul and the heart of the caliphate. Here Mills will lecture on the citys role in the history of East-West conflict which continues unabated as the families of the first films casualties (led by mourning father Rade Serbedzija) lay in wait planning to kill daughter Dad and reconciled ex-wife Famke Janssen. This cross-cultural family feud leads Mills to compose an airtight war-without-end response to the dove logic that War on Terror intervention only creates more terrorists ""Then I will kill them too."" Its all in the family at co-writer/producer Luc Bessons EuropaCorp with Olivier Megaton (Colombiana) replacing Taken director Pierre Morel working in headlong house style. While fetishizing the precise effectiveness of its heros ""very particular set of skills""--the bullet-exchange ratio between Islamo thugs and Mills must be 501--Taken 2 rarely embodies the values of concision and focus that it extols and any breathing room from the hurtling narrative illogic only allows the audience opportunity to notice slips in Millss father-knows-best infallibility.

If the script for Taken 2 had dropped on to the desk of a Cannon executive it would have been laughed out of the room. This is a film that makes the Death Wish sequels look like Godfather 2 that makes the work of Jean-Claude Van Damme look like an Ingmar Bergman box set. It is one of the laziest mainstream films ever.Where the first Taken began with a believably nightmarish scenario - ex-Secret Service operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) was forced to act when his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) was snatched by sex traffickers - the sequel doesnt bother with old-fashioned fripperies like plot or intrigue. The relatives of the bald jabbering baddies that Bryan bumped off in the first film now want revenge. They follow him to Istanbul. They try to kill him. They fail. The end.Much of the blame must fall on writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (a sequence involving a bag of grenades and a map of Istanbul sparked gales of laughter at a screening) but the real culprit is director Olivier Megaton. The action sequences are punishing a car chase feels entirely composed of close-ups of smashing glass spinning tyres and hands grappling with gearsticks while a punch-up in a sauna is about as much fun as watching someone else play Street Fighter. Taken 2 is a cynical film which has only been made apparently to squeeze the pockets of anyone who enjoyed the first movie. Why give them the satisfaction?

It goes through the motions with the fights and mass shootings and the overlong car chase but there is a nagging doubt that other films have done this so much better.

Daily Edition Login to download Taken 2 Film Review 200 PM PDT 9/7/2012 by Bernard Besserglik FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Neeson is the main attraction as Taken 2 provides more of the same. TWITTER Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen reprise their roles from the 2008 action thriller. DEAUVILLE -- A sequel to the 2008 action thriller Taken probably was inevitable given that movies astonishing success worldwide -- a take of 225 million for an outlay of barely one-tenth that amount. The makers of Taken 2 have stuck as close as possible to the original formula the same actors the same high-octane mixture of violence and pursuit the same assertion of family values. The location has shifted from Paris to Istanbul but otherwise Taken 2 could virtually pass for a remake. With more funds to lavish on production values and this time the advantage of a precedent theres every prospect of similar causes leading to similar effects at the box office. PHOTOS 80s Action Stars Where Are They Now? Liam Neeson reprises his role as retired CIA operative and concerned parent Bryan Mills while Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen re-enlist as his daughter Kim and former wife Lenore respectively. The story hinges on revenge rather than rescue. Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (who also scripted Taken) reference the earlier movie in an opening hilltop burial scene where Albanian clan chief Murad Krasniqi (Rade Sherbedgia) vows to avenge Mills killing of his son the head of a human trafficking ring who had the bad idea of making off with Kim. His plans are given a boost when Mills -- ill-advisedly as it soon proves -- invites Kim and Lenore to spend some holiday time with him in Istanbul where his private security firm has just completed a deal with a wealthy sheikh. One car chase later and its Mills and Lenores turn to be ""taken"" while Kim only narrowly avoids a similar fate. From here on its played strictly by the numbers. The infinitely resourceful Mills who has secreted a micro cellphone about his person manages to contact Kim and teleguide her actions organizing their escape by remote control. Practicing Houdini-like skills he is able to break free of his bonds and save Lenore before she bleeds to death. There are no martial arts of which he is not the master whether wielding a handgun against assault rifles or bare-fisted against a band of men armed with clubs and knives. An ultimate mano a mano leads to a final confrontation with the clan chief and a conclusion that leaves open the possibility of a Taken 3. STORY Old People Old Stars Hollywoods New Hot Demo Is Saving the Box Office Theres one decent joke in a movie that is otherwise played perfectly straight a second breakneck car chase through the souk in which Mills is in the passenger seat the wheel taken by his daughter who weve been informed early on has flunked her drivers permit twice and has been skipping driving lessons. Directed by Olivier Megaton a journeyman helmer in the Besson stable (Transporter 3 Colombiana) Taken 2 is in some ways a more polished product than its predecessor taking full advantage of its exotic locations and pacing its action sequences more successfully. The villains still are cardboard cutouts -- short dark Oriental and not much interested in anything other than televised soccer -- and the general level of characterization is skin deep. But the filmmakers know precisely what they are doing and ultimately whether its a good or a bad movie is beside the point. So is the issue of plausibility. This is the action movie pared down to the basics storytelling without pretentions of subtlety irony or sophistication -- Superman without the superpowers and the fancy costume. PHOTOS Second Times the Charm 15 of Hollywoods Most Notable Remakes Neeson is utterly convincing as the anger-fueled but soft-spoken action hero the personification of the regular guy pushed to the limit in defense of his family and its hard to see the Taken franchise succeeding without him. Theres a touch of vigilante advocacy in the movie that will displease some with Neeson as a more gentlemanly version of the Charles Bronson of the Death Wish series but clearly theres still a market for such fantasies. Moviegoers who liked Taken and want more of the same will get precisely that.
