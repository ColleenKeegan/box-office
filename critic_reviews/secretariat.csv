In the silent era cowboy star Tom Mix shared equal billing with Tony the Wonder Horse. Singing cowpoke Roy Rogers often rode Trigger while warbling. And a breathtakingly lovely 12-year-old named Elizabeth Taylor rode a steed named Pie to stardom in 1944s ""National Velvet."" As steady as the drum of hoofbeats during a cavalry charge filmmakers continue to crank out movies about fictional horses many aimed at younger viewers. ""Black Beauty"" alone has been made and remade more than a half dozen times since the early 1900s. There are multiple websites with pages and pages devoted to recalling and debating the merits of various horse movies past -- though nary a one mentions ""Equus."" In more recent years the fortunes of real life race horses have been chronicled in 1983s ""Phar Lap"" 2003s ""Seabiscuit"" and 2004s ""Hidalgo"" (though many contended the last was more fictional than real). And there are more to come. Steven Spielbergs next film is ""War Horse"" the tear-inducing tale of a British horse and its farmboy owner both of whom go off to fight in WWI. (Personal aside though Ive never seen it Ill always have a fond spot for 1991s ""Wild Hearts Cant Be Broken"" a sappy tale about a teenage girl who rides performing horses as they dive off a high perch into water in Atlantic City. I still laugh when I recall that a friend went to see it the day after a wrenching breakup with a boyfriend. She sobbed and sniffled loudly throughout. A young girl in the audience whispered to her father ""Daddy why is that lady crying?"" ""Honey"" her father replied though he obviously knew better ""I guess shes just afraid the horse doesnt know how to swim."") Disneys new ""Secretariat"" is more ambitious than most horse movies. It tells the story of how Penny Chenery Tweedy (Diane Lane) a Denver housewife took over her fathers foundering Virginia horse farm and bet the farm literally on a thoroughbred colt she lovingly raised named Big Red. The horse running under the nom de track of Secretariat went on to win the Triple Crown in 1973 one of only 11 horses to do so in history. The speed records he set still stand. Though the champion race horse gets his name in the title the movies real hero is Tweedy and her journey which parallels Secretariats rise. (The real life Tweedy now 88 can be glimpsed among the fans watching a race during the movie and is spotlighted again in the closing credits.) When the film begins she is an upper-middle-class housewife who spends her time cooking cleaning and making life comfortable for her lawyer husband (Dylan Walsh) and four kids. When her mother dies and then her father (Scott Glenn) not long afterward Tweedy begins dividing her time between her family in Colorado and the horse operation in Virginia. The film is careful to show the conflicts and stress this dual existence causes though - obvious-spoiler alert -- all ends happily. Theres even a sketchy subplot about a teenage daughters involvement in anti-war protests apparently to show that both mother and daughter believe in standing up for what you believe in and sticking with your convictions. Directed with workman-like competence by Randall Wallace (""We Were Soldiers"") ""Secretariat"" has three things going for it besides its cant-fail-to-inspire story. The first is Lane appealingly steely as Tweedy despite being asked to stare meaningfully into the horses eyes several times. She creates a believably determined woman who uses humor and charm to overcome the often chauvinistic world of horseracing. The second is an amusingly showy comic turn by John Malkovich as Lucien Lauren the loudly dressed French-Canadian trainer whom Tweedy convinces to come out of retirement to guide Secretariat. And finally the horse-racing scenes are sensational full of movement and immediacy putting viewers right in there among the giant sweating beasts as they gallop swiftly around the track. There are other movies out there now that are smarter (""The Social Network"") more fun (the French sex comedy ""Heartbreaker"") more loaded with action (""The Town"") or achingly grown-up melancholia (""Jack Goes Boating"") but you cant schlep the kids and the great-grandma to any of them. With ""Secretariat"" you can load them all into the SUV without a worry. Its a sports movie a horse movie an inspirational true-life tale and a feminist consciousness-raising exercise all rolled into one predictable but nonetheless appealing package for all ages. Which makes ""Secretariat"" by default almost as much a winner as its hard-running namesake. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The title nods to the greatest race horse of all time but the filmmakers choose to focus on its owner Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) a no-nonsense housewife who against all advice takes charge of her late fathers failing breeding stables and is given a boost when one of her mares produces the foal that becomes Secretariat. With the help of Margo Martindales home help and John Malkovichs flamboyant trainer Penny perseveres through the ups and downs of juggling family life with big business and is eventually rewarded when her steed wins the coveted US Triple Crown. A few unnecessary family-related diversions and the odd Disney cliche aside what were offered is a simple stirring sports drama about a housewife who enters a male-dominated world and succeeds in trouncing the opposition. Lane is excellent in the role; her likeable Grace Kelly-esque looks and demeanour sit perfectly within the films authentic period milieu.

"Bio-pics of John Lennon and Secretariat make an oddly fitting pairing. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bio-pics of John Lennon and Secretariat make an oddly fitting pairing. Bio-pics of John Lennon and Secretariat make an oddly fitting pairing. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 7 2010 751 PM Double Fantasy Triple Crown Bio-pics of John Lennon and Secretariat make an oddly fitting pairing. By Dana Stevens Diane Lane in Secretariat This week two legendary figures have their legends gilded--and gelded--by well-executed but conventional biopic treatments John Lennon whose pre-Beatle adolescence is ploddingly chronicled in Nowhere Boy (the Weinstein Company) and Secretariat whose record-breaking 1973 Triple Crown victory is suspenselessly re-enacted in Secretariat (Disney). In a strange way these films make for a kind of thematic double feature. Both of them argue that their subjects seemingly preternatural gifts were a direct consequence of their relationships with their powerful doting often flawed mothers. And both the boy from Liverpool and the colt from Virginia had adoptive mothers who were crucial to their adult success. Lennons unstable depressive birth mother Julia farmed him out as a small boy to her stern but loving sister Mimi who would raise him to adulthood. As for Secretariat his equine mother Somethingroyal--about whose emotional stability little is known--entrusted him after weaning to his fanatically dedicated owner Penny Chenery who for reasons that the movie never makes clear somehow knew that this horse was destined for racing greatness. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Of these two films Id be quicker to recommend Nowhere Boy (though Secretariat as well see is not without its own curious waxworks charm.) The story of Lennons early years is dramatic and painful enough to survive an imperfect retelling even if youre already familiar with the stations of the cross. In the space of about one year Lennon initiated a reconciliation with his long semi-estranged mother; got his first guitar from her as a gift; started a skiffle band called The Quarrymen with his schoolmates; met Paul McCartney and began their collaboration; and learned that his mother walking home from Aunt Mimis house after a visit had been struck by a car and killed. Advertisement With the help of some elision and compression Nowhere Boy (which was based on a memoir by Lennons half-sister Julia Baird) faithfully documents the events of that year. Aaron Johnson a hunky 19-year-old Brit last seen as the hero of Kick-Ass plays the young John as a volatile occasionally brutish punk whose adoption of a rock n roll attitude long preceded any actual interest in playing music. (According to many accounts by the older John Lennon this portrait isnt far from the truth.) Like the sullen hero of a British postwar kitchen-sink drama Lennon craves escape from his suffocating middle-class milieu emblematized by the stiff-backed Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas in one of the casually perfect performances shes come to specialize in). Young John skips school picks fights and steals singles from a record store. His mates including his best friend and fellow Quarryman Pete Shotton (Josh Bolt) follow him around like puppies and Johnson is charismatic enough to make you understand why even when the script cant make up its mind whether to show him as a carefree cutup or a suffering soul. As Julia Lennon Anne-Marie Duff lays the Oedipal backstory on a bit thick. I can accept that Lennon was more than a little in love with his elusive fun-loving mother--his ethereal love song ""Julia"" attests to that--but scene after scene shows her rubbing up against him and all but purring like a cat in heat. The baby-faced Thomas Sangster nearly steals the show in the much smaller role of Paul McCartney. (Sangster 20 years old in real life plays McCartney at age 15 but looks around 12.) A couple of scenes exist to illustrate the difference between teenage John and teenage Paul As anxious insecure John skips school and picks fights to prove his bona fides as a rocker Paul a defiantly uncool music geek is quietly rocking out. Im not up enough on my Beatles lore to know how accurate that contrast is but dramatically it feels right. Nowhere Boy itself at times errs on the side of hagiography but Ill admit that when the newly named Beatles took off for Hamburg at the end I sort of wished there was a second chapter coming. Theres not much I can add to Andrew OHehirs marvelous reading of Secretariat as a fantasy fable for Tea Partiers nostalgic for a prelapsarian America that never existed. Im not sure I saw all that in the movie but honestly I found it hard to pay attention long enough to see much at all. Secretariat is a by-the-numbers sports-hero picture with an inexpressive hero (horses look great in motion but they cant carry a close-up) and a preordained outcome. The only reason weve heard of Secretariat is because he was the first horse in 25 years to win the Triple Crown and he set speed records in the first and third races that have yet to be broken. It would take an even greater miracle to lend suspense to this animals smooth ascent from pampered thoroughbred to freakishly gifted champion to long-lived breeding stud. So the story focuses on Secretariats owner Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) who like her horse has lucked out in the lottery of life. Shes a well-off Denver housewife with four children and a husband (Dylan Walsh) who after her mother dies goes back to her parents Virginia horse farm to help out her senile father (Scott Glenn--is Scott Glenn really old enough to play senile already?). After losing a coin toss with another owner Penny wins the rights to the least-valuable foal in the stable the offspring of a stallion with speed but no stamina. But somehow in the steel-trap brain that dwells beneath that frosted beehive Penny knows that this oversized stubborn colt has what it takes to become the greatest racehorse in history. So for the next two years Penny devotes herself full-time to the horses care and training with the help of her fathers stalwart secretary Elizabeth (Margo Martindale) and the horses groom and handler Eddie (Nelsan Ellis in an unpleasantly retro Uncle Tom-ish role). John Malkovich is the colts colorful trainer Lucien Laurin who communicates his French-Canadian-ness by delivering random lines in unsubtitled Malkovich-accented French. Diane Lane is as always appealing to watch and the script does its best to load Penny down with some adversity to overcome Her fathers farm may have to be sold leaving her with only her own nice house back in Denver She really misses her kids when shes out on the racing circuit The country club where the racing crowd has lunch wont allow women But in the end the only real thrill in Secretariat comes from watching horses run. As any viewer of Westerns can attest that pleasure does go a long way and there are some inventively filmed jockeys-eye-view race scenes along with a strangely ecstatic moment in which Penny and Eddie soap up and groom Secretariat to the accompaniment of a gospel soundtrack. My advice If youre looking for a nostalgic inspirational horse-race biopic that doesnt isolate itself completely from economic historical and racial reality go rent Seabiscuit.

If you know zilch youll be thrilled. If you know slightly more than zilch youll be a little less thrilled. If you know the pertinent details and Im thinking of certain race results from 1973 you may regard the film as a pleasant two hours spent with two magnificent creatures. The horse is gorgeous; Diane Lane is gorgeous; they spend a lot of time staring into each others eyes backlit by perpetual sunsets. The whole film is golden from her helmet of blonde hair to the halo of light embracing (almost) every shot. Ill be writing this review spoiler-free for the folks who know zilch. I had assumed such viewers did not exist until on a whim I performed an unscientific survey of people exiting the theater at a promotional screening. Two-thirds of them knew nothing of Secretariats legacy going into the film. I am envious. Without the element of surprise this sparkling bauble of American sports nostalgia adds up to pretty pictures thundering hooves gauzy setpieces -- and not a whole lot else. Its a handsome static portrait of a legendary thoroughbred and the luminous woman who owned and loved him. Secretariatwas directed by Randall Wallace who last sat in the directors chair for 2002sWe Were Soldiers and written by Mike Rich who brought a reverent-but-dull sheen to 2006sThe Nativity Story. Its Secretariat who gets canonized this time first with opening biblical quotations (Job 39) then with a plot that assigns almost mystical superpowers to a singularly driven animal. His female co-star is Lane as Penny Chenery Tweedy the housewife and mother of four who overcame ingrained old-boy sexism in taking the reins of her fathers horse farm. Tweedys ownership of Secretariat - or ""Big Red"" as she calls him - is as much the subject of the movie as Secretariat himself jazzing up social tensions and layers of family strife. (Her husband portrayed by a staunchly uninteresting Dylan Walsh frets over Pennys independence and their daughters emerging hippie-dom.) Other humans in the cast include John Malkovich encased in heinous plaids as eccentric trainer Lucien Laurin and Dylan Baker as Pennys patronizing pushy tax-obsessed brother. They all play their roles on this stately trot through history. Movies with foregone conclusions arent that rare of course and they work just fine when their screenplays build suspense from fictitious elements. The Titanic sinks sure but what about Jack and Rose? In Secretariat the fictionalized bits are simple exaggerations - broad Disney-ish adjustments in races and other realities. So a rival horse wins an event he didnt. A rival trainer is made out to be a sneering villain (smack that grin off his face). Secretariats gentle African-American groom is given just enough screen time with just enough pure-hearted dialogue to establish him as the Designated Spiritual Black Man so often found in films about rich white people. And Malkovich? Hes the clown. He gets to make off-color cracks about monkey butts while Lane never more earnest or airy issues lofty bromides about racing as a metaphor for life. ""You never know how far you can go unless you run"" she says and I totally agree. Or I would if I hadnt known so much about her horse. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Banzai Wigglin Water Sprinkler for 7 + pickup at Walmart PUMA Mens Leather EvoSpeed 1.4 Shoes for 38 + free shipping 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Better Homes amp; Gardens Karachi Olefin Rug for 10 + pickup at...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Consider this a nonspoiler alert for the rollicking intelligent PG-rated ""Secretariat"" The horse wins. You know a movie is winning you over when you fall for the rhythms of suspense knowing all the while the outcome. This in part is whats so rousing about director Randall Wallaces tale of the 3-year-old chestnut stallion that won racings elusive Triple Crown when he crossed the finish line of the Belmont Stakes on June 9 1973. Knowing in no way diminishes the trampling-the-oval action or the insightful human drama. Will he win? How will he win? These questions never flag. Yet ""Secretariat"" earns its best accolades for asking even larger questions as it highlights the story not just of a terrific horse but of his greatest champion owner Penny Chenery portrayed with grace edge and a growing sense of self by Diane Lane. In a time when family movies so often come with yammering animals or computer-generated characters and fantasy settings its edifying to have a multidimensional narrative that doesnt require 3-D glasses. ""Secretariat"" imagines that our lives our history can still deliver the goods. In the late 1960s Penny Tweedy -- nee Chenery -- is a wife and mother living in Littleton with husband Jack and four children. When her mother dies she travels to her fathers horse farm in Virginia. There she finds her once-vigorous dad Christopher Chenery (Scott Glenn) ailing and no longer able to run the grand horsebreeding enterprise known as the Meadow. Her taking over is not an easy ride personally or economically. Mike Richs script doesnt shy away from depicting a marriage fraying. The movie touches on the tensions of the late 60s and early 1970s. The year ""Big Red"" -- as he was known to some -- took the Triple Crown Bobby Riggs got a swatting from Billie Jean King in the so-called ""Battle of the Sexes"" tennis match. The Vietnam War came to some sort of end with the Paris Peace Accords. The Watergate scandal broke. And weve barely touched on that years events. The times they were still a- churning and the screenplay captures this within a familial context. Dylan Walsh portrays Jack Tweedy Pennys husband at the time. He isnt outright hostile to his wifes project just tight-lipped and passively unsupportive. Dylan Baker plays Chenerys older brother Hollis an economics professor whod like to unload the family farm. The director and Lane celebrate Chenerys bravado without pretending it didnt have costs. While shes tending to the Meadow her children -- Sarah Kate John Jr. and Christopher -- are growing up without her. In particular Kate (A.J. Michalka) starts to buck the system to pose political questions to become an activist. Penny isnt there for those moments. The film has no shortage of classic perks agile performances witty details evocative music and an engagement with grandeur within a fine yarn. John Malkovich proves powerfully amusing as the gifted if sartorially challenged horse trainer Lucien Laurin. James Cromwell is financier and horseman Ogden Phipps who believes hes won the toss that leads to Secretariat. Chenery family friend Bull Hancock is appealingly portrayed by Fred Dalton Thompson who had the horse sense to bow out of a different race -- for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination -- and return to acting. Secretariat is about luck and pluck the muscular grace of a horse and the elegant gumption of his owner. The ""sport of kings"" found a tough princess in Penny Chenery.

By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 8 2010 Save for later Saved From second left Diane Lane Nelsan Ellis Otto Thorwarth and John Malkovich are shown in a scene from Secretariat. John Bramley/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of How can a mere actor compete with the magnificent-looking chestnut stallion in ""Secretariat""? Youd need a heroic presence akin to Sean Connerys to even come close.Diane Lane plays Penny Chenery owner of the greatest of all racehorses who in 1973 won the Triple Crown - handily. A Denver housewife who inherits her ailing fathers Virginia stables Penny turns out to be a take-no-prisoners dynamo in a male-dominated business. Everything about her is imposing starting with her rock-hard hairdos which look as if they could withstand tsunamis.Penny surrounds herself with a bastion of equally intransigent types foppish French-Canadian trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) who is described as dressing like Superfly but looks more like Pinky Lee; jockey Ronnie Turcotte (real-life rider Otto Thorwarth in an excellent debut) who appears to lack a nervous system; and Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) the films requisite horse whisperer. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Hes about the only person in the movie who does whisper. Most of the time were privy to stampede-inducing shoutfests. The racing scenes easily the best thing in this otherwise uninspired piece of inspirationalism come as a distinct relief. Malkovich at least is amusing injecting some much-needed nuttiness into the proceedings. Lane is stuck with the dullest and deadest of the dialogue. Her overrehearsed underfelt attempts at resuscitation compound the dullness. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Disney studios director Randall Wallace and his screenwriter Mike Rich obviously targeting a ""faith-based"" audience a la ""The Blind Side"" lard the soundtrack with ""Oh Happy Day"" and readings from the Book of Job. This is odd since Penny and Co. are not portrayed as especially churchgoing types. Are we supposed to think it was Gods will that Secretariat made all that moola for all those breeders and bettors?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 08 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Typically nobody loves a Goliath-slays-David story. But there are exceptions none greater than on a summer day back in 1973. There at the Belmont track in the final leg of the Triple Crown an equine Goliath named Secretariat achieved something far more magical than merely winning. Instead before astonished eyes that wouldnt know a furlong from a foot-long he transformed himself into the winged Pegasus - soaring charging pulling away ever faster and further converting power into raw speed so tangibly so poetically that for precious seconds the mythic seemed real. Detail featuring a horse in the Lascaux Cave paintings in France The paintings are more than 17000 years old and the majority of the animals depicted in them are horses. Reuters In Pictures Great moments in horses KATHERINE HEIGL 40 watts Heigl needs a hit more than Ashton Kutcher needs marriage counselling. The last movie both were in Killers died at the box office. With the pressure on from her previous successes The Ugly Truth and 27 Dresses can the 31-year-old actress get her rom-com mojo back with Life as We Know It? Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? If you doubt that proof is just a computer click away. Call up the YouTube video of the race. Even now viewed in grainy black-and-white from a distance of decades the magic is there to be seen and more profoundly felt. Yes that old video is bound to turn skeptics into believers. Alas this new movie isnt - not remotely. The problem is how to inflate that moment of sheer poetry into a feature-length plot. Horsey movies are usually buddy flicks partnering the steed with often young and diminutive pals ( The Black Stallion Phar Lap) whereupon large horse and little rider take on the big bad world. If the buddy isnt little then the horse must be as in Seabiscuit. Thats because the David factor the long-odds hero is always there to stir up the drama. Ostensibly so it is here not in the horse but in his owner Penny Chenery a woman in racings traditionally male domain. Nice try no sale. The long odds on this gal the rich daughter of a richer father seem as contrived as the drama and we arent buying into either. The contrivance begins when Penny (Diane Lane) leaves a lavish home in Denver surrounded by her lawyer husband and a passel of kids to return to the family stables back in Virginia where she inherits the reins from her ailing father. Hubby isnt pleased but our housewife-turned-racing-magnate stays the course. Whats more she defies conventional wisdom by firing the current trainer and hiring Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) a transplanted Quebecker whose discriminating eye for horseflesh is apparently exceeded only by his pimps taste in clothes. Sorry but the comedy here is pretty much confined to the yellow checks on his loud suits. And you know the dramatic pickings are just as slim when director Randall Wallace tries to find suspense in a coin toss - seems in the horsey set thats how they settle the ownership of new foals. Well aint her bad luck good. Penny loses the toss but wins Secretariat. Cue the colt-is-born scene and enter the baby Goliath. Flash-forward to his first victory with another Canadian (Ron Turcotte) aboard and then to his horse-of-the-year coronation as a two-year-old. So wheres the drama now? It shifts from that tossed coin to bigger money problems With her stables in financial difficulties and the whiny hubby still yapping Penny turns down a cool 8-million for her young horse choosing instead to sell ""breeding shares"" in his studly future. Will she raise the requisite bucks? My but our seat edges are getting quite the workout. Happily after a few more plucky outbursts from our budding feminist and high financier (""Im not giving up"") were on to the Triple Crown where the legend is made. That being the well-known case the niggling question repeats itself Drama? Try this out. Before the Kentucky Derby Secretariat comes down with an abscess on his lip. With mere hours until post time Penny not just his owner but his BFF looks him straight in the face offers a few words of healing encouragement and - poof - the abscess disappears. Its magic all right but just that damned Hollywood brand. When the trumpet sounds for the races themselves Wallace uses his camera to manufacture a modicum of excitement combining extreme close-ups in the starting gate with tracking shots on the course - first the animals wild-eyed anticipation then their thundering stride. And among the cast members you cant fault the five nags who collectively play the title role. They know how to pose they know how to run and they look awfully pretty when silhouetted against the rosy dawn or galloping in the morning mist. But none is the real deal. So when the movie climactically reproduces that exhilarating Belmont the fiction is just a pale shadow of the fact and the realized myth that lives in our memory dies on the screen.

Its also a finely constructed feel-good movie gorgeous to look at suspenseful when its supposed to be and firmly in control of the sports movie archetypes and tropes that it wields like an experienced jockey using a riding crop.The subject isnt the horse which ruled the track en route to a record-breaking 1973 Triple Crown run so much as the woman who brought him to prominence. As played by Diane Lane Penny Chenery is a quietly determined strategist who beat the boys at their own game. Chenery is the storys secret weapon and dramatic core. She turns a rather traditional movie into a spirited reminder of how recently women were scorned for tasks routinely expected of men.Lane gets ample support from John Malkovich as Secretariats trainer Lucien Laurin a colorful French-Canadian with his own underdog story and from a story arc that pushes the right buttons. Coming on the heels of 2003s Seabiscuit Secretariat should still garner a word-of-mouth crowd-pleasing reputation. It doesnt hurt that its also a good movie.Directed by Randall WallaceStarring Diane Lane John Malkovich Scott Glenn James Cromwell Dylan Walsh Fred Thompson Nelsan Ellis and Kevin ConnollyRun time 116 minutesMPAA rating PG (brief mild language) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

When critics use that term its often a quiet condemnation as if feeling good were a thing that the average person does blindly in response to a highly manipulated set of stimuli that a more discriminating one is smart enough to find lacking. But there is no point in being snotty about Secretariat. The saga of the horse becoming a champion has you pumping your fist in simple pleasure not just over the victories of an incomparable and beautiful creature -- famously described by sportscaster Chic Anderson as ""moving like a tremendous machine"" -- but for his determined owner Penny Chenery Tweedy (Diane Lane) the woman who gambled on Secretariat. (Read TIMEs fall arts guide.) It also manages to be suspenseful which in and of itself is no small feat for director Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers). After all Secretariat isnt exactly a dark horse. In 1973 at three years of age the stallion appeared on the covers of TIME Newsweek and Sports Illustrated in the span of one week. Hed already won the Kentucky Derby establishing an as yet unbeaten speed record as well as the Preakness and had only the Belmont Stakes to go before becoming the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. In short he was the furthest thing from the underdog contender typically beloved by sports cinema. (See historical photos of the Kentucky Derby.) His owner however was an underdog if only by virtue of her sex and that provides much of the films drama. Penny Chenery Tweedy grows up around her fathers horsebreeding business in Virginia goes off to Smith College has four children and settles into a housewifes life. When her mother dies she leaves behind Pennys ailing father (Scott Glenn lending dignity to a man with dementia) and a not exactly thriving horse farm. Penny ever her fathers daughter doesnt want to give up the farm; her brother Hollis (Dylan Baker) a Harvard professor is frantic to sell before they get hit with an enormous inheritance tax. Pennys clean-cut attorney husband Jack (Dylan Walsh) is also highly skeptical of her endeavor. Hes the kind of guy who gives his wife careful instructions on which wines to buy for a dinner party; its clear he thinks of her as less competent than he is. His chauvinism is more low-key than say that of Pancho (Nestor Serrano) -- the obnoxious owner of Secretariats main rival Sham -- who takes shameless potshots at Pennys housewife status. But its present nonetheless. We know Secretariat isnt going to turn out a dud but were not so sure about Pennys marriage. Its possible that the real Jack Tweedy was more supportive; its worth noting that the real Penny who has a cameo in the film recently reminded the New York Times that Secretariat is a ""Disney movie."" She said she enjoyed it but that ""we know they have to convey certain values and photogenic moments."" Presumably the screenplay by Mike Rich (The Rookie) -- ""suggested"" as the credits inform us by William Nacks book Secretariat The Making of a Champion -- might have heightened the drama by making marital tensions seem worse than they were. (Nack is also a character in the film played by Kevin Connolly who unfortunately plays him exactly the way he does Eric Murphy in Entourage.) Like the real Penny well take Disneys version of the story with a grain of salt (or sugar) but this is an undeniably well-crafted genre piece. Pennys fathers legacy includes two mares pregnant by Bold Ruler a champion stallion owned by financier Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell) who is described throughout the movie as the worlds richest man. Thanks to the peculiar habits of the horse-breeding world a coin toss determines who keeps which foal. Phipps ends up with the more obvious choice while Penny gets the unborn foal she already suspects might possess unusual speed and stamina. She hires a trainer a flamboyant French Canadian named Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich as fun as hes been in years) and they the Chenerys groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) and Pennys young son all watch and marvel together as the huge colt is born and immediately clambers to his feet. Theres a sweet moment when the boy learns that Something Royal Secretariats mother has given birth 13 times and says to his mother admiringly ""Youve done it four times."" Its nicely done warmly emotional and not too sentimental. (See photos of the amazing moms of the animal kingdom.) The most obvious comparison in terms of similarly inspirational movies featuring strong women is last years The Blind Side but Secretariat is about 90% less cheesy than that football saga. Thats a product of the writing and the fortunate limitations of working with horses -- they cant go shopping for a makeover -- but much of the credit goes to Lane. She keeps her performance small and dignified expertly intertwining Pennys vulnerability with her inner strength. Penny is very precise a perfectly coiffed woman who dresses like a lady and behaves like one throughout the movie. (Lane as Pat Nixon could give Joan Allen a run for her money.) But her Penny is not the obvious steel-magnolia type as Sandra Bullock was in The Blind Side; instead we see her strength and resolve develop gradually. This isnt a passionate showy part but a finely drawn performance worthy of a veteran actress who started her career as Secretariat did in the 1970s (in A Little Romance) and has since earned a champion status of her own.

Housewife and mother Penny Chenery agrees to take over her ailing fathers Virginia-based Meadow Stables despite her lack of horse-racing knowledge. Against all odds Chenery -- with the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin -- manages to navigate the male-dominated business ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and what may be the greatest racehorse of all time. Starring Diane Lane John Malkovich Dylan Walsh James Cromwell Kevin Connolly Nelsan Ellis Dylan Baker Margo Martindale Otto Thorwarth Fred Thompson Director Randall Wallace Running time 156 Release Opened Oct 8 2010  Editorial Review Get a great story and run with itBy Ann HornadayFriday October 8 2010Its tough to guess who will enjoy ""Secretariat"" more -- filmgoers who remember the extraordinary events of 1973 when the chestnut 3-year-old won the first Triple Crown in 25 years or those for whom the story is brand-new. With this stirring thoroughly entertaining movie director Randall Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"") has achieved the next to impossible injecting genuine tension and suspense into a narrative we all know the ending to. Wallaces secret is that he makes ""Secretariat"" about characters not races and he has found irresistible protagonists in both his equine and human subjects. Coming from behind with a heart as big as a house is Secretariat known to his owners and intimates as Big Red who at first is so slow ""he couldnt beat a fat man encased in cement being dragged backwards by a freight train"" according to his trainer (played with quirky crusty gusto by John Malkovich). But his owner believes in him Penny Chenery Tweedy a Denver homemaker who inherits her fathers Virginia horse farm and battles the sexist forces of her own family and the horse racing establishment to champion Big Red and change the face of the sport forever. One of the best things ""Secretariat"" has going for it is that Tweedy is played by Diane Lane who brings her signature ineffable blend of radiance toughness and demure reserve to a woman who knows how to wear just the bright brooch when upending the patriarchy. Its a testament to Big Reds mythical force that hes portrayed by five horses in the movie of his life -- including one charismatic steed that like Secretariat himself plays to the camera so cannily you could almost swear he winks. Juxtaposing Tweedys you-must-pay-the-rent travails and her conservative husbands complaints with Big Reds journey to becoming a superstar Wallace turns ""Secretariat"" into a parable of faith and quiet assured feminism. If some of the back-home scenes are awkwardly staged (especially Tweedys teenage daughter who rebels against her parents politics in a parody of liberal agitprop) and the plot contoured for Hollywood efficiency the story itself is too infectious to resist. Filmed with breathtaking immediacy the racing sequences are utterly heart-stopping with each hoofbeat and clod of dirt seeming to leap off the screen especially during Secretariats astonishing run in the Belmont Stakes. (Fans will appreciate Wallaces decision to show much of the Preakness on a television monitor reproducing how most of us remember the event.) But at its core ""Secretariat"" is the story of a girl and her horse that mystical bond between human and animal that by quoting the Book of Job to open and close the movie Wallace suggests is almost spiritual. When Big Red snorts as Tweedy approaches his stall its a moment of transcendent recognition. And in its own way its more thrilling that those legendary runs themselves.Contains brief mild profanity.

ABOUT THE MOVIESecretariat  1/2 out of four Stars Diane Lane John Malkovich Dylan Walsh Margo Martindale Scott GlennDirector Randall WallaceDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for brief mild languageRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Hes not a horse of course. Hes Secretariat. The tale of this glossy chestnut colt substitutes reverence for bona fide excitement. Diane Lanes voice-over narration quotes from the book of Job while a handsome steed bursts through billowing clouds as if on a divine mission. MORE Other horse movies to get you out of the gate TRAILER Hop in the saddle with Secretariat MORE Why Secretariat lives on The true story of the recordbreaking Secretariat is pretty stupendous as is. It didnt need schmaltzing up. But director Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask) chose to aggrandize everything surrounding the Triple Crown winner to worshipful proportions. The sentimentality ladled on thickly however undermines the impact of this underdog saga. The deification even extends to the choice of musical selections. Oh Happy Day swells during a montage then is reprised with the volume cranked up to 11 when Secretariat wins a key race. During racing sequences swelling music overpowers all drowning out the potent sound of hooves. When it comes to horse movies Seabiscuit more effectively chronicled a champion Thoroughbred through the eyes of those who loved him as well as a larger sociopolitical lens. Here those contextual elements are brushed aside or caricatured. This old-fashioned biopic trains its focus on Secretariats tough-minded owner Penny Chenery (Diane Lane). Lane is cool and steely as Chenery and speaks in platitudes. She spends a lot of time looking determined or cheering from the sidelines. But the origins of her dedication are tossed off in a flashback. We hear about her skills as an owner and her connection to the horse but we never see it. We see more of a bond between Secretariat and his groom (Nelsan Ellis). Chenery wins over her husband Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh) and her budding hippie daughter (Amanda Michalka). Playing a strong woman in a sexist era Lane has the most nuanced part. But thats mostly because the others are so one-dimensional. John Malkovich hams it up as trainer Lucien Laurin. As racing executive Ogden Phipps James Cromwell wears a continuous scowl. Seeing Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths to capture the Triple Crown makes a huge impression. Wallace repeatedly focuses on the horses right eye as if vast mysteries are contained within. Secretariat may be ready for his close-up but wed rather see him gallop.

Weinstein Company By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 8 2010 1201 a.m. ET In ""Nowhere Boy"" a modest and enjoyable account of the young John Lennon (who would have been 70 this week) the camera glances fleetingly at a small ""Strawberry Field"" sign in front of a Liverpool house. What would we have thought of Sam Taylor-Woods debut feature if the fruit of the sign had been blueberry or if the heros touchingly young band mate had been a kid named Peter instead of Paul? We might still have found her film to be modest and enjoyable albeit less resonant a coming-of-age drama about a gifted youngster caught in a no-boys land between a stern aunt who raises him and a loving mom whos too tormented to mother him. ""Nowhere Boy"" a movie that chronicles John Lennons life. More Yoko Ono on Nowhere Boy Aaron Johnson on Playing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy John is played by Aaron Johnson who makes him a strong presence and a credible one. You can imagine that Lennons prodigious outpouring of pop poetry--the movie ends before the Quarrymen became the Beatles--was beginning to form in the fertile mind of this likable 15-year-old with a cocky facade and a tender soul. The creative process is almost audible in a silent moment when John turns an adoring gaze on the curvaceous body of his first guitar. (The reliably fine shooter Seamus McGarvey did the cinematography.) The script adapted by Matt Greenhalgh from a memoir by Lennons half-sister Julia Baird is flagrantly Oedipal; almost every scene between John and his mother is sexually charged. The curse is taken off most of these encounters by Anne-Marie Duffs eloquent work in the mothers role--beautiful as a seductress in spite of herself affecting as a woman with a wild childs impulses. And ""Nowhere Boy"" which was directed by a woman gives another enviable role to the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas. Her Aunt Mimi isnt beautiful at least on the outside she buries her features beneath thick powder marches around in dowdy clothes and looks old beyond her years. When the time comes for truths to be told though Ms. Scott Thomas fires off volleys of passion that transform Mimi from a prim martinet into a powerfully loving influence in Johns life. ENLARGE Above right Ms. Scott Thomas and Sergi Lopez in Leaving. IFC Films Leaving Kristin Scott Thomas is the best though not the only reason to see ""Leaving."" Catherine Orsinis French-language drama starts with a departure that isnt what it seems to be. The actress looks exceedingly beautiful as Suzanne a doctors wife and devoted mother who once had her own career as a physical therapist. After 15 years of domesticity she hopes to revive her practice as soon as a builder finishes work on her home office. But shes taken out of her comfortable bourgeois life by the builder instead of the office (his name is Ivan and hes played by the excellent Spanish actor Sergi Lopez.) ""It hit me"" Suzanne tells her husband in an effort to explain her uncontrollable passion ""I didnt ask for it."" Nor did she ask for the trials that ensue. For a triangular tale with a familiar premise this compact feature which was written by the director with Gaelle Mace proves to be uncommonly interesting. (And beautifully photographed by Agnes Godard with long shots that tell more than most movies close-ups.) Suzannes folie damour slowly changes to a folly of another sort while her love for the hard-working Ivan comes up against chilling issues of class. Along the way Ms. Scott Thomas finds or creates lovely moments like the one when Suzanne tells Ivan teasingly that she wont leave his bed unless he tells her to then realizes to her quiet astonishment that she truly doesnt want to go. Life as We Know It Opposite singles who have a strong mutual dislike for each other are unexpectedly thrust together when their best friends die and the couple leaves their daughter 1 in their friends guardianship. In the wonderful world of tell-all trailers you dont have to see ""Life as We Know It"" to know what its about or how the story is worked out. As the website reveals--nay proclaims--Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have a first date from hell followed by the discovery that the friends who introduced them have died and left a will designating them as the ones to raise their baby daughter. If that sounds ever so slightly contrived you might be a candidate for the online excerpts. Turning on your computer costs a lot less than two tickets to a multiplex and you dont have to worry about gum on the floor. If you insist on investigating the big-screen version be forewarned that the charming co-stars--shes a gifted comedienne and hes skillful too--contend against coarse direction as well as the clanking machinery of the plot. The movie will surely find an audience since it speaks to young peoples anxieties about marriage and parenting. But what are two particularly engaging performers doing in a dump of a comedy like this? ENLARGE Diane Lane and John Malkovich in Secretariat. Disney Enterprises Secretariat More Why Malkovich Is Fun to Watch A family film about one of the fastest racehorses in history ""Secretariat"" stumbles along beneath the weight of leaden life lessons. Theyre dispensed at frequent intervals by Diane Lane who does better than anyone had a right to expect since she is saddled with dialogue of exceptional dreadfulness. Ms. Lane plays Penny Chenery the owner of the Triple Crown winner a Colorado housewife and mother who in the 1970s took over a Virginia stable from her ailing father. (John Malkovich dispenses some of his trademarked acting tricks as Lucien Laurin the horses French-Canadian trainer.) The lessons are feminist in a narrow sense though theyre meant to be broadly inspirational--never give up run your race to see how far you can run etc. etc. As if the script werent clumsy enough the movie even mangles a wordless moment when Penny seeks to inspire her hay burner by looking him in the eye. His eyes are dead while her barely suppressed desperation makes her look like a horse wheedler. Tamara Drewe A young newspaper writer returns to her hometown in the English countryside where her childhood home is being prepped for sale. ""Tamara Drewe"" makes a strong case for rhinoplasty and a stronger one for the pleasures of comedy. This bucolic frolic was directed with unflagging elan by Stephen Frears from a script with a layered lineage Moira Buffini adapted a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which was in its turn a contemporary riff on Thomas Hardys ""Far From the Madding Crowd."" The heroine of the title returns to the Wessex village of her birth with a cute new nose and newfound confidence to go with it. Once an ugly duckling known to the locals as Beaky she is now absurdly glamorous and given the unchained nature of her id extremely dangerous. (Its hard to visualize an outsize schnoz on Gemma Arterton the lovely actress who plays her but flashbacks to Tamaras childhood help.) The storys literary underpinnings are hilariously represented by the denizens of a seedy writers retreat situated near Tamaras old house which she has come back to reclaim after her mothers death. Some denizens are dazzled by her charms others are undone by them. I found myself rooting for Tamara to reconnect in the deepest way with handsome Andy her childhood friend--Luke Evans makes him a son of the soil who would have had Hardys vote--and I was shocked by her home-wrecking exploits with a fatuous scrivener though her heedlessness is exactly the point. The scintillating cast includes Roger Allam Bill Camp and Tamsin Greig. Dominic Cooper is a fatuous rock star and Jessica Barden is a wondrously funny teenager and slatternly deus ex machina who adores him. A dog named Boss--the credits say hes played by Albert Clark so make of that what you will--has the dubious distinction of turning a placid herd of Belted Galloway cows into killers. Inside Job If Charles Fergusons polemic documentary were merely depressing it could take its place alongside the dreariest of downer dramas from Bulgaria or the former East Germany. But ""Inside Job"" has the added value as well as the cold comfort of being furiously interesting and hugely infuriating. Its a scathing examination of the global economic meltdown that began more than two years ago and continues to affect our lives. Takes a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown in the movie ""Inside Job."" Extremely cold comfort can be taken from the case that serves as an introduction. ""There is nobody unaffected in Iceland"" we are told. Well before 2008 that small island nation privatized its banks; then economists paid by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce wrote reports that praised the perilously fragile banking system. But no nation is an island these days. Cataclysmic events that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG sent concentric tsunamis around the globe and the film reserves special fury for its contention that ""this crisis was not an accident--it was caused by an out-of-control financial sector."" (Mr. Fergusons co-writers were Chad Beck and Adam Bolt. Matt Damon delivers the narration with seething calm.) As circumstantial evidence ""Inside Job"" puts the toys of that sectors beneficiaries on display--the private jets the horses the houses and yachts--and lays out some of the astronomical salaries theyve received as rewards for failure as well as success. But Mr. Ferguson also provides historical context for his provocations--the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s the steady march of deregulation the advent of exotic derivatives. Iceland isnt the only place where the film contends the financial industry ""has corrupted the study of economics itself."" Among others interviewed on the subject Glenn Hubbard dean of Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Business is unresponsive and visibly shaken during a withering interrogation about his connections to financial-services firms. And the Obama administration gets as much of a drubbing as any other ""Its a Wall Street government"" a former president of the Greenlining Institute says. ""Its status quo."" After seeing ""Inside Job"" you dont have to be a tea partier to feel the anger thats sweeping the land. Its Kind of a Funny Story A clinically depressed teenager gets a new start after he checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward in the movie ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" Think of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin and youve got a slight sense of ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" The film itself is fairly slight Im not sure what it adds up to. Still I enjoyed every moment of its beguiling saga of a depressed teen named Craig who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up in an adult psychiatric ward full of wouldnt you know it screwy people. The directors were Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; they adapted the screenplay from Ned Vizzinis young-adult novel. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile. Of the patients he meets the most appealing is Noelle (Emma Roberts) and the most mysterious--and funny surprising and touching--is Bobby whos played with sensational verve by Zach Galifianakis. From time to time theres a bit of Mickey and Judy putting on mental illness; these arent tragic figures and arent meant to be. But Craig eventually comes to a useful understanding of where he belongs in the spectrum of human suffering. Id like to think of this graceful little movie as a fantasy about empathy as therapy.

"Movie review Secretariat - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review SecretariatDisneys movie about the Triple Crown winner and his plucky owner is an unabashedly sentimental family film.October 08 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic As the Walt Disney Pictures enchanted castle logo unerringly indicates ""Secretariat"" is a fairy tale about a horse. If youre in the mood for it and in the mood for a strong and satisfying performance by Diane Lane youre definitely in the right place. Though the movie is based on the exploits of arguably the greatest horse who ever lived a thoroughbred of whom it was truly said ""his only reference is himself"" ""Secretariat"" is hardly the place to look for a thoroughly factual account of the events in William Nacks book of the same name. For not only do ""Secretariats"" credits say it was merely ""suggested by"" Nacks work rather than the customary ""based on"" but one of director Randall Wallaces favorite sayings is ""Lets not let the facts get in the way of truth."" Nuff said. In telling the story of the riches-to-riches story of the 1973 Triple Crown winner ""Secretariat"" shows no fear of the sentimental and thats putting it mildly. This is an old-fashioned super-genteel family movie that opens with an equine quote from the Book of Job and makes ample use of the Edwin Hawkins Singers gospel song ""Oh Happy Day."" With a film like this moments of emotion-run-amok excessiveness are inevitable but a trio of interlocking factors keep the winces at a minimum and stop the film from going too far off the rails. Number one it always helps to have a good story and though Secretariat was never the underdog Seabiscuit was his triumphs made him visible enough to make the cover of both Time and Newsweek and to become in Nacks words ""a cultural phenomenon a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of Watergate and the Vietnam war."" Though Wallace who wrote the Oscar-winning ""Braveheart"" is clearly bullish on unapologetic emotion at least equal credit should be given to screenwriter Mike Rich whose work on both ""The Rookie"" and ""Miracle"" (about the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team) reveals a genuine touch for stirring sports dramas that need to be feelingly told without getting out of hand. The third and likely most significant factor in the success of ""Secretariat"" is Diane Lanes crucial performance as Penny Chenery who owned the horse and was a trailblazer in a male-dominated world that was unapologetically unfriendly to women with power. Because Secretariat did not face serious challenges once he hit his Triple Crown stride the obstacles no film can do without had to be in the human arena. That meant a focus on Chenery having to prove herself to her brother her husband and her children as well as to the racing elite confrontations that give the film an unexpected Hollywood feminism slant that will likely not hurt at the box office. Oscar-nominated for ""Unfaithful"" Lane has been a familiar and welcome face to moviegoers since her 1979 debut in ""A Little Romance."" She is an actress with an instinct for honesty someone incapable of false moves and her restrained focused performance as Chenery is a graceful stabilizing force here. In an unashamed movie that cant resist pushing too hard having someone who pulls things back toward reality is more than welcome a its essential. Lanes character is introduced as a classic suburban Denver housewife circa 1969 her life dedicated to her husband Jack (Dylan Walsh) and their four children. Then she gets a phone call that causes her to drop and break a kitchen bowl (yes its that kind of a movie). Her mother has died and she has to go back to her childhood home Meadow Farm near Doswell Va. for the funeral. Not only is her mother dead but her father Chris (an always welcome Scott Glenn) is ailing and the future of his racing stable is in jeopardy. Unwilling to let it be sold Penny Chenery says she will hang out ""for a few days"" to try and pull things together. It turns out no surprise that Chenery is her fathers daughter a tough savvy individual who knows a ton about horses. With the help of her fathers secretary Miss Ham ( Margo Martindale) his friend Bull Hancock ( Fred Dalton Thompson) and kindly groom Eddie Sweat ( Nelsan Ellis) she starts to pull things together. Helping considerably is an enormous piece of good luck. As the result of a coin toss (which she loses) with the wealthy Ogden Phipps ( James Cromwell) Chenery gets ownership of one of two colts sired by the great Bold Ruler. That noble youngster known to intimates as Big Red is the future Secretariat. Chenery also persuades reluctant trainer Lucien Laurin (predictably eccentric John Malkovich) to take on the horse and feisty jockey Ron Turcotte (real-life jock Otto Thorwarth) to ride him. All the while trying to manage choppy relationships with her husband her peacenik daughter (AJ Michalka) and even her stumbling-block brother ( Dylan Baker). What saves her and the movie are those Triple Crown races that Secretariat dominated in historic style. With veteran cinematographer Dean Semler behind the camera when those pounding hoofs come flying down the track its hard not to be happy that you are there to watch them fly. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWorking Hollywood Lisa Brown keeps Secretariat a all of...October 17 2010Word of Mouth Disneys betting on SecretariatOctober 7 2010Secretariats missing character Angle LightOctober 3 2010Secretariat plays odds with uplifting winning messageOctober 3 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentSecretariatPenny CheneryTriple CrownCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secretariat-20101008,0,1131452.story",200,secretariat15,secretariat,latimes

(Bramley/Disney) Joe Neumaier Thursday October 7 2010 858 AM Title Secretariat As a kind of Son of ""Seabiscuit"" Randall Wallaces ""Secretariat"" knows which beats to hit come-from-behind winner historical setting colorful characters -- check check check. Sounds potentially yawn-inducing and yet this slightly glazed drama is aiming for family audiences and that ought to help it at the starting gate.Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) has no idea she has a future winner on her hands when she inherits her late fathers Virginia horse ranch. Leaving her husband (Dylan Walsh) in Denver while she tends to business Penny clashes with her skeptical brother (Dylan Baker) as she plans on racing a horse bred from a strong sire but weaker broodmare.That chestnut-red horse eventually named Secretariat comes to mean something special to Penny and Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) the colorful but down-on-his-heels trainer chosen by Chenery to guide Secretariat to victory. After a disappointing event at the Aqueduct the underdog equine takes charge and eventually winds up in the winners circle at the Kentucky Derby the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes in 1973 becoming the first Triple Crown winner in a quarter-century.Theres not much more to the movie than that though Wallace layers on some era-specific meaning to Chenery who seems to be simply following her lineage thanks to Lanes quietly dignified performance. Malkovich is more fun though Laurin isnt as outrageous as the movie thinks he is. None of which kills the thrill of the re-enacted races or the professionalism of all involved. But it does give you a feeling like youve simply been put through your paces.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In ""Secretariat Diane Lane plays Penny Chenery. She wears three-quarter-length skirts and a kind of bouffant. Her colors are carnation Tiffany and mother of pearl. The movie is set in 1972 and 1973 but the embalming tradition of money and the recessive legacy of housewifery have made her look like a pitchwoman for cake mixes or Studebakers. The achievement of both the movie and what Lane does with the part is that its all bait to write her off as a sufferer a role that Lane due to bad movies and the bad men in them knows too well. Not this time.Lane dominates ""Secretariat with nothing more than confident poise. She often props her face on her hand but every time we see her do it the pose exudes something different thought sadness astonishment. After her mother dies and her father (Scott Glenn) falls into a vegetative state Chenery decides to take over her daddys New Rochelle farm which includes a handful of champion horses in particular a mare that spawns a colt later named Secretariat.By nearly every standard ""Secretariat is a small conventional movie. If you know the tale of Chenerys great American thoroughbred and the movies eponym its even predictable. But the film is happy proof of what care polish and some modest humor can do for a tired-seeming entertainment. This is a sports drama and that being the case it has been presented to us -- by Walt Disney Pictures no less -- as an occasion for uplift.Falling for the factual bottom-line of these movies is easy. All those scrappy football teams did win national championships. Of course USA upset the Russian mens hockey team at the 1980 Olympics. And is Sandra Bullock nice or what? Record books make good screenwriters. The writer for ""Secretariat is Mike Rich. Rich took the story from a book by William Nack who covered the horses run for Newsday and while adjusting several facts extracts a surprising argument.The uplift doesnt stem from the horse per se -- we dont see a race for an hour -- but from a smart idea. Chenery knows what shes doing. She fires her fathers opportunistic trainer keeps his groomer Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) retains his secretary Elizabeth Ham (Margo Martindale) and hires a new reluctant trainer an irascible French-Canadian named Lucien Laurin played by John Malkovich. When the horse loses one race Chenery fires the jockey and brings on a better one Ron Turcotte (the champion jockey Otto Thorwarth). Shes the CEO of a startup.In the eyes of most of the men Chenery encounters she actually is a cake-mix girl. When Chenerys uptight Harvard professor brother (Dylan Baker) dismisses her as a housewife Lane devises a nasty face for him. Her husband (Dylan Walsh) chafes at her use of her maiden name instead of his surname (its Tweedy). But really he seems secretly miffed that hes stuck doing his wifes chores and worse that two of their perfect children -- the teenage girls -- have become hippies whose desire to run off to Chile suggests premonitions of political coup. Chenery is cultured and progressive and sophisticated. But the movie suggests shes still a transitional figure between whoever her mother was (we dont learn much) and whoever her daughters will become. When the more outspoken girl Kate (AJ Michalka) talks politics at the dinner table Chenerys response is ""Would anyone like some pie?The 1960s and 1970s housewife differed from her 1940s and 1950s counterparts. Feminism had chased the cultural glamour out of the role. By the end of the 1960s there were too many examples of what else a woman could or -- according to some feminists -- should be. Its the formidable Ham who gives the horse its racing name (shes Robin to Chenerys Batman in barrier-bending) and its a class and gender subversion that the movie allows to stand for itself a stud named for a pool of proletariat typists.Politics here are all implied. Eddie Sweat is the movies lone black character and hes portrayed as slightly touched. But when the horse wins the Kentucky Derby a black arm reaches into the frame to congratulate him. The shot lasts two seconds but its touching in its pridefulness.""Secretariat doesnt have the panoramic ambit of say ""Seabiscuit which used its champion horse to hang a loving frame around the 1930s. That movie was going for a thematic girth that would look foolish here particularly in the wide world of sports. How do you use this highlight to draw conclusions about the 1970s when you also have the Fight of the Century the Munich Olympics and the Battle of the Sexes?""Secretariat opts instead for a more modest scale. Its overly familiar but its also more manageable. Lucien Laurin appears to have dressed himself by staring at his TVs test pattern and the movie embraces the energy of all his clashing colors. The races have the pounding force of thunder and the jolting immediacy of lightning. The director Randall Wallace and his crew including the cinematographer Dean Semler find clever ways to upend the many cliches of this sort of movie. One of them is to affix digital cameras to the horses or to shoot them in thrilling proximity. Its a strategy that recalibrates whats important about the races which is not the outcome but the intense physicality of these animals. A second viewing or a passing knowledge of Secretariats success fails to diminish their power.The standard victory montage is not a collection of images but a single shot of the horse crossing a finish line in the slowest of motion while audio commentary of the wins is pared down to snippets. Thats glorious ingenuity -- all the better for setting it to the Staples Singers ""Ill Take You There.Suspense accompanies each Triple Crown race which the movie packs into the final 30 minutes without cramming them in. That also qualifies as an achievement. But again and again I thought about the softer more emotional action in the films of Douglas Sirk while I watched ""Secretariat. Sirk made lusciously tragic melodramas in the 50s with stars like Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson and if some of the framing lighting and close-ups here fail to achieve Sirks cinematic holiness even the faintest echoes carry a kind of beauty.Wallace also wrote the screenplay for ""Braveheart and ""Pearl Harbor so that might be as far out on a limb as Im willing to go. But grace is grace and however it arrives theres no denying its presence. So when Lane who is Jane Wyman spared all the pain walks up to the horse grabs a lathered sponge and helps wash its hide its an eloquent moment. Thats partly because the Edwin Hawkins Singers gospel chestnut ""Oh Happy Day is on the soundtrack. But its quite a moving sight a CEO bonding legally with her best employee.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

She plays the stallions owner he its trainer.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 08 2010Secretariat an equine Chariots of Fire is the true-life tale of the mighty chestnut stallion known to intimates as Big Red.The makers of Secretariat present him as a sacred figure born in a stable and destined to inspire men.Like the horse in the Book of Job Big Red swallows the ground with fierceness and rage. And in this movie with a gospel-inflected score (""Oh Happy Day"") when the horse meets the bottomless gaze of his owner the chestnut returns it with peace and infinite patience.A workmanlike sports inspirational boasting a potent performance from Diane Lane Secretariat harnesses womanpower to horsepower for galvanic effect. Director Randall Wallace (Braveheart scribe) and writer Mike Rich (The Nativity Story The Rookie) deliver a mostly true story about a woman and her horse who both stand their ground.Lane plays Penny Chenery Denver homemaker mother of four and daughter of a Virginia horse breeder. In 1969 when her mother dies and her fathers mind is clouded by dementia Penny shuttles between Colorado and Virginia striving to keep the family together and the family business from coming apart.Her brother wants to liquidate Dads stud farm. Very much her fathers daughter Penny runs her own race. She has the temerity to suggest that a thoroughbreds dam is as important as its sire and guesses how best to produce a horse that has both stamina and speed.Serially patronized by the farm manager horse trainers her husband and her brother Penny stands up to each seeming to grow in height after each confrontation. Pennys only support comes from Miss Ham (reliable Margo Martindale) her fathers secretary.Lane often the romantic with the downcast eyes leads with upthrust chin and fierce eloquence. As in Braveheart there are many rousing monologues in this speechy movie. Both as the businesswoman who believes a womans place is in the Winners Circle and as the mother crushed that she missed her daughters recital Lane is charismatic and credible.The filmmakers present Penny and Big Red (played by five horses including Trolley Boy winner of the 2008 Secretariat Look-a-Like Contest) as cosmic twins forces of nature who will not be denied.The result if occasionally forced is also irresistible especially in racing sequences shot from the jockeys perspective as if by SaddleCam. Speaking of jockeys real-life horseman Otto Thorwarth is excellent as jockey Ron Turcotte.Wallace is a director of moments not of cohesive wholes. His movie is a parade of confrontations punctuated by a thrilling race. Apart from Lane and Thorwarth actingwise the movie is a pageant of undistinguished performances by distinguished actors such as John Malkovich (as clownish horse-trainer Lucien Laurin) Fred Dalton Thompson (as improbably named breeder Bull Hancock) and Scott Glenn (as Pennys father).While I like how Lane wears Pennys period sheaths and riding clothes Im puzzled by Bulls description of Luciens getups circa 1969 ""He dresses like Superfly."" 1) He doesnt. 2) Superfly the one about the pimped-out drug dealer wasnt released until 1972.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Share Tweet Toward the end of Secretariat an equine biopic about the famed racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1973 Secretariats trainer an eccentric French-Canadian played by John Malkovich makes a stunning admission. For all his years of experience and in spite of the victories hes enjoyed he doesnt really understand how horses think. Along with a few close-ups of horses eyes looking as if they could belong as easily to feral beasts as domestic animals its a rare mysterious moment in a film otherwise too concerned with smoothing out Secretariats story to fit a family-friendly underdog sports narrative. Theres adversity triumph and lessons learned on the way to a happy ending. And upbeat scenes set to stirring era-appropriate songs? Do you even have to ask? Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers) directs from a script by Mike Rich who also penned Radio Finding Forrester and The Rookie. Only the lattermost landed on the right side of the divide between inspiring and corny. Secretariat walks it with fine performances from Malkovich and Diane Lane helping to keep the balance. Lane plays Penny Chenery the daughter of a horse-breeder living as the film opens the busy life of a full-time mother of four. When her mother dies leaving a dementia-stricken father behind Lane returns to her Virginia home. Her arrival coincides with a downturn in her familys finances and the arrival of a colt quickly dubbed Big Red an animal whose racing potential is apparent almost from the moment of his birth. But potential and success arent one and the same and Lane--with the assistance of Malkovich and a few others devoted to the red colt soon to be renamed Secretariat--finds her time monopolized by tending to the animals training particularly once her familys fortune becomes wrapped up in his success. Lane gives her character depths the rest of the film never achieves. Though it makes some Seabiscuit-like attempts to place Secretariats story in the context of the times they feel like an afterthought. We know Lanes Marcia Brady-sunny daughter is committed to protesting the Vietnam War because she mentions it with virtually every line. And while the light sprinkling of feminism gives the film some added flavor it doesnt really need the moment when Lanes husband tells her shes taught their children ""what a real woman is."" As a complex tale simply told it works well enough though Wallace doesnt really try to create anything beyond a routine crowd-pleaser and the moments that might have helped transcend formula--particularly the racing scenes--are merely workmanlike.

Secretariat Fair to Good Director Randall Wallace. Cast Diane Lane John Malkovich Scott Glenn. Rating PG for brief mild language. Films with animal stars Historical figures in film Why? For one thing the horse of the title the magnificent horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 remains all these years later a transcendent sports figure. America loves a winner and no one won like Secretariat. Thus theres a certain lack of suspense going in with director Randall Wallaces film but hes able to overcome it by playing up some of the maybe-forgotten details (a mysterious downturn in Secretariats performance right before the Kentucky Derby for instance). But the movie is also helped greatly by a get-in-there-and-plug-away performance from Diane Lane who plays the horses owner Penny Chenery. The film focuses on Chenery which sounds kind of like making a movie about Michael Jordan and focusing on Jerry Reinsdorf (if you dont know who that is my point is proved). But it turns out there was plenty of against-the-odds drama going on with Chenerys life as well. Nothing we havent seen a thousand times before - the struggle to balance a demanding business with raising a family a woman in a mans world that sort of thing - but Lane does what she can with the story. Granted its hard to feel too sympathetic for someone so obviously wealthy but Lane certainly makes you root for her to succeed. And you arent going to find anyone rooting against Secretariat. Chenery and her husband are raising a family in Denver when her ailing father (Scott Glenn looking like hes 100) finally dies. His horse farm in Virginia has struggled for years. Chenerys brother Hollis (the always-enjoyable Dylan Baker) wants to sell it and her husband (Dylan Walsh) wants her at home more often but Penny wont hear of it. She places her hopes on a foal she won in a coin flip (she actually loses the toss but winds up with the horse she and no one else wanted). The horse is a miracle from birth standing on its own legs more quickly than any horse loyal groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) has ever seen. Chenery again going against conventional wisdom hires the somewhat-gone-to-seed Lucien Laurin (James Malkovich overplaying the role but having such an obviously good time doing so its hard to hold it against him) to train the horse called Big Red. But hell need a racing name; longtime family aide Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) provides one Secretariat. We know what happens next. Wallace does what he can to build tension a game effort in a story involving the greatest race horse who ever lived. Chenery shows both courage and restraint in press conferences where shes repeatedly belittled by the owner of Secretariats closest rival played as an absolute pig of a man by Nestor Serrano. Victories all around in other words. But Secretariat was such a commanding presence the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years a Time magazine coverboy the focus of the publics imagination during his pursuit that any excuse to relive that excitement is worthwhile and ""Secretariat"" gives us one.

Comments Secretariat Rated PG  123 minutes  2010 Like Natalie Wood actress Diane Lane inhabits roles with the naturalness of someone whos spent nearly a lifetime in front of the camera and shes the bedrock of this inspirational sports story from Disney. She plays Penny Chenery the Denver housewife and mother who rescued her fathers Virginia horse farm and raised Secretariat the legendary 1973 winner of the Triple Crown. Instinctive resourceful and stubborn Chenery hires a burned-out trainer (John Malkovich) to help turn the spirited colt into a champion. The period details are so exact theyre occasionally distracting the use of gospel music at the end is questionable and director Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers) shows a surer hand in the track sequences than the domestic scenes. Still theres no denying this movie has heart.

"No surprises in by-the-numbers Secretariat - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs No surprises in by-the-numbers SecretariatSecretariat a 2 starsOctober 07 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThere is no suspense in ""Secretariat."" This is the one thing Disneys new picture has in common with ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Titanic."" We know the outcome. Studios rarely back movies about horses that place or show. The animal that loved to preen for the cameras made all the magazine covers in 1973 after running away with the Triple Crown though in the 73 Kentucky Derby Secretariat was back by nine lengths before finishing like a champ. With the facts of his triumph widely known and his symbolic rebuke to Watergate-era cynicism so happily evident the challenge faced by the makers of Disneys ""Secretariat"" is clear. Can triumphal heart and soul carry the day? Certainly director Randall Wallaces picture boasts a skilled onscreen labor force. Diane Lane stars as the horses owner Penny Chenery Tweedy a Denver wife and mother who won the future champ in a coin toss and who took over the Virginia horse farm owned by her dying father ( Scott Glenn). John Malkovich lets his golf outfits do the talking in the role of the eccentric trainer Lucien Laurin no less exotic a figure to the old money horsey-set atmosphere Penny must learn to negotiate. As scripted by Mike Rich and revised by Wallace essentially this is ""The Blind Side"" with a quadruped. The busy wife and mother whose rebellious teenage daughter Kate (Disney Channel alum AJ Michalka) is a chip off the old block may be changing that horses life but hes also changing hers. Husband Jack (Dylan Walsh) may object to all the time shes spending taking care of business and brother Hollis ( Dylan Baker) may contest some of those business decisions regarding the farm. But little occurs in ""Secretariat"" in ways suggesting complicated human interaction or even complicated human/equestrian interaction. Its a shame Lane in particular is fully up to the task of portraying a three-dimensional character caught up in history in the making. The film works best in the scenes between Lane and Margo Martindale (as Miss Ham Pennys longtime personal assistant). In their scenes the actresses see to it that more than mere dramatic points are being scored. The rest of the film hits its marks and moves on to the next race designed to qualify for the audiences love. Its tricky this idea of a movie featuring a horse burdened with symbolism and charged with brightening an entire nations mood. ""Seabiscuit"" carried that burden rather better (at twice the budget spent on depicting the prettiest little Depression you ever saw). From my lifetime the horse movie I cherish remains Carroll Ballards ""The Black Stallion"" (1979) which is truly special truly inspirational truly cinematic. ""Secretariat"" isnt bad but its precisely what youd expect. The story belongs to Penny. The horse has to fight for his fair share of screen time which is another thing the movie has in common with ""The Blind Side"" The alleged subject of the film has been sidelined so that a good actress can strut her stuff. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for brief mild language) Cast Diane Lane (Penny Chenery Tweedy); John Malkovich (Lucien Laurin); Dylan Walsh (Jack Tweedy); Dylan Baker (Hollis Chenery); Margo Martindale (Miss Ham); Otto Thorwarth (Ronnie Turcotte); Fred Dalton Thompson (Bull Hancock); James Cromwell (Ogden Phipps); Scott Glenn (Chris Chenery) Credits Directed by Randall Wallace; written by Mike Rich suggested by the book ""Secretariat The Making of a Champion"" by William Nack; produced by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray.

"Secretariat | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; secretariat ) Secretariat (United States 2010) October 06 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Secretariat joins Disneys pantheon of sports movies about underdogs that defy odds and become champions. Of all the movies in this group (which includes Remember the Titans The Rookie Invincible and Miracle) this is the least effective in large part because its more difficult to dramatize the rise to prominence of a character without speech. So instead of giving the title horse a voice and calling him Mr. Red the producers decide instead to focus on Secretariats owner Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) which allows the script to drown in numerous clichA(c)s. The racing sequences are effectively done and Secretariats quest for horse racings Triple Crown concludes with one of those stand-up-and-cheer moments but the story as a whole seems stale and overly familiar. Secretariat sticks to the facts albeit in a Disneyfied manner meaning that bits and pieces of the horses story are cherry-picked to fit the ""family entertainment"" aspect of the feature. Secretariat one of horse racings greatest champions won the Triple Crown in 1973 so a movie about the animals exploits is perhaps overdue. Sadly this mediocre effort doesnt do the horse or his achievements justice. The problems are twofold a lack of focus and the need to force all elements of the story into a clearly delineated formula. It makes for humdrum movie viewing and demonstrates the superior talent and craftsmanship that went into 2003s Sea Biscuit. The film follows the efforts of Penny Chenery to develop Secretariat into the champion he would become while at the same time steadfastly refusing to sell him to pay off the massive estate tax that arises from the death of her father (Scott Glenn). To train Secretariat she hires the stubborn and unconventional Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) who uses this opportunity to reverse his reputation as a loser. For a jockey she brings aboard Ron Turcotte (Otto Thorwath) who puts as much into his races as he demands from his steeds. Her ally is Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell) one of 32 rich individuals to have bought the syndicated breeding rights to Secretariat - provided the animal can perform on the track. The villain of the piece is Pancho Martin (Nestor Serrano) the owner of Secretariats chief nemesis in all three Triple Crown races. Had Secretariat concentrated more on the races and the minutia surrounding them the results might have been more successful. Instead however the movie attempts to tell the individual stories of two significant characters (Penny and Lucien) and several minor ones. By fragmenting its focus and diluting its attention the subdivided narrative never takes off except during the racing scenes. Pennys life is mundane. Secretariat re-invigorates her but drives a wedge between her and her husband John (Dylan Walsh) who would prefer for her to stay at home and care for the kids. The horse brings her closer to her oldest daughter however who like her mother is out ""doing her thing"" and following her dream (in this case protesting against the Vietnam War). Lucien meanwhile is the stereotyped flawed genius who finds a chance at redemption through his training of an eventual Triple Crown winner. Its all predictable and obvious and director Randall Wallace brings it to the screen in a by-the-numbers manner. Secretariat has an A-list cast although no one gives an A-list performance. Thats not to say the acting is bad but there are no standouts. Diane Lane dressed in period garb with a period hairdo and a halo to match is the perfect example of a self-sufficient middle-aged woman who is determined to make her mark in the world. John Malkovich brings a certain offbeat flair to Lucien but thats his trademark and he has a lot more fun in another current outing Red. Solid support comes from veterans Scott Glenn Fred Dalton Thomas Margo Martindale and James Cromwell. The horse (actually several horses) is the real star but youd never know it. The movie doesnt do much to develop him into more than an icon-in-the-making. (Although I suppose there are limits with what one can do with a horse of course of course.) Fans of horse racing will likely be less than impressed with this bland treatment of one of the greatest participants of the sport. The film may work best for those who have no idea who Secretariat is and judging by the target audiences age that may be a significant portion of those who see Secretariat. This is generic movie-making. There are enough high points to keep it from being discarded out-of-hand but not sufficient consistency to warrant anything more than a reluctant and lukewarm recommendation.

Otto Thorwarth and Nelsan Ellis help make racing history in Secretariat (John Bramley) B- Secretariat Genre Sports Drama; Starring Diane Lane James Cromwell John Malkovich; Director Randall Wallace; Author Mike Rich; Release Date Wide 10/08/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 116; Distributor Walt Disney Company Posted October 8 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Moviegoers have grown increasingly intense about avoiding ""spoilers"" (probably because of all the information that spills out of the Internet). In that light Secretariat a benignly inspirational Disney sports drama about the legendary racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1973 offers a fascinating test case for how much spoilers sometimes dont matter. Going into the movie we absolutely know that Secretariat the chestnut Thoroughbred who galloped to triumph through a rare combination of total speed and maximum stamina will win his three big races (the first time a horse had done so in 25 years). Yet there he is in his famous blue-and-white blinker hood pounding the track at the Kentucky Derby starting way in the back (as was his style) then overtaking one horse after another the camera following right on his hooves. And damned if at that moment we arent as excited as children our hearts in our throats as he thunders to victory almost as if we had no idea what was coming. When Secretariat is running his races the movie has a hokey old-fashioned appeal. It uses a fantastic gospel anthem to stoke our feelings the Edwin Hawkins Singers 1969 rendition of ""Oh Happy Day."" And that song with its funky-sublime syncopation its waves of lordly joy makes us feel that yes Secretariat really was a miracle horse a competitor graced by Someone Up There. Off the racetrack however Secretariat is a sketchy and rather innocuously upbeat movie. The director Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers) often seems to be aiming for the same Christian demographic that helped make a hit out of The Blind Side. I personally have no objection to a horse film that views a creature as magnificent as Secretariat with religious awe but in this case the uplift has a downside. The film is so insistently square it undercuts the very drama its out to capture. The central figure Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) is a housewife who knew nothing about running a horse farm when she took over the management of her ailing fathers Meadow Stables in Virginia. Penny wins Secretariat in a coin toss (though the film suggests its her womanly vantage that leads her to foresee how the horses bloodlines will give him racing strength). Its a pleasure to see her take charge fighting her way up in a racehorse world thick with the corruptions of men. Lane wearing Pat Nixons hair makes Penny devoutly traditional but never prim; it doesnt scare her that shes in over her head. She recruits the eccentric trainer Lucien Laurin played by John Malkovich and the actor wearing crazy hats and spouting French whenever he gets angry makes us feel his horse fervor. Penny in her devotion to Secretariats racing career tears her family life apart. Yet this central conflict comes to very little. (Dylan Walsh plays her husband with just enough mild testiness to make you wish hed shown more.) Pennys obsession remains flawless noble benevolent. The only real drama is that (spoiler) Secretariat occasionally loses. As long as hes winning though this pleasantly rote movie will rouse you.

Hes Secretariat Wednesday October 6 2010 at 4 a.m. By Nick Schager 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Horses make lousy protagonists what with their inability to speak emote or do much of anything but run or stand around. No surprise then that Secretariat employs its subject as merely a vehicle for a human-victory-over-adversity story which in this based-on-real-events case involves owner Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) triumphing against the chauvinistic ""old boys""--and in the process setting a proto-feminist example for her hippie daughter--by leading Secretariat to Triple Crown glory. Sexism and classism are the twin hurdles leaped by feisty Penny and her plaid-hat-wearing trainer Lucien Laurin (a hammy John Malkovich). Along the way director Randall Wallace goes overboard with mawkish deification The stallion makes his intro in slow motion set to narration about the biblical tale of Job is later visualized emerging from roiling storm clouds like a divine steed and is exalted by Malkovich with the trailer-ready proclamation ""Hes not a horse. Hes Secretariat"" As befitting a Disney period-piece sports drama cutaways to sunset horizons are plentiful and social issues of the day are glibly addressed via hoary platitudes. At least the formulaic race footage itself is vigorous; the schmaltzy mythmaking script on the other hand deserves a one-way trip to the glue factory.

Americas greatest racehorse was no underdog a fact that gives ""Secretariat"" an unexpected edge among inspirational sports dramas. Starring Diane Lane as Penny Chenery proud owner of the chestnut-colored colt that broke all records to win the 1973 Triple Crown this conventional but rousingly effective picture pulls through its occasional faltering stretches by focusing on the essentials of its incredible real-life saga even if the details have been massaged for maximum uplift. With proper nurturing Disney release could muster impressive B.O. stamina catering to the audiences that made ""The Blind Side"" a heartland hit. If Mike Richs screenplay presents a simplified version of events its often gratifyingly tough-minded in its depiction of the often ruthless imperatives of the racing world. William Nacks account of the saga (which gets a ""suggested by"" credit here) was pointedly titled ""Secretariat The Making of a Champion"" and Chenery and her team are indeed portrayed here as fiercely committed individuals who all but willed a winner into existence. Married to lawyer Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh) with four children Denver housewife Penny (Lane) is shaken out of her domestic routine by her mothers death which has left the Chenerys Virginia farm in the hands of Pennys sickly father (Scott Glenn). In a series of scenes accompanied by too many funereal violins Penny decides not to sell the farm hoping to keep the Chenery stables open by breeding a champion. Her efforts are presented with a wealth of detail that will please horse enthusiasts and enlighten others the most fascinating of which is the formal coin toss between Penny and rival breeder Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell) to determine the first pick of two foals produced by Phipps stallion. Phipps wins the toss but Penny gets the better horse a natural-born runner christened Secretariat by the Chenerys faithful assistant Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) and looked after by devoted groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis). Penny also seeks help from two brilliant but down-on-their-luck horsemen trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich delightfully cantankerous) whose fashion sense is as flamboyant as his temper and Ronnie Turcotte a stubbornly persistent jockey and future Hall of Famer (played by real-life rider Otto Thorwarth in his acting debut). Penny Lucien and Ronnie form a sort of equestrian trinity and the sharp unsentimental insight of ""Secretariat"" is that while luck certainly plays its part a winning thoroughbred is by and large a feat of human engineering the best genetic match and the right combination of caretakers. At the same time the film cant resist turning these majestic creatures into objects of worship making liberal use of ""Oh Happy Day"" and having Lane quote the book of Job in voiceover (none of which will hurt the films popularity with the Christian market). Rich and director Randall Wallace (""The Man in the Iron Mask"" ""We Were Soldiers"") have the challenge of wringing drama and excitement from a story whose outcome is never in doubt and whose title character demonstrates superb consistency on the racetrack. They manage by effectively modulating the buildup to each race and finding fresh ways to cover similar events especially when Secretariat must run the Kentucky Derby the Preakness Stakes and the climactic 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes in quick succession (of the Triple Crown tracks only Churchill Downs was used in the production which was lensed in Kentucky and Louisiana). Pics most obvious and immediate forerunner is ""Seabiscuit"" (2003) which turned a little horse that could into a symbol of Americas indomitable spirit during the Great Depression. Though it boasts less in the way of production polish ""Secretariat"" spins the more satisfying yarn allowing its story to stand on its own without straining for metaphorical significance or faux gravitas. Gently if unmistakably feminist in its account of a lady who classily showed up a male-dominated arena the film is on less secure footing in its treatment of Pennys increasingly strained family life. Scripts attempts to flesh out the politics of the era -- largely through Pennys hippie daughter Kate (AJ Michalka) whose anti-Vietnam activism unsubtly mirrors her mothers own passionate cause -- yield a few clunky scenes that play like outtakes from ""The Brady Bunch."" Elaborately coiffed (if not always flatteringly lit) Lane projects the combo of homespun warmth and steely determination that has always been intrinsic to her screen appeal. Of the sterling supporting thesps Cromwell is a subtle standout as the breeding vet who regards Penny with both annoyance and admiration. Exciting race sequences made use of a small digital camera for closeup saddle shots and the lower-grade video footage stands in noticeable contrast with Dean Semlers HD lensing giving the picture a visual roughness thats not inappropriate to its subject.

Daily Edition Login to download Secretariat -- Film Review 132 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An engaging sports movie about the greatest racehorse ever and his female owner who literally bets the farm on his supremacy. TWITTER Mayhem Pictures and its producer/partners Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray have successfully hit upon a formula for making inspiring sports movies and ""Secretariat"" the story of the worlds greatest racehorse is no exception. Written by Mike Rich who wrote ""The Rookie"" and ""Miracle"" for Mayhem the film manages to find a way around the seeming disadvantage of making a movie about a horse likely to win every race. Rich and director Randall Wallace do so by focusing not on its eponymous hero but on his female owner. The film thus takes on a feminist tone as a Denver housewife (well-played by Diane Lane) goes up against the old boys who dominate horse racing. Consequently ""Secretariat"" might be one sports movie that draws a significant share of female viewers. The film looks primed for a decent theatrical payoff for Disney especially with older viewers and the ""faith-based"" audience Disney has courted online. The film should be a solid performer on all TV platforms and home video. In a career spanning only 16 months Secretariat became a true legend. Altogether the deep-chested muscular chestnut stallion won 16 of his 21 career races with three seconds and one third for in-the-money finishes in 20-of-21 starts. So this movie definitely is not about an improbable underdog like ""Seabiscuit"" was. The thrill here for audiences is akin to going up against criminal baddies with Dirty Harry on your side or entering the boxing ring with Muhammad Ali. If you know anything about horse-race history you cant wait until you see how the movie stages the famous 1973 Belmont Stakes. The movie seeks its dramatic conflict between races in the battles of the stallions owner and true believer Penny Chenery Tweedy (Lane) -- who takes over the Virginia-based Meadow Stables from her ailing dad (Scott Glenn) -- for she inherits a stud farm deeply in debt and upon her fathers death owes hefty estate taxes. Nonetheless her unshakable faith in this miracle horse extends even to before his birth. A 1969 coin toss originally agreed to by her father determines which of two foals sired by Bold Ruler one of most important stallions of that day will go to the winner. Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell) a wealthy breeder and owner wins the toss and makes his selection. Penny whispers that she actually got her wish She wants the unborn foal of Somethingroyal. She guessed right. Aligned against Penny and her horse whom everyone calls Big Red are a wall of sexist men starting with a corrupt trainer she immediately fires. Then there is Pennys tradition-minded husband (Dylan Walsh) who wants her back home minding the stove and washing machine; her economist brother (Dylan Baker) who wants the horse sold to pay the estate taxes; and a belligerent owner (Nestor Serrano) of Secretariats only racetrack rival Sham. Misogynistic remarks and slights fail to deter Penny who runs roughshod over the male world of racing. And she can because she has the best horse. Her team is nearly all-male as well Veteran trainer and all-around eccentric Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich reigning in his usual exuberance only slightly) who gives the movie its needed color by dressing as one character puts it ""like Superfly""; tough-as-nails jockey Ron Turcotte (excellently played by real-life jockey Otto Thorwarth); and groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis) who believes he knows what horses think. Pennys one female assistant is Miss Ham (a motherly Margo Martindale). The films other prominent speaking roles are barely necessary. As Pennys daughter Kate Disney recording star AJ Michalka gets a chance to sing and when Kate turns into something of a hippie to trivialize the whole counterculture/anti-war movement of that era. Kevin Connolly and Eric Lange play two cartoonish reporters who never venture into the press box. Lane in a series of wigs to portray the blond Penny Tweedy holds the film together with a sturdy performance that suggests in moments a mystical connection between horse and owner. Malkovich gives the film its comic relief as the French-Canadian trainer who after a long career has a winner to make up for all those painful big losses. The races are well shot with five horses needed to play the one superhorse in all his glory.
