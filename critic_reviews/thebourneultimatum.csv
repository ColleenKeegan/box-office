"Review Bourne a thrill-a-minute powerhouse - CNN.com Review Bourne a thrill-a-minute powerhouseStory Highlights ""Bourne Ultimatum"" has terrific action-packed set pieces Film directed by Paul Greengrass also has ideas under its frantic pace Matt Damon David Strathairn Joan Allen lead solid cast Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Its not easy being Bourne again. It means a lot of miles a lot of challenges and all for uncertain ends. And you never know what youll have to explain ""My fight is not with you"" Matt Damons amnesiac rogue CIA agent evading capture in Moscow says to a local cop in Russian before beating a nonviolent retreat. Matt Damons Jason Bourne remains on the run in ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Thus begins ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" the series third and final installment. Despite a marked limp in this early running Bourne remains on the run globe-hopping to Paris London Madrid Tangiers and finally home to New York. Hes also getting closer to connecting the dots and discovering his true identity. But its not just the ""who"" that drives him its also the ""why"" why was he brainwashed into an implacable impervious -- and it seems just about impregnable -- killing machine? The Bourne series gets a lot of credit for a supposedly more hard-nosed contemporary take on espionage than other spy movies we could mention. This is largely a function of style. Bourne travels light and adopts a pragmatic hands-on approach to problem solving. He has no truck with the CGI thats got the better of ""Die Hard"" cop John McClane. But when the bullets fly hes as Teflon as the next superagent. One minute hes floored by a bomb blast the next hes sprinting across rooftops like hes trying out for a triathlon. Hes one-man surge. Watch an audio slide show with Bourne soundtrack composer John Powell This being a Paul Greengrass movie -- he directed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""United 93"" -- the shock absorbers are off the framing is epileptic and its a rare shot that lasts more than a millisecond. The effect is purposely disorienting but even in the midst of this breathless visual bombardment Greengrass his cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Christopher Rouse have a knack for homing in on the vital dynamic element in the frame even if were only able to process the information a beat or two later when that blurry gun or book or voice recorder comes in to play. Dont Miss Composer John Powell  Helping Bourne rise to the occasion Indeed the action pounds so thick and fast its a relief when hard-working composer John Powell grants us a brief reprieve for a brutal hand-to-hand scrap scored only to thumps bumps and grunts. Still much to Greengrass and Co.s credit they want to get to the ""why"" too. It takes awhile thats not a question CIA headquarters is ready to address and certainly not in public. CIA deputy director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is aghast when the agency picks up a British journalists reference to the top-secret codename ""Blackbriar"" in a cell phone conversation with his editor. (Forget the Patriot Act; these guys are eavesdropping across the Atlantic now.) In the first of the films dizzyingly orchestrated cat-and-mouse sequences Bourne steals the reporter out from under a thousand virtual Agency eyes and ears in Londons Waterloo Station. (Tip for the terrorists to avoid detection when all else fails tie your shoelaces.) The hack doesnt make it but Bourne is nothing if not elusive and its on to the next stage in his whirlwind European tour. Along the way he has a suspiciously serendipitous encounter with old acquaintance Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) before executing another adept variation on an escapist theme. Bourne -- or whatever his name really is -- is such a resourceful and reckless agent of chaos we thrill to him despite the fact that hes officially a non-entity. Matt Damon makes enough of his scarce terse exchanges with Nicky and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to suggest remorse spurs him more than revenge. Landy in particular comes to figure as a mother-confessor. Shes the only one who understands Bournes true nature blowback. Which turns ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" into a thinking-mans action film. Reflecting a growing apprehension that counterintelligence agencies have overstepped legal and ethical boundaries ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" smartly affects kick-ass with a conscience by implying weve become our own worst enemy. Who knew guilt could be such a trip? ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" runs 111 minutes and is rated PG-13. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

He glowered his way through The Departed looked anxious in Oceans Thirteen and seemed bored every second of The Good Shepherd when he wasnt in drag singing ""Little Miss Buttercup."" Mostly though hes chosen roles that allow him to be bare-knuckled and blank-an action movie mannequin with fewer lines and facial expressions than Steven Seagal. As Jason Bourne hes in bland bloom as the amnesiatic killer who wants one thing to avenge himself on his handlers whoever they are. Hes still beset by flashbacks-this time of a lab where he was hooded and tortured-yet he whizzes through London Moscow Madrid Tangier and New York racking up devastation with the emotional complexity of a pinball. A few times he points a revolver but refuses to kill. Were supposed to feel tense empathy but hes been pulling that move since Franka Potente was renting scooters in the Greek Isles. But for all the feigned soul searching The Bourne Ultimatum knows what we really want is speed evasion and the latest in special ops tactics. Its good on all three. The flick picks up quick with Bournes flight out of Moscow then zips to England where a Guardian reporter named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) has published three pieces on Bourne and Marie. Ross is on to something big-his source has just tipped him off to a secret CIA project that might be the key to Bournes identity but as soon as he says the words ""Black Briar"" on the phone to his editor the NSA is on his tail. And Bourne hunting down what Ross knows is on a collision course to meet them. Between Bournes British director Paul Greengrass shot the 9/11 docudrama United 93 which was hushed and apolitical. He seems to have channeled every frustration he repressed into this multiplex thriller. Theres waterboarding Arabs with car bombs security cameras everywhere and wiretapping up the wazoo. Most of all theres Agent Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) a shady leader in Dick Cheney spectacles who tries to convince everyone that Bourne is a threat to the American way of life and delights in ""experimental interrogation."" ""No more red tape"" he exults to Agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen hair smaller than last time). And lest we doubt that these things are true the team of screenwriters has devoted many lines of dialogue to avowing they are. ""This is real"" grunts Damon and later ""You couldnt make this stuff up."" But just as Bourne has his signature moves-surprising people in their apartments using his snub-nosed Archie comics face to pass off as every nationality from Scottish to Estonian and refusing to put on a football jersey when his enemies have spent three films scouring security footage for a man dressed all in black-Greengrass tic is zoomed-in shaky footage that feels like he forced his cameramen to balance on one foot. Which is all very well when youre trying to give immediacy to a crowd chase sequence but rotten when the audience wants to see a spectacular stunt. Bourne races motorbikes up staircases and leaps across balconies like a mountain goat but all I could see was fuzz and chaos. Halfway through the plot stands still for a 10-minute pursuit through Tangier that might have had some badass fight choreography but I suspect that with his style of filming and editing he could turn Jackie Chan folding his laundry into Rush Hour 4. These irritating sequences dont look like a movie but a YouTube stunt Damon shot with Ben Affleck for giggles. At the end however Greengrass scores points by asking the series ultimate question. Not who were Bournes bosses but why did Midwestern boy David Webb sign up with them to become a hitman? ""I love my country"" Bourne says in a flashback before his bosses force him to shoot a prisoner in a black hood. And so Greengrass comes full circle from the War on Terror film that bit its tongue to the popcorn flick that speaks volumes. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Director Paul Greengrass - who directed the superb ""United 93"" between the second and third ""Bourne"" installments - knows how to stage and edit bravura action sequences generating almost unbearable suspense while deploying a superb cast. At the center of ""Ultimatum"" is Damons finely shaded performance as the enigmatic CIA killing machine known as Jason Bourne who continues his quest to discover his true identity - and wreak vengeance on the spooks who took it and his girlfriend away from him. After eluding pursuers in Moscow rogue agent Jason pops up in London where a reporter for the Guardian (Paddy Considine) has been writing about Jason and Blackbriar the CIA black-ops program that replaced the one that produced Jason. Noah Vosen (David Strathairn of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" effectively cast against type) who heads the program is determined to cover his tracks by ordering the assassination of Bourne and anyone in a position to help him. An astounding chase sequence in Londons very crowded Waterloo station is intercut with scenes of Vosen in New York who directs Bournes pursuers using Londons ""Ring of Steel"" surveillance-camera system. This chase is followed by an even neater one through the narrow alleys and over the roofs of Tangier - where Bourne finally engages in visceral hand-to-hand combat with a killer in a tiny bathroom. One great thing about this smartly developed series is that Bourne doesnt use high-tech gadgets - he works with his wits and whatevers available. In Bournes experienced hands a toothbrush or a washcloth can become a deadly weapon. Bournes globetrotting trail leads to New York where Vosens extra-legal tactics are being questioned by high-ranking CIA investigator Pamela Landy (Joan Allen). But does she having the backing of the agencys director (Scott Glenn)? The tension ratchets up as Vosen and Bourne play a cat-and-mouse game in the Big Apple where the classic chase in ""The French Connection"" is arguably topped by a breathtaking vehicular pursuit beginning at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It all ends on the Upper East Side where Bourne confronts the Mengele-like doctor (a short but highly effective appearance by Albert Finney) who used torture and other methods to turn Bourne into an identity- and conscience-free killer. The screenplay by Tony Gilroy (who wrote the first two Bourne flicks) Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi very loosely adapted from Robert Ludlums Cold War-era novel repeatedly raises - but doesnt dwell - on the issue of how far intelligence agencies should go to protect us in the 9/11 era. But as in the two previous Bournes it grounds the film in a 21st-century reality thats generally missing from the genre - even as Damons unflashy spook harks back to the low-key morally ambiguous spies played by Michael Caine in the 1960s and 1970s. The story does strain credulity repeatedly especially when Bourne just happens to re-encounter former CIA colleague Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles in her most substantial ""Bourne"" appearance to date). And how exactly does Bourne emerge from a grisly car wreck on South Street without a scratch? ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" moves with such assurance and at such a lightning pace to effectively render such questions moot. Once again the Bourne-again spy makes James Bond Ethan Hunt and their quaint adventures seem like something of the last century. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next BODY ELECTRIC Read Next BODY ELECTRIC Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46913 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19317 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18669 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Jason Bourne in theory could be George W. Bushs dream historian a loyal foot soldier who has been conditioned to obey and serve but whose mind has been broken and reconfigured to conveniently forget certain details and fixate on others. You couldnt find a better candidate to sit down and write a glowing record of the W. presidency. It would be a masterpiece of selective memory -- except for the fact that Jason Bourne insists on trying to use even the parts of his brain that dont work. When Robert Ludlum wrote the Bourne novels in the 80s he probably didnt conceive of his character -- an amnesiac killer who hunts his targets with machinelike efficiency even as the remaining shreds of his human decency cloud his brain like tattered ghosts -- as a freethinking leftist American patriot. But in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" -- the third picture in the Bourne franchise and the second to be directed by extraordinary English filmmaker Paul Greengrass -- Jason Bourne emerges as the kind of troubled but resolute hero we most need these days a figure who insists on peering through the murk rather than letting it block the truth. Jason Bourne clawing his way out of madness still has a conscience even though he has lost most of his mind. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a great action movie exhilarating and neatly crafted the kind of picture that will still look good 20 or 30 years from now. And while it isnt a cheerful picture I found it to be an oddly comforting one perhaps more so than its two predecessors 2002s ""The Bourne Identity"" (directed by Doug Liman) and Greengrass 2004 ""The Bourne Supremacy."" In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" Jason Bournes isolation feels weightier and more oppressive than ever. But then again sometimes -- particularly if youre killing people and you dont know why -- isolation is the only appropriate feeling. Theres a way in which Greengrass and the movies writers Tony Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns make Jasons separateness so palpable that its practically a communal state something that draws us closer to him rather than distances us. In all three of these movies Jason Bourne -- played by Matt Damon an actor so old-fashioned all-American that he looks as if hed be most at home in one of those 1940s football costumes with the leather helmet -- knows hes a killer; he simply has no idea what his motives are or who or what may have instilled these murderous impulses. At the beginning of the second film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" Bournes girlfriend Marie (played by marvelous openhearted actress Franka Potente) is killed suddenly. She has been trying to help him remember who he is and to find out whos instigating these ruthless missions. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" simply drops us into the middle of Jasons story and assumes were hip to it. But even at this point in Jasons nightmare adventure as he sprints to keep at least two (and often 20) paces ahead of the top-secret CIA forces that are trying to kill him Marie is still a not-so-spectral presence. In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" he explains to Nicky (wonderfully stern and serene Julia Stiles) the young CIA agent who keeps looping into his story ""I can see their faces -- everyone I ever killed. I just dont know their names."" And then he adds as if struggling to retrieve stray scraps of memory from the corners of his brain ""Marie would try to help me remember their names."" In this moment -- and in many other moments in the Bourne movies -- Damon who seems to be a perfectly fine actor locked behind that nominally uninteresting yearbook-picture face is a figure of solitude straight out of an Edward Hopper painting although this guy isnt just alone with his memories hes alone period. Bourne isnt the prototypical American loner hero the upright stoic type who knows whats right in his slow-moving bones. (For one thing his bones move too fast The chase sequences in all the Bourne movies are marvelous but in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" Greengrass brings them to a level of artistry and of mounting horror that tops even what has come before.) Bourne is a U.S. citizen but more essentially hes a citizen of the world ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" jumps from city to city -- London Moscow Paris Tangier New York -- as if national boundaries were just bothersome fences begging to be hopped. Bourne travels light (although even his single knapsack is laden with meaning) and he seems to speak every imaginable language presumably because of all the evil CIA training he has received but that doesnt discount the reality of his need for connection and communication For Bourne all soil is foreign soil which means that home could be anywhere or nowhere. You Might Also Like I think fans of the previous two Bourne movies may fear that reading too much about ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" could spoil their pleasure of it. But theres barely a plot to spoil -- theres only movement and sensation. Joan Allen reappears as Pamela Landy the CIA honcho whos entrusted with trapping the elusive Bourne even as her sympathy for him (and her distrust of the organization she works for) increases. Paddy Considine plays an earnest Guardian journalist whose title is ""security correspondent"" and if any actor has the face of an earnest Guardian journalist its Considine Even his eyes ask unanswerable questions. Scott Glenn appears as the lizardlike director of the CIA who wants his orders followed without having to dirty his own mitts. David Strathairn is a Company bigwig an arrogant mirror image of the Edward R. Murrow he gave us in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" And Albert Finney an actor whose face I dont believe I could ever tire of appears as -- well that you really dont want to know. Greengrass doesnt pace ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in the usual way building tension and then allowing it to release before starting up the whole process again. Instead he uses the movies first few minutes to establish a pulse. After that all of the movies beats -- its anxious moments and its calmer ones -- hit in response to that pulse. Greengrass methods as a filmmaker have always felt more organic than mechanical especially in his greatest picture the 2002 ""Bloody Sunday"" an account of the Jan. 30 1972 massacre on the streets of Derry Northern Ireland in which 13 unarmed civil rights protesters were killed by British soldiers. Greengrass doesnt shy away from making the horrors of history feel immediate and disturbingly alive. Maybe guys like Greengrass should be reserved only for serious pictures about serious subjects movies like ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93 (the latter a picture whose mere existence I have problems with as much as I respect Greengrass technique and approach). Then again action movies desperately need more guys like Greengrass. The violence in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is exciting all right. But very few contemporary directors know how to film action and violence with the kind of chaotic clarity Greengrass does. That may seem like a contradiction but Greengrass knows how to use a movie frame so we know where to look every instant -- and still we cant ever be certain that were catching it all because violence by its nature is unmanageable. In a street chase sequence set in Tangier Morocco Bourne runs for his life through courtyards and across rooftops leaping from building to building through windows that arent always open. Part of the sequence involves a motorbike chase but Greengrass presents it as an example of boyish shenanigans with real-life consequences. And in the fight sequences Greengrass never lets us forget that every landed punch causes real pain One in particular is so beautifully choreographed that it left me feeling a little heartsick as if Id just watched a perfectly executed tragic love scene. In that sequence a book is used as a weapon a bitter rejoinder to the generally comforting idea that books are our friends. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a movie packed with exploding fragments of information. As Bourne repeatedly rattles the padlocked chain wrapped around his memory we see and hear shards of the past he cant remember Bourne hooded and bound being roughed up by men whose faces we cant see; voices speaking in broken-up phrases ("" ... tank treatment ..."" ""... hasnt slept for 52 hours ...""). At one point a character states flatly ""We are the sharp end of the stick"" meaning that this not-so-royal ""we"" answers to no one. If someone anyone needs to be disposed of theres no paperwork to fill out no clearance needed from the higher-ups. A murder can be ordered up like a pizza; a previous sensible decision can be overturned with a single phone call. Against all of that a guy like Jason Bourne with his mangled brain and whirring conscience shouldnt stand a chance -- and yet hes the last man standing. Theyve given him a number and taken away his name but what he stands for cant be so easily erased. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Damons Bourne to run | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDamons Bourne to runIf the Bourne Ultimatum the third instalment of the high-energy spy-thriller film franchise is the lesser of the three movies its only because its predecessors set the bar so high.While The Bourne Ultimatum starring Matt Damon is the lesser of the trio its only because the first movies set the bar so high.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Aug. 3 2007 Starring Matt Damon Julia Stiles David Strathairn Joan Allen Paddy Considine and Albert Finney. Written by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi. Directed by Paul Greengrass. 111 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  With the primary motivating issue in his life largely resolved at the end of superjacked high-tech spy thriller The Bourne Ultimatum a big question remains concerning the future employment opportunities for the once homicidally programmed government agent Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Article Continued BelowJust what do you do with a guy who can kick jack smack smash and shatter his way across the world in less time than it takes you to find parking to watch him do it? Running an extreme travel service maybe? Offering seminars on how to minimize time spent in airports and clearing customs? How about teaching housewives how to use handily available household appliances as murder weapons? That might just be the ticket Jason Bourne the Martha Stewart of mayhem.While the final image of Paul Greengrasss film suggests that there is a future for the unstoppably crafty and creatively self-sufficient rogue agent - who spends most of this movie borrowing his way inexorably closer to the Rumsfeldian doctor (Albert Finney) who programmed Bourne as a black ops killing machine - The Bourne Ultimatum nevertheless has the neat and mostly tidy feeling of a job well done.While the first movie (the Doug Liman-directed The Bourne Identity) in this smartly engineered series focused on Bournes quest for his own identity and the second (the Greengrass-directed The Bourne Supremacy) revealed just what evil hed been compelled to do the third caps the quest by sending the guy home. Hes off to a top-secret CIA division specializing in legally unhindered terror management to do some damage to the guy who made him what he was. At least partly the Bourne movies are a 21st-century Frankenstein story played out beneath the shadows of 9/11. Considering that novelist Robert Ludlums character was created in another century in a vastly different global political climate these movies are even more striking for their breathless immediacy.In the same way that cultural historians now read certain movies of the 60s and 70s as barometers of that eras ruptures and turbulence the Bourne movies will probably rank as especially revealing artifacts of life in the Bush Age.Since Ultimatum is the least revelatory and action-programmatic of the three movies its the one freest to indulge in pure foot-through-the-floorboards momentum. No sooner has the movie started than Greengrass nearly exhausts us with what seem to be about six chases through airports railway stations rush-hour traffic snarls and various shiny-floored glass-tower lobbies. This is the world of ubiquitous surveillance concealed microtechnology coded bafflegab and public-space anonymity in which the likes of a Bourne - not to mention both the people who made them and the bad guys they kill - can both thrive and flourish. And its a world that Greengrass - the formidably gifted British director of Bloody Sunday and United 93 - renders with a jumpy agitated ferocity.He keeps the movie barrelling forward even when its not doing much but vaulting from one time zone to the next and when he stops - either to capture Damons strangely soulful Bourne in horrified reflection over past deeds or to stage a stunning close-quarter brawl in a cramped Moroccan apartment - he only makes you wish the movie had more to do than simply deliver Bourne to his inevitable destination.However while Ultimatum may be the lesser of the three Jason Bourne movies - there are way too many scenes of CIA puppeteers David Strathairn and Joan Allen barking high-tech gibberish at terminal-bound drones - it is only so because the bar set by its predecessors was so uncommonly high. As far as most contemporary action thrillers go this one still vaults clear over the heads of most. And hits the ground with barely a limp.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 3 2007 400 AM The Bourne Ultimatum. Final chapter in the action series about an amnesiac CIA assassin desperate to uncover his true identity. With Matt Damon Joan Allen. Director Paul Greengrass (149). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. We all know that the best parts of a thriller are - well the thrills. The car chases and quick escapes the fight scenes and flying bullets. Few series have grasped this concept better than the ""Bourne"" trilogy which ends as it began bursting with so much amped-up energy you may need to rest once its finally done. No one deserves a day at the spa more than amnesia-suffering spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Having already loved (""The Bourne Identity"") and lost (""The Bourne Supremacy"") he spends ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" on his own and ready to return home - if he can just figure out where that might be. Bourne himself has no idea how he ended up spanning the globe on deadly missions so his first clues come when a British journalist begins an expose about him. The piece raises alarm bells within the CIA and black-ops agent Vosen (David Strathairn) wants Bourne killed before he learns how or where he was originally hired let alone why he has no memory of the details. But agent Landy (Joan Allen) has worked with Bourne before and refuses to accept his assassination at the hands of the organization that trained and then betrayed him. There are other threads to the plot - Julia Stiles once again drags down her brief scenes as a sympathetic operative - but all are secondary to the primary objective keeping Bourne on the run and us on the edge of our seats. Just as Damon is an effectively low-key action star the ""Bourne"" films - which are based on Robert Ludlums classic spy novels - feel satisfyingly real in their rejection of slick effects. Director Paul Greengrass who also made ""Supremacy"" gets his kicks from turning every set into a maze of suspense be it a packed London train station a labyrinthine Moroccan medina or a blaring Manhattan street corner. Somehow he also manages to tie up loose ends from all three movies propelling us to an entirely satisfactory finish. Well maybe not entirely. For that wed need the promise of Bournes return. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Government-funded New York City ""Hit Room"" team members--including leader Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Cronin (Tom Gallop)--in the espionage thriller The Bourne Ultimatum. Photo Jasin Boland Universal Pictures The Bourne Ultimatum 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Paul Greengrass is an auteur of agitation in a world transformed by terror. You could if you wanted to take a cue from Graham Greene divide his four most recent films between literature and ""entertainments"" United 93 and Bloody Sunday as examples of the former his two Bournes (2004s Supremacy and now an Ultimatum) as examples of the latter. But no matter how you slice his work the ingredients are more alike than not. The Greengrass hallmarks remain consistent from hand-held camerawork and its signature visual tremolos to a plainspoken narrative approach that teases character out of action meaning out of plot. Most of all there is an abiding psychological unease to these films the war-fed paranoia of a shifting political age. In one type of film in one type of context its called suspense; in another realism. In this latest film we find a little of both. The Bourne Ultimatum is not a balm for the eyes or the spirit. If The Bourne Supremacy gave you sharp pain between your temples (or the equivalent in your gut) so will this. Its story rests on a pretty thin frame Scene after scene of its amnesiac renegade CIA agent Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) chasing and being chased by various arms of law enforcement and a few lethal subcontractors all while Oliver Woods cinematography shakes rattles and rolls. But Greengrass knows what he has here -- a relentlessly breakneck chronicle of a relentlessly hard-nosed man -- and he knows how to grab the audience in a stranglehold. I must have breathed during The Bourne Ultimatum because I didnt pass out in my seat -- but Im sure those were bruises on my throat. Gripping? Yes. The last time we heard from Jason Bourne he was mourning the death of his lover and obsessing over a black-ops program code-named Treadstone. Hes still mourning and still obsessing and still trying to figure out how the heck he came to be a government killing machine. This third Bourne based like the first two on a Robert Ludlum novel lacks the thumping emotional center of the last one replacing it with a profound existential crisis Who am I? And more to the point Why am I? Much of it will look familiar to anyone who saw and remembers The Bourne Supremacy. The global-hopping mania is there (Russia London Paris Morocco Madrid New York). The masterful chase scenes are there (motorcycles). The bloody-raw violence is too (knuckle-baring head-smacking glass-shattering). Many characters reappear (Joan Allens sympathetic boss Julia Stiles entangled colleague) but there are newcomers most notably David Strathairn as a dazzlingly oleaginous New York honcho. Damon provides as ever an ideal combination of cool-headed intellect and subtextual psychic squirming. He seems to suffer without actually doing anything a rare gift for an actor. In interviews he has pooh-poohed comparisons with the James Bond franchise saying his JB murders less flippantly than that other tuxedoed JB. But Bourne has more in common with the ur-Bond of last years Casino Royale -- an emotionally battered even vulnerable assassin who understands that killing can claim the soul. Theyre on different trajectories Bourne is scraping his way toward absolution Bond away from it. ""This is where it started for me -- this is where it ends"" says Greengrass tenacious running man pausing for a moment to breath and to hope. Does it end? Not really. Jason Bournes quest for redemption may never come to a close but the chase is fun to watch. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Apple Sale at eBay Up to 60% off + free shipping Polo Ralph Lauren Mens Shoes for 20 + 5 samp;h Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Its not just because the action franchise piles up megabucks and leaves enough cliffhangers to extend the string of scripts another 20 years. Jason Bourne rightfully replaces James Bond because of a pervasive convincing gloom surrounding the CIA rogues feats and the reasons his grim exertions are necessary. In keeping with the times Bourne (Matt Damon) fights the excesses of his own nation rather than the transgressions of others. In this weeks ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" director Paul Greengrass doesnt even offer a pretense that there is a worthy mission abroad for Bourne to resume his assassins career. Jasons only duty is to come home and clean up the mess that began with his own brainwashing. Make no mistake about who Greengrass and his screenwriters are critiquing here. In a New York City torture lab long before 9/11 a young Bourne was waterboarded browbeaten and generally corrupted by American superiors. Even the pointed black hoods pulled over Bournes head between ""sessions"" are sewn straight from the Abu Ghraib pattern book. In the present a CIA deputy chief (David Strathairn) has new clearance to carry out the war on terror and reel in the troublesome Bourne ""Experimental interrogation. Thats what makes us special. No more red tape."" Throughout ""Ultimatum"" as Bourne fights the physical CIA in the present and his memories from the past Greengrass question is pointed Is there any real truth or triumph to be gained from methods relying on abuse and lawlessness? Joan Allen asks a similar question of Strathairn ""You start down this path when does it end?"" Strathairn spits back ""It ends when weve won."" The ""Bournes"" work. The first by Doug Liman was best but the second and third by Greengrass come close because of a strict consistency in tone and talent. Bourne never cracks a smile never makes a cheap joke never employs cool ring tones on his ubiquitous cellphones. He is haunted and through his eyes the world - even the glorious European capitals where Bourne chases always lead - will look like a mean dangerous place until he breaks through to some answers. The roster of Damons supporting cast always adds gravitas where car chases cannot. Bourne 1 had Chris Cooper Brian Cox Clive Owen and Franka Potente; B2 had Cox Joan Allen Potente and Julia Stiles; B3 adds Strathairn Scott Glenn Paddy Considine and Albert Finney. It takes real talent to attract that wealth of talent and the people who latch on to Bournes speeding bumper know they will ride in a smart thrilling vehicle. And Ive always appreciated Bournes mash-up of high- and low-tech. The CIA can hijack every closed-circuit surveillance camera in London to track Bourne and seemingly Google- map Bournes every synapse. Playing analog hero to the digital villains meanwhile Bourne can kill an attacker with a ballpoint pen or fashion a decoy out of an electric fan a broom a flashlight and a roll of Scotch tape. Implausible? Ask the shoe bomber. It was lack of brains not equipment that foiled his plans. The innovative infallibility of Bourne finally gets to the straight-laced Strathairn who shouts ""Jesus Christ Thats Jason Bourne"" He might as well say ""Jason Bourne Thats Jesus Christ"" A few thin points in ""Ultimatum"" distract from the proceedings. Would anyone at the CIA weep over the death of a British newspaper reporter? Having stolen that reporters notebook would anybody be able to read his handwriting? Having seen what Bourne does to trained killers why would anybody agree to meet him anywhere? Knowing hes being watched by every video camera in the world might not Bourne don a baseball cap and sunglasses once in a while convert to Hasidism or try on a burkha? And does anybody seriously believe there could be a high-speed traffic chase in New York City at any time of day or night? These are mere quibbles though in a summer where the alternative action choices have consisted of a scattered spider a tired pirate and soulless battle- bots. I cant wait for Bourne Four when no doubt the writers will try to answer the question raised by Julia Stiles as she applies her poultice of femininity to Bournes bruised face and purrs the historical red flag ""It was difficult for me ... with you.""

But still this clench-jawed thriller - with Matt Damon as the somebodys-messed-with- my-head secret agent known as Jason Bourne - is unstoppable fun. Jumping from Moscow to Langley Va. to Turin to Paris to Londons Waterloo Station all before most flicks have finished their ""produced by"" credits The Bourne Ultimatum offers a deftly directed series of bone-crunching fight sequences high-tech hugger-mugger and head-spinning chases (on foot in car by motorbike). Paul Greengrass handed the baton by The Bourne Identitys Doug Liman and proving himself up to the job with the second installment The Bourne Supremacy is quite simply one of the best action directors working today. Nominated for an Academy Award last year for his taut terrifying 9/11 drama United 93 Greengrass combines a documentarians eye for real-life panoramas (and a doc-makers agility with hand-held cameras) with a big-screen sensibility and editing chops to die for. The Bourne Ultimatum is built around three major action sequences - in and around Waterloo Station on the streets of Tangier Morocco and in the glass and steel of midtown Manhattan - and the pacing the rhythms are nothing short of brilliant. The film doesnt slow down to catch its breath so much as it just shifts into another mode of gallop. Plot? Tony Gilroy writer of all three Bourne screenplays based on the Robert Ludlum best sellers begins things with our hero on the run in Moscow breaking into a pharmacy dressing his own wounds and experiencing disconcerting disconnected flashbacks - an interrogation room a mumbled mantra (""Will you commit to the program?"") torture torment. Cut to six weeks later and a British journo (Paddy Considine) meeting with a CIA informant in a cafe in northern Italy. The reporter gleans some prized info - about an agent named Bourne about an operation code-named Treadstone. The deep-cover antiterrorism boys (and girls) back at CIA headquarters hear about the meeting and track the Guardian newspaper guy back to Britain. So does Jason Bourne who wants to know what the journalist knows. Bourne is still asking those big existential questions Who am I? What am I doing here? Only in his case his memory erased Bourne truly doesnt know. But shards of history are beginning to surface - those flashbacks familiar names a phrase a voice. Damon serious and seriously buff plays the CIA spy with the killer instincts and negative recall with a charismatic brand of anti-charisma. He blends in like the good spy hes trained to be but he stands out like a movie star. Monitoring from control rooms in Langley and New York is the keyboard-clacking cell-phone-monitoring GPS-ready CIA team - led by a terse David Strathairn and by Joan Allen whose Pam Landy is torn between a fealty to the feds and a gut feeling that Bournes a good Joe. ""Assets"" also known as assassins are brought in. ""Sub rosa collection of bodies"" is initiated. Operations and operatives are compromised. And everywhere Bourne goes - Madrid Manhattan - bullets fly bodies fall. (One amazing rooftop chase covers row upon row of umber-colored Tangier houses with the ever-resourceful Bourne plucking items from clothing lines - you never know when a towel will come in handy.) And Julia Stiles the efficient CIA techie returns to run tandem with Bourne - her big blank features like a heroine out of some 1960s Jack Kirby comic book. The Bourne Ultimatum isnt ultimately about anything. Sure theres speechifying about a cynical government exerting undue control over its citizens - and where does one draw the line between personal liberty and the public good? - but really this is a film about momentum gravity trajectory. Its a physics lesson wrapped up in an espionage thriller and when director Greengrass yells ""Action"" he means it. The Bourne Ultimatum  (out of four stars) Directed by Paul Greengrass.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 03 2007 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 1134PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Bourne Ultimatum Directed by Paul Greengrass Written by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns George Nolfi Starring Matt Damon David Strathairn Julia Stiles Albert Finney Classification 14A 1/2 BY LIAM LACEYJason Bourne is back in the third and purportedly last of the exemplary action thrillers in a trilogy The Bourne Ultimatum. Bourne as you may or may not recall is found floating in the Mediterranean one day. He has no memory of who he is but soon discovers hes a frighteningly efficient killing machine. All three movies have followed the traumatized Bournes attempts to get to the bottom of a brainwashing experiment of which he is the unhappy product. The Bourne Ultimatum is both the most bewildering of the three movies and also the most brutally compelling. The movie is directed by Paul Greengrass ( United 93 The Bourne Supremacy) using jittery handheld cameras and claustrophobic convulsive editing with an unerring sense of rhythm that keeps the anxiety level in the red zone. This is a chase film pushed to the fragmented limits of abstraction that rattles and jolts and explodes like an intricately designed drum solo. Throughout the panic dream of a plot the titular amnesiac hero experiences repeated bouts of physical mayhem lives in dreadful paranoia and travels with such hurtling speed he seems to dematerialize and re-form in new places. Bourne the bullet-headed protagonist with the blank stare crashes falls gets shot at gets wounded and murders his opponents with wrenching unhesitating violence. Shards of narrative fly by between chases and abrupt changes of locations experienced simultaneously from the perspective of Bourne and his adversaries in the CIA. Behind the omnipresent surveillance cameras phone taps and would-be assassins is a hierarchy of sour-faced white-haired men who took Bournes identity and now want to end his life as well. CIA black ops chief Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) follows Bournes movements and has an irrational zeal to see the former agent killed. Vosen is working for an even more vicious boss Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) who in turn answers to an older and still more evil figure the gravel-voiced Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney) who appears intermittently in Bournes scratchy flashbacks. In a final confrontation Hirschs voice is altered and seems to be accompanied by the sounds of some Stygian wind. Working on the heros side are women Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons a young round-faced CIA operative whom Bourne had met before and Joan Allen as the blond angular Pamela Landy an agent who looks at the walls of surveillance images and computer data and feels sympathy with the target. The script by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi is efficiently savvy and - like the vanity-free acting throughout - pared down for maximum thump with the minimum of adornment. Bournes journey has elements that are obviously mythic with devouring father-figures mothers confused as lovers Bournes baptismal birth and the heros desire to be Bourne again. But all these archetypal underpinnings are submerged beneath the blur of relentless action. The first of these bravura action set-pieces in crowded city centres takes place at Londons Waterloo Station where Bourne attempts to meet a newspaper reporter (Paddy Considine) who has run a story about Bourne obviously from a well-informed source. Picking up on a word Blackfriar from the reporters cellphone a CIA hit squad instantly attacks Bourne and the reporter. This leads to a breathtaking chase through the train station and a shopping mall in which the viewer is simultaneously immersed in the vast surveillance network while participating in Bournes thwarting of it. Barely has the tension from the sequence ended when Bourne is off to Madrid where he meets again with Nicky for another short battle. He then heads on to Tunisia where a CIA hit-man (Joey Ansa) trained under the same mysterious program as Bourne is waiting for him. What follows is the films tour-de-force chase using the same parkour techniques (obstacle-course running and jumping across rooftops) and vicious hand-to-hand combat that reinvigorated the last Bond movie. The extended Tunisian sequence is so breathlessly intense that it risks taking the wind out of the films last act. Its yet another showdown this time in New York where Bourne penetrates his enemies nest. The conclusion is complete enough that any further Bourne adventure would have to be regarded as an act of bad faith with the audience. Is The Bourne Ultimatum about anything more than the astonishing visceral kicks? Well yes and no. The idea that American intelligence agencies are corrupt isnt so much an indictment as a thriller cliche. The script makes pointed references to water torture and Vosens George Bush-like commitment to killing until ""weve won"" but this is a blockbuster fantasy that disturbs only to reassure. If the real CIA were anywhere near this efficiently evil terrorism would long ago have been as passe as spies in tuxedos.

"The pace quickens - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW The pace quickensThe latest Bourne ratchets up the action -- and thats saying a lot.August 03 2007|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer3 IT says something about Paul Greengrass directing style that hes able to make a movie as fresh and frank as ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" from a genre as moldy and bombastic as the spy thriller but its hard to explain what exactly without inventing some new kind of frenetic seen-from-all-angles-at-once Cubist grammar to describe it.(Maybe. Something. Like. This This. THIS)The third in a series kicked off by ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" director Doug Liman and now ably stewarded by Greengrass director of the blood-chillingly understated ""United 93"" the Bourne films are based on Robert Ludlums airport staple spy thrillers but ratcheted to a new level of excitement. Greengrass clearly a philosophical type is rarely content to show a thing from a single angle if he can show it from five. He wants us right in there thinking on our toes and putting our heads together as if the life-threatening situation were our very own. He eliminates the polite distances between the movie and the viewer and shoves us into the chaos.And yet the profusion of frantic shots never feels like showboating and the closeness never feels claustrophobic. This is also saying something considering how thoroughly action films have used similar techniques to come out resembling steroidal video games. Greengrass is not out to ""entertain"" in the dismal specious sense. He can be trusted to never dangle a shiny Tom Cruise object in front of us and expect us to sit back in brain-dead amazement as it flies across a green screen just out of singe range of an exploding CGI fireball. Greengrass camera may scurry and dart like a rabbit trapped in a mall but he keeps the tone grounded the effects in-camera and the acting low-key and real. With plenty of help from director of photography Oliver Wood screenwriters Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and editor Christopher Rouse Greengrass brings a degree of honesty to a completely implausible fantasy thats remarkable.Of course Matt Damon helps too. Through his efforts Jason Bourne the fictional government-made killing machine we have followed through the two movies leading to this one (and would happily follow through a few more) stands out in a crowded field as the humblest and most relatable existentialist government-made killing machine ever devised. Even in the slightly more disillusioned spy subgenre its rare to find a protagonist as soulful as Bourne. But a cosmopolitan polyglot with a brain a conscience and no discernible attitude at all is not something you see on the screen every day. Of course he can still kill an opponent with a ballpoint pen if it comes to that. Hes all purpose and no posturing -- the perfect antidote to the ugly American action hero.Updated from Ludlums novels the better to align to post post-Cold War realities the ""Bourne"" series takes our hero through three stages of enlightenment. In ""The Bourne Identity"" he discovers who he is. In ""The Bourne Supremacy"" he figures out who made him what he is why theyre still out to get him and gets back at them for killing his girlfriend. In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" he . . . looks deeper into the matter. This may not sound like much -- in fact its not until after the movie has ended and someone asks you what it was about that you realize how disproportionate the frenzied action is to the storys overall progress. Not that it really matters -- like the others ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is ultimately a movie about self-discovery. It moves fast but its real momentum is internal.When we first meet up with Bourne hes still in Moscow apologizing to the orphaned daughter of the Russian politician he murdered on his first job. Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) is dead and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) has brought back the taped confession that should put an end to the Bourne manhunt. Soon though he discovers the rot had spread further than previously surmised. An article in a British newspaper suggests someone somewhere knows things about him he still doesnt know but which his persistent flashbacks suggest he should look into.Treadstone the sinister secret program that created him and others like him may be dead and buried along with its director Abbott but the umbrella operation that housed it is alive and well and being run by a shifty Department of Defense operative named Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). That Vosen is up to no good is clear even before he orders his hideously yuppie breakfast and condescends to Landy the CIA operative who has started to develop protective instincts for lost killer-lamb Bourne.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 3 2007 Save for later Saved Jason Bourne has come a long way since he turned up on that Italian fishing boat in ""The Bourne Identity."" Hes still on a quest to find out who he is really is but in the intervening five years hes racked up quite a body count.In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" the third and final installment in the franchise that also includes ""The Bourne Supremacy"" Matt Damon looks no more winded than he did at the start of the series. Which is a good thing since he spends most of the movie being chased all over London Tangiers Moscow Paris Madrid and finally New York. What no Baghdad?Director Paul Greengrass downplays the movies travelogue aspects by repeating the bobbly hand-held camera style he used on ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Its not a style Im fond of. Instead of imparting a present-tense immediacy it just me makes me sea sick. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Despite the nonstop bumpy ride Bourne stands squarely in the center of the action at all times. Hes like a human gyroscope. Bourne is an incongruous image A master killer with a presence so anonymous he can easily blend into any crowd. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 In the last film he unleashed his revenge against those responsible for the assassination of his lover. In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" he is brought out of hiding by a story in a British newspaper that is rife with informed speculation about his existence. By seeking out the storys reporter in order to track down his sources Bourne opens himself up to yet another round of kill-or-be-killed gymnastics.This time around the defunct top-secret black-ops program that ""created"" Bourne has been revived as the equally hush-hush Blackbriar. With its seemingly limitless supply of stealth assassins this new CIA/Department of Defense joint venture has targeted Bourne as a rogue operative. He in turn has targeted them for making him their Frankenstein monster. Understandably enough its often unclear just who is shooting/punching/garroting/torching whom.Damon has played a wide variety of roles in his career but Bourne is likely to remain his signature part for some time to come. (Maybe thats why he said this installment is the last for him.) Within its highly circumscribed limits the part fits him like a glove (better that way - no fingerprints). In ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" Damon was more charming than as Bourne. But Ripley was a saucy psychopath. Bournes kills are inspired not by a murderers lust but by the understandable need to keep on living.Other stalwarts in the cast include David Strathairn as the Blackbriar honcho who wants Bourne good and dead and Joan Allen repeating her role from the previous film as the CIA operative who wants to keep Bourne good and alive. Thats because she has you know scruples plus she doesnt like what the agency has turned into. Torture and waterboarding and top-level assassinations are not what she signed on for. Question Did she think she was joining the Campfire Girls?Greengrass once co-wrote ""Spycatcher - The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer"" a personal account of a former MI5 secret service operative. He also directed ""United 93."" So its no surprise that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is more politicized and up-to-the-minute than your average spy movie. But the relentlessly no-nonsense tone is a bit of a drag.We are not after all watching ""Battle of Algiers."" A little more pulpiness a few light moments would have been welcome. This is why I prefer ""Live Free or Die Hard"" as a summer action film - at least in that one the filmmakers are winking at us. Here as in that other new-style spy movie ""Casino Royale"" everything is hard and fast and brutal and above all straight-faced. No throwaway lines no puns.It makes sense If Bourne told a joke he might expend valuable energy better utilized for offing the enemy. Grade B Rated PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For a major Hollywood star Matt Damon doesnt seem to care much about ingratiating himself to the audience. After getting his ""love me love me love me"" performance out of the way with Good Will Hunting Damon has become a master of tragic self-effacement gravitating toward characters whose true selves are masked by an impenetrably stoic veneer. For all his talent for imitation Damons Mr. Ripley was a blank slate waiting for someone elses more vibrant personality to sketch on the empty canvas. Damons minimalist style is key to why the Bourne movies have become an oasis from other blockbuster action fare; freed from the bells and whistles of computer-generated effects theyve zagged while the rest have zigged and theyve succeeded in bringing the genre back down to earth. The last and most exciting installment in the trilogy The Bourne Ultimatum continues the heros evolution from thoughtless killing machine to somewhat more conscientious maiming machine. Still struggling to piece together gaps in his memory--alone again this time after his girlfriend (Franka Potente) was killed in The Bourne Supremacy--Damon finds some clues to his identity in an article written by a London journalist (Paddy Considine). The article suggests the existence of a top-secret CIA black-ops mission that commissioned willing agents like Damon into carrying out assassinations. Naturally the CIA led here by David Strathairn considers that information dangerous and commits all its global resources to wiping Damon out. That doesnt keep Damon from wanting to find out more about who he is even if it means going straight into the lions den. Set into motion with a brilliantly choreographed sequence at Londons Waterloo Station--the filmmaking logistics hurt the brain--The Bourne Ultimatum essentially amounts to one long chase scene yet the tension never really flags. Zipping from one locale to the next the action scenes are in danger of blurring into one another as each new city presents Damon with its own set of one-way streets and narrow alleyways. But theres always some distinguishing feature like a magnificent footrace across the rooftops of Tangiers or a hand-to-hand fight scene thats all natural sound no music. Shooting in his patented documentary style director Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy United 93) puts a premium on ground-level realism and breathless efficiency all without sacrificing his political conscience. Now that theyre over--for now anyway--the Bourne movies have left behind perhaps the strongest residue of mainstream anti-government paranoia since 70s thrillers like The Parallax View and Three Days Of The Condor. And all while kicking ass of course. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review The Simpsons Movie Next Movie Review Becoming Jane Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

A killer Ultimatum - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie review A killer Ultimatum Matt Damon is smarter and tougher than ever in his third Bourne outing By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 2 2007 The Bourne series makes for an unusual action franchise. All the movies are exhilarating including the third installment The Bourne Ultimatum which opens tonight and leaves a bruise. Part of what makes them so good is that theyre all-inclusive. You could take your mother your teenage kids your mailman your history professor and your dog -- everybody goes home happy. The movies are smart -- smarter than you but not in an off-putting way. Their basic appeal especially this new one is that Matt Damons killing machine Jason Bourne is the cleverest man on earth. And we thrill to his sense of superiority.Theres a great early sequence in Ultimatum in which Bourne fresh from avenging his girlfriends death in the previous movie and now in Londons crowded Waterloo Station manipulates a meeting with a reporter in the know (Paddy Considine) whose top-level contacts have won the murderous attention of the CIA. Via cellphone Bourne choreographs the guys every move. These scenes are funny suspenseful and exquisitely shot and edited in a first for the movies a pas de deux by remote control.Bournes memory is working again and with the help of Julia Stiles conflicted CIA agent (her part is bigger now and her hair streakier) a mental picture of his exploiters is forming. As he gets closer to putting all the pieces together hell have similar dances with David Strathairn and Joan Allen as the pair of feds increasingly at odds with each other over how to handle Bournes eventual descent upon their offices in Manhattan. The movie written by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi seems to be digging into our current surveillance and espionage quandaries.Strathairns character spends half the movie dispatching skilled men to kill Bourne. Theyre called assets and as the film trots the globe each city offers an asset whos hilariously ethnically appropriate and model-handsome. Its as if John Casablancas has started an assassins agency.These films are lean and swift. The violence comes in bursts but lasts as long as some musical numbers -- there are fights and chases here that would knock Bob Fosse into next week and make Bruce Lee break down in tears. The documentary transparency is characteristic of Paul Greengrass. He directed both this new installment and the previous one 2004s The Bourne Supremacy as well as the Sept. 11 drama United 93.That transparent quality makes his Bourne movies seem unadulterated and unalloyed. Inother words absurdly real despite Bournes apparent indestructibility. The landed blowsmake you wince. So does the films score which the movie is slathered with; the sound design is so percussively good that music seems redundant.Part of that realism extends to the movies locations. Habitually Hollywoods wanderlust is a bid to enrich the international box office. Here the globetrotting is functional. Greengrass and his crew tailor the chases and fights to each location. The rooftops and cul-de-sacs of Tangier completely recalibrate the typical breathless foot chase. Now the physical dimensions of everything seem smaller tighter intensified. That sequence climaxes with an instant-classic fight in a cramped apartment between Bourne and a Casablancas killer. Theres also a car chase in New York City that is so brutally real it seems plain impossible or just magical. Crashes as spectacular as these would make the international news.With these Bourne movies we can all feel like were getting what we want unless what you desire is Matt Damon grinning. He cracks arms legs necks but never a smile. Its hard to think of an actor better suited to playing this stuff with a straight face and the streak of human feeling that Jean-Claude Van Damme Jet Li and Jason Statham are allergic to. Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis would feel remiss if they didnt wink. But Robert Ludlum onwhose books these movies are based didnt write for the megaplex. He wrote to keep youcharged up on the plane. Theres no Yippee-Kay-Yay here. Youd have to go back to another Ford -- Glenn -- for Damons professionalism. But Glenn Ford was scarcelythe athlete Damon is.After three movies worth of running jumping and some electrifying hand-to-hand combat Damon no longer seems bewildered by his physical skills. He seems content with action-figurehood. Theres a whiff of sexual connection with Stiles who seems downright European with all the staring her character does but she just makes you miss the Germanactress Franke Potente who played Bournes girlfriend in the first picture. Mostly Damon looks understandably forlorn. Id like to see him in a comedy soon if only to confirm that he still has all his teeth.Thats how tough these movies are. Yet theyre naturally muscular where the average Hollywood blockbuster is on human growth hormone. Many of the sequencesin Bourne seem wildly spontaneously choreographed.When Bourne does a running leap off one of those Tangier rooftops across an alley and into an apartment window its a familiar action-flick move. But the immediacy takes your breath away. You might be impressed but the movie doesnt leave a second to pat itselfon the back with a slow-motion shot or a lot of build-up. He jumps. He crashes in. He lands.And on we go. The intruded-upon residents are spooked but youd have to be looking hard for their startled faces since its over for both them and us in a flash. If you need an awed reaction shot bring date and watch his or her face.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

While a police posse is chasing Bourne hes hopscotching across rooftops wrapping a sheet around his hand to vault over a wall with shards of glass on it and somehow keeping track of the elusive Nicky in a big unfamiliar city. Maybe our super-spys brain earlier rewired by The Company has been accessorized with a Google Earth chip implant. Bourne crashes through a window into the apartment where Dash just happens to be and the two martial artists go at each other like ultimate fighters using every fist and foot every ounce of strength and dirty trick every piece of furniture and plumbing at their disposal while the camera is often perched just beneath the ceiling to keep from getting whacked as collateral damage. Id be more specific in my description of this fight -- which might have been made to prove Alfred Hitchcocks thesis that killing a man is damn hard work -- but I was too excited to take notes. The battle is as long as it is ferocious and in the audience I saw the movie with nobody took a breath until it was over. Then they exhaled in a noise that exploded into a cheer. The first episodes of the movie trilogy based on Robert Ludlums novels -- The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004) -- picked up the reputation as a thinking mans spy series. Certainly they were darker grimier than the old James Bond films and their glitzy clones. (The latest Bond Casino Royale took some cues from the Bournes made the hero more brutal gave the visual a hint of grit.) But the notion of an amnesiac agent a spy with no past born into a web of intrigue search for his true identity is not automatically Oedipus Rex. Bourne who needs no sleep or food or pee breaks no downtime at all hes closer to the Terminator a national-security murder machine. Or to give Bourne a literary benefit of the doubt one of those questing creatures from a Philip K. Dick story a robot who dreams hes human and struggles to determine if the dream is true. No the movies even more than the Ludlum books (which long ago I consumed with equal velocity and voraciousness) are themselves machines beautifully constructed splendid to behold. And in this third and possibly final episode directed by Paul Greengrass from a script by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi the series has come close to attaining a kinetic perfection. If Ridley Scotts Black Hawk Down was the all-war war movie -- nearly two hours of nonstop battles -- The Bourne Ultimatum is the all-action action movie. A pounding of the eyes and ears (John Powells score is all urgent percussion) the movie is one continuous exhausting exhilarating chase. Eluding or dispatching bad guys fighting off six at a time in a stairwell wrecking more autos than in a NASCAR blooper reel Bourne speeds from London to Berlin to Tangier to New York City. Meanwhile his itinerary is monitored by CIA types -- the pompous desperate George Tenet-y David Strathairn and the more sympathetic Hillaryesque Joan Allen -- on world-scanning computer screens. They might be watching a video game. Certainly theyre trying to play Bourne like one Grand Theft Ego. Hes a weapon they created but to their chagrin hes in control of the trigger; he keeps going off and killing the thugs theyve assigned to kill him. ""Hes really good at staying alive"" Allen says of Bourne extending the movie-monster motif ""and trying to kill him just pisses him off."" Allen Strathairn and the movies other middle-age co-stars photograph about 20 years older than they did in their last films; Scott Glenns face has the bas-relief road-map look of the aged W.H. Auden. Thats partly to isolate the younger Damon generationally as well as geographically from his handlers but mainly because Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood are going for a verismo feel. The director who last year did the excellent docudrama United 93 has defined his Bourne location work as guerrilla filmmaking -- using concealed cameras in ""wild"" situations -- and he overuses the hand-held shaky-cam to shout visually that this is all real man ""You couldnt make this stuff up"" Glenns chracter wrily observes as if the audience doesnt know its watching a spy thriller. Its in those rare moments when the movie slows down as it does for plot-requisite conversations at the beginning and the end that The Bourne Ultimatum seems empty and ill-used like an interrogation room after a waterboarding. Greengrass cuts each action scene into agitated bits; but he cant let fast enough alone. Could he please explain why in the chat scenes the camera is afflicted with Parkinsons? The film frame trembles obscures the speaker with the listeners shoulder annoys viewers and distracts them from the content of the scene. It surely interrupted my enjoyment of the movie; for a minute I wanted to give it a good spanking. Greengrass isnt alone among serious directors who when they make an action film want it to be More Than. Well forget that. Just get an audience caught up in the Bourne web. Making a good action film is its own conspicuous achievement and Greengrass is a superb spinner of plates. And conductor of stunts. And car scenes. Bourne runs through three or four each movie -- those indestructo-cars that can be rammed and smashed spun stripped and flipped and still outrace and outlast all pursuers. In Damon Greengrass has an improbable but plausible Bourne. Moviegoers are so used to seeing Damon smile that he becomes someone else when he relaxes his features. His Bourne is a man of three expressions going blank which gives his features the slackness of a new corpse; showing wariness of imminent danger or unmasking like a naughty schoolboy who realizes hes being watched; and an instant later getting taut in situations where he expects the worst and tries to be prepared for it. The strategy is simple but effective. Damon uses the ordinariness of his appearance to help make Bourne invisible to his enemies a working-class hero to the audience. Thats the secret of this character and Bond and John McClane and all the other action-movie studs. They are a projection of American power -- or a memory of it and the poignant wish it could somehow return. In real life as a nation these days we can achieve next to nothing. But in the Bourne movies just one of us grim muscular and photogenic can take on all villains all at once and leave them outwitted dead disgraced. Thats a macho fantasy of the highest purest most lunatic order.

The choice is clear in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic PREV of NEXT JASIN BOLAND          Bourne (Matt Damon) and Nicky (Julia Stiles) are on the run in ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" JASIN BOLAND          Matt Damon as trained assassin Jason Bourne speeds through fabulous locations in Tangier Madrid London and New York. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" with Matt Damon Julia Stiles David Strathairn Scott Glenn Paddy Considine Edgar Ramirez Albert Finney Joan Allen. Directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi based on the novel by Robert Ludlum.111 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action. Watching Paul Greengrass jolting breathless chase thriller ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a bit like running on a treadmill You get a good workout even as the view remains predictable. This is the sort of movie in which somebody says ""Um he drove off the roof"" and it isnt a metaphor. Matt Damon as trained assassin Jason Bourne slips in and out of crowds rides his motorcycle up a concrete wall beats up a faceless army of guys who want to do him in jumps across rooftops races a car through the streets of Manhattan does a few nifty tricks with cellphones and never once cracks a smile. Not that hes got much reason to grin Bourne as we learned in ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (both based as is ""Ultimatum"" on the novels of the late Robert Ludlum) is haunted by his shadowy past; by the murder of his girlfriend Marie; and by the unpleasant fact that many people all over the world wish to kill him. And while the third movie reveals some previously unknown details of Bournes past hes still more of a video-game figure than a character. Damon a fine actor is reduced to looking elusive and shifty and to making cool-voiced cellphone calls from unexpected locations. Likewise the rest of the cast shift rapidly like chesspieces on a sped-up board with little time for performances. Joan Allen and David Strathairn as a pair of icy CIA types have a few scenes together that could be electric but the ever-moving cameras seem more interested in finding edgy angles than in letting the actors -- and the audience -- have a moment of calm. Greengrass devastating masterful ""United 93"" though fast-paced and chaotic took the time to find some quiet moments; ""Bourne Ultimatum"" though an utterly different kind of movie would have benefited from the same touches. Julia Stiles whose character Nicky (introduced in the first movie) finds herself on the run with Bourne has only one note for her performance wary. In one scene Nicky busily dyes and cuts her hair so she wont be recognized; its a deliberate echo of an on-the-run scene in ""The Bourne Identity"" when Jason gives Marie a very stylish new haircut. (Apparently its one of his spy superpowers.) Here the two just eye each other and the scene goes nowhere; as alas does Stiles new do. But even as the movies caffeinated pace grows familiar (the movie is a dead ringer for Greengrass ""The Bourne Supremacy"" in look and speed) you appreciate the skill with which its fitted together. Different locations -- Tangier Madrid London New York -- zip by breathlessly shaping the movies story in a series of overlapping hubs. Greengrass somehow manages to keep the pace aerobically snappy for almost two hours never letting it lag. You dont wonder about the tricky holes in the story (how on earth did Damon get into Strathairns office in a blink when weve already seen the lengthy security process Strathairns character had to go through to get there?) because you dont have time to wonder. And many of the action sequences (in a film made up almost entirely of action sequences with a few breaks in which characters bark orders at each other) are masterfully done particularly an early one set in Londons bustling Waterloo train station. In and out of the crowd Bourne goes slippery as a noodle never hesitating. The ever-cutting cameras seem to take on his character and his confidence always a step ahead of us keeping the audience leaning in breathlessly. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" may not break any new ground in cinema but as summer action movies go its like a cool drink familiar yet icily refreshing.

Matt Damon as Jason Bourne It feels odd during a week in which the film world lost two of its towering artists to pick up the baton of reviewing summer blockbusters again. But The Bourne Ultimatum is an ideal place to re-enter the flow because the pure jolt of narrative pleasure it provides reminds you just how powerful the pull of mainstream cinema can be. Paul Greengrass who also directed The Bourne Supremacy and last years nerve-racking United 93 is fluent in the idiom of the hand-held camera--an annoyingly overused technique but one that at its best excels at capturing disorientation anxiety and fear. Since these states of mind are the stuff of daily existence for the amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) Greengrass is perfectly at home in Bournes jittery world. I found United 93 almost too skillful for its own good surer of how to wring a cold sweat from its audience than of what it wanted to say. But when the source material is a Robert Ludlum spy thriller rather than one of the worst days in our countrys history that level of directorial calculation is more than welcome. Jason Bourne is a pretty calculating guy himself; since the death of his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in the second chapter of the trilogy The Bourne Supremacy hes been pursuing her killers around the globe under various assumed identities. At the beginning of Ultimatum with Maries death avenged we find him more introspective and brooding than ever. Fragments of his past as a CIA-bred killing machine are coming back (often in the form of clips from the first two Bourne movies). En route to uncovering his pre-brainwashing identity hes figuring out that the black-ops training program that stole his memory has mutated into something even scarier. Advertisement Under the direction of Noah Vosen (a silken David Strathairn) the agency has gone gonzo surveilling and targeting journalists passersby even its own agents when they start asking too many questions about the top-secret Blackbriar project. Bourne does have two allies within the agency Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) whos disillusioned by the dictatorial turn the agency has taken and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) a young agent whos been following Bourne since his pre-amnesia days. Nicky is the closest thing the movie has to a romantic interest but Bourne ever since losing his beloved to an assassins bullet has been a tough nut to crack. The fact that this action hero is still actively mourning his girlfriend two movies later is evidence enough that this is no typical franchise. Somber and melancholy Jason Bourne is the anti-James Bond. He may not be able to remember his own name but he cant forget Marie (and given that she was played by Franka Potente possibly the coolest moll in the history of spy thrillers who can blame him?). As for Stiles though shes finally given something to do this time around her blank stolid manner is too much like Damons to serve as a credible foil. The fiery Marie was someone youd want to be chased through southern India with; Nicky just seems like a pill. Still allowing for a few action-movie commonplaces (the wincing hero bandaging his own wounds in a fluorescent-lit public bathroom; the CIA op grimly informing his superior that ""we have a situation"") The Bourne Ultimatum feels fresher leaner and faster than any action movie in years. It zips from one acutely well-choreographed chase sequence to the next most notably a high-tech manhunt in Londons Waterloo Station and a one-on-one fistfight in an apartment in Tangiers. In this bravura sequence scored only with the sounds of heaving breath and cracking bones Bourne defends himself with whatever domestic weapon comes to hand a book a rag a toothbrush. When he finally does his opponent in a slack-jawed reaction shot of Julia Stiles stands in for the audiences own disbelief. Whether this third chapter in the series will turn out to be The Bourne Penultimatum or even the Bourne Antepenultimatum is left in suspense by the ending. On the one hand the ambivalent final frames all but bellow ""Sequel"" Then again assuming Jason Bourne really did manage both to find out his true identity and to live to tell about it what would be left for him to do?

Comments The Bourne Ultimatum The Bourne Identity (2002) turned on the novel premise of an amnesiac man gradually figuring out that hes a 30 million CIA killing machine now operating off the grid and hunted by company assassins; The Bourne Supremacy (2004) wrung some additional drama from the guilt-ridden Jason Bourne trying to make peace with his victims survivors. This adaptation of Robert Ludlums third and last Bourne thriller doesnt have much story left so director Paul Greengrass has to keep it moving all the time putting Matt Damon through endless car and foot chases and taking to a dizzying extreme his signature style of handheld camera lurching zooms whiplash pans and second-to-second editing. Joan Allen and Julia Stiles return as CIA operatives sympathetic to Bourne; David Strathairn and Albert Finney are the latest set of sinister black-ops guys who want the Bourne situation ""tied off"" as the euphemism goes.

SEE JASON RUN 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Bourne Ultimatum Action. Starring Matt Damon David Straitharn Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times and to buy tickets to select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Paul Greengrass directed the most artistically successful film about 9/11 ""United 93"" and put himself on the map as a director of consequence. That film documented the events of 9/11 as experienced on United Flight 93 which crashed in Pennsylvania. His new effort ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is less ambitious - its a satisfying action thriller that will make gazillions at the box office - but from the audiences standpoint it might be best to watch the movie as Greengrass second 9/11 statement. If ""United 93"" showed the tragedy ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" shows an America living with the aftermath. The events of 9/11 arent mentioned but they dont need to be as their aftershocks are all too apparent. This is a movie about fear - a governments fear of its citizens and citizens fear of their government. Its a movie about surveillance with people being watched at virtually every moment. Finally its about philosophies in collision about how much safety can be bought at the price of freedom and about the kinds of personalities that gravitate toward the totalitarian mind-set. Its about all these things even as it seems to be nothing more than a pretext for Matt Damon to spend two hours onscreen getting shot at. This is not to suggest that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a serious statement disguised as a straight-up action thriller. Rather its to say that somewhere in the making of this straight-up action thriller somebody wasnt afraid to let an idea or two slip in. Greengrass - who also directed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" the second film in the trilogy - and screenwriters Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi set their picture in the world that we all know one in which people are doing some of the very things that Americans today are worrying about. In the process the filmmakers capture some of the anxious spirit of the times. Jason Bourne is anxious too. Its three movies in and hes still not a happy person. He wants to know who he is and why he has more passports than most guys have socks and most of all he wants to find out how he became the strange being that he is - plagued by conscience yet emotionally detached a government-trained killing machine. When a London journalist indicates in a column that he knows something about the Bourne case Bourne goes to see him - and so do officials operating out of a special unit inside the CIA. Its a paranoids worst nightmare David Straitharn as Vosen the head of the special unit intends to do everything he can to make sure the secrets surrounding Bourne are never revealed and he has at his command armies of agents satellite technology and seeming access to every cell phone computer and surveillance camera on the face of the earth. An early action sequence in Waterloo Station in which Bourne tries to choreograph the moves of the journalist so that they both avoid government assassins is brilliantly executed. But beyond the appeal of the action theres a mythic aspect of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" thats worth savoring one that I suspect ""Iron John"" author Robert Bly would appreciate. Bourne is a young man who has been betrayed by old men - men he trusted like a good son. Thus the film presents a kind of metaphorical story of a son who was lied to and abandoned by fathers who are now trying to hide from the consequences. In any era that metaphor has powerful unconscious resonances but its reverberations become downright transcendental at those times when older men are betraying younger mens idealism by sending them into wars they cannot win. Albert Finney plays the psychiatrist who developed the program that turned Bourne into an assassin and he submits to some brutal close-ups. Bourne is searching for his father and all there is to find is this morally depraved old man with a face full of bloat and burst blood vessels. Greengrass shoots Finneys face in a bright uncompromising light that shows every pore and blemish and the idea becomes implicit Bourne sacrificed everything - for that. On the downside Greengrass shakes the camera too much and he sometimes shoots action in a way that makes it hard to know whats going on. Greengrass got away with his crazy camera in ""United 93"" for two reasons First the confined space made it impossible to lose the audience. And second an intensely subjective camera was appropriate there because everyone who had ever contemplated flight 93 had imagined himself or herself on that plane - so he was only showing us what wed already seen in our minds. He should have taken it a bit more easy in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" but all the same he has made a thoughtful superior action movie. -- Advisory This film contains violence stressful scenes and disturbing images.

"Thrilling ultimate `Bourne - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeThrilling ultimate `BourneBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 08/02/2007 013632 AM PDTUpdated 08/02/2007 065923 AM PDT ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" opens with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) hobbling away from the Moscow car chase that gave ""The Bourne Supremacy"" its rip-roaring climax three years ago. From that first moment to the last of this peerlessly mounted action thriller the chase never stops. Bournes nerve never falters or that of director Paul Greengrass either. Damon has said this is the final installment of the terrifically intelligent ""Bourne"" series which began in 2002 with ""The Bourne Identity"" and is based on Robert Ludlums trilogy of novels. If you believe him it means ""Ultimatum"" has three endings the ending at the beginning the ending at the end and the ending - of these movies forever - that never ends. That makes it all the more fitting then that this final chapter marks Bournes headlong assault on the CIA to find out who turned him into an assassin and how. As he tries to recall who programmed him Bourne keeps hearing someone ask in a dream ""Can you commit to this program?"" Hoo boy can he ever Its his relentless commitment that makes Jason Bourne beautiful. He will not stop. And we get to ride shotgun. ""Ultimatum"" which opens at midnight tonight in some theaters cleverly catches us up with Bournes lethal progression through the ranks of CIA evildoers and overlords by taking that small first step backward to ""Supremacy.Advertisement "" Almost as soon as Bourne is finished avenging the murder of his girlfriend from the first movie characters who werent in the second picture - CIA director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) and his diabolical director of black-ops Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) - are plotting his demise in the third film. Finding him becomes both a possibility and a necessity when a highly-placed source within the agency - someone who was ""there at the beginning"" - tells a reporter for a British newspaper (Paddy Considine) about Bourne and about Treadstone the murderous operation that created him. A new program called Blackbriar has been set up allowing Vosen to bypass all the pesky constitutional hand-wringing that used to accompany his impulse for murder on demand. Now its a slow day when he hasnt ordered an assassination before ordering lunch. When the reporter writes a story about Treadstone Bourne calls him and offers to meet at Londons Waterloo Station a crowded railway hub bristling with closed-circuit cameras and soon enough CIA hit men. Using the station like a high-speed chess board Greengrass sets the pieces in motion. Despite all the resources arrayed against Bourne he has the advantage of being able to see at least two moves ahead. These spy vs. spy set pieces put into action the subtext that makes the ""Bourne"" movies so profoundly satisfying He is the ultimate outsider the wary lone wolf who not only resists being eaten by the pack but being made leader of it. The CIA surveillance center - which is located in New York and unaccountably has stationery bearing its embossed address - has cameras and electronic sensors in every corner of the globe. As Bourne races from Turin to Tangier in search of the source behind the reporters story it appears that nothing and no one is beyond its reach. And yet every time Bourne lights up the agencys monitors Vosen is left sputtering things like ""What the hell is this?"" and ""What just happened?"" Strathairn seems at first too buttoned-down to lead a flying squad of hit men; its like Edward R. Murrow trying to play Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano. The character also lacks subtlety. Vosens solution to every problem is to kill it. And you would think his last job was running CTU on the TV series ""24"" because he is forever calling for ""perimeters"" to be set up putting buildings on ""lockdown"" and referring to the people who work for him as ""people."" As in ""People thats a Code 10 abort"" When Bourne slips through the CIAs grasp Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) the nail-spitting agent who hunted him in ""Supremacy"" is brought into the chase. Also returning is Julia Stiles as Treadstones continental op Nicky Parsons who has been given a great deal more to do this time and does it with style. Strathairn comes into his own in the pictures final act as Vosens mounting fury at Bournes ability to elude every killer he throws at him develops into one of the movies most acute pleasures. There are others - too many to mention and too surprising to spoil. When they have finally stopped chasin Jason we see him floating amniotically as if he were drifting in space. Whether he is still Bourne or will be reborn remains part of the history of his mystery.

Burns Tony Gilroy George Nolfi Tom Stoppard; Release Date Wide 08/03/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted August 1 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT Marveling at the uncanny off-center camera technique of Jaws Alfred Hitchcock during a TV interview late in his life offered the following description of the director he referred to as ""young Spielberg "" ""Hes the first one of us who doesnt see the proscenium arch."" Spielberg in other words was the first mainstream filmmaker whose visual awareness didnt derive from the classic spatial dynamics of the theater. Watching The Bourne Ultimatum with its swervy headlong you are there images of a man on the run from forces he senses yet cannot see I remembered Hitchcocks words and I thought If Spielberg doesnt see the proscenium arch then Paul Greengrass barely even sees the stage. Hes that live-wire and intoxicating a wizard of suspense. In The Bourne Ultimatum the camera mostly handheld follows the characters through train stations airports and the bowels of sinister office buildings (the prospect of a CIA headquarters hidden in Manhattan is a lot scarier than the one in Langley) and through the ancient zigzag stone alleys of Madrid and Tangier. At times it zooms down from the sky homing in on vehicles like a heat-seeking missile. Yet rarely if ever is there a cozy master shot. Each image is torn aggressively out of the one before it -- the movie doesnt seem to be creating the action but catching it on the fly -- and the result is that hardly a moment goes by that we dont experience in the moment. In one bravura sequence Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) the renegade CIA assassin who is being hunted across three continents tries to meet up with a British journalist (Paddy Considine) who has information that can connect Bourne to his past -- that is to his brainwashed-away identity. Shooting in downtown London Greengrass nudges this predicament into a densely layered and exciting pursuit that rides along on tiny jagged explosions of peril and cunning. Bourne with his programmed existential reflexes keeps telling the journalist by cell phone where to go keeping him just out of the view of surveillance cameras; one wrong step and hell be an assassins target a victim of Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) the head scoundrel in charge who is monitoring it all in the CIA control room. Its like a scene out of Coppolas The Conversation kicked up to nervous high alert. You take it in not with your brain but through your feelers -- your technological third eye. The civilians who swirl around in a rush-hour blur look as if they couldnt possibly be extras. Nothing feels remotely staged yet theres a hidden design to the disorder and it comes from Greengrass elevation of voyeurism into a state of near-metaphysical awareness as we watch the filmmaker watch Bourne watch his connection as hes watched by cameras that are watched by enemies who are desperate to kill him. Tense nervy and dazzling The Bourne Ultimatum has other scenes that tingle with ingenuity like one in which Bourne sets up a fake meeting with Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) the spymaster whos now on his side as bait to clear out the CIA office. Or a car chase that makes you feel every crunch and bend as the vehicles play bumper cars with the concrete. Greengrass too stages hand-to-hand combat with a thwacky viciousness that feels less choreographed than anything he did in The Bourne Supremacy. It may be that this director is liberated to create action with such whirling physical freedom because the story by now verges on the abstract. This is the movie in which Bourne finally uncovers what happened to him -- a mystery that pays off though with a bit of musty 80s Cold War didacticism. Damon with that bruised scowling baby face turns himself into more of a haunted machine than ever. He makes Bourne such a minimalist hero -- a walking rifle slug all frigid resolve -- that his human-Terminator terseness has become a form of wit. What he cant do is lend Bournes journey more than a token of topical urgency. Ditto for Greengrass attempt to tone up the smeary brainwash flashbacks with ""relevant"" Abu Ghraib hoods. The Bourne Ultimatum is a spectacular windup toy of a thriller -- a contraption made by an artist. It cant really be said however that the movie takes you anyplace new. Thats perhaps too much to ask of a part-three sequel based on a Robert Ludlum novel. Yet Greengrass who stages even the simplest scene as if he were playing connect-the-dots in 3-D has the talent to make revelatory genre movies -- and as he proved in United 93 to elevate fear and courage into a heart-in-the-throat catharsis. Thats a gift I predict that will one day take him to Spielbergian levels. Heres hoping that he never starts seeing the stage.

Published in 1990 and the last of the Bourne thrillers to be written by Ludlum himself The Bourne Ultimatum brought to a head Jason Bournes struggle with his arch-nemesis Carlos the Jackal -- the real-life terrorist whose maverick operations will signify little or nothing to the Bourne target audience. The visceral thrills in the latest movie expertly directed by Paul Greengrass (who also made The Bourne Supremacy) are beamed at a worldwide generation that casually takes for granted both the notion of a globally power-hungry America and ambiguous creatures like Jason Bourne who knows not whether hes hero or villain or both.Played with his customary intensity by Matt Damon whos looking at last more like a man than an overgrown gym rat Jason spends his days wandering the globe stateless and friendless as ever. The identity crisis that agonized him in Doug Limans The Bourne Identity has shifted into murkier and potentially more interesting territory. Bourne knows who he is now (CIA straight arrow Pamela Landy played by Joan Allen told him at the end of The Bourne Supremacy) and who killed his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) but he remains tormented by the question of how he became an assassin (did he go or was he pushed?) while his former masters are bothered by the fact that such a malfunctioning loose-cannon killer poses a clear and present danger to their freshly amped plan for ruling the world. That plan is never made entirely clear -- which is more or less the point given that the primary goal is victory for its own sake. Dubya are you listening?In Bourne-speak Operation Treadstone (which perhaps because I found the first two Bournes efficient but dull I keep remembering as Operation Treadmill) has been upgraded to the far more attractive far more lethal Operation Blackbriar and moved to a London HQ more convenient to frequent flights by train air cell phone and e-mail to colorful European locales with occasional trips home to Langley Virginia. There lurks Scott Glenn up to no good and as terse of speech as his flinty London counterpart Noah Vosen played by David Strathairn among whose many skills is the ability to say ""Listen up people this is a full-priority situation"" without cracking up. Actually everyone is entertainingly terse in this movie which screenwriters Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi have rescued from Ludlums lumpy prose only to pepper it with dialogue straight out of a boys own comic book. Under Vosens dour supervision with Landy as resident patsy should things fall apart Blackbriars game plan can be summed up as a series of excuses for leather-jacketed internationals in woolly caps to chase Jason and be chased in turn around Waterloo Station Paris Turin and Madrid all the while demonstrating the expendability of human life especially the lives of its own agents. If thats all you ask of The Bourne Ultimatum it will be quite enough.There is minimal distaff distraction -- Julia Stiles returns in a becomingly streaked bob to gaze mournfully at Jason and execute plucky leaps between buildings in Morocco. But mostly Greengrass treats us to an escalating collection of exquisitely choreographed car chases blowups and -- Bourne being the do-it-yourself one-man-against-the-system fellow that he is -- hand-to-hand combat and the use of common electric fans as nifty decoys. With every twist of the final pileup on the streets of Manhattan -- a sequence of unbelievable technical chutzpah -- the man next to me rose in his seat grunted happily and gently resettled.

The best action movies strain against genre but there isnt a single player in The Bourne Ultimatum you could plausibly call a character -- not even Jason flailing around in moral agony as he fastidiously picks and chooses between true baddies and victims of The System. Underneath its thin plotting the movie seems to be reaching for something new to say about the death of idealism and the self-perpetuating self-defeating nature of superpower espionage. For a thriller about the changing terrain of global terror though The Bourne Ultimatum is strikingly circumspect even timidly distinguished for what it completely ignores -- namely the war between Islamic jihad and the West which despite a busy visit to Tangier (where was the burqa when Julia needed it?) doesnt merit so much as a look-in. Ludlum was a cold warrior through and through; Greengrass gives great fight but seems unsure what or for whom its being fought. Which makes you wonder whether Jason Bourne or whoever he is is really keeping America safe from itself -- or just saving it for the next sequel.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM | Directed by PAUL GREENGRASS | Written by TONY GILROY SCOTT Z.

"Fleets in - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Fleets in3rd Bourne keeps Damon on the run audience on the edgeAugust 03 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie criticTHE BOURNE ULTIMATUM 3 1/2 StarsHas a films running time in this case a breathless 115 minutes ever involved so much actual running? The superbly kinetic action picture ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" treats its own narrative almost abstractly as a series of hurdles to be knocked over quickly casually en route to the next futile attempt on Jason Bournes life.This is the most satisfying thriller of the year capping the Bourne trilogy taken from the Robert Ludlum novels. The films are faithful to those books in name only. Ludlum is one kind of popular storyteller. Director Paul Greengrass is another. Ludlum used 10 exclamation points in the two-page prologue to ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" The film version doesnt have time for exclamation points; it barely has time for dialogue.Matt Damon as effectively taciturn (near-mute even) as he was in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" three years ago returns as the CIA-trained assassin in search of his brain-washing handlers and a little rest. Even more valuably director Greengrass returns alongside Damon. The filmmaker took over the ""Bourne"" franchise with the second installment and he is the primary reason No. 2 and No. 3 are something special. These films are pure velocity practically without let-up. They come with plenty of identifiable tricks the restless woozy-making hand-held camera work; the eye-blink cutting rhythms (Christopher Rouse edited all three ""Bourne"" films plus the superb Greengrass docudrama ""United 93""); the unusual realism of the physical violence. Yet Greengrass is a master of pacing. He favors the prestissimo but miraculously hes not a pounder.The globe-trotting budget of ""Ultimatum"" rumored to be in the 130 million-150 million range is easily twice that of the last one. Potential disaster there. Was Greengrass giving in to blockblustery gigantism simply because he could? Turns out he wasnt. The new one may zip all over the world but it doesnt feel appreciably larger or more consciously dazzling than its predecessor. It is built for speed like its bullet-headed protagonist.Bournes secret training program Treadstone has been rejiggered as something called ""Blackbriar"" and a Guardian newspaper reporter is about to break the story of this secret below-the-radar spy program wide open. Bournes ruthless former keepers interrupt a meeting between Bourne and the reporter in a London train station. This is the first of many action set-pieces the most remarkable being an exhilarating rooftop chase through Tangier involving Bourne; his pursuer Paz (Edgar Ramirez); Bournes ally Nicky (Julia Stiles who really does seem like someone you could trust with a secret); and hapless Moroccan cops.Nearly every Greengrass film features a ""war room"" and a war going on somewhere else. The figures of authority remain comfortably behind the control station unable to control their situation. Here the smugly unctuous pooh-bah of power is played by David Strathairn governmental shadow operation incarnate. At one grimacing moment in a breakfast meeting with Joan Allen his intel inferior but in every way his superior Strathairns character orders a ""heart-healthy omelet."" Why? For his non-existent heart? Good line; good actor making the most of a role spun out of exposition and twigs.""The Bourne Ultimatum"" hops from Moscow to London to Madrid to Tangier to New York City. To the screenwriters credit you generally know why Bourne is where he is. Now and then the action threatens to grow as seizure-like as a Michael ""Transformers"" Bay outing. There are some major differences however. Bay rarely shows you anything like ordinary human behavior; hes a hopelessly kitschy glamorizer as well as an action thug. Greengrass by contrast knows how to work over an audience without pulling their collective spine out just for kicks the way you suspect Bay would if he could and not get sued. In the one-on-one combat sequences ""Ultimatum"" goes for the jugular yet the violence doesnt have that wearying tinge of sadism so many thrillers rely upon. Composer John Powell another ""Bourne"" alum complements the mayhem rather than competing with it.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDamon was born to be Jason BourneAugust 8 2007Bourne Legacy Franchise weakens as it branches off...August 9 2012OK that settles itAugust 26 2005Find More Stories AboutJason BourneBourne SupremacyBourne UltimatumRobert LudlumTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-08-03/entertainment/0708020802_1_jason-bourne-bourne-ultimatum-bourne-supremacy,200,thebourneultimatum28,thebourneultimatum,chicagotribune
"The Bourne Ultimatum Chases Its Tiresome Tale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Bourne Ultimatum Chases Its Tiresome Tale Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 3 2007 Is it BABOOMBABOOMBABOOM -- BABABABABOOM Or possibly Dumb-da-dumb-da-dumb-da-dumb-da-DUMB Or last Boffa-bobba-bap-bap-bappity-bap I give up. No medium as thin as language can capture the snare-drum riffs that propel ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" along faster than the speed of sound light and thought. Its not a movie; its a trip through a gun barrel at the head of a cloud of exploding gas and you end up splattered against a wall then sliding into the dust with the sound of the drums ringing in your head for hours. Good? Who could tell? Its like watching french fries crackle in a spew of hot bubbles in the back of a Mickey Ds. Do the actors act? Again you got me. Does it make sense? Ask the scriptwriters; theyd probably have a good idea. Does it give you a headache? Hmm about the size of beautiful downtown Rockville. The third in the series of films derived from novels by the late Robert Ludlum it stars Matt Damon and is the second to be directed by Paul Greengrass the brilliant Brit who like everybody affiliated with the project is much too good for it. Other luminaries whose careers will be tarnished by this express train without destination include Damon himself (grown grave and tragic in his mid-30s) Julia Stiles Joan Allen David Strathairn and Scott Glenn whose face looks like the Grand Canyon from 40000 feet. All of these people have immense amounts of talent and they all walk around with their secret-agent faces on scowling and saying things like ""People we have a national security alert here now dammit; lets get cracking"" Try to say that three times fast with your jaw clenched like a fist and see if you dont fall to the floor laughing. Greengrass God help us has a style brilliantly deployed in his documentary-style re-creations such as ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" but its sorely overused here never settling down to give us poor protoplasm sacks a chance to rest. He doesnt want us to catch our breath which his why his SteadyMount camera guy (now theres a boy who earned his paycheck) dances around his subjects as if hes the third member of a two-man conspiracy always close enough to hear the muttering likely as not to get knocked flat in a fight completely out of breath in the movies too many chase sequences. The plot seems to be Jason Bourne who two movies ago awoke with no memory while floating face-down in the sea but with a great number of alarming unexplained skills (he can start any motor vehicle with his fingernails and flip any 10th-dan black belt into the balcony) is closing in on the puppet masters who vacuumed his brain and turned him into an assassin automaton. (Clearly I have failed in my attempt to convince the American people that ""amnesiac superagents"" should be banned from the movies.) In any event after the movies dim opening (to connect it to the last one which ended in a car chase in Moscow) Bourne is headed to England to link up with a British reporter who has knowledge of the black op that programmed Jason while the agency is politicized (Allen is the liberal exec Strathairn the conservative) by the crisis and tries to either kill him (the con position) or bring him in (the lib). At this point the movie deploys a modus operandi that it will cling to throughout. It devolves essentially into three behaviors The first is downloading. Oh say its really interesting to watch the bytes trickle down the computer screen while the newly accessed data drizzle in and we learn (if were bothering to pay attention) who the players are what their relationships are what team they play for and whether they bat ""L"" and throw ""R"" or the other way around. The second is the Multitask Chase. Greengrass isnt content to have A chase B. Instead he has A chase B while fleeing C as B meanwhile chases D to kill her. Clearly A (Bourne) is the key figure because hes got to keep moving toward B while evading C but never forgetting to care for D which is like trying to figure a trig problem in your head in the prison shower with the Noble Pagans MC. Its pretty silly particularly when Bourne chases a Moroccan hitman who chases Stiles while the Moroccan police chase all of them. The last key component of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (no ultimatum is ever issued or even mentioned by the way) can only be called the John Frankenheimer Ultimatum. This is a scenario repeated seemingly ad infinitum just as the great director did back in the ""Playhouse 90"" control room in the days of live TV. As it plays out in ""Bourne"" the senior exec takes command of a roomful of techies at monitors and its so razzle-dazzle that we forget we are watching people in a room talking. ""Sir hes moved to 11th --"" ""Go to green Number 7"" ""Sir on Ninth hes picked up a cellphone and -- theres the TARGET TARGET ACQUIRED"" ""Prepare to vector."" ""Roger that vectoring commenced."" ""Vector vector -- "" ""Hes de-vectored the vector."" ""Wilson I told you to stay on the vector."" ""Sorry sir."" ""Sir Scotland Yard is arriving down 13th Street"" and on and on it goes achieving a surrealistic delirium as everyone tries to out-wonk-voice the other. For a while the movie plays its games in various sordid European locales but eventually it moves to New York figuring if it can make it there it can make it anywhere. Frenetic to the point of crazy while achieving a mark that barely exceeds the mediocre ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" does have a few nice touches. It has a car chase (multitasked of course) with real cars where the stunt guys do some tremendous real-time real-space crashing on the actual streets of New York. Then theres the climax of that 3-hour 17-minute Moroccan quadruple relay race where Bourne and the hitman end up trying to beat the Jockeys off each other which in Greengrasss rendering is immensely physical an epic of strength on strength and pain threshold on pain threshold. It could be edited into ""300"" and nobody would notice. But I reached my pain threshold halfway through the opening credits so the rest was pure hell. The Bourne Ultimatum (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and intense action.

"This `Ultimatum Bourne is the best one yet - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bourne This `Ultimatum Bourne is the best one yetmoviesAugust 3 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticJason Bourne brings it all home with a bang a big bang in the breathless finale to the Bourne trilogy The Bourne Ultimatum. This adrenaline-charged bullet-riddled sprint from Moscow to New York is the best of the Bourne films a politically charged actioner with chases brawls shootouts and dry wit that never relies on one-liners.Matt Damon has grown into the role of Bourne an amnesiac government assassin slowly gathering memories of who he was and how he came to be. The physical demands of the role -- a brutal command of the martial arts a willingness to hurl himself hither and yon heedless of danger trained out of any fear able to act and react -- come easily believably to an actor who seemed to need a lot more stunt and camera trickery to get through his baby-faced turn in The Bourne Identity back in 2002.An A-list cast of character actors the great director Paul Greengrass who took time off from spying to make United 93 and editor Christopher Rouse have conjured up the action film of the summer.Ultimatum picks up the story in Moscow where Bourne escapes the clutches of the last Treadstone operatives after turning the tables on their leader (Brian Cox). With Coxs character and (in the first Bourne movie) Chris Coopers original ""control"" dead Pamela Landy the CIA section chief on his case (Joan Allen) has figured out that the survival move on her part is to not want Bourne dead. Shes sympathetic and wants to bring him in.But the vast right-wing conspiracy in charge (Scott Glenn heads the CIA David Strathairn is his new covert killing kingpin) still want the ""rogue agent"" silenced.Thats because bits of Bournes story are reaching the vigilant British press in the person of a reporter (Paddy Considine) who is on to Treadstones successor codename Blackbriar. The ability to monitor international cell-phone traffic means the spies are on to the reporter. And Bourne reading his story in print is on to him too. Who will get to the guy first?The tale races from Paris to London to Turin to Tangier as Bourne pulls in bits of memory about people involved in his ruthless training.""Will you commit to this program?"" comes to him in the voice of Albert Finney. Thats who he has to find. In between blackouts.Strathairn playing Noah Vosen a not-quite-panicked bureaucrat with blood on his hands hurls out words weve heard on the news to his subordinates -- ""Rendition."" ""Experimental interrogation."" ""Imminent threat."" All to do with CIA justifications for illegal actions and all pertaining to Bourne. He calls in assorted ""assets"" to snuff him out.That cute low-level field officer Nikki (Julia Stiles finally old enough to play this) comes back into the picture. She exchanges a lot of blank-faced but meaningful stares with Bourne whose memory of losing his German girlfriend in The Bourne Supremacy is still fresh.A car chase in New York a motorcycle and foot race in the glorious housing clutter of Tangier a nervy get-away in Londons Waterloo Station and a hand-to-hand struggle to the death with an assassin all add up to a movie that rarely takes a breather for character. The few slow moments seem trite by comparison. A visit to the brother of the dead girlfriend Stiles stone-faced flirtation all unmoving. Strathairn and Allen bicker in front of subordinates like an old married couple complete with CIA acronyms and spy-craft jargon.""When does this end?"" Landy barks.""When we win"" Vosen hisses back.All the while their smart bomb who has wandered off-target is recovering memories and questioning the morality of all this following orders all this violence.The Bourne movies rarely waste a moment showing how Bourne gets from place to place with a new passport money a new gun and a plan. He just doesThe way Greengrass Damon cinematographer Oliver Wood editor Rouse and composer John Powell package these movies chases should be in film-school textbooks. Shoot the hurried Damon with a hand-held camera fairly tight so that it jostles and jumps as he stride-sprints. Cut to extreme close-ups of Bourne a villains neck a gun being assembled the door of a Ford Expedition a locale all in a seizure-inducing blur. Add a pulsing Hitchcockian score and every Bourne rushes past in a flurry of images impressions of people places incidents all creating a feeling that time is running out.Which it is. But this conclusion to Bournes odyssey assures us that while his trilogy may be over spy movies will never be the same. Bourne ultimately has reinvented them.

BurnsStarring Matt Damon Joan Allen David Strathairn Julia Stiles The first 20 minutes of The Bourne Ultimatum the third and final chapter in the trilogy about the baby-faced C.I.A. operative with amnesia are better than Transformers Pirates of the Caribbean I II and III and anything with Bruce Willis all put together. From there its uphill all the way. A knockout roller-coaster ride custom-made for adrenaline junkies its easily the savviest and most satisfying spy movie in years besting both of its preceding Bournes--Identity and Supremacy. Picking up mere seconds from where the last one left off the film opens on Matt Damons Jason Bourne in Moscow where the brain-scrambled super-spy is still hot on the trail of his own identity having just tracked down a relative of one of his former victims. After enough expository flashbacks to catch up the uninitiated the movie puts the pedal to the metal and never shifts gears for two hours straight. The action shifts to London where a Guardian reporter (Paddy Considine) with a high-level source inside the C.I.A. has stumbled onto the story of Blackbriar the secret C.I.A. program that replaced Treadstone the botched C.I.A. program that created a squad of brainwashed government assassins of which we now learn Jason Bourne was the pilot candidate. Splashing Bournes name all over the British tabloids the reporter brings the full force of the C.I.A. down on Jasons hapless head luring him back to England to search for clues. A meeting between hero and reporter goes awry and suddenly Bourne is back on his quest to fit together the pieces of the elusive puzzle that will ultimately lead him back to the shadowy place that spawned him. Its here in London that we meet the crack team of spooks and G-men that oversees the 24-hour video and audio surveillance networks that our governments have so lovingly assembled for our protection in a paranoid world. (Think no ones listening in on your cellphone conversations? Think again.) Leading the C.I.A. scabs as they break every law in the books is Noah Vosen played smartly against type by David Strathairn. As soon as the oily Vosen gets wind of Bournes presence in London he pulls out all the stops to nab him--and people start to die. The ingenious ways they die pump oxygen into the bloodstream of The Bourne Ultimatum keeping you dizzy and creeping you out. Bring smelling salts. Unlike the grandiose megalomaniacal archfiends in the James Bond franchise the assassins in the Bourne films have been played by some of our most down-to-earth character actors--everymen like Chris Cooper Brian Cox and now Strathairn. The message is clear and its chilling the sang-froid of the Treadstone and Blackbriar spies may be the stuff of escapist Robert Ludlum fiction but the men who play them are all too real. If the Bourne series does stretch to another installment (without Matt Damon) then dont be surprised to see the Abe Lincoln countenance of nice guy Sam Waterston dispatching bounty hunters to wipe out women and children. The enemies here are the nameless faceless morally ambiguous bureaucrats who keep the system chugging along year after year no matter who lives in the Oval Office. Who do you think is stationed in Washington typing up transcripts of all those government wiretaps? They have to be familiar faces at P.T.A. and town hall planning-board meetings somewhere. In the end thats a much scarier proposition than a guy in Armani with a solid-gold Rolls Royce who wants to blow up Fort Knox. Fortunately except for a few lines of hammy dialogue by Tony Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns that hint too obviously at the current administration British director Paul Greengrass (United 93) is content to leave the political commentary in the subtext. Instead he wisely concentrates on serving up thrills and spills and lots of them--all flawlessly executed. In almost every action movie these days the plot skids to a halt at random points while the actors blow things up or beat the hell out of each other. Here every single set piece--the cat-and-mouse game in Waterloo Station the rooftop footrace in Tangier the de rigueur car chase through the streets of Manhattan--is shot and edited at Grand Prix speed yet the film never loses its momentum balance or sense of story and character. By the end Bourne survives more explosions and demolitions than Wile E. Coyote. The scene where he drives himself off the roof of a parking garage strains credulity to be sure but by then youre so wrapped up in the story that youll relish every curve the movie throws at you. In addition to Strathairns fine turn as Vosen Joan Allen does well in her returning role as Pamela Landy Bournes only ally on the inside. And Albert Finney adds a dangerous tone to the finale as the Dr. Mengele behind the birth of Jason Bourne. The only false note is Julia Stiles who reprises her role from the first two films in what seems like a contrived plot-straining coincidence. But they all lend support in the truest sense because its Matt Damons show all the way. Bourne is a bit of a cipher; his whole identity is that he has no identity. In the hands of a less accomplished actor that might be a recipe for blandness. But Damon is a hard-working beaver who brings such intensity and singularity of purpose to the role that you cant take your eyes off him. Not too difficult since hes in almost every frame of film but still quite an admirable feat to demand and get the kind of serious attention that is justified. If The Bourne Ultimatum is purportedly the end of the franchise its both a blessing and a shame. Few filmmakers and fewer movie stars have the good sense to leave well enough alone when they smell more money waiting in the sequel trough. As a trilogy the Bourne movies added up to a single thrilling arc of a narrative. We dont need another. Mr. Damon says he has thrown in the towel with this one. Smart guy. He knows an exit line when he hears one.

And they focused mainly on the ballyhooed blockbusters that came out at the beginning of the summer third installments in the ""Spider-Man"" ""Shrek"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchises. But now as were creeping into August traditionally a dumping-ground time at the movies we have easily the best threequel of all. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" kicks all of their butts - literally and figuratively. Its the first one that doesnt feel like a dragged-out continuation of a series but rather a climactic satisfying culmination. (Though who knows? The ending does leave the door open for the possibility of ""Bourne 4."") Paul Greengrass who also directed part two 2004s ""The Bourne Supremacy"" as well as the riveting ""United 93"" continues to prove himself a master of mood. Hes done something astonishing here Hes made an action film thats both delicate and aggressive a difficult balance to strike. Its all stuff youve seen before - car chases fistfights international jet-setting and spy vs. spy intrigue - but its so expertly crafted and the cast is so superb that ""Bourne Ultimatum"" exceeds all expectations of the genre. Matt Damon remains a strong stoic force in the center as the amnesiac assassin of Robert Ludlums novels still seeking answers about his past. David Strathairn Joan Allen and Julia Stiles co-star.

"Bourne Ultimatum The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bourne-ultimatum-the ) Bourne Ultimatum The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli If nothing else The Bourne Ultimatum represents the best of 2007s inordinately high number of so-called ""threequels."" Hopefully thats not damning with faint praise. The Bourne Ultimatum the third in the movie trilogy loosely based on Robert Ludlums novels is superior to its immediate predecessor but not quite as good as the original. The action is this movie is top-notch (despite the spastic camera) - full of suspense and kinetic energy - but the film doesnt have as much heart or emotional depth as The Bourne Identity. As with The Bourne Supremacy this movie diverts so far from its ""source material"" that the only things retained from Ludlums novel are the title and some of the character names. (Shades of how the James Bond movie producers approached many of Ian Flemings books.) Ludlums version of The Bourne Ultimatum is completely different from the one penned by Tony Gilroy and directed by Paul Greengrass. The film moves so fast theres almost no time to breathe. Although the plot may at first seem convoluted its actually fairly straightforward. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) as part of his ongoing quest to discover his true identity once again becomes a danger to the CIA. So the departments black ops division led by Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) targets him for elimination. Also conspiring against him is the agencys director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) but Bourne has allies as well agents Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) endanger their careers and lives to help him. The Bourne Ultimatum globe hops with the best of its genre Moscow Paris London Madrid Tangier New York. Bourne is always on the move sometimes acting as the hunter and sometimes being the quarry (and often both at the same time). One could argue its a little exhausting but the action is consistently excellent - if only the same thing could be same could be said of the manner in which Greengrass has chosen to film it. Looking back on The Bourne Identity its easy to be impressed by the clarity with which Doug Liman directed the action sequences. Greengrass on the other hand prefers fast cuts and an unsteady camera. Even during static shots (such as a simple conversation with close-ups) its as if the cameraman has Parkinsons. Things arent as bad here as in 28 Weeks Later but there are brief instances when the inability to figure out whats going on diminishes the effectiveness of the action. Still its hard to deny that Greengrass approach generates intensity. There are two standout sequences. Tension is enhanced in both because not only is Bourne trying to outthink and outflank the bad guys but hes also responsible for protecting someone else. In the first one he and a reporter for The Guardian Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) are trapped by enemy operatives in Londons Waterloo Station. The second involves a chase through the roads and across the rooftops of Tangier as Bourne attempts to intercept a key contact who has knowledge of his past while keeping himself and Nicky alive. Matt Damon once again plays Bourne perfectly - its a largely impassive kick-ass performance that draws the viewer in. Bourne doesnt delight in killing but he doesnt shy away from it either. Theres a kinship one can sense between him and the newest James Bond. Julia Stiles and Joan Allen get a chance to show softer sides of their hard-edged characters. In the past both played Bournes adversaries; here theyre his allies. David Strathairn the excellent character actor who is favored by John Sayles oozes white collar menace. Albert Finneys inclusion in the cast may confuse viewers with imperfect memories because he looks a lot like Brian Cox who was in the other two movies. When it comes to action The Bourne Ultimatum trumps the summers other offerings. While its stunts are no less preposterous than those in Live Free or Die Hard (in fact both films feature ""flying"" cars) what The Bourne Ultimatum offers is grittier and more visceral. And while there are fewer special effects here The Bourne Ultimatum provides a lot more suspense and tension than Transformers could hope for. As to whether this is the last cinematic chapter in Jason Bournes life one suspects that depends on the box office receipts. Certainly the door is left open for more adventures.

By David Denby Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in Paul Greengrasss movie.   Credit FRANK STOCKTON Matt Damon at least in the ""Bourne"" series looks like a bullet. He has short hair no stubble to speak of and a blunt nose. In violent scenes his eyes go dead and he has a strong compact body which he hurls through the frame ricocheting off walls windows cars and fences. In person Damon is thoughtful and friendly with a ready smile and he has shown an increasing range as an actor. Sociable and fast-talking in ""The Departed"" he was glum and all but immobile in ""The Good Shepherd."" As the C.I.A. assassin Jason Bourne however Damon is a smooth and deadly object. His directors in the series--Doug Liman in ""The Bourne Identity"" and Paul Greengrass in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and now ""The Bourne Ultimatum""--have kept him almost continuously in motion racing down streets and along corridors leaping across rooftops. Bourne is intimate with many cities--Berlin London Paris Madrid--and incapable of hesitation he runs without a stumble though their mazelike neighborhoods markets and railroad stations. No office or hotel-room door remains impenetrable; no safe remains locked. Robert Ludlum created the character--in his 1980 novel ""The Bourne Identity""--as a black-ops assassin whose brain had been wiped clean before he was programmed to kill. The writers who adapted Bourne for the screen (Tony Gilroy has been a constant along with various collaborators) took over Ludlums notion for the character while dropping his literary sludge; they enhanced Bournes locomotive skills and gave him a soul. This Jason Bourne is so anguished by his crimes that he develops amnesia but he gradually remembers the bad things he has done and is haunted by them. Having participated in illegal operations Bourne is a menace to the C.I.A. which has no further use for him and would like to be rid of him. The basic setup of all three movies is that the agency tracks his movements with banks of computers and surveillance equipment under the control of powerful people barking intel gibberish at one another while Bourne tries to evade them and also the various goons some working for the C.I.A. some not who are trying to kill him. Eventually he gets himself in a position to survey the surveyors and hunt the hunters. He has them under his control. But all he wants to do is reclaim himself from his induced oblivion. Summing up the first two films Manohla Dargis (then at the Los Angeles Times) said that the drama of ""Identity"" was existential (Who am I?) and the drama of ""Supremacy"" was moral (What did I do?). I would say that the drama of ""Ultimatum"" is redemptive How can I escape what I am? The creators of the black-ops program are shown to have used such techniques as hooding and waterboarding to break down and remake Bournes personality and he wants to find them. Commenting acidly on current interrogation techniques the filmmakers suggest that such games were played with Americans as well as with outsiders. This may be a fiction but its a sinister thought. In the end Bourne reaches the sadist who trained him--played by Albert Finney whose voice is now so gravelly you could walk on it. The material is formulaic but of all the current action franchises this one is the most enjoyable. Cut off from the C.I.A. and from himself Bourne has nothing to draw on but tradecraft and instinct. As Damon plays him--silent wary--Bourne thinks with his body. He seems to have sensors attached to his limbs and his head and he reacts instantly to threats. I used to be a purist about action sequences demanding that bodies in combat be seen in full frame and without too much cutting. A few directors are still capable of that kind of classicism (Wolfgang Petersen in ""Troy"" David Cronenberg in ""A History of Violence"") but Paul Greengrass who also made the superb ""United 93"" shoots scenes in tiny fragments and when he does it I see the point--the gain in speed and power is extraordinary. The camera trembles and shakes and hurtles in ""Ultimatum"" as if we were trapped inside the moving Bourne and yet on the fly we see what we need to see. Gathering the fragments Greengrass keeps some of the chase scenes going for ten minutes at a time. You come out of the movie both excited and soothed as if your body had been worked on by felt-covered drumsticks. I doubt that Bourne will cease his wandering any time soon. Ludlum having turned out the three ""Bourne""s (among many other volumes) died in 2001 so the writer Eric Van Lustbader none of whose books have ever been made into a movie unselfishly stepped forward and committed a few extra ""Bourne""s to keep the ball rolling. One of these productions with the curious title ""Robert Ludlums The Bourne Betrayal"" was published only a couple of months ago. I salute Lustbaders entrepreneurial energy but why should he be the only one allowed to get in on the act? I havent yet made a deal with the Ludlum estate but I suggest the following titles ""The Bourne Topography"" (Bourne prevents the C.I.A. from taking over the Kyzyl Kum Desert in Uzbekistan); ""The Bourne Infarction"" (Bourne causes a systemic breakdown at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley); and my most ambitious idea ""The Bourne Arpeggio"" in which Bourne now a violist prevents the assassination of a Russian dissenter at the reopening of Alice Tully Hall. There isnt much thats factually new in ""No End in Sight"" Charles Fergusons extraordinary documentary about the American occupation of Iraq--at least not for people who have kept up with the best reporting on the war and have read such books as ""Fiasco"" by Thomas E. Ricks and ""The Assassins Gate"" by the New Yorker writer George Packer who appears in the film. Yet we need to hear the story again and again for no amount of rage and disbelief can turn what the Bush Administration did into someone elses problem. The occupation is our problem a dead eagle hanging around our necks. Though the facts in ""No End in Sight"" are well known the movie is still a classic. Modest and attentive and quietly outraged this collection of interviews news footage and narrated history gathers weight and strength and delivers in chronological order an overwhelming pattern of folly In the run-up to the invasion of March 2003 and then in the early months of the occupation all the people who actually knew anything about Iraq and the Middle East--anyone who had serious experience in military intelligence or reconstruction work--were either ignored or dismissed by the Department of Defense with White House backing. They were then replaced by ignorant and inexperienced ideologues who refused to hear what the knowledgeable told them. Ferguson establishes the disastrous thinking around such turning points as the decision not to stop the looting that followed the invasion; the de-Baathification of the professional classes of Iraq; and the disbanding of the Iraqi Army which sent some half a million armed men into the streets. ""No End in Sight"" is an exposure of the psychopathology of power. Ferguson earned a Ph.D. in political science from M.I.T. but went into Web design only to sell his company to Microsoft in 1996. He is one of the new plutocrats (Andrew Jarecki of ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is another) who unaccountably refused to buy a vineyard in the Napa Valley and instead turned to filmmaking. He paid for the movie himself--it cost two million dollars--and hired some of the best talent he could find the cinematographer Antonio Rossi the composer Peter Nashel and the documentary producer Alex Gibney who advised him to hold down the rhetoric and build up the interview subjects so that they become real characters. No better counsel has ever been given to a first-time director and writer. Despite the often gruesome subject this is an exceptionally elegant-looking film and it provides what can only be called sensuous rewards. Its necessary for us to see and feel how utterly torn up Baghdad and Falluja and other sites in Iraq are. And its moving to see the faces and hear the voices of the losers in the policy wars including former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage who makes it clear in his terse and guarded way that he and his boss Colin Powell got exactly nowhere whenever they offered sane advice; General Jay Garner the first American proconsul in Iraq who was replaced by the fatuous L. Paul Bremer and wishes that he had been able to fight harder against Bremers decisions to disband the Iraqi military; and most painfully Colonel Paul Hughes who was in touch with Iraqi officers commanding troops ready to maintain order in Baghdad only to be shut down from Washington by Walter Slocombe the senior adviser for national security and defense for the Coalition Provisional Authority. The madness continues Slocombe for example still refuses in an interview to admit that the disbanding of the Army had anything to do with the insurgency. The bitterest revelation of ""No End in Sight"" is that the people who got it right are in agony whereas the people who got it wrong are practically serene.

Its a 114-minute chase film dashing through streets and rooftops of any number of international urban sprawls with Matt Damons redoubtable Jason Bourne hot on the trail of -- himself. That might be the genius of the series A James Bond-like character who can escape any pickle and thwart any villain but all in a quest for his own identity. Jason is not out to save the world -- though he might do that -- hed just like to know his real name.Director Paul Greengrass who only made the astonishing ""United 93"" in the interim returns for his second ""Bourne"" film (after 2004s ""The Bourne Supremacy"") to bring the roller coaster ride to an end in a dead heat where all the plot points and (surviving) characters of the three films converge. Audiences will eat it up This is a postmillennial spy-action movie pitched to a large international audience. You hardly need subtitles. Article Templatehttp//link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1119669402http//www.brightcove.com/channel.jsp?channel=769341148   The cool thing about this movie is that the real revenge is not against bad guys in the CIA but against the high-tech world that maddens mere mortals. Your mobile phone drops calls? Your car needs towing after a parking-lot fender-bender? Well Jason can switch phones and patch into the world from trains subways stairwells and undergrounds. Any car he steals leaps up sharp inclines plunges off of roofs or smashes into other vehicles until reduced to smoldering metal yet can still outrace any car on the block.And his body Blow it up with a bomb expose it to brutal hand-to-hand combat or throw it into the East River and it gets up with a few manly scratches.Yes there are a few plot holes. But few are likely to care. A smart cast of veteran actors gives the film just enough emotional heft to carry you through the silliness. Damon has definitely made Bourne his own. For all his physical dexterity and killing instincts Damon brings a Hamlet-like quality to the CIA-trained assassin suffering from a five-year spell of amnesia who can never quite tell who his friends are or rather which of his enemies might be a true friend.Joan Allen returns as the CIA investigator who has slowly come to see that Jason might be the real deal. And Julia Stiles as an in-over-her-head agent again shows up for no credible reason other than the producers want her back. (Theyre right.)Newcomers include a flinty and increasingly antsy David Strathairn as a head of a black-ops program that has its real-life model in all the extralegal programs sponsored by the current administration. At one point he declares ""you cant make this stuff up"" and you know the filmmakers are nodding toward todays Washington.Scott Glenn appears as a law-ignoring CIA director though he might remind you more of the current attorney general and Albert Finney crops up toward at the end as a Dr. Mengele figure behind a behavior-mod program that created any number of Jason Bournes.The movie swings through Moscow (filched from the previous film); Paris; Turin Italy; London; Madrid; Tangiers Morocco; and New York as Jason hones in on who did this to him. (Thats another thing -- he never has to endure airport security checks)A fatigue factor sets in somewhere; it might vary from person to person. Yet the sharp intelligence behind the screenplay by Tony Gilroy Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi (though other hands reportedly contributed) gives the plot salvaged from the Robert Ludlum Cold War spy novel a genuine buoyancy. The film is trying to get at something no matter how crudely about corruption within the American espionage system with its secret reliance on renditions and torture in the name of freedom. This might not be the best way to illustrate the problem with credibility-stretchers at every turn. But then again how many people look at documentaries?Greengrass tops himself with each passing minute by staging terrific stunts and chases through crowded streets buildings and rooftops. Cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Christopher Rouse gives the film its lightning speed and jagged edges with a close hand-held camera and quick edits while John Powells score pulsates pure adrenaline.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUMUniversal PicturesUniversal Pictures in association with MP Beta Prods. presents a Kennedy/Marshall production in association with Ludlum EntertainmentCredits Director Paul GreengrassScreenwriters Tony Gilroy Scott Z.

If they could bottle what gives ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" its rush it would probably be illegal. The third and purportedly final installment in the mountingly exciting series is a pounding pulsating thriller that provides an almost constant adrenaline surge for nearly two hours. Worldwide B.O. will be terrific and likely surpass that for each of the previous two pictures which combined pulled down more than 500 million. In setting Jason Bourne on the home stretch of his search to discover who and what made him the killing machine he is director Paul Greengrass has outdone himself creating a film of such sustained energy and tension that the infrequent pauses for breath seem startling in their quietude. In other hands unrelenting nervous camera movement and machine-gun cutting prove wearying more often than not but Greengrass skillfully employs both not only in the service of excitement but for the accentuation of telling detail and discreet parceling out of information. Result is a breathless doozy that sends Bourne from Moscow to Turin Paris London Madrid and Tangier Morocco before alighting in New York from where the CIAs extra-legal assassination org has been tracking his movements with the most sophisticated and instantaneous of high-tech equipment. But Bourne continually beats the agency at its own game outwitting and tricking its surveillance ploys and besting the toughest killers the company can throw at him. Having settled certain scores in ""Supremacy"" three years ago Bourne (Matt Damon) is determined to retrieve his memory this time around so as to learn the identity he had before placing his skills at the service of the agency. Spurring this opportunity are articles by a London journo (Paddy Considine) in which revelatory details of Bournes career were obviously provided by a highly knowledgeable source. After a hair-raising pursuit of Bourne and the scribe at Londons Waterloo Station Bourne tracks the source to Spain where he once again meets CIA op Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and then to Tangier where a CIA ""asset"" or hitman is lying in wait. An amazing chase through the port citys twisty hilly streets and the teeming passages of the old Medina then over rooftops and through windows and finally to a gasping slashing hand-to-hand combat scene in a cramped bathroom is a marvel of technique and sheer logistics and one that makes marvelous use of a legendary city rarely seen in Western cinema. Along the way it becomes clear the CIA has replaced its former black-ops program Treadstone with a new one called Blackbriar which under stern topper Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) displays a propensity for rogue action and killing as a ready solution to all problems. As they listen in on phone calls and observe Bournes movements their secret Manhattan HQ (never before has a feature film so well documented Londons pervasive surveillance cameras) Vosen and colleague Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) argue over what to do with Bourne. Landy who developed a certain affinity for the lone wolf in Berlin three years back wants to keep him alive while Vosen repeatedly insists upon whacking him. Latters increasing frustration over the mounting failures to do so amply contributes to the very pure audience pleasure the picture generates. Greengrass stages one spectacular set piece after another virtually all of them in crowded public places -- train stations airports cafes bottlenecked city streets -- that lend the action scenes an unsurpassed sense of verisimilitude. Bourne walks away from more than one auto crash that would have finished off lesser men but he and we know that nothing is going to stop him before he comes face to face with his own Dr. Frankenstein a man whose image periodically flashes through his mind. Resolution to this central issue of the three films as well as to individual fates of secondary characters proves highly satisfactory resulting in that rare tumultuous thriller that cant be faulted at all on its own terms. The continuity and even upgrade in quality as the series has progressed can be significantly attributed to a solid team that hasnt changed much across the seven years; producers Frank Marshall Patrick Crowley and Paul L. Sandberg have been onboard for the entire ride as have story and screenwriter Tony Gilroy (this time credited alongside Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi) cinematographer Oliver Wood editor Christopher Rouse and composer John Powell whose urgent musical accompaniment is goosed by some striking string and percussion orchestrations. Second unit and stunt work overseen by Dan Bradley is top-drawer. Nor should one forget Doug Liman who continues on as an exec producer after having set the artistic template as director of the initial outing. It may not have been entirely apparent at first but Bourne is unquestionably Damons signature role the one in which a viewer becomes most complicit in the actors identification with a character. The subjective camerawork merely augments the degree to which one is completely with him in the series and if this is indeed his last ""Bourne"" as he has said then this is a performance to be savored all the more. Stymied by limited action in earlier rounds Stiles has more to do this time but remains deliberately understated. A low-key Strathairn proves mightily effective in an against-type turn as the quietly seething heavy while Allen shrewdly reveals a woman dedicated to creatively subverting the constraints of her highly regulated job. Scott Glenn turns up briefly as a new CIA director and Albert Finney effectively lends his weight basso tones and a slight Southern drawl to his man-behind-the-curtain character.

Part of its success has to do with the directors subtle feel for a jittery frame--more like a jazz drummers brush strokes than fashionable twitchiness. But the deeper appeal has to do with the cloud of fear we still live in. Here are American-intelligence war rooms of infinite precision (for a change) but in pursuit of a boyish hero whos smart enough to outwit them.That hero of course is Jason Bourne ex-spook amnesiac and Matt Damon who must count this as his signature role. Damon has always been cursed with farm-boy blandness; he comes to life only when he tightens his jaw into repressed covetousness (The Talented Mr. Ripley) or slippery corruption (The Departed). But with Bourne here free of romantic attachment he becomes an all-American killing machine much like the soldiers were sending overseas. The Bourne Ultimatum is that soldiers revenge coming home to America--to New York even--to find out why his humanity was robbed from him. Of course many cars will be crashed along the way. Hell strangle a goon in a bathroom with a towel (a close-contact fight eerily reminiscent of United 93s cockpit struggle). The cat-and-mouse sequences in this film are revelatory--theyre why we go to the movies in the first place.
