Movie Reviews Captain America Gets Ready to Avenge 1 0 By Matthew Lickona July 27 2011 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Captain America The First Avenger  In 1991 director Joe Johnston brought us The Rocketeer in which a decent All-American guy chances upon the means to become a superhero. This enables him to take on the Nazi menace and its plan for an aerial attack on the United States. In 2011 director Joe Johnston brings you Captain America The First Avenger in which...well this time its Hydra a rogue Nazi subdivision. There are other differences too but whats most important are the similarities -- of charm of square-jawed unironic goodness and of sweetly awkward romantic stirrings. Captain America -- or rather his alter ego Steve Rogers -- is a throwback superhero. Hes not working out his damage (a la Batman) and there are no lessons he must learn about power and responsibility (a la Spider Man). Hes just a good guy who needs the tools to get the job done. And thanks to refugee German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) and his muscle-building super serum hes got those tools. Buff actor Chris Evans gives a real sense of fun to Rogerss first excursion in his serum-boosted body a feeling of Holy cow look what I can do That sense of fun is becoming something of a Marvel hallmark in this run-up to next summers Avengers. While DC has gone ponderous and portentous with The Dark Knight Watchmen and even weirdly Green Lantern Marvel has managed to keep a light touch amid the drama with Iron Man Thor and now Captain America. Tommy Lee Jones nails this tone as the colonel in charge of the Captain easing from genial to grave without any sign of effort crossing his creasy craggy face. The feeling is right; other aspects less so. Hugo Weaving usually so reliable as a creepy villain is oddly muted as the Red Skull. He lays out his mad plan for world domination without relish -- and without much menace either. And the story squanders its own fine setup the Skull was the super-serums first recipient but as Erskine explains it only heightened his self-serving ambition. Cap on the other hand understands compassion having once been weak himself. One would hope that their final confrontation would hinge on this difference. One would be disappointed. And while the 3-D did manage to produce one genuine flinch at other times it lent events an embarrassing unreality. Crazy Stupid Love Like the recent Jim Carrey vehicle Mr. Poppers Penguins the driving force in Crazy Stupid Love is a kid who wants mom and dad to get back together. Unlike Popper Love injects some pathos into the proceedings. Also fallout from sexual adventuring varying levels of human folly and some quiet consideration of manhood and husbandry. (Steve Carells late-night yard work at the home hes left behind presents a fine image the care of a house standing in for the care of a household.) All in all a much less fantastical and much more moving affair. And except for a bit of (literally) masturbatory indulgence its even artful enough to let the grown-ups hog the spotlight since theyre the ones who ultimately have to decide what to do. If that doesnt sound much like the man-makeover comedy laid out in the films trailer blame the trailer. The silly stuff is in there but most of the laughs come in moments of painful recognition or uncomfortable absurdity. Just because the film champions the notion of being a middle-aged married dude doesnt mean it lionizes it. Apologies fail grand moments go awry and humiliation becomes a regular guest in the soul. The only recourse is perseverance -- which on a good day can look a lot like love. Carell of course is the star of the ensemble cast but the rest of the heavens shine almost as bright Julianne Moore is emotive and reliable as his confused wife Ryan Gosling is pretty and vulnerable as his silver-tongued advisor and Emma Stone...well Emma Stone is full-stop adorable.  Sarahs Key ""Sometimes our own stories are the ones we can never tell"" intones Kristen Scott Thomas at the opening of Sarahs Key. ""But if our own stories are never told they become something else forgotten."" This is solemn piffle straining to make something terribly significant out of the mundane. We hear it again much later when a successful middle-aged man declares ""My whole life has been a lie"" after learning that his mother -- who died when he was nine -- was not totally honest about her heritage. Yes we want our stories to be remembered. Yes our parents heritage is part of who we are. But come now -- its all a bit much the sort of stuff wed expect in a story that features a mother lovingly watching her toddler wander up against the windows of a Manhattan restaurant. Oh right thats here too. I almost wonder if director Gilles Paquet-Brenner knows all this. The film tells two stories the first about a Jewish girl in World War II France who hides her younger brother from the authorities and then sets out to rescue him from that hiding place the second about an American woman in modern-day France who is about to move into the Jewish girls old apartment. (She stumbles upon the girls story while researching a magazine article about the French governments gross mistreatment of its own Jewish citizens.) While the first story is fraught with danger -- and in some cases rife with horror -- it is also thrilling and full of high adventure. Separated from her brother torn from her parents and seemingly doomed little Sarah presses on with the passionate certainty of childhood faith she must succeed and so she will. Paquet-Brenner paints Sarahs world with bright colors; everything feels warm and vital and the humanity that blooms despite the suffering is all the more precious because of it. The comfortable present meanwhile feels cold and wan and not a little dim. In 1942 we are given a girl risking everything to save her brothers life. In the present day we get a guy asking his wife to have an abortion because he doesnt want ""to be an old dad"" and a woman willing to sacrifice the happiness of innocents in her quest to dig up a past that is not her own.

As the films subtitle alleges the Captain may be The First Avenger but hes still a patriotic prat in tights whose main powers much like the real-world superpower that spawned him seem to be excessive arrogance and blunt force. So respect is due to Joe Johnston and his screenwriters for not only fashioning a nifty highly entertaining slice of pulpy comic-book action but for making this most divisive of costumed crusaders universally relatable.The films period setting helps by taking the character back to his mid-40s roots and pitting him against historys most hissable villains the Nazis the filmmakers have neatly sidestepped questions of American imperialism. They even take a few witty potshots at patriotic fervour in a terrific mid-film musical sequence as our genetically buffed-up weed-turned-warrior hero Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) traverses the country selling war bonds and bopping a comedy Adolf on the nose to the delight of baying crowds.But with this sticking point out of the way the film has other problems to contend with the action scenes are inventive and well constructed but can feel somewhat slight; the characters are well sketched but far too plentiful; and the 3D effects are blurry and confusing - if you can catch this in 2D you probably should. Most damagingly of all Captain America like Iron Man 2 and Thor before it is hamstrung by its commitment to the upcoming Marvel superhero ensemble movie The Avengers leading to a deeply unsatisfying non-sequitur ending. The result is pacy and punchy but not quite a knockout.

The cast was good though but it might just as well be in 2D unlike movies like Avatar which really impressed in 3D. What really irritates me is that in the Netherlands the movie distributor does not give the cinema goer the opportunity to choose between 2D or 3D for some recent releases like Captain America the first avenger Kung Fu Panda 2 and Rio (only the dubbed Dutch versions of Kung Fu Panda 2 and Rio meant for a younger audience were also available in 2D). Two exceptions were fortunately Pirates of the Carribean On stranger tides and Harry Potter amp; the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which were both available in 2D and 3D. I think that all movies released here and elsewhere should be available in both 2D and 3D versions. The movie goer can then decide for himself or herself which version to go for.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 30 2011RobertFeaturedOh dear. Whats wrong with me? I really quite enjoyed this film. But then I came to it with the same expectations of the kid I once was who read every Marvel and DC comic back in the sixties and really just enjoyed the stories and didnt get any political sub-plots or imperialistic symbolism.So  for me it was just a rather exciting boys own adventure story that rattled along for a couple of hours with great effects and a few good jokes the Nazis as the bad guys and Hayley Atwell. I guess Mr Rabbit I am therefore 6 years old. Incidentally if youre buying dodgy DVDs of pre-released movies from a stall then youre a criminal and should go to jail. You do realise that the same people behind movie piracy are the same who enslave children from Africa and Eastern Europe for sex slaves in the West and who are behind the drugs trade and other organised crime.

To me movie is horrible its army propaganda; basically Saturday morning cartoon with no acting skills needed; very shallow with ""take steroids as only way to attract girls and join the army so that you become real man""; very unoriginal I mean basically every scene is already seen in some other movie all the way to the end when it reminds of Vanilla Sky. And this is viewpoint I also dont get that audience constantly has with US movies in past decade ""So they dodged American imperialism for the sake of fun"" but why dont they at least once make a movie in which they put American imperialism and maybe even maximize it for the sake of fun? I wish that anybody who sees this movie also sees movie ""Latino"" (1985) or at least drafting scene ""Across the Universe"" (2007).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89563/captain-america-the-first-avenger.html,200,captainamericathefirstavenger1,captainamericathefirstavenger,timeout
"Captain America The First Avenger | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; captain-america-the-first-avenger ) Captain America The First Avenger (United States 2011) July 22 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its fair to say that superhero saturation has set in. Not many years ago every cinematic version of a comic book protagonists adventures was awaited with baited breath. Now because of an unceasing and sometimes careless flood of such titles mainstream audiences have become apathetic leaving it to die-hards to pack theaters on opening weekends. Captain America is the latest in a seemingly endless line of origin stories and the last of The Avengers prequels. Despite being the most venerable character in Marvels line-up (he first appeared in 1941) Captain America is not a member of the vaunted A-list. In fact were it not for his participation in The Avengers one wonders whether the World War II patriot would have made it to the screen. Although most of Captain America transpires in the 1940s it is bookended by modern-day scenes that serve little purpose beyond setting up The Avengers. Thats one thing that has been increasingly annoying about the recent batch of Marvel movies - The Incredible Hulk Iron Man 2 and Thor - they seem less like stand-alone motion pictures than advertisements for The Avengers. Captain America may be the worst offender. The whole purpose of telling Captain Americas origin story is so that when he appears in The Avengers he will have a background. (Joss Whedon director of The Avengers allegedly had limited input to the Captain America script.) Captain America falls into the prevalent pitfalls of origin stories. So much time and effort is expended explaining how the protagonist gains his super-powers (and exploring his initial usage of them) that theres not enough opportunity to develop a compelling storyline beyond his ""baptism."" Then theres the issue of the main villain Captain Americas classic adversary Red Skull who comes across as a James Bond-type take-over-the-world megalomaniac and isnt given a lot to do except exude over-the-top nastiness. The final confrontation is disappointing lacking scope and energy. As bad as the Transformers movies are at least Michael Bay thinks big. The CGI work it must be said is at times exceptional believably transforming actor Chris Evans into 90-pound weakling Steve Rogers. In fact the computer enhancements are so good that I couldnt determine whether they were also used to ""beef up"" Rogers after he undergoes the treatment that transforms him into bulky hunky Captain America. As best I can tell no special effects are needed for Hayley Atwell (who plays Rogers love interest Agent Peggy Carter) Sebastian Stan (Rogers best friend and later Captain Americas sidekick Bucky Barnes) or Tommy Lee Jones (Captain Americas commanding officer Col. Chester Phillips). Jones is as fun as ever using his familiar crusty personality to its best advantage. Visual chicanery comes into play with Hugo Weaving whose Red Skull looks like something out of the Star Wars cantina. The thing that differentiates Captain America from the umpteen other superheroes who have trodden across screens this summer is that the action takes place neither on modern-day Earth nor in outer space. In this case we get a period piece - a re-imagination of some of what went on behind the scenes in the struggle against the Nazis. Captain America a super-soldier created by ex-German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) using the ""raw material"" of Rogers body is initially employed as a propaganda figure for selling war bonds (he has a catchy theme song written by Alan Menken) before he is sent on a rescue mission behind enemy lines. However instead of going after Hitler Captain America gets sidetracked and ends up tangling with Red Skull and the secret society he has created. When it comes to re-writing World War II history Quentin Tarantino did it better in Inglourious Basterds. Director Joe Johnston uses a similar aesthetic here to the one he applied to The Rocketeer another comic-inspired period piece. Despite the different characters and subject matter the movies are peas in a pod. Having seen the movie in 2-D I cant comment on whether the 3-D version compromises Johnsons use of slightly muted colors and carefully modulated lighting but its a good bet. 3-D is useful only when it comes to a ""wow"" factor; its putrid for subtleties like the ones employed by Johnston. (This is yet another post-production 3-D conversion.) Comic book fans are likely to appreciate Captain America which does a good job of consolidating the disparate origin aspects of the character into something easily digestible. Non-comic fans may have to fight the urge to stifle a yawn. Theres nothing in Captain America worthy or praise or derision. Its a competently made straightforward yarn that has little to offer those who are not already on the bandwagon. Anyone willing to sit through the lengthy end credits will be rewarded by a short unrevealing teaser for The Avengers. Its a reminder of what Captain America is all about getting audiences primed for one of 2012s big events rather than providing something memorable for 2011.

The director Joe Johnston did special effects for Raiders of the Lost Ark and made such graphically strong fantasies as Honey I Shrunk the Kids The Rocketeer and Jurassic Park III and he obviously learned from Steven Spielberg to make every composition read and never to waste a shot. The movie looks wonderful. The production design by the great Rick Heinrichs is bold and unfussy the palette monochromatic with splashes of comic-book greens and reds and the compositions evocative of World War II newsreels and propaganda (Allied and Axis) without ever slipping into camp. Heinrichs mixes up architecture styles a Expressionist futurist Deco a into frames that might have leaped from the collective unconscious of forties moviegoers. The score by Alan Silvestri is a marvelous pastiche with a life of its own and thereas a terrific song-and-dance montage in which the newly christened Captain America is trotted out alongside leggy chorines to raise the warring nationas patriotic spirits Itas both satirical and exhilarating. The story? Its all right nothing special. The musclebound Captain America with his mighty shield ne Steve Rogers actually was the first avenger conceived in 1940 by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby to do battle with Hitler -- earning the publisher threats from a then-large American pro-German faction. Rogers begins life not as a typical jock but a 98-pound weakling and for the movie the beefy Chris Evans has his head grafted via computer onto a punier actors frame. Its the best effect in the picture -- mostly because it doesnt look like an effect. Rogerss scrawniness is just exaggerated enough to make you roll your eyes and giggle as he tries over and over to enlist in the Army despite a firm 4F classification. Then hes spied by Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) a German scientist who defected to the Allies and thinks Steve despite his asthma and pitiful muscle tone has the strength of heart to become the first biochemically enhanced U.S. soldier -- putting him at odds with Tommy Lee Joness Colonel Phillips whod like a manly man for this momentous experiment. This first half of Captain America is much better. Jones all acid deadpan bickers with a shining-eyed Tucci (the Einsteinian Cher-man accent adds to his lovableness) while we gleefully anticipate little Steves transformation into a big deal. I thought I even caught a whiff of one of my favorite films Preston Sturgess Hail the Conquering Hero which also centers on a 4F who dreams of fighting in World War II -- but doesnt have a scientist to pump him full of supersizing chemicals. Its too bad Chris Evans doesnt have Eddie Brackens gusto Once he gets into his own body he becomes a non-entity. Evans isnt physically inventive enough to get laughs out of this nerds surprise and then elation with his new abilities -- or make you see what luscious British agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) all dark curls and red lipstick sees in him beyond those impressive pecs. This would have been a good role for a hunk with an antic spark like Ryan Reynolds -- stuck alas with the Green Lantern. The supervillain isnt Hitler but a breakaway Nazi psycho named Schmidt who was the first recipient of an Erskine serum -- which transformed his head into a red skull. (Or was it the supernatural glowy cube zealously guarded by Norwegians? Its a bit of a jumble.) As Schmidt Hugo Weaving is icy perfection and gets to play most of his scenes with Toby Jones spot-on as always as a German scientist increasingly squeamish about their unorthodox collaboration. But the dialogue is generic megalomaniac stuff and when the fighting begins the movie feels even more by-the-numbers. We keep waiting for the bravura mighty-shield set-piece -- in which say Captain America wittily plays the angles like a billiards champion -- that never comes. Goldfingers Oddjob did far more amazing things with his bowler. The retro-nostalgic Captain America is still miles ahead of its recent competitors and helps to put the Marvel avengers in perspective. Early scenes at a Worlds Fair (featuring Iron Mans dad Howard Stark played by Dominic Cooper) remind you of the impulse behind the thirties superhero mythos the mixture of patriotism Utopianism and hucksterism -- the belief that scientists capitalists the military and nerdy messianic dreamers could come together to free the world from evil. Okay that didnt work out so well. But Captain America suggests how grand it once was to have faith.

Do the bigger kids at school slam you into your locker when you quote lines from fantasy-action films? Does that girl you secretly adore refuse your offer to take her to the umpteenth Marvel comics movie? Well friend you may be suffering from Superhero Overload. Seeing all those epics about the overmuscled macho dudes from the Marvel universe -- Spider-Man and the Hulk and Iron Man and Thor and endless X-Men -- has drained your fevered brain. So approach Captain America The First Avenger with caution. It could leave you super-pooped and quite possibly super-duped. (Read about the 70th anniversary of the Captain America series) Movie genres no less than great civilizations have their periods of ascent and descent. Musicals Westerns and the dead-serious romance have all flourished then nearly perished. Now the superhero format looks close to being spent. In the late 1930s and early 40s the paradigm was born as a babysitter for Saturday-matinee kids in the form of B-minus serials in 12 to 15 weekly chapters; Captain America was one such chapter play the first Marvel character to make it to the big screen. Comic-book heroes didnt graduate to ""A"" movies until the 1978 Superman; then the 2002 Spider-Man opened the floodgates. Now every summer boasts a platoon of steel-jawed planet-savers. This one already had Thor X-Men First Class and Green Lantern with new segments of Pirates of the Caribbean and Transformers adding to the genre glut and Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Conan the Barbariancoming in August. Can you wonder that connoisseurs sag from ennui? On its own Captain America is a modestly engaging little-big movie in the median range well below the first Iron Man somewhat north of X-Men First Class. It approaches one of Marvels earliest good guys created in 1941 by writer Joe Simon and illustrator Jack Kirby with the utmost reverence. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley who wrote the Narnia films and You Kill Me have faithfully adapted the origins story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a little guy beset by bullies whos gung-ho to go to war and is enlisted in a secret Army project that transforms him from a 90-pound weakling into a Charles Atlas figure who can outrun a speeding taxi and battle Hitlers most potent mad scientist. That would be Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) aka the Red Skull in a sneering-villain guise with the bone structure of Kevin Bacon (First Class main meanie) and the Teutonic vocal timbre of Werner Herzog. Director Joe Johnson choreographs some cool chases and the production team provides a loving reimagining of New York in the 40s. (MORE Read Corlisss review of X-Men First Class) The only problem is that weve been there -- been nearly everywhere Captain America goes -- in countless previous movies. The undergrown underdog could be Peter Parker before he became Spider-Man. Steves skill set isnt so special since its served a dozen or more superheroes. The infiltration of a fantasy story into historical events was used in X-Men First Class where Charles Xavier and his mutant gang averted the Cuban Missile Crisis and for that matter in Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds another chimerical rewrite of U.S. soldiers efforts to bring down Nazi Germany. We get it G.I. Joe killed Hitler -- though really it was the Soviet Army that exhausted his troops and Hitler killed himself. (MORE Read a Corliss review of Inglourious Basterds) Other films handprints are all over Captain America. The remarkable visual effects that make the early runty Steve eerily realistic (by superimposing Evans thinned-out face on a much smaller actors body) are a refinement on the techniques used to turn Brad Pitt into an old man a boy and a baby in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Even the movies this movie steals from have been widely and recently filched. Captain America uses Raiders of the Lost Ark as a template; but the makers of Green Lantern already filched the Ark of the Covenant as MacGuffin. They called it the Parallax; here its the Tesseract -- though we grant that Marvel introduced that particular cosmic cube back in 1966 15 years before Raiders. (MORE Corlisss review of Green Lantern) To get a sense of the superhero in his raw cheap0 prime check out the 1943 Captain America serial -- where our hero sports a disguise that would fool even the Red Skull. In the Republic version Army volunteer Steve Rogers has morphed into fearless District Attorney Grant Gardner. Played by the not-at-all-ripped Dick Purcell (who shortly after filming ended played a round of golf and collapsed dead of a heart attack at 35) Gardner does occasionally dress up in star-spangled drag but without the comic-book heros trusty discus-boomerang shield; he just packs a gun. And instead of pulverizing Nazis he pursues American archaeologist Dr. Cyrus Maldor (Lionel Atwill) a standard-issue archfiend with the nom de crime the Scarab whose ""purple-death poison"" clouds his rivals minds and forces them to commit suicide. For four hours and through 15 episodes Gardner and Maldor wrangle over such fanciful inventions as the Life-Restoring Machine the instant-mummifying device the Portable Electronic Fire Bolt and its antidote the Fire Bolt Locator and best of all the Thermo-dynamic Vibration Engine. This last weapon also known as the Dynamic Vibrator has the power of 100 million volts ""a force that would shatter a 20-story building like an eggshell."" Most of the cliffhanger episodes climax with a furious fight between Gardner and Maldors henchmen intercut with shots of a needle on one of the weapons dials shakily rising to the inevitable moment when everything will go boom. Directed by John English and Elmer Clifton this Captain America doesnt have the vigor of the terrific Republic serials (Spy Smasher Drums of Fu Manchu and Dick Tracy Returns) that English had turned out with William Witney in a few weeks and for about 100000. But its artless rendering of what were then new cliches of wish-fulfillment -- the dream that pure and stalwart guys could defeat real-life villains -- makes it fresher and more fun than the 100-million mastodons parading through todays multiplexes. Find one of these old serials friend. Theyre a tonic for the debilitating malady of Superhero Overload.

IMO the viewer has to already like Marvel and love Captain America to find this entertaining. I was not one of those people so I had really hard time to even finish it. Without Tommy-Lee Jones I probably wouldnt have. Foghornsaid on Sunday November 25 2012 122450 AMSpot on. This movie was so boring I actually fell asleep in the middle of it. Whether its an origin story or not is beside the point. The point of a movie is to entertain. On this point Captain America gets an epic D in my book. Jonsaid on Wednesday August 15 2012 110351 PMReally?? You gave it a C?? This movie is one of the truer comic book origin story that came out to date. Evans Jones and even Hatwell were all great in their roles. So why are you bitching about something that needs to be praised?? In my opinion this origin story is better than Batman Begins and Superman Returns combined Johnsaid on Monday April 30 2012 81003 PMI completely agree 100 Percent it was Boring had some Good Special Effects but pretty Boring youre right he would do much better with Iron ManThor and Hulk I Da Cahmansaid on Saturday April 14 2012 40003 PMNearly all comic book movies these days are either cheesy fun or bad. Thankfully this is a cheesy fun movie and to differ Id give it a C+ but a C is a fair shake. Jimsaid on Tuesday October 25 2011 120522 PMI think you just gave Thor a high rating because you have a crush on Natalie Portman and Captain America a C because Chris Evans is your arch-enemy. Speed Racersaid on Tuesday October 04 2011 51004 AMPretty boring movie. As was Thor and X-Men. Now I dont really get Captain America. Okay so hes a scrawny kid that gets injected with steroids and then becomes an American hero (great message for the kids btw). Beyond this however my recollection of Captain America from the comics was that of a pure Alpha-like team leader built on ironclad American ideals. I didnt get a sense of this pre or post roids. Instead we get a do-gooder who could do a bit more now that he had muscles. Too much heroism was tied up with his transformation. If ol Captain America expects to stand with demi-gods monsters and robots he better have something going for him other than a little enhanced strength and some buttermilk values. Oh and it would be nice to have an real battle at the end. Ten seconds with Red Skull followed by an airplane crash isnt exactly epic. shrug Deeeeesaid on Tuesday August 16 2011 13729 PMCaptain America was a snoozefest. They dropped the ball on this one. Mike Murraysaid on Saturday August 06 2011 32750 PMI really have to disagree with you on this one. I felt this movie brought a lot of heart to a genre that is all too often lacking this aspect. It wasnt the dark and cynical heroes we are often presented with today. I applaud Johnstons choice selections scenery cinematography and musical score. It was a light hearted romp through a lost era.

Does Darkman count? Do the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? By my narrow and perhaps idiosyncratic reckoning Hollywood released nine real superhero flicks in the 30 years from 1970 through 1999 or about one every three years four Batmans four Supermans (forgot that last one didnt you?) and a Captain America that went virtually unseen. In the 12 years since by contrast there have been--again by conservative estimate--about two per year Five X-Mens (including Wolverine) three Spider -Mans two Hulks two Batmans two Iron Mans two Fantastic Fours and one each of Superman Daredevil Ghost Rider Watchmen Thor Green Lantern and as of today Captain America. And thats not to mention next years The Avengers which will assemble its heroic talent with the promiscuity of a 1980s rock supergroup. More On Superhero FilmsWB5 Fatal Errors for Comic Book MoviesWB/DCThe Dark Knight Rises Why Christopher Nolan Should Break BatmanWB/DCThe Many Lives of Catwoman Given the superhero genres ever-more-central role in the pop-cinematic imagination it was perhaps inevitable that some actors would have to start performing double duty. (In more innocent times Randolph Scott averaged three or four cowboy films per year.) Ryan Reynolds was first out of the gate by a nose having played Deadpool in X-Men Origins Wolverine and just last month protagonist Hal Jordan in Green Lantern. But Ryan at least had the decency to do his moonlighting in different comic-book universes one Marvel one DC. With Captain America The First Avenger Chris Evans--who played the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies--has bent the space-time continuum more radically offering his second performance as a Golden-Age Marvel hero. (If the studios eventually get desperate enough to plunder a 1950s-era anti-communist storyline teaming the Captain and the Torch theyll need Winklevossian technology to get enough Evanses up on screen.) While this may not be Evanss first foray in tights the result this time out is a good deal more satisfying. Captain America is not in the top tier of super-flicks with the Dark Knight cycle and the better Spider- Iron- and X-Men but it is near the top of the second evidence that a genre that intermittently feels taxidermied (viz. Daredevil Ghost Rider Green Lantern) still has some life left in it. As its title announces the movie is the final appetizer for and most explicit prequel to The Avengers. So like its Marvel cousin the similarly colon-titled X-Men First Class the film is an exercise in self-conscious retro. This time the year is 1942; the look sepia; and the tone amiably gee-whizzy. Steve Rogers (Evans) is a scrawny but big-hearted Brooklyn kid evidently on hiatus from his gig modeling as the ""before"" in Charles Atlas ads. Hes tried repeatedly to join the Army and fight the Reich but his weight (90 lbs.) and list of past ailments (asthma scarlet fever rheumatic fever and too many others to recount) have sensibly enough kept him out. (In an impressive feat of CGI--if perhaps one that will prove of limited use to Hollywood--the decidedly strapping Evans is persuasively rendered Benjamin-Button-like as a textbook case in puny.) Director Joe Johnston keeps things moving briskly right up to the unexpectedly touching conclusion Witnessing Steves pluck and persistence a kindly scientist (Stanley Tucci) gives him a chance as such types do enlisting him in a secret program to produce the perfect American soldier through a regimen of injections and ""vita-rays."" The experiment proves successful but inevitably irreproducible and in no time Steve finds himself chasing Nazi saboteurs down the streets of Brooklyn and into the East River. Such heroics obviously meriting promotion Steve is detailed to crisscross the nation promoting war bonds in his familiar (if ridiculous) red-white-and-blues as the ""Star Spangled Man with a Plan."" Meanwhile across the Atlantic a depraved Nazi scientist known formally as Johann Schmidt but to his friends as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) is plotting the overthrow of the global order Hitler included through the use of futuristic technology fueled by a mystical cube of unimaginable power. That is until while performing in a USO show for servicemen in Italy Steve learns that the unit of his childhood best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) was captured just a few miles away by the Skulls cult-like secret society HYDRA... Captain America is a by-the-numbers diversion but a charming one. There are strong echoes of Hellboy and the Indiana Jones movies with the Skull boasting at one point of the progress his own diabolical plots are achieving ""while the Fuhrer digs for trinkets in the desert."" The action sequences are solid if hardly revelatory. (The best is probably the pre-costume chase in Brooklyn.) And the careful interweaving of franchises that has characterized recent Marvel films continues but unobtrusively with links to Iron Man (Tony Starks father played by Dominic Cooper shows up as the Armys top weapons engineer) and Thor. Evans displays the easy likability hes brought to earlier roles in particular Cellular; as the Red Skull Weaving offers the most villainous sneer this side of Alan Rickman; and the rest of the cast--which includes Hayley Atwell Tommy Lee Jones and Tobey Jones--is uniformly solid. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley (with a light uncredited polish by Avengers director Joss Whedon) is sharp enough to remain just this side of hokey. And apart from an all-too-common sag around the two-thirds point director Joe Johnston keeps things moving briskly right up to the unexpectedly touching conclusion. What lingers most about Captain America though is its innocent throwback ethos a firm unqualified embrace of the Little Guy. Early on when scrawny Steve is asked if he wants to kill Nazis he replies ""I dont want to kill anyone. I just dont like bullies no matter where theyre from."" That sentiment the idea that even when made inhumanly powerful he will retain his compassion and aspire to be ""not a perfect soldier but a good man"" is a tonic change from the bleak vision of The Dark Knight and the unpleasant overdogging of Green Lantern. Incongruous as it may be today it is a particularly appealing vision of a man who is after all the imagined embodiment of a national ideal.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 22 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ever feel as if this is a Marvel Cinematic Universe and were just living in it? If youve sought out comic-book-action thrills at the multiplex over the past few years then you know what Im talking about. And you also already know that Captain America The First Avenger for all its nostalgia-hued fun is essentially just a set-up. Screen grab from the online trailer for the latest film in the Marvel Comics Avenger series ""Captain America"" Movies Captain America The official trailer DC Comics has achieved reboot glory via Christopher Nolans Batman pics (the third due next summer) and may find a speeding bullet in a planned Superman remake in 2012 called Man of Steel. But various one-off flicks like this summers dim Green Lantern reveal a lack of strategic cinema planning. Meanwhile on the other side of Tinseltown Marvel has been meting out an ambitious cinematic vision. The company knows its not enough these days for a guy to strap on reactor-powered armour or get blasted with gamma rays or regain ancient godly powers or in the case of 98-pound-weakling Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) in Captain America have his patriotism and muscle mass enhanced by the injection of top-secret serum. Superhero movies will be stronger if they work together - and thats exactly whats been happening through Robert Downeys Iron Man flicks Edward Nortons 2008 redo of The Incredible Hulk and this springs winning hammer toss Thor. The goal is Marvel Studios The Avengers the superhero smackdown written and directed by Joss Whedon and scheduled for 3-D release next May. Captain America is the fourth and final Marvel comics original story required before the superdudes can avenge together on screen. But there are challenges not the least of which is that Captain America was ""born"" in the 1940s and his future superpals are modern characters. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely the team best known for writing the three recent Narnia films whip up a Captain America story that often feels like its only purpose is to deliver Steve Rogers into the 21st century. The many montages story leaps and abundance of flat functional characters (the wonderful Dominic Cooper is wasted in the thin role of inventor-industrialist Howard Stark future father of Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark) lend a ""lets just get through this"" vibe. Nevertheless the film contains many fun visual and action flourishes from director Joe Johnston (director of cult fave The Rocketeer) whose pop-up book approach to 3-D and limited colour palette make Captain Americas overall look kind of like Sky Captain meets Indiana Jones with a touch of steampunk. In the opening scenes Evans who played the Human Torch in two Fantastic Four movies and is a solid choice for the straight-arrow Captain America is eerily scrawny thanks to digital magic and camera angles. But his physique expands when Steve Rogers becomes the Strategic Scientific Reserves candidate to test an experimental super-soldier serum. It works. Instead of being shipped off to fight bullies (as the former 98-pound-weakling refers to Nazis) hes sent out to sell war bonds - depicted in a fun musical montage that also introduces the iconic Captain America costume in an ironic way. Meanwhile over in Europe the evil Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving with a perfect German accent) aka Red Skull has tapped into a source of Teutonic mythological power and is working closely with a mousey sidekick scientist to harness this for his world-domination project. Is there any doubt Evans Captain America will do exactly what the character created 70 years ago by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby did in the comics - kick Nazi butt? The real surprise will come next year when we get to see how the super-square Captain adapts to 21st-century life.

Comments click to enlarge Captain America The First Avenger Video Rated PG-13  125 minutes  2011 No matter how seamlessly the technology may be integrated (and its pretty seamless here) the idea of a 3-D comic book adaptation still feels all wrong the pleasure of reading comics has less to do with perceived depth than with lateral movement. Still this superhero adventure has a fair amount going for it. Joe Johnston--returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort The Rocketeer (1991)--creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story (at least until he reaches the arbitrary half-hour of explosions that concludes every blockbuster these days). Theres also a pleasant nostalgia for how people walked and talked in movies 70 years ago. With Chris Evans Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci.

By Peter Rainer July 22 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Chris Evans is shown in a scene from the film Captain America The First Avenger. Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Dont you wish there was a superhero who could rid us of all the mediocre superhero movies? As good a place as any to start would be ""Captain America The First Avenger"" - which incidentally you might be interested to know is being marketed in Russia simply as ""The First Avenger."" (Glasnost only went so far.) Despite all the advance hype preceding its release ""Captain America"" yet another 3-D Marvel Comics concoction straggles onto the screen with little reason to exist except as a marketing machine. The first comic book which was so arrantly patriotic that it featured our hero socking Hitler in the jaw came out in 1941. Since all superheroes require a back story this first (last maybe?--pretty please?) installment of the saga takes us back to that retro time when men were men and women wore long skirts. The man in question Brooklyns Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 98-pound weakling who wants desperately to join the Army and serve his country but is immovably classified 4-F. His spunk however does not go unnoticed by German-American Army scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who courtesy of equipment more appropriate to Dr. Strangelove converts Steve from milquetoast to beefcake. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Although still an innocent who is shy around girls Steve is outwardly at least a warrior. Swathed in his American flag costume he leads his men into battle while pursuing Nazi mad scientist Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who was himself subjected to Dr. Erskines ministrations back in the old country and is now so bonkers that he thinks he can take over the world without Hitlers help. After this movie and Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglorious Bastards"" maybe we can declare a moratorium for a while on faux Nazi fantasias? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Joe Johnston and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are clearly preparing us for a sequel one that is set in the present day but is there any law that says these films have to keep getting made? Once is more than enough. Twice thrice ad infinitum is a punishable offense.

Unfortunately it cant sustain that standard of quality devolving into hackneyed melodrama in the final hour. This is a shame because a world-beating Captain America film could have created unassailable momentum for The Avengers. Alas its not to be. What we have here is a slightly below average movie doomed by choppy editing and cringe-worthy characterizations. So it goes. After the iconic Marvel Studios logo were greeted by distant headlights in the snow. Orchestral strings pace the opening moments faceless men emerging from the shadows to have a look at what appears to be a spaceship. What is it thats sticking out of the snow? And what does the futuristic-looking craft contain? Whoooosh were whisked back to Norway in 1942 World War II at the outset of the Nazi occupation. Hugo Weaving is Johann Schmidt but hes doing his best Christoph Waltz impression and hes desperately looking for something. Something powerful. This mysterious power source eludes him and its the final piece to his HYDRA puzzle. HYDRA is the super secret science-based weaponry unit that Hitler has funded and Schmidt is the evil fellow who is tasked with evil project management. Believe it or not HYDRA is WORSE than the Nazis at least according to the mythology of Captain America. Now I know what youre thinking. ""Umm sure but when does Captain America his own self enter the picture?"" Next Hes up next and he stands about 54"" 130 lbs. at the outset of his introduction. Hes small but scrappy and he positively HATES bullies. Extra credit if you surmise that attribute might come up again. Anyway hes trying to join the army but hes striking out because hes too sickly. Weve all been there. His best pal tells him to get over it soon hell be the only eligible bachelor in a town with millions of single girls. The entire ""smallification of Chris Evans"" effect is handled with the help of Benjamin Button technology and its effective enough to be jarring. Your mind knows real-life Chris Evans is yoked but your eyes keep demanding that hes wee. Youre certain that eventually a transformation will happen. But how and more importantly when? At this point we can all agree based on the trailers and posters that Captain America does join the fight. So well leave the rest for your viewing enjoyment. As mentioned prior the first half of the film comes off relatively well. Tommy Lee Jones plays a hard-nosed general who underestimates Steve Rogers abilities. Hayley Atwell (as Peggy Carter) is the love interest; shes worried and charmed by the Captains transformation into an elite fighting machine. Finally Stanley Tucci is the mad scientist on the American side of the equation the natural counterbalance to HYDRAs nefarious plots. The real problems for Captain America The First Avenger come when the momentum of the piece is undone by absolutely brutal editing and dialogue. Examples abound but a good one is when Captain America is scheduled to receive an award ... which he doesnt show up to receive. They call his name theyve set up the podium and the audience looks on expectantly. But Captain America is off doing his thing or at least thats the inference. But didnt anyone think to check if he was actually there before they went up to the mic to introduce him? Did he RSVP? Little items like that kept adding up until they became a much bigger issue. Another example occurs when a gal throws herself at the Captain he attempts to parry her physical advances which of course leads to his actual love interest walking in to ""catch them in the act"" all so we can have a 15-minute misunderstanding. Its focus group character management at its worst. But since youve come this far Ill give you three more rapid fire moments of murderous interaction. In one scene Captain America has done something particularly gallant ... to which one of his team members shouts ""Lets hear it for Captain America"" Cue applause. Another primary character can be heard saying ""You dont give up do you?"" and ""Fire again kill him"" in the thick of a battle. I get that the film glances wistfully back to a simpler and gentler time but the writing itself pales in comparison to modern hero narratives. No chances were taken and nothing new was attempted. The film is a composite of what a superhero film should look like. The film that Captain America The First Avenger most homages? Pearl Harbor a prime example of ham-fisted and forced relationships cribbing any sense of authenticity. Captain America punches and kicks his way through the Nazis (and worse) but the movie itself cant find a foothold. Yes in the final moments they manage to logically pivot to The Avengers a film one cant help but look forward to but where lasting impact is concerned Captain America The First Avenger comes up far short.

Adding goofy uncertainty to shoulders as wide as the East River makes for a disarming hero in one of the spiffiest WWII action yarns ever to march out of Hollywood. Recombining DNA from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""Superman"" ""Spider-Man"" and even ""Flags of Our Fathers"" ""Captain America"" smashingly layers superhero stuff such as magic serums atop a wry appreciation for campy WWII propaganda and 60s cinematic rousers that kept Richard Burton Robert Shaw and Lee Marvin constantly employed. This is no mere Corporal Canada or Sgt. Spain were talking about. Busting out of 1942 Brooklyn to inflict some inspired pulverization on Krautlands evilest Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is in reality an asthmatic 90-pound bully-ee with a pipe-cleaner build. This guy isnt puny Hes punys square root. Achieving this effect requires an uncommonly imaginative new usage of CGI to paste Evans face on the build of a shrimpy actor. Queasily I began to suspect they were just using footage of me taken surreptitiously the day I arrived in Fort Bragg in 1988. (Or even the day I left Fort Bragg.) Despite being morsel-sized Steve is resourceful and brave. In basic training -- where he is harangued by a beautiful British drill sergeant/secret agent (the brisk Hayley Atwell from whom you cannot take your eyes off) -- a German scientist (Stanley Tucci) who escaped Hitler decides it is Steve who should get the secret bulkification serum spirited out of Germany that gives a body an instant Barry Bonds treatment. Here geezers may chuckle with recognition for the expert Hun killer Audie Murphy was a runt too -- while John Wayne stayed home. Instead of merely being an unfortunate orphan like Kryptons lost boy Steve morally earns his superpowers in a thrillingly American way. This is meritocracys world capital home of the underdog turned top dog. But if thats too much to chew on -- heres a Nazi submarine popping up in the Brooklyn docks. And heres a kindly old antiques-shop proprietress who is also handy with a machine gun. Theres still some of the serum back in Deutschland where a Hitler aide (Hugo Weaving) obsessed with all things Nordic and supernatural is fully superpowered by the ancient black arts and is also toting around a battery pack that contains enough energy to rule the world. (Cruelly he scoffs at his colleagues down in Africa searching for the Lost Ark who did after all give their lives in the effort.) Meanwhile Steves exploits in foiling the Brooklyn Nazis give the Army an excellent idea for how to deploy him Put him in a woolly blue costume and send him dancing off on a War Bonds tour and USO shows. He traipses through Milwaukee and Buffalo with cuties in red white and blue Rockette wear ending each show by biffing an actor playing the Fuhrer. By the time he gets overseas to brazen his way into some real action he notes ""Ive killed Hitler over 200 times."" Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeelys script not only makes it rain witty lines but delivers fresh stunt ideas and a prominent place for ""Iron Man"" Tony Starks overconfident dad (Dominic Cooper) a gadget monkey who is forever vowing another breakthrough but is as reliable as the Brooklyn Dodgers. Much of the best writing is reserved for Steves boss the colonel Tommy Lee Jones triumphantly back in ""The Fugitive"" mode after all those dreary dramas. Is there anyone youd rather hear say ""They will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell""? While Weaving is saying ""I haff harnessed duh power of duh gods"" and being adequately terrifying (especially when his look changes dramatically in mid-film) TLJ keeps checking in with lines such as ""If you have something to say now is a perfect time to keep it to yourself."" Steve he calls ""a showgirl."" Oof. Soon though Capt. A is kicking A leading a handpicked troop through Europe to roll up the apparatus of the Third Reichs renegade Hydra unit a group of fellows who think Hitler is too much of a wuss. Director Joe Johnston stages the action scenes with a wonderful clanking throwback quality and Steves lads buzz forth on some of the finest motor vehicle chases through a forest since the Ewoks. The quieter moments are just as fine though such as when Steve mourns one setback in a pub with a half-empty bottle of booze. The twist? His molecules are so righteously self-restoring he cant get drunk. And the films characteristic combination of winking at past war films while executing a snappy salute is never more endearing than when Steve is asked by someone he hasnt seen since his weakling days what happened to him. Brightly comes the reply ""I joined the Army"" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Chris Brown to star in romantic comedy Read Next Chris Brown to star in romantic comedy Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 26604 How Hillary blew her big moment 16713 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 11143 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Review Captain America has the right stuff - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Captain America has the right stuff By Tom Charity Special to CNN Chris Evans stars in ""Captain America The First Avenger."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSChris Evans goes from puny to superhero in ""Captain America The First Avenger""The films also stars Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee JonesReviewer says Evans performance is ""always fun to watch"" RELATED TOPICS Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- Does Captain America have what it takes to wow cynical 21st-century kids? And more to the point can Marvel resurrect a brand forged in the heat of World War II and resell it to a global audience no longer inspired by the Stars and Stripes? If ""The First Avenger"" is anything to go by Yes and yes. Rather than fight against the characters flag-waving Nazi-busting roots the movie embraces them going back to the early 40s to remind us what made the ""greatest generation"" so great. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) doesnt want to kill anyone but as he explains to scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) he doesnt like a bully. Steve is short skinny and asthmatic -- he knows all about bullies and he believes in standing up to them. The doctor smiles. Hes found his specimen a man who will use his superstrength for good and wont let it go to his head. That is the antithesis of the Nazi uber-mensch personified by Erskines old boss the egomaniac Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) head of Hitlers paranormal research unit Hydra and better known to comics fans as Red Skull. Remember how comics used to carry commercials for body-building courses? Before Erskines radical treatment Rogers is puny. After he could be the poster boy for Charles Atlas. Hes at least a foot taller and probably 70 pounds of pure muscle heavier. Its any boys fantasy of manhood -- epic and heroic -- and true to form the U.S. government instantly sees the potential putting Captain America on the front line of propaganda war selling bonds and making movies. Its only when hes sent to entertain the troops in Europe that Steve gets the chance to show what he can do in action. Evans -- and the CGI team behind the curtain -- carry off this transition without so much as a smirk. Its not a showy performance but in its way its a fine piece of screen acting -- sharp and focused and always fun to watch. Director Joe Johnston tapped into a similar retro-futurist vibe in ""The Rocketeer"" some moons ago; that mixture of old-timey Saturday morning serial innocence thrills romance and spectacle that completely escaped the last ""Indiana Jones"" flick. Johnston makes it look easy by keeping things simple. It helps that Rick Heinrichs production design is such a gas with sleek submersibles planes and rocket cars that suggest a collaboration between Jules Verne and Howard Hughes. What a pleasure by the way to meet Tony Starks dad Howard (Dominic Cooper) in his prime With Tommy Lee Jones in fine irascible fettle as Colonel Phillips Hugo Weaving seemingly channeling echt Bavarian filmmaker Werner Herzog as the Red Skull and Hayley Atwell made up like Kim Hunter in ""A Matter of Life and Death"" as plucky British agent Peggy Carter the film has more engaging characters than it knows what to do with. Rogers hand-picked team of specialist commandos cry out for their own spinoff. The novelist Michael Chabon has compared ""Captain America"" creator Jack Kirby to Shakespeare and Cervantes. Such high-falutin literary references dont really apply here but Marvel Studios has come up with lively entertainment that keeps faith with the ideals Kirby espoused courage perseverance and kicking butt for the little guy. It may not be the most sophisticated creed but it still holds good.

Now that every new big-budget high-spectacle superhero movie is little more than an extended trailer for the next we have crossed a threshold -- not terrible is the new pretty good.In that spirit Captain America The First Avenger is pretty good insofar as its not nearly as terrible as it seemed destined to be. Of all the superheroes snatched from comic-book lore and splayed on the big screen Captain America is the most improbable and problematic. Thats saying something in this summer of Thor a Norse god who boasts a really big hammer. Captain America is rooted in a long-gone world of pre-ironic patriotism good guys and Nazis. What possible place could a guy in red-white-and-blue tights carrying a shield with a star on it hold in todays postmodern world of terrorists and hackers and superheroes that actually have some sort of superpowers?For the purposes of this setup for next summers first installment in the Avengers franchise director Joe Johnston and his screenwriters deliver an answer by avoiding the question. Captain America is an origins movie set during a World War II America bustling with new GIs recruitment centers and war-bond sales drives. In a movie full of computer-generated magic the most impressive effect is also the most subtle grafting the head of Chris Evans (who was the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies) onto a frail stick-figure torso for the movies pre-transformation introduction to Steve Rogers the man who becomes Captain America.Johnston and company wisely take a counter-approach to the now-standard tactic of draping a superhero movie in a self-satirizing cloak of wink-wink jokes and references. Captain America the movie is as unstintingly earnest and straightforward as its hero the tough little runt who becomes an overly muscled overachieving hero. Evans is effective as a guy who just wants to do his part and ends up being the savior of the free world. Hes helped by a strong supporting cast led by Hugo Weaving who delivers another casually sinister villain. This time hes the super-Nazi who becomes Captain Americas nemesis the Red Skull a villain so evil that he abandons Hitler for not going far enough.Tommy Lee Jones does his good-old-boy thing with typical aplomb as the colonel overseeing the Strategic Scientific Reserve a secret branch of the Army that does stuff like transform a skinny geek into a supersoldier. Stanley Tucci Toby Jones and Dominic Cooper also deliver fun performances. Best-in-supporting-show honors go to Hayley Atwell as Captain Americas smart-tough love interest. Thanks to a script that gives her some character dimension to work with theres real spark and sadness to the back-and-forth between them.Make no mistake This movie is full of moments and situations that are silly preposterous and-or just plain stupid which break down upon the slightest reflection. But presented in the lovely sepia tones of nostalgia the movie focuses on solid performances and spirited storytelling to present a superhero movie that is better than you thought it had any chance of being.Captain America The First AvengerB-Starring Chris Evans Hayley Atwell Hugo Weaving Tommy Lee Jones and Dominic Cooper.

By Joe Morgenstern July 22 2011 If you want to be literal-minded about it--I dont--heres the most obvious problem with ""Another Earth"" The planet of the title an apparent duplicate of our own has suddenly appeared in the sky and just floats there serenely at a safe remove as if the law of gravity had been repealed. Other far-fetched notions turn up regularly; this small-scale film has more outsize ideas than it could possibly manage. Yet Mike Cahills debut feature exerts a gravitational pull out of proportion to its size through powerful performances a lyrical spirit a succession of arresting images and a depth of conviction that sweeps logic aside. ENLARGE Brit Marling in Another Earth Fox Searchlight Exactly what that extraterrestrial Terra represents is hard to pin down--a way of looking at ourselves a chance to rerun our lives with different outcomes. String theory suggests the existence of infinite numbers of movies inspired by the notion of alternate universes and this is one of them. Still the presence of what comes to be called Earth 2 is incidental to a human story that plays out on Earth 1 and the cosmic overtones are less impressive than the emergence of a startlingly fine young actress named Brit Marling. Ms. Marling who wrote the script with Mr. Cahill and served as one of the producers has not been widely known on this planet until now but thats about to change. She plays Rhoda Williams a former student of great intelligence and boundless promise who buries herself in menial labor to atone for having done something dreadful and presumably irreversible. William Mapother--he made a relatively small role memorable in ""In the Bedroom""--is John Burroughs a composer whose life has been devastated by something dreadful and presumably irreversible. Does this sound dreadfully formulaic? It is but it also isnt because the actors and their director invest almost every moment with spellbinding urgency even when Rhoda and John are having spontaneous fun--a lively interlude turns on video boxing--or starting to light up each others lives. Until now Mr. Cahill has been mainly a cinematographer on nature films and a director of documentaries. Like Ms. Marling who has co-directed documentaries with him he studied economics at Georgetown. (She was also an investment-banking analyst at Goldman Sachs which proves the infinite unpredictability of career paths.) I dont know where either of them learned their spare specific approach to drama but its a pleasure to see how the acting anchors a tale that might otherwise have spun off weightless into realms celebrated by Carl Sagan. Take the scene in which Ms. Marling tells a story in her musical voice about a Russian cosmonaut. Its only a story and a slender one at that but it becomes a demonstration of the storytellers art that starts slowly and intimately pulls you in picks up speed and ends in a blaze of elation. In one of Mr. Mapothers surprising turns he plays a soul-filling solo on a musical saw. The tones may have been electronically enhanced but the scene like so many others keeps you watching intently. I dont want to oversell ""Another Earth."" A few passages like one involving a venerable janitor feel downright pretentious while the mysterious apparition of Earth 2 promises a profundity that doesnt pay off. (And when Rhoda and John peer at the nearby planet through an amateur telescope why in this world dont they open the window to see it more clearly?) All the same a small smart movie that keeps you watching intently is a big deal. Captain America The First Avenger Watch a clip of Universal Studios Captain America. In its early stretches this revenant from the early days of Marvel Comics brings a spectacular sense of design to the World War II era and sparkles with ambition; theres even a production number reminiscent of old Warner Brothers musicals. Chris Evans is quietly engaging as Steve Rogers the physical weakling with the indomitable spirit--Steves digitized scrawniness is spectacular too--who is scientifically transformed into Captain America the supersoldier with the vibranium shield that absorbs all vibrations. Hugo Weaving is Red Skull the Nazi villain bent on winning the war with dark science. (""Hail Hydra"" his underlings bark invoking the name of his secret research group.) Stanley Tucci as a Nazi scientist who defected to our side demonstrates the delicate art of understatement. Once Captain America goes off to war in his endearingly silly suit however the movie which was directed by Joe Johnston from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely starts to lose its vibe. ENLARGE Chris Evans in the superhero duds of Captain America Paramount Pictures This is truly a loss. America needs distinctive alternatives to all those comic-book movies that seem to have been written by the same computer and concocted in the same CGI shops. So why cant ""Captain America"" stay the course? The reasons are disparate but cumulative action that grows ponderous and repetitive; a color palette that goes unaccountably dull; a production design that turns claustrophobic; a pallid performance by Hayley Atwell as the training officer Peggy Carter; a lazy one by Tommy Lee Jones as Steves commanding officer Col. Chester Phillips. Mostly though its a matter of pace. Captain Americas metabolism Peggy tells him burns energy four times faster than the average persons. The movies metabolism burns out. Sarahs Key Sarahs Key takes place in modern-day Paris a journalist (Kristen Scott Thomas) finds her life becoming entwined with a young girl whose family was torn apart during the notorious Vel dHiv Roundup in 1942. In these ahistorical times when the present perceives the past dimly if at all historical novels may use a contemporary hook to engage their readers. That strategy worked well enough in the Tatiana de Rosnay novel this movie is based on but not so well in the screen version which was directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner from a script he wrote with Serge Joncour. Kristin Scott Thomas is Julia Jarmond an American journalist in Paris who in the course of writing a magazine piece about occupied France during World War II discovers secrets that shatter the outward stability of her own life. Ms. Scott Thomas is as intelligent and attractive as ever but the synthetic world her character inhabits cant compete with a harrowing past that depicts French complicity in Nazi atrocities a Sophies choice confronting a tender child and a literal skeleton in a closet to emphasize all the metaphorical ones. ENLARGE Kristin Scott Thomas confronts a dark moment of history in Sarahs Key. The Weinstein Company The subject of the piece that Julia sets out to write is the notorious Vel dHiv Roundup of 1942 when French police arrested some 13000 French Jews confined them in an indoor cycling stadium for five days without food or adequate water then sent most of them on their way to Auschwitz. The horror of this event is personified by Sarah a ten-year-old girl played with heartbreaking clarity by Melusine Mayance. (Niels Arestrup and Dominique Frot play the elderly couple who give her succor.) The present-day story by contrast is cluttered with clumsy scenes in magazine offices (""I would just let sleeping dogs lie"" a callow photographer advises Julia); marital conflicts that seem inconsequential in the films larger context and plot contrivances that may have passed for intricacies in the book but now ring as false as Sarahs story rings true. She is the films beating heart and with all due respect to Ms. Scott Thomas its only heroine. DVD FOCUS ""Moon"" (2009) ENLARGE Heres another small smart film with a sci-fi theme and a vital albeit ambiguous center. Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell an astronaut nearing the end of a three-year tour of solitary duty on the moon where hes been supervising machines that mine helium for fusion power on Earth. Suddenly he falls ill then discovers that hes not alone. Another Sam Bell has appeared insisting that hes not a clone. Given a cryptic script--by Nathan Parker--about the elusive question of human identity Mr. Rockwell tops one terrific performance with another. Duncan Jones directed deftly. ""Iron Man"" (2008) Marvel Comics plus star quality equals two scintillating hours of movie (minus if truth be told a few minutes of foolishness in a climactic battle). Robert Downey Jr. works marvels on his own as Tony Stark an arms manufacturer with a genius I.Q. who reinvents himself as a knight in space-age armor righting the worlds wrongs as he soars through the skies in his cyborg suit. Gwyneth Paltrow is Tonys assistant Pepper Potts a woman of substance as well as style despite her Bond-girl moniker. Jon Favreau directed a cast that includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. ""Lacombe Lucien"" (1974) The moral dimension is missing from the hero a 17-year-old peasant boy but not from Louis Malles profound study of guilt and innocence in occupied France. Lucien played by Pierre Blaise is an emotional and cultural infant. Unknown to himself and opaque to those around him he becomes a Nazi collaborator after being turned down by the French Resistance. A more accessible film on the same subject ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" grew out of Malles experience as a young student at a private school on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery that sheltered Jewish students from Nazi deportation.

"Captain America Stand and salute - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Captain America Stand and salute By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Its taken until well into midsummer for the best screen heroes to emerge. Last week we had quintessentially British Harry Potter and this week its ultra-patriotic Captain America The First Avenger. By Jay Maidment Paramount Pictures/Marvel Studio Rallying the troops Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell share a triumphant moment in Captain America The First Avenger . EnlargeClose By Jay Maidment Paramount Pictures/Marvel Studio Rallying the troops Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell share a triumphant moment in Captain America The First Avenger . Captain America avenges summers sodden comic-book adaptations like Green Lantern and deadening combat spectacles like Transformers with a jaunty retro style and stirring World War II story. Yes the characters are cartoonish (theyre comic book heroes after all) but this is the kind of old-fashioned popcorn entertainment summer is made for. As the titular comic book character Chris Evans has an appealing earnest quality whether hes playing the digitally enhanced (reduced?) scrawny Steve Rogers or the well-muscled super-soldier dubbed Captain America. Evans provides just the right human anchor to the flash and dazzle of director Joe Johnstonss production. The movie wouldnt work without Evans likability and the sense of integrity he projects as well as his all-American good looks. VIDEO Preview Captain America But before we even meet our hero the story focuses on a group of present-day soldiers who find a shield frozen in the Arctic. The timing switches to 1942 where we meet renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) who has found an extraordinary power source he plans to use for personal global domination. Cut back to the USA. Captain America The First Avenger    out of four Stars Chris Evans Hugo Weaving Sebastian Stan Hayley Atwell Tommy Lee Jones Dominic Cooper Director oe Johnston DistributorParamount Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action Running time 2 hours 1 minute Opens Friday nationwide The diminutive Steve (Evans) desperately wants to serve his country. But try as he might the skinny pint-size fellow cant transcend his 4-F status. Steves plucky courage is rewarded by military scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who enlists him for an experiment that will transform the puny guy into a brawny soldier with superhuman strength and speed. Throw in an indestructible Vibranium shield to fend off bullets and a superhero is born. Before his transformation Steve is humorously taunted by gruff Col. Phillips (a perfectly deadpan Tommy Lee Jones) and admired for his sincerity by British officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). An old-fashioned romance is hinted at with more meaningful glances than actual follow-through. Their relationship seems forced and unnecessary mostly because Carters character lacks dimension as is the case with everyone save the heroic Steve. After his bulked-up transformation Steve ends up assigned to the USO to raise savings bonds. Then in costume as Captain America he leaves the stage and leaps into action when he hears his best friend ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is lost behind enemy lines. He saves his pal and the rest of the troops and is assigned to fight the evil Schmidt who has transformed himself into Red Skull leader of evil battalions. Service and loyalty shine especially bright when contrasted with the megalomania of Red Skull. Their final battle while well-choreographed grows a bit overblown and the 3-D is not put to particularly good use. But its fun to meet Iron Mans old man inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) and see the origins of his son Tonys charming swagger. Marvel Comics is flourishing and Captain America is one of its oldest superheroes. (Thor and Iron Man have also made particularly effective action movie heroes.) While the story is preposterous and most of the cast standard-issue its hard not to like a comic-book movie that features both Busby Berkeley-style dance numbers and high-tech vaporizing weaponry.

"Captain America reviewed the best superhero movie of the summer. Slate Sign In Sign Up Captain America reviewed the best superhero movie of the summer. Captain America reviewed the best superhero movie of the summer. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 21 2011 708 PM My Hero Captain America rescued my faith in the comic-book movie. By Dana Stevens Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell in Captain America The First Avenger Joe Johnstons Captain America The First Avenger (Disney/Marvel) provided one of the best sensations Ive felt at the movies this year the pleasant shock of expectations reversed. Captain America isnt a masterpiece but its a solidly crafted elegant adventure movie that held my attention from start to finish and sent me out into the street energized instead of enervated. I didnt think any comic-book blockbuster could get through the scar tissue thats built up around my heart. This year alone weve already had The Green Hornet Thor X-Men First Class and Green Lantern --movies that have run the gamut from bad to less-bad to really-not-so-bad-in-parts-all-things-considered. But Captain America serves as a reminder of why we started plundering comics for story ideas in the first place because theyre great sources of American populist myth in addition to being rollicking good fun. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Captain America also proves the point--seemingly simple but oddly difficult for Hollywood producers to retain from one movie to the next--that what makes a film sing isnt the special effects or the casting or even necessarily the direction Its the script stupid. Good writing is the sine qua non of good narrative filmmaking. Blue-chip actors are of little use if theyre wrapping their mouths around shoddy dialogue as Oscar-winners Anthony Hopkins Natalie Portman and Christoph Waltz have all made clear this year in superhero-supporting roles. And spectacularly destroying Chicago as Michael Bay did in Transformers Dark of the Moon is only thrilling if youve created characters the audience doesnt want to see crushed by rubble. Advertisement The writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also collaborated on all three Chronicles of Narnia films) choose to start their story in March 1941 the date of release of the first Captain Avenger. That comic created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby carried an unabashed anti-isolationist message that made it controversial in those pre-Pearl Harbor days The cover showed our flag-emblazoned hero Steve Rogers socking Hitler in the jaw. Markus and McFeelys bright idea was to approach Steve Rogers story as a straight-up period piece no smirking nods to fans no stunt performances or fourth-wall-breaking celebrity cameos (with the exception of a questionably necessary epilogue that well return to later). This is an earnestly inspirational war picture; its no accident the closing credits begin with the image of an ""Uncle Sam Wants You""-style recruitment poster. In those days before Pearl Harbor a barking mad Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) breaks into a Norwegian crypt to steal a small crystal cube whose possessor can harness near-infinite power. As Schmidt gloats over his prize we jump ahead to the first confused days after Americas entry into the war. The 98-pound patriot Steve Rogers (Chris Evans his head digitally transposed onto a much smaller mans body) has been trying to get into the Army by any means necessary including lying to the draft board. Asked why hes so fiercely committed to fighting Hitler Steve says simply ""I dont like bullies."" But his small stature and long list of physical ailments have earned him an unwanted 4-F exemption. When Steves valor is spotted by Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) a government scientist working on a secret experiment Erskine convinces a hardboiled Army colonel (Tommy Lee Jones) to hand over the puny recruit. After a lab procedure turns him into a towering slab of manhood Steve is first recruited to sell war bonds Outfitted in a hooded woolen suit and billed as ""Captain America"" he tours the country performing staged feats of derring-do in front of a line of red-white-and-blue-clad chorus girls. (The musical montage in which we see this act coming together over a note-perfect period-style song is one of the movies many small delights.) The gambit of having the Captain America character be someone elses creation--all Steve wanted was to serve as an ordinary soldier--cleverly circumvents a problem endemic to the superhero origin story How can our hero credibly go from normal to super without sacrificing his humility? When Steve hears that his childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has disappeared behind enemy lines in Italy a career punching out a Hitler stand-in before cheering crowds abruptly loses its appeal. So aided by Peggy Carter (the luscious Hayley Atwell) a top agent at the mysterious Strategic Science Reserve Steve steals away on a one-man rescue mission. In the process he learns that the renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt has now become Red Skull a crimson-skinned supervillain whos so unhinged he makes Hitler look mellow. Even under a half-digital half-latex mask that limits his range of expression Weaving makes a splendid meanie striding the halls of his Goth-Nazi-industrial hideout in a billowing leather coat. Chris Evans whos been a memorable supporting presence in mainstream movies for a while now (he played the volatile Human Torch in the Fantastic Fourfilms and the arrogant action star Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) effortlessly owns the role of Steve Rogers. Hes wholesome but not goody-goody masculine but not macho and likeable without begging for the audiences love. In fact theres not a role here that isnt well-cast Toby Jones as a pusillanimous German scientist Dominic Cooper as the wealthy industrialist Howard Stark (father of Iron Man Tony Stark). Only when Samuel L. Jackson popped up near the end to remind us that this movie is only the latest chapter in the Ring Cycle-length windup to the coming Avengers movie did I feel torn out of Captain Americas remarkably consistent and well-integrated world. Between the old-fashioned gung-ho score by Alan Silvestri and the loving attention to WWII period detail Captain America at times recalls (without ever being as good as) Steven Spielbergs wartime adventure yarn Raiders of the Lost Ark. Tommy Lee Jones as the cranky Colonel Phillips gets a few Indiana Jones-worthy rejoinders and theres a propeller-related stunt that recalls one of Indys more memorable skirmishes. This Spielberg connection makes sense given that director Joe Johnston won an Oscar for his work designing visual effects for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Its probably too much to hope that Captain America represents a new kind of superhero movie. Im just grateful to Johnston for a nice midsummer break from the other kind.

"Captain America The First Avenger movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Captain America The First AvengerChris Evans saves the day with a stirring performance as the title character that makes this anything but just another superhero film.July 22 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Chris Evans plays Captain America in ""Captain America The First... (Marvel Studios )If youve seen more than one Marvel Entertainment film survived the standard cameos by Stan Lee and the obligatory appearances by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury you would be more than forgiven for feeling youve seen enough. ""Captain America The First Avenger"" is not the film to change your mind but it does have something the others do not Chris Evans in the title role. Evans has gone the Marvel route before playing Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in a pair of ""Fantastic Four"" movies. But as Steve Rogers a weak young man who gets turned into the husky Captain America by a dose of Super-Soldier Serum this part brings out an appealing earnestness and humility in the actor that is certainly not business as usual in the comic book superhero genre. ""Captain America"" is not just set during World War II. As the first comic book in what was to become the Marvel universe it actually dates to March 1941 months before Americas entry into the conflict and its cover of the captain cold-cocking Adolf Hitler apparently turned some heads back in the day. Though it begins and ends with a scene or two in the present as directed by Joe Johnston from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely ""Captain America"" is first and foremost an origins story. Almost half of the films running time elapses before Rogers gets any kind of power at all and though its elements are awfully familiar its the most involving part of the film because it takes advantage of Evans performance. These early-days sections are so old-fashioned that if you take away the copious special effects watching ""Captain America"" feels akin to watching the venerable 1950s television version of ""Superman"" starring George Reeves. Buttons are pushed dials are turned secret passwords are uttered and lights blink just like they did way back when. We first meet Steve Rogers as the classic 98-pound weakling a young man so determined to join the Army like best buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) that he keeps trying to enlist even though the armed services keep turning him down. Impressed by his gumption if not his physique is A(c)migrA(c) scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci with an accent and Albert Einstein hair) of the governments super secret Strategic Scientific Reserve. Erskine developed the Super-Soldier Serum but fled his homeland because the Nazis wanted to get their hands on it. The good doctor knows that because the drug amplifies ""all that is inside you"" potential super soldiers must be pure of heart. Which Steve Rogers definitely is. The Americans wouldnt you know it are not the only people with super soldiers on their minds. The Third Reich led by a renegade officer named Johann Schmidt (an expert Hugo Weaving) is also in the market but it is going about it in a somewhat different way. Schmidt is the top man in HYDRA the Nazis occult research arm and early in the film we see him somewhere in Norway making off with a mysterious green object ""the jewel of Odins treasure room."" That turns out to be an energy source so phenomenal it could pulverize the world. No one ever tells us exactly what this cube is (this is a comic book movie after all and you are expected to know going in) but its power convinces Schmidt to step out of Hitlers shadow and rule the world on his own. Far too soon we are treated to the spectacle of uniformed minions shouting ""Heil HYDRA"" as they lift both hands in a rather silly salute. Weaving is only one of the strong supporting cast this movie has attracted. Toby Jones (Truman Capote in ""Infamous"") capably plays HYDRAs No. 2 Dr. Arnim Zola; British actress Hayley Atwell is both starchy and sensuous as potential love interest Peggy Carter; and Tommy Lee Jones has a bit of fun with Col. Chester Phillips a part he could probably play in his sleep. Johnston who has the gentle and charming ""October Sky"" on his rA(c)sumA(c) is at home in the films softer moments including the difficulty Captain America has getting taken seriously as a soldier even after his transformation. The films action-heavy second half even with the addition of 3-D cant help but feel pro-forma. Even though the captain is not technically invulnerable it is so not in the cards for anything to happen to him that it is hard to stay involved. There is in fact a pro forma nature to this entire project which exists not just for its own sake but also to prepare the movie-going universe for next years ""Avengers"" movie which will unite the Captain with Thor Iron Man the Hulk and assorted other comic book folks for the greater fiscal glory of the Marvel juggernaut. Thats understandable from a business point of view but the captain is such an unexpectedly humble hero its hard not to hope hell get more screen time of his own. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Captain America The First Avenger MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of science fiction violence and action Running time 2 hours 4 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJoe Simon dies at 98; co-creator of Captain AmericaDecember 16 2011New on DVD Captain America The First AvengerOctober 23 2011Captain America will try to win over the worldJuly 22 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentCaptain AmericaCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-captain-america-20110722,0,49462.story?track=rss",200,captainamericathefirstavenger21,captainamericathefirstavenger,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the superhero line of work the clothes dont always make the man. In the case of ""Captain America The First Avenger"" our titular hero has ditched the red white and blue spandex for something a bit more rugged. The colors remain but the new suit is built for combat with a Kevlar torso and a gun. He looks like a vintage paratrooper. Which is to say he looks kinda cool. The updating mostly stops at the costume. Captain America might be the newest superhero to punch his way onto the big screen but hes actually one of the oldest. The comic-book version first appeared 70 years ago created to capitalize on the countrys entrance into World War II (the cover of the first issue depicted Captain America knocking out Adolf Hitler). In ""Captain America"" the character is acting his age. In other words This is your grandpas Captain America. And hes a darn wholesome one. By todays superhero standards Captain America might as well be Archie. Batman tossed gangsters off buildings in ""The Dark Knight."" The hero in ""Thor"" is an egomaniac who prefers preemptive strikes. ""Iron Mans"" Tony Stark is a drunk. This Captain America isnt even sure he wants to kill Nazis. The year is 1942 and this is his reason for enlisting ""I dont like bullies"" he says ""I dont care where theyre from."" CAPTAIN AMERICA THE FIRST AVENGER Two and a half out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings | 3D Even in his own time period he sounds dated. Performance-enhancing serum As the film opens German and American militaries are racing to design a serum that will give its soldiers super powers. A sickly 85-pound Steve Rogers is chosen to be our first super soldier. The actor behind the mask is Chris Evans a blonde beefcake who played the Human Torch in Marvels ""Fantastic Four"" franchise. After providing comic relief in those films his transition to iconic lead role is adequate but less than stunning. Regardless the military doctors juice him up his muscles explode and as Captain America he starts kicking Nazi butt. The Nazis have their own super soldier -- the Red Skull (basically a guy with a red skull). Hes in charge of the Fuhrers ""deep science"" division i.e. he blows stuff up. And he wants to blow up the world. Captain Americas objective stop him. Explosions and 3-D carnage ensue. The action is shot with precision and clarity. The jokes are funny. The side characters (particular Stanley Tucci as a German scientist and Tommy Lee Jones a gruff colonel) are well cast . Heres whats missing tension drama and most of all a sense of wonder. This is a superhero movie isnt it? In this summers ""Thor"" we got the feeling that the movies god-like hero might actually lose on Earth. ""Captain America"" director Joe Johnston spends so much time making the period costumes and the World War II tanks look perfect that theres no room for surprises. Everything is expected. We know exactly when Cap is going to save the day tell a one-liner and kiss the girl. This is the part of the review where we acknowledge that the film was presented in 3-D. The 3-D looks good. Things -- yes things like water faucets and poles and trees and flying shields -- appear in the foreground. These visual tricks add nothing to the story. ""Captain Americas"" saving grace is Tommy Lee Jones in a role hes played dozens of times. As Col. Phillips hes grumpy battle-hardened and hilarious. After Cap lays a smooch on his girlfriend during the climactic battle he looks to the colonel for approval to which Jones decries ""Im not kissing you"" Theres a slight problem when the superhero in the superhero movie isnt the most interesting character. For the sequel (yes there will be many sequels) the filmmakers would be smart to write in more scenes for Jones. Or better yet Do they make a Captain America suit thatll fit a scene-chewing 65-year-old grump? thorgenstartribune.com 612-673-7909 tomhorgen View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Starring Chris Evans Hugo Weaving Director Jack Kirby Zak Penn Release Opened Jul 22 2011  Editorial Review Captain America a superhero film with a heart for the little guyBy Ann HornadayThursday July 21 2011In any other cinematic era ""Captain America The First Avenger"" would be a bona fide movie event the kind of swiftly moving eye-popping effects-heavy spectacle for which movies were made. But we live in the midst of a comic-book-movie glut where no sooner has ""Thor"" opened than it must make way for ""X-Men First Class"" which then has to scoot down to make room for ""Captain America"" the better to set up next years superhero-pa-looza ""The Avengers.""Meanwhile Iron Man Spider-Man Batman and the Hulk wait in the wings -- tinkering spinning brooding and turning green with anticipation of their next moment in the spotlight. So ""Captain America"" arrives already in danger of being lost in that wildly genetically enhanced shuffle which is a shame because its a terrific movie. The ultimate origin story of the original ur-myth of Marvel Comics seemingly endless comic-book universe the World War II-era drama returns the form to its classic roots with the square-jawed forthrightness of its straight-arrow protagonist.Even his name exudes an America that time forgot Steve Rogers who as channeled by Chris Evans embodies the kind of wisdom bravery and fairness that a country mired in debt and political rancor could use right around now. ""I dont like bullies"" Rogers says simply before joining the U.S. Army in 1942. Some time later after hes been pumped up by a muscle-building serum even Roger Clemens would envy someone asks Rogers ""What makes you so special?"" ""Nothin"" he replies. ""Im just a kid from Brooklyn."" Sure but one who was knocking Hitler on the jaw when he was first introduced to comic book readers in 1941 (goading a recalcitrant administration into doing the right thing).Evans brings just the right amount of confidence and aw-shucks modesty to Rogers who surely counts as the most appealing Marvel hero starting out as a 98-pound weakling (achieved by some clever computer imagery and body-double work in ""Captain America"") and winding up as a superbly chiseled super-soldier whose heart still goes out to the little guy. Director Joe Johnston has surrounded Evans with a wonderful cast of supporting players including Stanley Tucci as the German doctor who turns Rogers from puny to magnificent; Hayley Atwell as a comely British military liaison named Peggy Carter; Dominic Cooper as millionaire inventor Howard Stark (a.k.a. Iron Mans dad) and the scene-stealing Tommy Lee Jones who nails the movies most amusing lines as the crusty Col. Chester Phillips.Then theres Hugo Weaving as Captain Americas nemesis Red Skull -- a role that requires delivering a genuine performance from behind grotesque crimson prosthetics which Weaving accomplishes with admirable dexterity. In fact everyone hits their marks with energy and finesse in ""Captain America"" which with its clean Art Deco lines and sprightly spirit exemplifies why comic book movies are such reliable fodder for Hollywood. They come pre-storyboarded after all; their gadgets dinguses and doo-dads are a production artists dream just as those tights capes and masks must provide fetishistic frissons for the most on-trend costume designer.Throw in the requisite special effects iconic roles actors live for and male-safe makeover fantasies and you have a full-employment program for an industry uniquely suited to provide the escapism wish fulfillment and telegraphed narratives audiences crave along with their jumbo popcorns and super-size Cokes.Johnston understands all these impulses but he doesnt dumb ""Captain America"" down in order to assuage them -- unless you count the nonsensical decision to present the movie in 3-D which does nothing to enliven the experience but instead dims what should be a crayon-bright palette into a muddy glop. Instead he revels both in the fantastical elements of the era and the eras embrace of the fantastic staging the retro-futuristic 1942 Worlds Exposition and the War Bond road shows Rogers stars in with lavish affection and splendor. Indeed more than its Marvel predecessors (or successors depending on the medium) ""Captain America"" shares an aesthetic sense with Quentin Tarantinos pop pastiche ""Inglorious Basterds"" about a ragtag team of soldiers similar to the ones Rogers assembles on a similarly unlikely Allied mission.Steve Rogers of course is a glorious good guy not superhuman as much as super-humane Its revealing somehow that he chooses a defensive shield for his talismanic identifier rather than a metal sheath or gun (fill in your own blanks compensation-wise). With ""Batman"" mired in its own sense of solemnity and self-importance ""Spider-Man"" franchised into bloated Broadway oblivion and ""Iron Man"" in danger of succumbing to its protagonists own arrogance and entitlement ""Captain America"" might hold the most promise not just of saving the world but of saving comic book movies from themselves.Contains intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence.

We know what comes next. Weve seen our share of superhero movies after all. This summer alone offered up no less than four iterations Thor X-Men First Class The Green Lantern and now Captain America The First Avenger. So we recognize this scene for what it is the big final-reel moment when things look their darkest and the camera zooms in our beaten-but-unbowed champion long enough for him to deliver his statement of principles in a speech meant to stir our hearts and set us to cheering. ""Nope"" says Cap and promptly sends his shield caroming off the Red Skulls red ... skull. Thats it. ""Nope."" A flat monosyllabic note of rejection before jumping back into the fray. Its one of several instances in which Captain Americas filmmakers tweak a familiar superhero trope but its no mere wink to the audience -- its an elegant summation of the character weve come to know over the preceding two hours. Which is why that moment and the film work as well as they do. To play Steve Rogers Evans swaps out the slick bravado he brought to The Fantastic Fours Human Torch in favor of a quiet yet earnest sense of determination. Thats a risk not least because the roles over-the-top oddly bifurcated physicality harbors the real potential to distract our attention from any small performance choices an actor might care to make. Throughout the films first act Evans face is digitally -- and convincingly -- grafted onto a slight bird-boned body; following the secret government experiment that transforms Rogers into an improbably and impressively buff super-soldier Evans must carry the film on those flesh-colored medicine balls he keeps where you and I keep our shoulders. And through it all whether Captain Americas takin the good fight to HYDRA (the Nazis ""deep science division"") or hawking war bonds in a traveling USO show (the films cleverest conceit which features dancing girls a pantomime Hitler an insanely hummable period-appropriate ditty supplied by Alan Menken and -- in what seems a nod to diehard fans -- a cheap-looking costume very much like the one Cap sported in his cringeworthy straight-to-VHS 1990 film outing) Evans confidently understates providing the whole noisy spectacle with a laconic human center. Given the characters militaristic roots it was inevitable that the film would affix Captain Americas considerable superhero trappings onto a war-movie chassis. But that makes all the difference Where The Green Lantern talked (and talked) a big game about the power of Will and what it means to be a Hero Captain America just shuts up and moves. In place of the lengthy training montages that sap the momentum from films like X-Men First Class director Joe Johnston and his screenwriters have Cap discover his newfound abilities on the go in the midst of a frenetic chase scene through the streets of Brooklyn. From there the movie surges ahead moving nimbly through a series of action set-pieces that owe more to films like Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone than they do to say The Green Hornet. (NOTE This is a mercy.) i Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) a snarling Nazi villain is the Axis powers answer to Captain America. His wonderfully hammy performance is a highlight of the brisk entertaining film. Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) a snarling Nazi villain is the Axis powers answer to Captain America. His wonderfully hammy performance is a highlight of the brisk entertaining film. Paramount Pictures The stakes are high the fight scenes smartly stylized and a passel of capital-A Actors including Stanley Tucci as a gently paternal scientist and Tommy Lee Jones as an irascible army colonel gamely provide some dramatic ballast to the rollicking shoot-em-up mise-en-scene. Its Weaving however chewing gleefully on the Red Skulls crisp Republic-serial German accent and fondness for (yep) Wagner operas who supplies perhaps the films most satisfying element its truly hiss-worthy villain. Less effective it must be said are the sundry bits of Marvel Universe housekeeping the movie is tasked to perform. As ""I-now-wield-the-power-of-the-GODS-THEMSELVES"" McGuffins go the Cosmic Cube (first glimpsed in the post-credits coda of this summers Thor) cant help but look like a paperweight swiped from the desk of Mies van der Rohe and the work required to set up next summers The Avengers feels more like rickety last-minute scaffolding than organic narrative infrastructure. But thats a quibble; by finding an ingenious way to streamline a now-familiar genre -- and by providing a means to fill up your muggy summer afternoon watching hordes of evil soldiers gettin their arsche handed to them by a true-blue Sentinel of Liberty -- Captain America The First Avenger does his country proud.

In ""Captain America The First Avenger"" he doesnt have Batmans cool cynicism Thors grunge-rock appeal or Iron Mans postmodern snark. But never underestimate the power of old-fashioned corn. An unabashed underdog story ""Captain America The First Avenger"" is a rousing romantic crowd pleaser with a classic Hollywood feel and not just because its set in World War II. This is a movie and a superhero with heart. The nearly unknown Chris Evans stars as Steve Rogers a Brooklyn kid repeatedly rejected by the Army for his drinking-straw physique (created through some impressive digital magic). But Dr. Erskine played by an endearing Stanley Tucci likes Steves pluck and picks him for a secret ""super-soldier"" experiment. After a serum injection in a delightfully Frankensteinian lab Rogers becomes taller broader-chested and alluringly sweaty. British officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is happy to towel him down. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Rogers doppelganger is Schmidt aka Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who took the same serum. ""Good becomes great; bad becomes worse"" Erskine explains. Schmidt who leads a Nazi sub-cult called Hydra isnt terribly complex -- movie Nazis rarely are -- but he gives Rogers a reason to flex his new muscles. Director Joe Johnston (1991s ""The Rocketeer"") fills this handsome-looking movie with nice details a beat-up shield a rugged jumpsuit and thankfully no tights. Despite the vague plot (world domination and all that) ""Captain America"" is enlivened by smart dialogue engaging characters (Tommy Lee Jones plays a lovably cantankerous colonel) and Evans himself. What makes him so convincing? As with Christophe Reeves Superman you somehow just know hes the good guy. Thats a quality that never goes out of fashion. PLOT The story of a skinny kid who becomes the countrys savior. RATING PG-13 (violence gruesome imagery) CAST Chris Evans Hayley Atwell Tommy Lee Jones Hugo Weaving advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 202 PLAYING AT Area theaters some in 3-D BOTTOM LINE A genuine crowd pleaser rousing romantic and big-hearted. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Back story Evans ready for call of fame Chris Evans understands he may have to give up some privacy in exchange for the fame he is likely to encounter as the star of ""Captain America The First Avenger."" ""Ive been making movies for 10 years but I can still go to a ballgame I can still live my life with relative ease and anonymity"" the Boston native says. ""This movie potentially could change that and thats scary."" The trade-off weighed heavily on Evans mind before he agreed to play the iconic Marvel superhero. But the 30-year-old decided the creative rewards of working with director Joe Johnston (whose credits include the 1991 superhero adventure ""The Rocketeer"") were worth the cost. advertisement | advertise on newsday Evans plays Steve Rogers a scrawny teenager who desires nothing more than to serve his country in the U.S. Army in World War II. The actor says he likes his characters earnestness and integrity. ""I dont think he would let his new physical form change who he is"" he says of his character. ""He is who he is and thats what makes him worthy of this gift. He appreciates everything he didnt have before and hes OK with it."" Though Evans is 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 170 pounds he recalls being a late bloomer. ""I weighed 135 pounds until I was at least 17"" he says.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures/Jay Maidment) Jay Maidment In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Hayley Atwell portrays Peggy Carter right and Chris Evans portrays Steve Rogers in a scene from the film ""Captain America The First Avenger."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jay Maidment) ""Captain America"" is the best kind of comic-book movie. Its stylish and spectacular yet its rooted in history and human emotions. Its smart yet its funny. Its wise yet its willing to kick ass when it has to.Just like the U.S. of A.Befitting the title this is a movie about American values. But the country that it celebrates is the not the flag-waving aggressor thats been masquerading as Uncle Sam for the last decade. This is the optimistic slow-to-anger citadel of decency we see in the movies of the 1940s. This shrewdly old-fashioned flick is set during World War II when Americans dreamt of progress while Europe slid back to barbaric feuds. Skinny Brooklyn boy Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is willing to fight for truth justice and the American way but the draft board refuses him. However exiled German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recognizes Rogers courage and enlists him for a secret project to build a super soldier who can defeat the fascist bullies of the Third Reich.Patton-esque Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones at his tough-talking best) is skeptical of the costly project and visiting British agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is a fence-sitter but when the serum-fortified Rogers rises from the gurney with massive muscles and super speed they are impressed - for the few seconds before a saboteur tests Rogers mettle. A chase and shoot-out in a ""Dick Tracy"" version of New York is one of the most thrilling scenes of the summer movie season yet this generous film keeps the popcorn popping for two full hours. Its got musical numbers as Rogers is costumed as Captain America and sent on a war-bonds tour; its got a prison break as the touring celebrity frees some multicultural P.O.W.s from the Nazis and its got a mythic smackdown as Captain America squares off against Germanic evil genius Johann Schmidt (the hugely entertaining Hugo Weaving mimicking documentarian Werner Herzog). In terms of its style and tone ""Captain America"" is comparable to an Indiana Jones movie so its only mildly surprising that it was directed by Steven Spielberg sidekick Joe Johnston. Johnston (""Jumanji"" ""The Rocketeer"") is a journeyman a regular Joe who rose to the occasion like the scrawny everyman brought to life by Evans and the crackerjack effects team. On almost every level ""Captain America"" is better engineered and more entertaining than the ""Iron Man"" or ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman"" films. Its a movie that makes you proud to be an American.""Captain America The First Avenger""Three and a half stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 205  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence Find movie showtimes Nov 11 2010 (...)

Slideshow Captain America Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The First Avenger Captain America >> Previously Johnny Storm the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films Evans has a jaunty humor strictly under wraps in this diverting hokum from Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer October Sky) about the scrawny kid transformed into a muscular superhero the Allies secret weapon against Nazi renegade Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). His head digitally superimposed on a pencil-necked body Evans plays Steve Rogers a 90-pound asthmatic desperate to enlist in the U.S. Army and routinely rejected as physically unfit. At a New York induction center a German refugee scientist (Stanley Tucci with a Col. Klink accent) taps Steve for a military experiment. ""De veek mann knows de value off strength und compassion"" says the scientist. In other words the kid who is accustomed to being bullied will not use his enhanced powers to bully others. Steve is injected with super-serum and irradiated to accelerate its steroidal effects. He emerges a full foot taller with square shoulders bulging biceps and the ability to outrun most motor vehicles. Now buff he catches the eye of British officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) on whom he nurses a major crush and earns the grudging respect of Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones gruffly endearing in the one good performance in the film). The newly pumped Steve becomes Captain America. Assigned to sell war bonds he goes AWOL to liberate U.S. prisoners of war. From its antagonists to its art direction everything about Johnstons movie has a been-there seen-that familiarity. Yet Evans clean-cut idealism and objectives make old-fashioned patriotism look fresh. Shot in 2-D Captain America was subjected to a 3-D conversion. The effect is one of a nicely lit and atmospheric film seen through an algae-encrusted aquarium glass. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet More than any Marvel Studios film since Iron Man Captain America The First Avenger feels like its working from a conceptual checklist titled How To Make A Superhero Movie Fun For Everyone. For mainstream viewers there are big action sequences a heady battle montage a 40s setting featuring uber-Nazis with glowing laser-guns and plenty of well-timed one-liners. For the hardcore comic-book fans theres the Wilhelm scream the Stan Lee cameo the Marvel-history inside jokes and a self-aware humor that even includes a wry dig at Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Just so everyone feels included the eponymous hero has a competent multicultural support team and a kick-ass love interest who never needs to be rescued. And to cover even more bases director Joe Johnston reaches past all the modern meta humor to inject the film with the cheery gosh-wow sincerity he brought to The Rocketeer. The roster of crowd-pleasing elements seems dubiously calculated and ambitiously lengthy but ultimately thats no strike against the film which follows Iron Mans lead in obscuring the calculation behind outsized gleeful fun. Granted Captain America could use some of the charisma of Iron Mans star. Thanks to a creepy Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like effect that puts his CGI-shrunk head atop a smaller mans body--making him look like the worlds gauntest lollipop--Chris Evans (the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four films) spends the first quarter of the film as a scrawny short asthmatic but lion-hearted New Yorker desperate to join the military and help fight Hitler. Evans gets a lot of pathos out of the frustrated-shrimp version of himself Constantly tempted to be bitter or belligerent he instead endures his physical limitations with appealing determination. But once German expat scientist Stanley Tucci recognizes his sterling qualities and uses mad science to transform him into a muscular golden god he loses all nuance and becomes a bland slab of beef. Fortunately the film around him remains a fast-paced four-color delight. As Nazi crypto-researcher The Red Skull (Matrix-series baddie Hugo Weaving) delves into mad science of his own he launches a global takeover that naturally requires superhero intervention--but thanks to grumbling commanding officer Tommy Lee Jones Evans is sidelined as a touring propaganda device until he takes matters into his own red white and blue hands. Johnston and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (partners on the three modern Narnia movies) let the first quarter of the movie stretch out slowly enough to establish a vast cast including tough-as-nails military liaison and ass-kicker extraordinaire Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Captain Americas best bud Bucky (Sebastian Stan). Then they ramp up the comedy with a terrific propaganda montage before getting into the heroism. At times Captain America feels like four films in one packed with incident and distinct acts a few of which work better than others. (The tone-deaf ending which turns a tragic situation into a stupid punchline is a massive miscalculation.) But for the most part it manages to balance laughs genuinely rousing moments and a fully packed agenda into something fleet enough to keep running under the weight of its rich ambitions.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Heres the funny thing Despite all the Captain America rah-rah in costume and indestructible shield the movie is at its best when the story sticks with skinny Steve. Evans who played the Human Torch in two less-than-fantastic Fantastic Four films brings such humor heart and vigor to virtuous Steve that our rooting interest holds even when the action gets to be standard-issue as it did in director Joe Johnstons The Rocketeer. Hayley Atwell excels as the Captains soldier crush. And Hugo Weaving huffs and puffs mightily as the Red Skull the rogue Nazi freak who heads the Hydra plot for world takeover. But its Evans playing it old-school who has us looking forward to The Avengers next year when the pioneering Captain leads Iron Man Thor and the Hulk on present-day adventures. Evans makes a hell of an MVP.

(Marvel) Joe Neumaier Thursday July 21 2011 1203 PM Title Captain America The First Avenger A scrawny guy becomes a WWII superhero. With Chris Evans Hayley Atwell Tommy Lee Jones. Director Joe Johnston. (205). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. Need a top-notch comic-book movie to stop this summers march of mediocre superheroes? ""Captain America The First Avenger"" reporting for duty. The latest cinematic transplant from the house of Marvel has a greater mission than just solving its heros neuroses or arrogance. This muscular red-blooded adventure has a decent heart and the stuff of Saturday afternoon serials running through its veins. In a present-day prologue government agents find an aircraft containing a frozen passenger in the Arctic. Then its 1942 and scrawny Brooklynite Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is 4F and cant serve in WWII. Little guy Steve never backs away from a fight and hates bullies which is how he sees the Axis powers. At an expo at Flushing Meadows park Steves complaints are overheard by Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) a military scientist who offers Steve a chance to be part of an experiment thatll bulk him up into a super-soldier. It works although enemy agents steal the serum to help a scary renegade Nazi called the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) harness otherworldly powers. As the only super-soldier Steve is assigned by cranky Col. Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and comely officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) to the USO selling war bonds as a character called Captain America. But when he hears a friends unit is lost Steve in costume leaps into action behind enemy lines. He saves the troops and is awarded a team to fight the Red Skull. How he winds up in the ice involves the Red Skulls flying craft and Steves indestructible boomerang-like shield. But the real kick is the pitch-perfect tone harnessed by director Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer"" ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" ""The Wolfman"") a genre stylist specializing in classic movie moments. He and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make sure we know skinny Steve (Evans head is believably CGId onto a smaller body) before his transformation to give the story a solid backbone. Meanwhile the nifty wartime setting adds to a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-lite feel. And there are secret laboratories behind bookshelves a mountainside fortress and tie-ins to the Marvel characters wholl assemble in next years ""The Avengers."" Anchoring it all is Evans striking the right balance between old-fashioned corniness and retro-style integrity. Jones is enjoyably gruff Tucci adds a twinkling kindly conscience and Weaving would be deliciously loathsome even if he didnt look like a sunburned Valdemort. Though the action scenes are rousing an impressive last battle is regrettably missing. But hang in there A head-spinningly cool finale will have you seeing more stars than there are on Caps iconic costume. Magic Moment When Captain America throws his mighty shield -- and the 3--D thwacks it into your face.

Its paced and designed for people who wont shrivel up and die if two or three characters take 45 seconds between combat sequences to have a conversation about world domination or a dame."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;This is the fifth film in the interconnected Marvel comics universe wherein the whole gang -- Captain America Iron Man the Hulk and Thor plus their superpowers -- will come together to form a boy band next May in ""The Avengers."" So what makes ""Captain America"" more than just a pro forma origin story?For one thing the movie takes its mythology seriously without choking on it. Director Johnston knows and loves the storys period; he made ""The Rocketeer"" (another engaging adventure more of a cult title than a popular success). Johnston brings to ""Captain America"" a similar zest for retro detail in the service of an early 1940s story dealing in Nazis and World War II but also in blue-ray ray guns and a true-blue shield-brandishing symbol of the American fighting spirit informed by the sort of humility that you do not find in anything directed by Michael ""Transformers"" Bay. Its speculation of course but I suspect Bay would explode like the Nazi at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" were he to receive orders to sit still for two hours and watch ""Captain America."" Whats this? A prologue that takes a minute or two to establish a mood of eerie atmosphere? Sound levels suited to inhabitants of this planet not some other louder planet? GaaaaaaaahhhMarvel introduced the title character in early 41 with legendary cover art depicting a square-jawed American socking Adolf Hitler square in the jaw. Creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby offered a wish-fulfillment fantasy for 98-pound weaklings everywhere. Asthmatic young Steve Rogers played by Chris Evans first in digitally enhanced ""puny"" mode and then in bulked-up personal trainer mode comes straight out of Brooklyn and wants to join the fight (this is 1942). His lion-hearted determination in the face of 4-F status buys him a ticket into a secret government program overseen by Stanley Tuccis kindly Dr. Erskine who pumps the kid from Brooklyn full of the same blue serum being used nefariously by Hitlers maddest scientist (Hugo Weaving shrewd and scary) extracted from the unholy Tesseract of Odin or something.Weavings antagonist morphs into the terror known as Red Skull as Rogers becomes the beefed-up Captain America leader of a multiethnic commando unit out to save the world and get Rogers home from the war safely so he can make good on his planned date at the Stork Club with agent Carter played by British actress Hayley Atwell. She looks swell behind a machine gun in her smudge-free lipstick and Andrews Sister hair.A relaxed air of confidence and though I hesitate to use the word charm informs Johnstons film. Tommy Lee Jones could play the role of the tough colonel in his sleep and once or twice he does seem to have been caught napping just before the cameras rolled but his line readings (like Tuccis) have a way of tweaking the innate ridiculousness of the material while reminding folks of the fun to be had with such ridiculousness."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;Im not sure Evans was an ideal choice for Rogers. Like Ryan Reynolds the headliner in an earlier summer title ""The Green Lantern"" hes a pretty good actor and the right physical type (not hard to find in Hollywood) but a movie or two shy of really coming into his own as a dominant leading man or action hero. In other words Evans doesnt yet have what Dominic Cooper has in spades in the supporting role of engineer and inventor Howard Stark father of Tony (the Robert Downey Jr. role in the ""Iron Man"" sub-franchise). The x-factor is wit. Downey has it; even Chris Hemsworth had it in the title role in ""Thor.""

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Does Tommy Lee Jones bring his own writers to the movies? At some point toward the end of ""Captain America the Army colonel he plays gets some interrogation time with a runty Nazi scientist (Toby Jones no conceivable relation). ""Youre trying to intimidate me says the scientist. ""I bought you dinner replies the colonel. Only he doesnt simply say it. He performs it with all the brusque macho indolent comic authority that we recognize as ""Tommy Lee Jones. This is what the ongoing onslaught of comic book movies lacks stars. Real stars. Robert Downey Jr. is the exception when he should be the rule. Its possible we take these movies for granted because the marketing tells us we should.Honestly its the only way to find yourself sitting in ""Captain America which was never a very good comic book and as the Marvel Universe expanded into allegories for every -ism coursing through combusting and corroding American society in the 1960s 70s and 80s the seriess patriotic derring-do seemed defensively old fashioned. But Marvels movie division now has plans for an ""Avengers film which will comprise Captain America Thor the Hulk and Iron Man.It was touching the sight of a packed house sitting through the closing credits expecting the customary Easter egg which here is a peek at what the next film will hold. The studio issued only a cynical title card announcing that Captain America will appear in ""The Avengers (the subtitle is ""The First Avenger). People booed but the whole movie is a long Easter egg needlessly filmed in miserable-looking 3-D. (Remove your glasses occasionally and see how bright the snowscapes should be.)Youd notice less were this movie a little more rousing were there more actors - like Jones and Stanley Tucci who deploys one of the films many stunt German accents - taking the material sideways. The Captain is Steve Rogers who in Dr. Tuccis great science experiment transforms from a scrawny sickly Army reject into a muscle-bound Nazi demolisher. He is pumped full of something called VitaRays which is just a fancy way of saying if you cut him now hed bleed Michael Bay. Chris Evans plays Steve. In the movies early scenes his gaunt face is persuasively sculpted onto the body of a digitized weakling. Who he becomes is who Hollywood would like him to be. But the secret of Chris Evans is that hes neither a leading man nor an action figure. Hes a comedian. His previous stint in a Marvel farm team was as the Human Torch in two disgraceful ""Fantastic Four movies. They were terrible but he had a good time making a joke of stardom he didnt have His hotness was a split-level gag. ""Captain America gives all the Chris Evans lines to everyone else. Even the extras. When a kid is tossed into a river and Steve stops chasing the baddie who threw him in to perform a rescue the kid yells up ""Go get him. I can swim. I dont know whether Evans is enjoying himself but I didnt enjoy watching him throw his ""vibranium shield at heavily masked German henchmen wear a cloth mask with a big ""A on the forehead and be an unwaveringly unconditionally good American. (The ""A might as well stand for ""anybody can do this - and by ""anybody I think I mean Hilary Swank.) He delivers the movies last line with real sadness and for the first time you wonder whether like a lot of funny people Evans isnt also built for tragedy.The movie itself isnt bad. Its fully ensconced in the American fever for World War II. Theres even a musical number built around Steves being a symbol of the American fighting spirit. Its almost subversive to spend half a movie watching a kid trying desperately to enlist only to discover in bulkier incarnation that war might actually be cooler than he thought. This isnt ""Coming Home or ""Born on the Fourth of July or ""Full Metal Jacket. It also isnt Vietnam. For stretches its actually ""Hogans Heroes. The movie which Joe Johnston directed and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely wrote distills World War II down to a Saturday cliffhanger. Its a digestible reduction that comes with a love plot featuring Hayley Atwell as a British officer and Hugo Weaving as the Nazier-than-thou Red Skull who sounds like Bavarian director Werner Herzog and looks like an over-roasted Mr. Peanut.The trouble I suppose is that these sorts of serials are all Johnston really does. Hes also made ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids ""The Rocketeer ""Jumanji ""Jurassic Park III and ""The Wolfman. This movie is more than competently made but Johnston is another Spielberg disciple and all the crane shots laboratory fights antique props and airplane-hangar sequences - the very adolescence of the whole affair - make you miss the wit and visual acuity of his mentor. The movie feels counterfeit in some way devoid of a center and copied. Tommy Lee Jones isnt distraction enough from the reality that weve been sold a 140 million trailer for a different movie. The eggs a little rotten.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Captain America review Back to comic book basics |       NJ.com comments Captain America review Back to comic book basics Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 21 2011 at 816 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1052 AM View/Post Comments MARVEL STUDIOSChris Evans as the title character in ""Captain America The First Avenger."" Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios If anyone ever needed a superhero to step in and save the day -- well itd probably be the people making superhero movies during this not-exactly-inspiring year. So here -- hooray -- comes ""Captain America The First Avenger."" And while he cant quite vanquish our bad memories of ""The Green Hornet"" at least he can remind us of the genres original innocent appeal. Perhaps thats because although theres a brief framing sequence the script doesnt try to immediately update the good Captain to 2011. This is a 40s story as a draft-board reject volunteers for an experiment -- and finds himself turned into a super-strong soldier and a celebrity. But he soon abandons his stage show (although he keeps the costume) to take on the one-man German army known as the Red Skull. The mix of WWII style and flashy modern eye candy is no surprise coming from director Joe Johnston. The former effects guy directed the retro cult fave ""The Rocketeer""; hes also helmed modern big-ticket movies such as ""Jumanji."" Hes comfortable in both worlds. Style and action are the main parts of this movie too and true to what many fans found in those Golden Age comics to begin with -- awesome inventions and wild clashes between pure-in-heart heroes and sadistic villains. (The angst and trauma and gray areas -- those came later.) Where the film falters a bit is the casting. Most of the supporting actors are fine. Tommy Lee Jones is quietly funny as the Captains superior officer; Hugo Weaving plays the fierce Red Skull without a wink. (Only German scientist Stanley Tucci -- coasting on und corny accent yah? -- seems content to merely cash his check.) But while hes sympathetic as the ""98-pound weakling"" once he becomes our pumped-up Captain Chris Evans is pretty much just a simple cut of prime rib. And Hayley Atwell brings nothing to the part of the British agent whos supposed to be Captain Americas great love. Thats a real failing for this film -- although some fans kvetched about ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern"" you couldnt say their love stories disappointed. But the romance here -- which is an important part of who Captain America becomes -- has no fire. In fact the strongest love visible on-screen is Johnstons for his own work -- and sometimes it gets a little cloying. To have a character offhandedly refer to other Nazis looking for occult relics in the desert is appropriate and fun; Johnston did effects on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" To steal a major scene from that film for an ending though isnt an homage; its like showing your hostess how much you liked her party by pilfering a teaspoon. But if you stop looking for what youve come to like about superhero films as an adult (dashing leads sly wit bittersweet romance) and concentrate on what you liked about comic books as a kid (good guys bad guys and action) ""Captain America"" wont disappoint. And for once that obligatory last-minute appearance by Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury does what its supposed to do -- put you in the mood for next years all-star superhero ensemble ""The Avengers."" Captain America The First Avenger (PG-13) Paramount (125 min.) Directed by Joe Johnston. With Chris Evans Hugo Weaving. Opens 1201 a.m. Friday in New Jersey. Note The film contains violence.

Maybe Ive been beaten down to bargain-basement expectations by a season of relentless superhero-action spectacles. Maybe I passed out after the air conditioning failed during the New York press screening of ""Captain America The First Avenger"" and what Im remembering is just the collective hallucination of a bunch of movie geeks locked in a 90-degree sweat box on 42nd Street. Be that as it may ""Captain America"" is exactly what the third week of July needed a curiously fun surprisingly imaginative and unashamedly old-fashioned yarn of skulduggery and adventure.Let me come clean here and now as someone with severely limited interest in the Marvel Comics universe and even less patience for the lumbering pace of the current Marvel-Paramount movie series which has been building since at least the 2008 ""Iron Man"" toward next years big ""Avengers"" reunion and beyond. Somehow we must now get through the rest of summer and fall and winter and the return of spring without any more Marvel Comics movies and when lilacs next in the dooryard bloom (not that well be paying attention) those of us who survive will find out what Joss Whedon can wrangle out of Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man Chris Hemsworths Thor Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury et al. Lets not even discuss the fact that the franchise is plotted out at least as far as a Fury film set for 2014 and in all likelihood much further than that.So that was the attitude with which I approached Joe Johnstons ""Captain America"" and the character has long struck me as one of Marvels least interesting creations a straitlaced and jingoistic super-soldier so lacking in dark side or human dimensions as to make Superman look like a Eugene ONeill protagonist. But director Johnston and his screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely use the vintage squareness of the original Captain America comics to their advantage nimbly walking the fine line between period spoof and patriotic celebration.Chris Evans a 30-year-old actor getting his first major starring role proves irresistibly likable as weedy Brooklynite Steve Rogers who keeps being rejected by the Army before he is re-engineered as an unstoppable human weapon one who never loses his instinctive sympathy for puppies children and the wretched of the earth. Evans is matched or more than matched by Hugo Weaving as the nefarious German mastermind Johann Schmidt better known to comics fans as Red Skull. Schmidt has injected himself with some of the same goo that transformed Rogers but perhaps because of his innate Germanness has become so power-mad and evil that he views Hitler as a pantywaist lightweight who must be supplanted. Weaving should play every villain in every movie that has one frankly. He has to deliver hopelessly shticky dialogue while wearing a ludicrous red rubber mask and is simultaneously scary and hilarious.If you start taking ""Captain America"" seriously on any level it becomes way too troubling way too fast -- lets fight the Nazis experiments in eugenics with our own all-American version -- and this movie wisely avoids any of that. This is a fast-moving atmospheric action-adventure with clearly delineated heroes and villains and comic supporting characters and almost all of it is set between 1942 and 1945 when most of us can agree that historical ambiguity wasnt much in evidence. There are also prologue and epilogue sequences set in the present about which I should say little except that the first evokes the eerie mood of ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"" and the second of course involves Jacksons Nick Fury. (There was no post-credits scene aka ""stinger"" on the print shown to the press although rumors suggest there may be one on the public version that opens Friday. Since youre dying to know.) You Might Also Like Johnston presumably got this assignment because of his success doing vintage Americana in ""The Rocketeer"" and ""October Sky"" the two best films of his 22-year career as a Hollywood journeyman. He has a meticulous eye for period detail and while the 1940s New York backdrops in early sequences of ""Captain America"" are obviously fake -- a combination of old-fashioned Hollywood sets and CGI -- thats entirely consistent with the movies ethos. Just as important Markus and McFeelys screenplay views the World War II era from a wry but affectionate distance. After the experimental serum developed by Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) the future father of Iron Man turns Steve into Captain America he is first employed as a propaganda weapon not a military one. Clad in an embarrassing woolen costume he goes on tour with a troupe of leggy chorus girls to sell war bonds stars in short-subject adventure movies and becomes (yes) a hero in comic books sent to actual soldiers on the front lines.But fiery English secret-agent bombshell Peggy Carter (played by Hayley Atwell a British TV star and Hollywood newcomer) believes in him and so more grudgingly does Col. Phillips the latest in a long line of Tommy Lee Jones irritable-grumpus authority figures. Once Captain America decides to shed the dancing girls and take the fight to Red Skulls Hydra organization -- who evidently find the Nazis insufficiently wicked in all senses of the word -- this movie turns into the kind of action-adventure youve seen dozens of times in which a small plucky and implausibly diverse band of brothers takes on a vastly superior force apparently hand-picked from Darth Vaders Galactic Academy of Sinister Ineptitude. Thats more than a gag actually. For better and worse (but mostly better) Johnston draws on all kinds of pulpy adventure movies here most obviously ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" ""Captain America"" has the brisk chaste manner of a preteen-oriented action flick of yesteryear -- Steve Rogers and Agent Carter barely even smooch -- combined with all the cutting-edge digital effects contemporary audiences expect and the result is oddly satisfying. Special credit goes to cinematographer Shelly Johnson and production designer Rick Heinrichs for creating the films witty and internally consistent visual mood. You can tell Red Skulls uber-Nazi machinery from Howard Starks American-century gizmos just in terms of design aesthetic On the one hand brooding neo-Gothic contraptions that would look at home in Dr. Frankensteins lab; on the other sleek modernist lines and cool colors that look forward to Cadillacs and Hoover vacuum cleaners yet to come.Is Captain America as some have suggested a symbol of American proto-fascism or a Tea Party hero before the fact? One answer to that question is to say that its a stupid question to ask about a comic-book hero and another given the overall left-libertarian leanings of the Marvel universe is to say no. Im not sure either answer is adequate in the long run but this origin story effectively ducks the question by pointing out that Captain America was a weapon created in a moment of global emergency. Hes unquestionably an argument for American exceptionalism in that he seems cooler more humble more self-sacrificing and just flat-out nicer than those who sought to enslave the world. Thats an important aspect of our national mythology and ""Captain America"" is a nostalgic tribute to the time when it still felt true. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

On the heels of the so-so ""X-Men First Class"" and the downright dopey ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern"" now comes ""Captain America The First Avenger"" another labored effort to bring a popular comic book icon to the big screen. Stop me if youve heard this one Its about an average guy who gains superpowers uses them for the good of humanity and faces off with a seemingly unvanquishable foe while the fate of Earth itself hangs in the balance. Also read Too Many Men in Tights? 5 Reasons the Superhero Summer Has Been a Bust Stop yawning this is very important stuff. If you wont sit still and watch the boring prequels there cant be an awesome ""Avengers"" movie full of these same dullards. Yes obviously there are only seven basic stories to be told and superhero movies generally focus on just one of those seven but ""Captain America The First Avenger"" only sporadically stands out as something special -- when deja vu strikes linger at the soda refill station maybe look at a lobby poster or two -- while mostly wallowing in the been-there-done-that. The good stuff first Director Joe Johnston uses so-good-theyre-invisible special effects to turn our hero short and scrawny (but brave and good-hearted) Steve Rogers into buff handsome Captain America. The transformation occurs thanks to Rogers participation in the armys top-secret Super Soldier program in the early days of World War II and Johnston digitally files down the body of buff handsome movie star Chris Evans into a slighter version of himself. Its a close cousin to how David Fincher turned actor Armie Hammer into two Winkelvosses in ""The Social Network"" and Johnstons use of this snazzy effect like Finchers feels like a smart way to establish character and not like so much digital trickery these days merely showing off. Also entertaining is how Captain America before becoming a combat hero gets shipped around by the government as a war bonds pitchman pretend-punching a Hitler impersonator in front of a row of chorus girls in city after city -- director Johnston previously made ""The Rocketeer"" a movie in love with the gloss and shimmer of the 1940s and the USO dance numbers call to mind that earlier films nostalgia for the shinier side of the war years. And then theres Hugo Weaving and Toby Jones as the Nazi villains; Weavings Red Skull creeps us out both visually (""Red Skull"" isnt just a nickname hes got a giant excellently gross red skull) and aurally (his accent makes him sound like an even more diabolical Werner Herzog) while Jones shows that ""Third Reich flunky"" was second behind ""Truman Capote"" on the list of roles he was born to play. The details in ""Captain America"" deliver but the big moments fall flat -- you can tell that were intended to cheer here to weep there but the scenes that try hardest to elicit emotions just feel deflated like when your windbag uncle screws up the punchline of the joke hes spent the last five minutes telling you. The movies attempt at a heart-tugging climax fails doubly if youve seen Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgers 1946 film ""Stairway to Heaven"" a.k.a. ""A Matter of Life and Death"" -- that classics opening scene is lifted and repurposed for this movies big finish. Part of the problem is Captain America himself -- yes hes been one of the archetypal figures of the Marvel Comics universe for some seven decades but he tends to be kind of a stiff if hes not being handled by talented writers. Hes a character almost completely lacking in irony or self-doubt or even self-analysis -- they dont come more square-jawed four-square or all-around-square than Cap. And screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely dont know how to make this boy scout into an interesting character. (Evans certainly isnt actor enough to give us anything beneath the surface of this red white and blue icon.) We dont need a demon-plagued Batman here just a human being with something in addition to patriotism and organic whole milk running through his veins. And while some visual bits pop -- those star-spangled dancing girls the Red Skulls mammoth warplane an ersatz Worlds Fair featuring the inventions of Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper wearing one of the phoniest screen mustaches since Leonardo DiCaprios in ""The Aviator"") -- other scenes are surprisingly sloppy. A car chase through 1942 Brooklyn feels particularly fakey and seeing the film in 3D renders everything dark and mustard-colored. Points to this movie for at least having the hero toss his mighty shield at the camera once or twice particularly since the makers of ""Thor"" never bothered to heave the thunder gods hammer into audiences faces. The Comic-Con crowd will thrill to the inside jokes that only they get -- WWII Marvel characters like the Howlin Commandos and the original Human Torch turn up -- but for most audiences ""Captain America"" will feel like a movie theyve already seen and didnt love all that much the first time.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures)MoreLet Tony Stark make the wisecracks and Nick Fury give the intimidating commands.As Steve Rogers Chris Evans brings an earnest dignity and intelligence to ""Captain America The First Avenger"" the final Marvel Comics set-up for next summers all-star blockbuster ""The Avengers."" Theres little humor here outside a few moments in which this superhero discovers the full breadth of his powers and the presence of Tommy Lee Jones who shows up and does that bemused condescending thing he can do in his sleep.Director Joe Johnstons film feels weighty and substantial even in the dreaded and needless 3-D and it has a beautiful sepia-toned art-deco look about it. The lighting production design costumes even the perfect shade of red lipstick on retro-chic Hayley Atwell all look just right. Plenty of action awaits but its not empty or glossy. You are not in for a giddy winking high-flying summer fling. And thats OK -- theres something appealing about such an old-fashioned approach.Evans who previously played a Marvel comic-book hero as the smart-alecky Human Torch in both ""Fantastic Four"" movies takes a very different tone here as the World War II fighting hero. Rogers is a scrawny kid from Brooklyn with dreams of military glory who keeps getting rejected each time he tries to sign up for service. (In a creepy but seamless special effect Evans head is placed on a skinny body; that deep serious voice of his gives the character gravitas and heart.)Scientist Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees something special in him though and enlists him for a daring experiment. Through some high-tech injections Steve is transformed into a super soldier known as Captain America. Despite his newly buffed physique the government believes the best use of this human weapon is to send him out on tour selling war bonds.But Rogers isnt the only one whos been juicing Hugo Weaving plays the former Nazi leader Johann Schmidt who will reveal himself to be the villainous Red Skull. Hes formed his own splinter group Hydra and insists that his minions greet him with a Hitler-style salute. Hes built some formidable weaponry with the help of Toby Jones as his put-upon scientist assistant.The rest of the abundant supporting cast includes Jones as Col. Chester Phillips whos skeptical of the kids abilities; Dominic Cooper as the clever and charming inventor Howard Stark; and Atwell as British agent Peggy Carter. Atwells gorgeous looks make her a great fit for the part but her character is better developed than you might imagine; shes no damsel in distress waiting for Captain America to save her but rather a trained fighter whos very much his equal.But ""Captain America"" is far more engaging when its about a scrappy underdog overcoming the odds than it is about generic shoot-outs and exploding tanks. It only scratches the surface in trying to examine the perils of premature fame. And in satirizing our countrys tendency to fetishize patriotism ""Captain America"" doesnt have much thats new to say We worship and cling to our heroes whether or not they want or deserve our adulation? Is that it?Still such a reserved take on the subject might just be preferable to heavy-handed preaching. And were surely in store for an over-the-top spectacle when ""The Avengers"" hits theaters next year. Til then this is a nourishing appetizer.""Captain America The First Avenger"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 for intense sequence of sci-fi violence and action. Running time 126 minutes.

TM amp; 2010 Marvel) B Captain America The First Avenger Genre Action/Adventure War; Starring Chris Evans Hugo Weaving; Director Joe Johnston; Release Date Wide 07/22/2011; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted July 31 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Captain America The First Avenger is stolidly corny old-fashioned pulp fun. Directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer) the picture is nothing really that you havent seen before but its the definition of a square competent deliver-the-goods blockbuster. Its set in 1942 and the World War II trappings -- gimlet-eyed Nazis patriotic newsreels high-stepping USO shows the whole earnest spirit of pitching in -- are no mere backdrop. The movie is so wholesome it could almost have been made during World War II. Captain America (Chris Evans) the strapping bionically enhanced U.S. Army soldier-turned-superhero (a character first introduced by Marvel Comics 70 years ago) runs like the Six Million Dollar Man and flies through the air on a motorcycle like Machete. Mostly though he doesnt do much that Bruce Willis didnt do in the Die Hard films. He leaps darts sneaks around and socks bad guys in the jaw. He just does it fiercer faster with more lightning invincibility. In his winged helmet and leather-patch uniform hes a one-man commando-squad fighting machine who wields his stars-and-stripes shield -- made of the toughest metal on earth -- like a battering ram and a lethal boomerang. Before any of that though the movie reaches back to the original seed of all superhero fantasy the myth of the 98-pound weakling transformed. When we first meet Steve Rogers who will go on to become Captain America hes a sawed-off asthmatic runt from Brooklyn whos obsessed with enlisting in the military and serving his country. Through the miracle of digital technology the face of Chris Evans has been melded onto what appears to be a skinny flat-as-an-ironing-board-chested teenager who stands around 5 foot 4. Steve may not look like soldier material but hes got ""heart"" which is why hes first spotted by Abraham Erskine a scraggly German-American scientist played by Stanley Tucci in a Hogans Heroes accent who decides to give Steve his untested cell-enhancement serum. Evans with serious eyebrows and a shock of blond hair has the Olympian-jock look that appears to be in favor in superhero movies this season but theres a melancholy cast to his features. Hes like the young Richard Gere with a touch of Norman Mailers super-aware furrowed-brow poker face. Injected with the blue serum then pelted with a maximum dose of ""Vita-Ray"" Steve emerges from this vaguely Frankensteinian experiment looking like Adonis and ready to serve. At first Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) the growly officer in command of the top secret project doesnt know what to do with his lone-wolf super-soldier. (Hed wanted an entire army of them which didnt quite work out.) So Steve dressed at first in the original now rather froufrou-looking costume from the 1940s Captain America comics is put to work as a performing mascot in kitschy stage shows designed to sell war bonds -- a funny sequence that has the effect of emasculating Steve all over again. Which of course just intensifies our desire to see him break out and kick ass. The Nazis or at least their deep science division (known as HYDRA) have their own secret weapon a series of nuclear-style bombs designed to be dropped on American cities. Its a project masterminded by a rogue officer named Red Skull who looks like Hellboy crossed with Michael Jackson and is played by Hugo Weaving with the gusto of a James Bond villain. He keeps nattering on about having harnessed the powers of the gods which is all very occult and Teutonic though its also supposed to be a dark mirror of Steves own transformation into a godlike hero who more or less resembles the ideal of Aryan manhood. I wish the movies script which is pretty bare-bones developed these ideas a bit further. More than that I wish the dialogue had a higher dose of wit. Chris Evans best known up until now as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films is an appealing actor but his Captain America could have used a bit of deadpan hipness. Hes so straight hes like a Boy Scout on steroids. Then again thats the appeal of a movie that takes you back to a time when America didnt have to be remotely ironic about believing in itself.

Red white and bland ""Captain America The First Avenger"" plays like a by-the-numbers prequel for Marvel Studios forthcoming ""The Avengers"" movie the proper teaser for which lies buried after the words ""Captain America will return"" in the end credits. While that 2012 tentpole will lump Cap in with Iron Man the Incredible Hulk Thor and various other superheroes this one focuses on constructing a blockbuster origin story for one of Marvels most iconic creations. Although Joe Johnston earnestly attempts to resurrect the WWII-era action figure with 3D conversion boosting the glossy pics B.O. potential his debut adventure comes across as remarkably flat. Back in 1990 Marvel learned a valuable lesson in protecting the brand when 21st Century Film Corp. threw together a shamefully low-budget version of the Captain America story. Two decades later the now-Hollywood-savvy pulp pubbery attempts to do right by Joe Simon and Jack Kirbys all-American hero recruiting a genuine star (Chris Evans) and an established director (""The Rocketeers"" Johnston) to mount a megabudget retelling of how 90-pound weakling Steve Rogers was nuked into Charles Atlas shape by the U.S. military then turned loose to hunt Nazis in star-spangled spandex. Even as Marvel film honcho Kevin Feige has managed to attract a diverse mix of ace helmers to bring these future Avengers adventures to the bigscreen the films all seem to coexist within the same universe aesthetically speaking. The same goes for Johnstons contribution which sticks to the lustrous tactile look of earlier chapters despite the added challenge of ""Captain Americas"" period setting. Though the pic opens in the present day as an arctic exploration crew uncovers Caps shield frozen in ice the action unfolds back in 1942 when both the Yanks and the Krauts were using a special serum to create super-soldiers for the war effort. On the Nazi side an injection turns teeth-gnashing ex-general Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) into a force more power-hungry than Hitler. Rather than repeat the same mistake German defector Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci in heavily accented character mode) hand-picks Rogers to test his perfected formula for the U.S. Army. For roughly the first reel Rogers appears as a spindly but sure-hearted runt digitally slenderized by a process weight-conscious stars may want to consider going forward. These early scenes are designed to establish the characters humanity as the determined-to-enlist young man suffers humiliation from bullies and boot camp alike only to prove his natural altruism in a field test from surly Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (veterans of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series) do a nice job of making Rogers a relatable Everyman only to transform him into a one-dimensionally dull meathead -- one who looks alarmingly similar to Hitlers Aryan ideal as he emerges bare-chested and gleaming from a chamber designed by none other than Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper playing the father of future ""Iron Man"" character Tony Stark in a bit of cross-franchise plot synergy). As Marvel heroes go Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot. He lacks the inner turmoil that DC Comics Batman brought to the genre and while not exactly invincible (a minor injury sustained during his first action scene suggests he bleeds like the next guy) hes quick to heal and a bit too handy with a shield. Its refreshing to see someone slug it out the way a 40s tough guy would absent the Hong Kong-style choreography of most modern-day fight scenes yet theres never the slightest concern that the Nazis might get the better of him. Back when Captain America debuted in print the character served as a baldly patriotic embodiment of the American spirit socking Hitler in the kisser on the cover of his first issue. Pic pays homage to those origins in a cheeky montage featuring Caps original costume and his overtly propagandistic raison detre as he hawks war bonds. On the war front however the character sticks to the tried-and-true Hollywood model of the enlightened loner who disobeys his superiors in order to save the day. Rogers is effectively a one-man army with those who help him -- including love interest Hayley Atwell and best friend Sebastian Stan plus an ""Inglourious Basterds""-like coterie of implausibly integrated soldiers -- edged offscreen whenever things start to get hairy. Since Quentin Tarantino already had his fun rewriting Hitlers defeat ""Captain America"" concentrates on a more fantastical enemy as the megalomaniacal Schmidt who rips off his own face to become the Red Skull uncovers a magical cube that will give him the power to wipe out entire cities. Creepy appearance aside such a villain would feel like yet another stock Bad Nazi stereotype if not for Weavings wickedly slick performance colorful enough to upstage the pics pretty-boy hero any day. Its a shame then that the ultimate showdown between Captain America and the German general doesnt make more of their contradictory natures. Pics actual finale is a strangely anticlimactic one as Rogers must make the tragic personal decision that will put him out of commission for the 70 years until Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson making yet another high-camp cameo) and his fellow Avengers need him again.

TWITTER Sticking to its simplistic patriotic origins where a muscular red white and blue GI slugging Adolf Hitler in the jaw is all thatas required. If you take a World War II movie dial up the action with contemporary visual effects and CGI then give your hero a double dose of steroids and human growth hormones you wind up in the movie/comic book world of Captain America The First Avenger. The movie is of course Marvel Comics and Paramounts filmization of Joe Simon and Jack Kirbys Super Soldier series that first appeared in comic books in March 1941 well before Pearl Harbor so understandably this is one superhero movie that demands that the first movie at least be a period one. So you get an alternative WWII say like Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds -- only without all that dialogue and enough oversized vehicles and outlandish sets to fit its beefcake hero. Captain America delivers comic book action that should satisfy Captain Americas fans old and new while Chris Evans no-nonsense yet engaging portrayal of a man who doesnt know how to back away from a fight may cause young women to swoon and young men to join a gym. Yet the film will leave others wondering -- especially following the films long gestation and marketing buildup -- ""Is this all there is?"" For in terms of even recent films Captain America lacks the deft touch appealing character interaction and sophisticated storytelling skills of Marvel Comics X-Men First Class. And lets not even bother to compare this to Christopher Nolans Batman series. Sticking to its simplistic patriotic origins where a muscular red white and blue GI slugging Adolf Hitler in the jaw is all thats required Captain America trafficks in red-blooded heroes dastardly villains classy dames and war-weary military officers. There is no ambiguity here. Nor does any superhero question his powers. No sir not in this war and not with these determined heroes. While bracketed by a modern-day sequence the movie otherwise takes place in a heightened rendering of the early days of the fight against Nazi Germany. Brooklyns Steve Rogers (Evans) son of a dead war hero repeatedly tries to enlist in the military but his physical condition is pure 4F. In perhaps the movies best or at least weirdest visual effect Evans face sits atop an unbelievably scrawny body that recruiting sergeants shoo away until German-American scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci with the phoniest of accents) sees something special in the young man. Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones having a fine time) dismisses Steve as a ""90-pound asthmatic"" not without justification. But the minute Dr. Erskine performs a ""procedure"" on Steve -- with equipment that looks like it was left over from Bride of Frankenstein -- suddenly Steve is buff and fast-healing in fact nearly impossible to injure. Moments after his rebirth he faces his first test as he races barefoot through Manhattan streets circa 1942 to take down a Nazi spy. This feat more than catches the eye of British military liaison Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) not to mention the press. An overnight media sensation the military doesnt know what to do with Steve other than send him -- shades of Flags of Our Fathers -- on a bond-raising tour as the newly dubbed Captain America. When the tour takes him to Europe he breaks out of the carnival show long enough to save the lives of nearly 400 GIs including his Brooklyn buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). This rescue cues a new assignment for Captain America. Steve is now point man for Col. Phillips team in Strategic Scientific Research along with the redoubtable Peggy Carter and inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) in taking on the Hydra organization a Nazi science division that is even worse than the Nazis. In fact its more like a worldwide criminal organization out of the James Bond era intent on world conquest and more than willing to kill fellow Nazis. Everyone associated with this evil group shouts not ""Heil Hitler"" but ""Heil Hydra."" Its run by the mad scientist Red Skull (go-to villain guy Hugo Weaving) whose red face may be the result of an experiment gone horribly wrong or just pain embarrassment at the Nazi cliches he is forced to play. He even listens to the soothing strains of Richard Wagner. Yes he does. Caught between contemporary tentpole moviemaking and a period piece the movie keeps featuring very odd visual anachronisms. You might accept the battles that feature sci-fi weapons alongside vintage WWII arms but what can you make of the Hydra soldiers Darth Vader costumes those weird planes cars and a submarine that maneuver within 1943s Earth sky and sea and most alarming of all that red dress Peggy wears in the battle zone? Its a knock-em-dead outfit that may be a special weapon all its own. Director Joe Johnston makes certain that amid all the retro-futuristic nonsense his nucleus of actors playing SSR heroes fits well together. Evans nicely underplays the role giving a Gary Cooper-ish air to the young hero who just wants to do the right thing. Atwell is a perfect throwback to that era Darkly gorgeous yet tough as nails she would look just at home painted on a bomber fuselage as she is slugging a solider who gives her lip. Jones knows how to make every moment of screen time count with these grumpy and gruff characters he now plays but Stan and Cooper arent so lucky Their characters came out a little too thin in Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeelys screenplay. Meanwhile Weaving is very one-notish as the villain which leaves it to Toby Jones as his sidekick to add a little nuance to Nazi villainy. The tech team brilliantly supports the comic book action without any single department showing off or adding unnecessary flourishes. A special tip of the hat to Anna B. Sheppards costumes and Rick Heinrichs production design for maintaining enough period flavor so the production doesnt go too overboard. Oh yes this film is yet another summer fantasy in 3D in certain theaters. For some sequences the format works well enough but its hardly worth the extra expenditure. This gimmick is truly running out of steam.

(Spoiler alert Captain America doesnt have one).The film concerns the transformation of one Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) ""a 90-pound asthmatic"" repeatedly declared unfit to fight in World War II whose persistence impresses Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci heavily vamping) a German scientist working for the U.S. military alongside billionaire inventor/future Iron Man progenitor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper). Steve is soon chosen for a top-secret military experiment for which hell be injected with a serum that as Colonel Tommy Lee Jones intones will turn him from a weakling into ""a new breed of super-soldier"" assigned to ""personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell."" Not that Hitler--or anything else ripped from real history or recognizable life--is really on the radar of this hokey hacky two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D.Shortly after Steve (who is played in both supersize and diminutive form by Evans via still-creepily uncanny head-replacement effects) emerges from the experiment as an enlarged greased-up Ken doll a spy kills Erskine. Without his champion this human-engineered living weapon is relegated to what an opportunist politician claims is ""the most important battlefield of the war""--the media offensive. Touring the country fronting a live propaganda show designed to sell war bonds star of his own comics and short subjects Captain America becomes a folk hero for the folks left at home. But on the frontlines hes a joke. Then with no apparent combat training but a roadshow-bred sense of showmanship he mobilizes a rescue mission to liberate his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and incidentally frees 400 Allied soldiers for good measure. Steve gets some vague support (and the film gets a spark of much-needed swagger) from his ostensible love interest Peggy (Hayley Atwell) a tough-broad British soldier who has some kind of role in the operation thats neither specified nor apparently anything that would muss her lipstick.The lead villain here is Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) a/k/a the Red Skull a Nazi whose obsession with the occult is a bit much even for Hitler to take. Having almost cheerfully ""left humanity behind"" Schmidt has assembled a splinter cult called HYDRA through which he operates labor camps focused on harvesting energy from the Tesseract--a glowing cube thingy that Schmidt pillaged from Norway--and funneling that energy into weapons. Its never clear what this power force actually is but somehow its transferred to laser guns which shoot streams of something or other to vaporize their victims on contact.That putting such a corpse-obliterating weapon in the hands of everyday Nazi soldiers would have been something of a Holocaust game changer is one of a number of potentially rich parallel-historical details that the film doesnt care to grapple with. Captain America assembles a ragtag multi-ethnic band of soldiers to help carry out his elite missions but theres not so much as a single mention of the ideological divides that plagued the times--and subsequently spawned the original anti-Fascist Captain America comics. So what is Captain America fighting for? Apparently nothing more or less than screen time in The Avengers.
