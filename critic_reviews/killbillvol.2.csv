Sober souls went all tremulous at the prospect of the sequel. Now Quentin Tarantinos Kill Bill Vol. 1 which earned 70 million at the domestic box office and 100 million abroad is joined by Vol. 2--not so much a sequel to the story as the completion of a chapter. Its about the Bride (Uma Thurman) a hit woman who had been ""jetting around the world killing human beings and being paid vast sums of money"" as a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad -- DIVAS for short. In Vol. 1 she went straight got left for dead in the slaughter of her wedding party and years later began to take revenge on the killers the rest of the DIVAS and their charismatic boss Bill (David Carradine). Vol. 2 finishes the tale as the Bride tracks down Bills brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and one-eyed Elle (Daryl Hannah) before a last chat with her old mentor lover and would-be murderer.

But Vol. 2 reduces the casualties and gentles down the mood. You get less kill more Bill. The first was show this is tell -- anecdotes at 10 paces. Of course this being a Tarantino film the conversations are as long and lurid and finely choreographed as the martial-arts set pieces. (The auteur is a bit of a diva himself he loves arias visual and verbal.) So you get a lecture on the toxic properties of the black mamba snake and a disquisition on the psychological duality of Superman. Vol. 1 was at heart a movie about movies -- a whirlwind graduate course in pulp-film culture. Vol. 2 also boasts some scenes that will have cultists attaching mental footnotes flicked references to John Fords The Searchers and the Jackie Chan -- Michelle Yeoh Supercop as well as a rehabilitation of Pei Mei a.k.a. White Eyebrow a villainous character from 70s Hong Kong action films. Here hes a stern but endearing teacher (played with majestic comic brio by the legendary Gordon Liu). Youll also make the Kung Fu connection. That was the 70s TV series that made Carradine a star; he won the role over a transplanted Hong Konger named Bruce Lee who went home to launch the worldwide martial-arts craze. For all the video-nerd one-upmanship Vol. 2 is a relationship movie a character study. It focuses on a handful of ornery but ordinary folks -- the three remaining killers -- and the flashes of rancor jealousy ennui and humor that illuminate their lives in the moments before the Bride tries to end them. The two brothers even achieve a reflective acceptance of their guilt. As Budd tells Bill ""That woman deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die."" A pause. ""Then again so does she."" Well nobodys perfect. Neither is Vol. 2. Its beguiling actors are urged to take their time delivering lines. (Does anyone in real life speak as slowly as everyone does in movies?) Theres little suspense as to who will be alive at the end -- just the poignancy of bad guys waiting to get a taste of what they have so often dished out. The cool twist is that the females are deadlier than the males. The deadliest is the newly righteous sword-wielding Bride whom Thurman invests with a bracing grit and poise. The Brides final at-home with Bill has the threat of imminent violence; nothing is spookier than watching Carradine who can steal a scene without leaving fingerprints make a sandwich for a 4-year-old. But the face-off is laced with the melancholy melody of a sundered couple reminding themselves why they were together. The combined Kill Bill speaks volumes but it doesnt tell the whole saga. How about a prequel detailing the DIVAS formation and exploits? Or a sequel since one of our heroines enemies has survived and is keeping an eye out for her? This borderline-Chekhovian episode should not be the end of the epic. But if it is enjoy the frissons in a theater near you. Then in a few months sit down in front of the DVD player and watch both parts of a gargantuanly entertaining double feature.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Tarantinos Vol. 2 Moving In for the Kill washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Tarantinos Vol. 2 Moving In for the Kill Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 16 2004 A GOOEY HUMAN organ goes very graphically splat in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" Quentin Tarantinos operatically violent yet cartoonish conclusion (and I mean all that in a good way) to his two-part revenge fantasy about a womans herculean efforts to punish her former lover. No Im not talking about the body part that our heroine known as the Bride (Uma Thurman) plucks out of her long-time nemesis Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) one of several assassins that stand between the protagonist and her ultimate target aka Bill (David Carradine). The organ Im talking about here is the human heart. Yes ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is a love story darkly acerbically told a love story that was only hinted at in ""Vol. 1"" but that is here filled in with meticulous detail. You didnt think the Brides fury at being shot in the head and left for dead was the only emotion motivating her did you? Her relationship with Bill - complex knotty toxic and in a grotesque way beautiful - is one of the chief subjects of this film. Thats on top of the fact that in this installment the Bride learns as we did at the end of the first movie that the unborn baby that was in her womb at the time of her attack has survived. Consequently the body count here is dramatically lower while the word count is much higher. Is it a chatty film? Hardly. Theres still plenty of action as in the Brides showdown with Elle in a ratty trailer and her earlier run-in with Elles fellow assassin Budd (Michael Madsen). In what is probably the most harrowing use of a black screen and evocative sound effects I have ever seen Budd at one point even buries the Bride alive. Its one of the hardest scenes you may ever have to watch - and theres nothing to watch. And a lengthy flashback sequence showing the Brides martial arts training with kung fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu in a ridiculously silky long white wig and beard) is filled with visual excitement and humor not to mention useful back story. Still a large set piece of the film is a single long conversation one that takes place between the Bride and Bill in which we learn exactly why she left him and his employ four years ago why he tracked her down to kill her on her wedding day and why once she finds him killing him is the easiest and at the same time the hardest thing she probably has ever done. Its a fascinating discourse richly philosophical and yet pointless filled with layers of character and emotions that flash alternately hot and cold. Whats more its cool. As he did in his earlier film Tarantino mixes ""Vol. 2"" up stylistically gleefully stirring film noir Western kung fu samurai and horror-flick idioms together into a nonlinear narrative that is baroque but never ponderous playful in its use of pop music and in a way profound all at the same time. Dont get me wrong. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is anything but heavy. Its a comic book at heart albeit a thoroughly grandly romantic one in the end. Bill once really loved the Bride it seems. Remember how he said that his shooting her was an expression not of sadism but of him at his ""most masochistic""? Its as if by shooting her he was attempting to kill a part of himself - or perhaps as if he knew deep down that she would one day come back to get him. When we finally meet him his ardor has cooled from a flame to a kind of icy resignation about his own fate. The Bride of course doesnt love Bill any more. Far from it. Surprisingly though the passion they once shared has been replaced at least on her part with something quite other than hate. Some bonds run deeper than lust you will discover as Tarantinos heroine makes one final transformation from vengeful Bride to . . . doting Mother. KILL BILL VOL. 2 (R 136 minutes) - Contains obscenity drug content and plentiful violence. Area theaters.

"Bride Revisited washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Bride Revisited Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 16 2004 The credits of Quentin Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" movies read ""Based on the character of The Bride created by Q amp; U."" That would be Tarantino and Uma Thurman star of the two-part ""Kill Bill"" project Volume 2 of which opens today. In ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" Thurman proved herself to be a worthy muse Even as Tarantino obsessively lingered over her elongated limbs huge eyes and preternaturally limber feet she managed to inject spirit and humanity into an otherwise thoroughly fetishistic project. ""Vol. 1"" was Tarantinos homage to the martial arts movies he grew up watching in the grind houses of Los Angeles shabbier precincts; it was an orgy of blood and carefully choreographed violence which had no deep meaning or import but admittedly possessed a contagious vigor and moments of elegant visual style. If ""Vol. 1"" was Tarantinos eastern (the yellow track suit Thurman wore in the film was a nod toward Bruce Lee in the chopsocky revenge flick ""Game of Death"") ""Vol. 2"" is his western and instead of Bruce Lee Thurman is Clint Eastwood. Beaten bloodied muddied and scowling her character the Bride has returned to finish the job she started in ""Vol. 1"" avenging her near-murder on the eve of her wedding four years earlier. Viewers will remember that in the last installment the Bride dispatched two of her would-be murderers played by Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu in a series of increasingly operatic bloodbaths. Here shes going after the final three names on her list Budd (Michael Madsen) Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill (David Carradine). The last of course is head of the assassination outfit she used to work for her former lover and the father of the child she was carrying when he ordered her colleagues to kill her. Tarantinos fans are understandably jacked up about ""Vol. 2"" having had their ganglia jangled so expertly throughout the first movie. Those viewers will need to adjust their expectations if not their entire metabolisms to accommodate this very different film. Slow quiet methodical and talky ""Vol. 2"" dispenses with the dazzling action and cutting of ""Vol. 1"" and instead concentrates on characters -- how they look what they say and whats going on between them. This was what made Tarantinos ""Jackie Brown"" such a bracing departure for the director Those conversations between Robert Forster and Pam Grier were perfectly orchestrated duets. But here the characters arent deep or intelligent enough to make their feuds and rituals and endless conversations remotely interesting. Watching ""Vol. 2"" is like being lectured for two hours by a film geek Its clear that Tarantino has seen every Hong Kong movie horror film western and cheesy 1970s television show ever made but its not at all clear why we should care. Like ""Vol. 1"" ""Vol. 2"" is presented in a series of chapters which themselves are a series of set pieces only a few of which pivot on physical action. There is a nasty fight between the Bride and Bills brother Budd which culminates in the movies most memorable and discomfiting scrape which Thurmans character literally punches her way out of; theres an encounter between Budd and the eye-patched Elle Driver then the highly anticipated catfight between Driver and the Bride. And of course theres the final showdown between the Bride and Bill a face-off that like so much of the rest of the film is mostly taken up with long windy disquisitions -- in this case on the cultural implications of comic book superheroes and something about worker bees. Tarantino has charmed highbrow audiences by overlaying the graphic violence of his films with cheeky pseudo-intellectual monologues about pop culture detritus. Here the shtick is revealed as just that a mannerism as tiresome and artistically bankrupt as the endless shots of Thurmans and Carradines feet the spurts of arent-I-a-bad-boy profanity and the bursts of misogynistic cruelty. This is not to say that ""Vol. 2"" doesnt have its good points. Once again the RZA (aka Robert Diggs) has composed or perhaps more accurately collected a fantastic musical score and soundtrack here mostly taken from Ennio Morricone and 70s organ vamps. And Tarantinos collaboration with cinematographer Robert Richardson continues to be a fruitful one especially during the sequence in which the Bride learns kung fu at the feet of the monk Pei Mei (legendary Chinese martial arts star Gordon Liu). These scenes have a grainy high-contrast look that is altogether fitting for the edgy relationship between student and master (they also include the films most delightful stunt when Pei Mei defends himself against the Brides sword by lightly balancing on top of its blade). Thurman too is as transfixing a heroine as she was in ""Vol. 1."" Indeed shes so good its possible to say that Tarantino doesnt deserve her. In no film in recent memory -- including ""Dogville"" -- has a lead actress been as abused disfigured defiled and treated as hatefully as Uma Thurman in the ""Kill Bill"" films. Indeed no actress in ""Vol. 2"" manages to get out without suffering some physical indignity whether its having an eye gouged out or a lip split open. Academic debates will no doubt ensue as to whether Tarantinos treatment of women is a backhanded form of empowerment or simply bald unapologetic contempt. In any event watching Thurmans character ""triumph"" in a context as joyless and self-referential as Tarantinos is a soul-deadening experience one that over two hours takes on the same dreary monotone as the cheapest pornography. Presumably ""Kill Bill"" was a lot of fun for Q amp; U but theres very little room in this hermetic world for I amp; Thou. Kill Bill Vol. 2 (136 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence language and brief drug use.

(AP Photo/Andrew Cooper Miramax Films) Uma Thurman ... more Photo ANDREW COOPER The Bride returns to kick some butt in Tarantinos better Bill 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Kill Bill Vol. 2. Starring Uma Thurman Daryl Hannah and David Carradine. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Now that both volumes of Quentin Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" have made it into movie theaters its clear that the release of the film in two parts was an artistic blunder a triumph of ego and greed over reason. Tarantino could easily have combined the 90 minutes of ""KB 1"" and the 130 minutes of ""KB 2"" and edited them down into one excellent two-hour-and-20-minute movie. He could have done this without leaving out a single good scene while improving the pace and potency of the scenes that remained. Still ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" stands alone as a witty and entertaining action movie always clever and sometimes gripping though at times also ponderous and self-indulgent. The hideous violence of the first installment is absent and the overall feeling is less like 70s kung fu and more like Sergio Leone. This time we even get to see Bill in the form of David Carradine whose searching eyes set within a rucked and seamed face suggest both utter depravity and a self-awareness bordering on the spiritual. All of Tarantinos strengths and weaknesses can be found in ""Vol. 2."" As a thinker as a philosopher just as someone responding to life on earth Tarantino is a cipher. He has nothing to say and in the few places in which he seems to invest in the emotional reality of his characters its as pathetic to witness as the sight of some mentally arrested adult conversing with a stuffed animal. Yet in terms of pure filmmaking skill how many directors can lay a glove on this guy? And how many screenwriters can come up with anything as loony and delightful as Tarantinos throwaway conversations - - for example the one here in which Michael Madsen as a strip-joint bouncer is berated by his boss for wearing a cowboy hat? So we take what we can get from ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" and theres much to enjoy. The Bride (Uma Thurman) back from an eventful trip to Japan is still holding a grudge about being shot in the head and left for dead by Bill and his gang. Talking directly into the camera as she breezes along in a car she recommits herself to her agenda. First she will kill Budd (Madsen). Then she will kill the ruthless and feral Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). And then she says ""Im going to kill Bill"" A flashback to the Brides wedding rehearsal -- which ended in a massacre -- serves to remind us not only of the story but also of Tarantinos instinctive dramatic sense. Because the audience knows that within moments everyone in the church will be slaughtered he impishly allows banal conversations to play themselves out thus building a giddy suspense. Bill makes his appearance playing a recorder on the porch of this country church and as soon as we see Carradine we know that Bill has been worth the buildup. Hes magnetic and menacing a mix of pride and self-disgust rage and exhaustion. Hes not a man to cross. Tarantino eventually brings the scene to its foreordained conclusion but in an unexpected way. Though ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has a ""Chorus Line""-type structure -- i.e. everybody gets his or her turn not to talk in this case but to get killed - - ""Vol. 2"" is less programmatic than ""Vol. 1."" Throughout Tarantino has story surprises up his sleeve and his digressions unlike the boring sword- making anime and Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) episodes in ""Vol. 1"" have wit and an integral function. The flashback to the Brides martial arts training under the ancient master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) works on its own terms and also as a zany parody. Tarantinos use of Thurman is uninspired. Hes clearly fascinated by her but he doesnt transmit that fascination or deepen our understanding of Thurman as a screen presence. He does however bring out a certain amused Mitchum-like fatalism in Madsen and he finds the fierceness in the usually ethereal (and sometimes bland) Hannah. Its also fair to say that his work with Carradine is revelatory. Obviously this is a major screen actor. But who knew? In the last half hour Tarantino indulges himself. Theres a sequence involving a Mexican pimp that plays like a DVD outtake and the Brides encounter with Bill goes on and on. Tarantino insists on telling us every thought he has ever had about these characters but hes the only one who takes them seriously. Still the movie never stalls and considering all the fun Tarantino has given us to this point the impulse is to cut him some slack. All he has to do is trim a full hour out of ""Vol. 1"" and a half hour out of ""Vol. 2"" combine whats left and hell have something not just amusing and idiosyncratic but outstanding. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and strong language.

Kill Bill Volume 2 Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kill-bill-volume-2-2004,200,killbillvol.213,killbillvol.2,rogerebert
"Second Kill Bill is dead-on - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Second Kill Bill is dead-on By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 16 2004 When was the last time you got high from a movie?In all the films a working critic sees in a given year maybe three or four brief moments fuse image sound and energy into a combustible rush. Less than a handful of times do you feel a director working at full throttle using the medium in a way that prompts astonishment delight even gratitude.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" fills that quota and keeps going delivering scene after scene in which the audience is picked up by the scruff of its collective neck and tossed playfully about the theater. If Quentin Tarantino is the Energizer Bunny of moviemakers in this second installment of his Wagnerian revenge pastiche -- a film richer in every way than its illustrious callow predecessor -- he has plugged back into depth of feeling and matched ""Pulp Fiction"" stride for stride. The result is insanely good and the best time Ive had at the movies in ages.""Vol. 2"" is both less and more than ""Vol. 1."" Its nowhere near as bloody for one thing a development that will come as a relief to weenies (such as myself) who dont really enjoy watching limbs get severed with bravura style. The martial-arts overkill that reduced the first film to a brilliant toy is replaced here with a more discursive yet oddly focused and confident approach. If ""Vol. 1"" was Tarantinos cross-riffing homage to the action movies of Japan and China ""Vol. 2"" looks West to American and European art movies of the 60s and 70s and above all to the thundering spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. Not for nothing is repurposed Ennio Morricone film music all over the soundtrack.Dont fret You still get to see Uma Thurmans Bride lay enemies to waste. But you also get such chatty Tarantino set pieces as the Brides ex-boss/ex-lover/mortal enemy Bill (David Carradine) explaining why Clark Kent represents Supermans lousy opinion of the human race. Theres a becomingly maternal world-weariness to the film too in spite of all the high-flying kicks. When the Bride and Bill sit down for a discussion toward the end of the film ""Kill Bill"" stands revealed as a relationship drama -- one of a particularly lethal stripe. As Bill himself admits ""There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard."" I think this is Tarantinos idea of couples therapy.Puckishly the director finally gives us the beginning of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" at the beginning of ""Kill Bill Vol. 2."" We dont exactly see the wedding chapel massacre that put the Bride in that four-year coma from which she emerged as a vengeful Fury but we witness the long run-up in luminous wide-screen black and white. She has tried to ditch Bill and the assassins life for which he tutored her he and his minions have tracked her down and as the two verbally parry on the chapels dusty front porch their faces sit like Easter Island close-ups on either side of the screen. The image references John Ford westerns existential Antonioni dramas the confrontations in ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" -- at times Tarantino seems hell-bent on recapitulating the entire history of the cinema. But there are other fish to maim. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" clicks into parched color as the Bride stalks the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. First up is Bills kid brother Budd played by Michael Madsen as if he were the last dishonest cowboy on earth. Budd has fallen on hard times living in a trailer in the desert cant even keep a job as a bouncer at the My Oh My Club wears an existential funk almost as big as his hat. The Brides encounter with him results in a sequence I advise claustrophobes to skip Rarely has the crash of dirt hitting wood sounded more terrifying than when youre sitting in a pitch-black theater.""Vol. 2"" of course was originally intended to be the back half of a single ""Kill Bill"" and you can tell where Tarantino has stretched the material to fit the new running time. The padding shows -- some of the early scenes go on a beat too long -- but with the arrival of Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) Bills one-eyed troubleshooter the film kicks into overdrive. The scene in which the two women finally settle their differences is a brilliantly sustained cadenza of creative mayhem -- its ecstatic resourceful and edited with a sense of timing that leaves your jaw stuck to the floor. You could take the sequence out offer it whole to the Academy and it would win the best short film Oscar.""Vol. 1"" was ingenious mayhem too but it burned its fingers on decadence. The new film succeeds by stirring up the embers of what once passed between the Bride and Bill and by startlingly exploring the no-mans-land of the Brides matriarchal impulses. Theres a lulu of a flashback involving an interrupted hit a home pregnancy test and two lady assassins staring down the barrel of the work/motherhood dilemma. Better yet the sequence that opened ""Vol. 1"" -- when Vivica A. Foxs character was killed in front of her daughter and parents in the audience felt their stomachs fall away -- has its very appropriate bookend in ""Vol. 2."" I will say no more.Other than to burble happily over the random elements Tarantino ladles into his neon mojito Johnny Cash songs and Japanese baby-cart samurai films; Samuel L. Jacksons cameo as a former session man for every soul group who ever recorded and Gordon Lius extended sequence as a kung fu sage with a flowing white beard; Elles scholarly description of the effects of black mamba toxin on the central nervous system and the way the Bride staggers from a premature grave like a golem having a bad hair day. Carradine and Hannah reclaim their careers with ferocity but Thurmans work is mighty in heart and deed and she deserves whatever awards the brave dare to throw at her.If you had chopped ""Pulp Fiction"" in two the first half might have looked like the work of a freakishly gifted undertaker too. Jacksons monologue at the end of that 1993 film gave the movie the exhausted moral weight it needed to matter and so do the final scenes of ""Kill Bill Vol. 2."" ""Youre not a worker bee"" Bill reminds the woman who left him to live a boring normal life and whom he tried to murder for it. ""Youre a renegade killer bee.""Hes right but he forgets that there are different ways of being a renegade and one of them is caring about other people. Quentin Tarantino knows it and in this movie he risks admitting it. That sounds an awful lot like maturity but whatever you do dont tell him that. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

But Kill Bill Vol. 2 isnt just more Thurman vs. vermin plus thrills. In one key scene its about co-star David Carradine preparing a perfect sandwich in a perfect take as he coordinates artfully delivered dialogue with artful bread slicings just so. These two take their food fights very seriously David Carradine and Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol. 2. Miramax Films Credit writer/director Quentin Tarantino for making this moment almost as compelling as the rowdy rest while also symbolizing how Vol. 2 differs from Vol. 1 (now on DVD see above). Or at least within a pulp framework that dictates almost everything but the sandwich be over the top. Octobers opening Bill installment was marvelous chop-socky choreography at the expense of character. The more verbal Vol. 2 which is better at explaining why Thurmans heroine wants to kill Bill (and Budd and Elle) is more widescreen-languorous and even contemplative. In fact the spirit of Sergio Leone must be bowing its head in pride at 2s transparent homage or demanding afterlife residuals from Tarantinos accountant. Peppered by flashbacks that illuminate the storys present the picture trades off action altercations with quieter scenes including an arduous Thurman training session that makes her aforementioned escape acceptably credible. ABOUT THE MOVIE Kill Bill Vol. 2    1/2 (out of four) Stars Uma Thurman David Carradine Daryl Hannah Michael Madsen Gordon Liu Michael Parks Director Quentin Tarantino Distributor Miramax Rating R for violence language and brief drug use Opens Friday nationwide But even if you think the movie presses it with extended dialogue sequences that make this half of the story run 25 minutes longer it really delivers the goods when Thurmans Bride battles wasted Budd (Michael Madsen) and one-eyed Elle (Daryl Hannah) separately in Budds crummy trailer. Bout No. 2 is among the best closed-quarters screen fights ever as good as (and longer than) Frank Sinatra vs. Henry Silva in The Manchurian Candidate. And Hannah does more for an eyepatch than anyone since the late Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan. As he has in the past with John Travolta and Robert Forster Tarantino generates new screen life not only for Carradine but also for 60s never-quite-was Michael Parks (TVs Then Came Bronson) who is superb in a colorful bit. And by giving her more to do here he establishes Thurman as the premier action heroine since Sigourney Weaver in Alien. Kill Bills two-pack isnt of Godfather caliber though enthusiasts may try overrating it into such. But its scope filmmaking ambition and uniquely twisted point of view make it worthy of being seen some day in a chronological home version. Bring on the action toys; this looks like a franchise.

(CNN) -- ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" starts off with a black-and-white extreme close-up of Uma Thurman. Shes driving a convertible and as her character the Bride she speaks directly into the camera. ""Ive killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point"" she purrs. ""I went on what the movie advertisements referred to as a roaring rampage of revenge."" Not a bad summation of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1.""But with ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" Quentin Tarantino has made a rip-roaring highly entertaining extremely enjoyable continuation to ""Vol. 1"" a work that flows perfectly from the first film while at the same time managing to alter the tone pacing and even the look of its predecessor.(""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" isnt a sequel in the Hollywood sense of the term incidentally; the two films were shot as one and released in two chapters.)The first film was about revenge and featured more stage blood than Sam Peckinpah and Mel Gibson combined could ever imagine. This second one believe it or not is about love -- albeit a Tarantino kind of love. Yes there is blood involved but its a love story nevertheless.Sex and death Uma Thurman as the Bride is handy with a sword -- and a gun.After Thurmans monologue Tarantino takes the audience back to the chapel where the first film began. But this time he takes us back just a bit earlier to the point right before the Bride and her wedding party were gunned down by Bills assassination squad in ""Vol. 1."" We see events leading up to the killings including a pivotal scene between the Bride and Bill. The film then flashes forward to what is now the real beginning of ""Vol. 2."" Its an excellent way of making the second film accessible even if you havent seen the first. (I do urge everyone to see ""Vol. 1"" before seeing ""Vol. 2"" though. It makes for a much more fulfilling experience.)In the first movie Bill (David Carradine) was heard in voice-over but only seen in one brief shot. In ""Vol. 2"" hes front and center and we discover who he is and how he formed his gang of assassins the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" or DiVAS. Basically Bill is a pimp but instead of sex he trades in death.Now we meet a mysterious white-eyebrowed monk with a long matching beard. Hes Pei Mei (Gordon Liu) an old man who is a legendary Chinese master in the martial arts. He trained Bill and all of the DiVAS a group that originally included ORen-Ishii (Lucy Liu) known as Cottonmouth and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) nicknamed Copperhead. Both were both disposed of during glorious bloodbaths in ""Vol. 1.""The movie shows the brutal training the Bride and the others endured to become killing machines. Reportedly Tarantino -- who began his career as an actor and has appeared in some of this films -- wanted to play Pei Mei. But he finally decided he couldnt commit to all the training required while at the same time directing this complicated film.Exciting battles The DiVAS stand outside the wedding chapel ready to cause destruction.Pei Mei also trained Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) aka California Mountain Snake and Bills brother Budd (Michael Madsen) the only male member of the squad who is also known as Sidewinder. These two are the only ones left (other than Bill) from the original assassination team. Much of the second film is taken up with the separate battles between the Bride and her two nemeses as she picks them off one by one on her way to her main goal killing Bill of course.Both confrontations are utterly sensational. Theyre exciting innovative extremely imaginative and pure Tarantino. The cat fight between Thurman and Hannah alone is worth the price of admission.But its the revelations in the final scenes -- and an exquisitely long dialogue sequence between Bill and the Bride -- that turn this movie into a twisted love story. It also shows Tarantinos genius at work.Casting Carradine was also an act of inspiration. Originally Warren Beatty was considered for the role but quite frankly that would have ruined the movie and turned it into some kind of ""Playboy and his bunnies"" parody. However with Carradines ""Kung Fu"" background and his innate sense of mystery his Bill gives this film just the right amount of Asian flavor needed to anchor this story in the Far Eastern sensibilities loved so much by Tarantino.Ultimately ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is an astounding conclusion to Tarantinos epic tale and Uma Thurman is nothing short of magnificent.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" opens nationwide on Friday April 16 and is rated R.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Fox Daryl Hannah Lucy Liu Sonny Chiba; Director Quentin Tarantino; Author Quentin Tarantino; Release Date Wide 04/16/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 136; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Miramax Posted April 15 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Sometime in the near DVD future Kill Bill -- Vol. 2 will undoubtedly be reattached to the Vol. that preceded it restoring Quentin Tarantinos fabulous blood-and-cinema-soaked story of vengeance exacted by a wronged woman to the jumbo-size saga originally envisioned by the filmmaker. It turns out however to have been a canny martial-arts move of a dramaturgic kind to chop the film in two leaving space to breathe before bringing Bill in for the kill. The pause after the electrically violent first installment with its Asian aesthetic of spurts slashes extreme fashions and an impossibly high body count only intensifies the pleasures of this elegiac Western- influenced companion episode; with Vol. 2 the erudition of Tarantinos audacious and triumphant project pays off emotionally. The reward for attentively comparing and contrasting the two in memory before theyre combined on home video is revelation With the second installment Tarantino -- famous as an inspired manipulator of genre less proven as a filmmaker of soul -- shows his shy but ardent cinephiliac understanding of American sentiment and yearning. Everything he knows he may have learned at the movies. But theres no denying that when it comes to communicating a certain delirious romanticism of character shaped by thousands of hours spent sitting in the dark the artist who made this showpiece is a master. Right from the typeface of the title credits the urgent chug of the Bernard Herrmannized opening score and the Hitchcockian black-and-white image of Thurman behind the wheel of a car inter-galactic eyes gleaming as fake landscape streams behind her Vol. 2 announces its provenance in the soil of Westerns (both spaghetti and Monument Valley) and the loners who seek justice therein. Here finally we learn the full story of the Massacre at Two Pines that began the saga so gruesomely -- the wedding-party mow-down by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad that left the pregnant Bride for dead and the connection between the Bride and her quarry. (For video clerk high-five fun cult-cool actor and NASCAR driver Bo Svenson plays the prunish pastor.) Here too we get our first sense of the power Bill has over the Bride -- and of David Carradines sinewy masculinity in the role a pop-cultural gleam burnished by memories of the stars Kung Fu years on TV. A serene scene of pre-wedding reunion between Bill and Bride is as iconic and verbally economical as any in John Fords The Searchers. Much later at his most potently human Bill soliloquizes eloquent and hip on the qualities of Superman unique among superheroes while puttering around his living room. Bill is ultimately killed -- thats no plot giveaway -- with plenty of scrapes and tussles for the Bride along the way. (The death toll is much lower and the blood spillage is contained although theres an eyeball plucking of notable juicy gore.) But its the journey taken by Uma Thurmans Bride from indestructible heroine to open-hearted woman that matters -- and the way this strangely gold-flecked long-limbed actress of such amphibian beauty becomes a princess warrior under her directors guidance. And its the solidification of Carradines Bill from phantom menace to vulnerable life-size man that packs the emotional surprise in Vol. 2 -- and the delicate controlled craziness with which Tarantino roams from joke to jolt to joy in piling on the homages. Which brings us to Pei Mei the great martial-arts master and theme-tying figure of Vol. 2 played by Hong Kong kung fu star Gordon Liu. It happens like this In settling scores with Bills washed-up brother Budd (Reservoir Dogs alum Michael Madsen) the Bride spends some time buried alive in a coffin. The claustrophobia of interment itself is created with lovingly creepy verve and hideously good sound work. But as happened in Vol. 1 while the heroine waited for her paralyzed toe to obey her wiggle command adversity leads to flashback. And in this case the digression explains the Brides essential character-building martial-arts apprenticeship in China back when she too was one of Bills DiVAS. Dictatorial and irrascible Pei Mei strokes his long wispy white beard leaves his magnificently winged cottonball eyebrows well enough alone and breaks down his new pupil unknotting every fiber of ego before discipline and training can really begin. (His greatest gift is instruction in the deadly ""Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique."") His pedagogical technique is time-honored in similar Chinese hero journeys as universal in movie apprenticeships as the education of Rocky Balboa. But this Pei Mei this Yoda unique to Tarantino is also quite the blunt imp. ""Your so-called kung fu is really quite pathetic"" he sniffs. Then he teaches the Bride to fulfill her destiny at the crossroads of East-West film influences -- where she now reigns.

What Quentin Tarantino started with a wham he finishes with a bang in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" the supremely tasty and entrancingly elegant conclusion to the filmmakers unique serving of deep-dish cinephilia. Originally conceived as one film the two-parter that has finally emerged can now be seen as a truly epic work a 247-minute revenge saga in which the raw materials of movie memories have been transformed into a deliriously personal reverie that generates a trance-like dramatic power of its own. Less exotic and spectacular than ""Vol. 1"" second half may not match the biz of the first installment which debuted last October and generated 70 million in the U.S. and 108 internationally. Long-term prospects are brawny for separate DVD releases (""Vol. 1"" sans commentary comes out domestically April 13 three days ahead of ""Vol. 2"" in theaters) then for a combination of the two volumes both theatrically and on home formats an ultimate DVD with extras and so on. Although a 15-minute opening seg presented in glorious black-and-white scope re-establishes the intention of the Bride (Uma Thurman) to ""kill Bill"" and elaborates the fatal day in El Paso when her wedding rehearsal was invaded by her former lover/boss and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad it is recommended that viewers not come to ""Vol. 2"" without having seen its predecessor. But if this prologue Chapter 6 out of 10 in the overall work essentially recapitulates what we already know -- that Bill (David Carradine essentially unseen in ""Vol. 1"") attacks the pregnant Bride to avenge her having left him -- it also immediately establishes a different tone. Instead of concentrating on the previously seen violence in this sequence -- there is none this time -- set-piece is dominated by a long superbly written and acted interlude on the chapel porch wherein Bill and the Bride gingerly discuss the unfinished business between them while she tries to suss out what his intentions are. Scene portends much of what ""Vol. 2"" will be like significantly more dialogue-driven than the first half with twin emphases on juicy lingo and emotion; dominated by two-character interchanges; and highlighted by sequences attenuated to an often outrageous and daring degree. The Mexican and American Southwest settings and use of material from Ennio Morricones scores rep the obvious ways in which ""Vol. 2"" derives from Sergio Leone but equally important is the influence of the Italian master in pushing Tarantino to expand what could have been perfunctory scenes into hugely elaborated set-pieces; latter detailing is what gives ""Vol. 2"" its special charge for film buffs or anyone who keys into what Tarantino is up to. Having spectacularly dispatched two of Bills four assassins played by Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu in ""Vol. 1"" the Bride sets out here to track down Budd (Michael Madsen) Bills trailer-trash younger brother. In a chapter entitled ""The Lonely Journey of Paula Schultz"" Budd who lives in a craggy desert wasteland near Barstow Calif. manages to turn the tables on the sword-wielding Bride and subject her to a fate sometimes described as worse than death burial alive. Briefly compressing the widescreen frame to the 1.33 format before turning the picture to black altogether Tarantino suffocatingly conveys the terror of such torture as the securely bound Bride finds herself in a tight coffin and must listen as piles of dirt are dumped on top of it with the sounds gradually diminishing as the hole fills up. The sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness induces a cold sweat as she desperately tries to untie herself but the panic is unexpectedly relieved with the abrupt arrival of Chapter 8 ""The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei."" Suddenly the Asian influence of ""Vol. 1"" is again thrust to the fore as a flashback reveals Bill dropping his young protege off for training with a Chinese martial arts master (Hong Kong action stalwart Gordon Liu of ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" aka ""The Master Killer""). Warned by Bill that Pai Mei hates Caucasians Americans and women the Bride finds all that and more to be true as she is systematically humiliated and beat up by her unforgiving teacher. As Liu obviously has a field day as the master humorously decked out in abundant white hair and eyebrows and a flowing beard he habitually flips around Tarantino has equal fun aping the conventions of 70s Shaw Brothers kung fu epics working with the ever-inventive d.p. Robert Richardson to recapture even the cheesy color schemes and zoom lens reframings of those films. Fortunately this invigorating detour has a point as the lessons of strength and concentration she learned at length from Pai Mei enable the Bride to escape from her grave and take on her other nemesis Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) the eye-patched hellcat who like Budd was briefly glimpsed in ""Vol. 1."" Except for the lack of a right eye Elle who also studied with Pai Mei would appear to be an even match for the Bride a proposition put to the test in an amazing catfight between the two that is considerably more credible and satisfying than the one that opened ""Vol. 1."" Helped by Tarantinos inspired stroke of staging the fearsome struggle within the cramped confines of Budds trailer home the two rangy blondes look like giants as they leap lunge and toss one another off and through walls before the Bride concludes matters in a manner both grotesque and memorable. Finally there is nothing left for the Bride to do but to track down Bill himself. The journey starts with a visit to an elegant Mexican chap played with devastating elan by Michael Parks briefly seen as a sheriff in ""Vol. 1."" In just this small role Parks charismatic intensity suddenly brings to mind what James Dean might have been like had he lived to old age and it can only be hoped that the renewed attention brought by Tarantinos spotlight will result in some juicy late-career roles for this enigmatic actor. Climax naturally involves the showdown between the Bride and Bill. While the latter proposes a duel much like the one that so strikingly concluded ""Vol. 1"" Tarantino pulls another surprise by wisely declining an attempt to top that formal sword fight. Instead he loads the much-anticipated faceoff with talk. Fortunately its very good talk with passages particularly a fascinating rumination on comicbook superheroes that enable Carradine to round out his portrayal of a thoroughly evil character with genuinely human dimensionality. The opportunity Warren Beatty bypassed has been seized with relaxed but focused determination by the former ""Kung Fu"" star in one of the two top bigscreen performances of his career in which there are occasional ghostly echoes of both his father and John Huston. Final stretch also receives an added emotional charge via the presence of the child (no surprise) Bill fathered and upon her birth took from the comatose Bride. This maternal element in addition to the advantages of more dialogue and a presumed growing into the part boosts Thurman to a performance that now in the long haul seems great. Status of the Bride as one of the supreme female action heroes of filmdom appears indisputable and Thurman has come through the characters multitudinous physical and emotional rigors with something genuinely estimable. Enormously extended end credits which are entertaining in their own right should be sat through for what comes after a final line that amusingly confirms Tarantinos urge not to let go of this project. With the DVD still to come he no doubt hasnt yet. Beginning with its delightfully retro black-and-white rear projection shots of Thurman driving in a convertible and looking for all the world like Lana Turner in (the referenced) ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" pic continues as a stylistic wonder a dizzying example of cinematic sampling that abundantly shows Tarantinos love and innate gift for filmmaking. Richardsons cinematography Sally Menkes editing David Wascos and Cao Jui Pings production design and the original score by the RZA and (for Mexican interludes) Robert Rodriguez are smart resourceful and alive with innumerable other craft contributions following in kind.
