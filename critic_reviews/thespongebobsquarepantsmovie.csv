Stephen Hillenburgs enormously clever and appealing animated creation which has been one of the Nickelodeon channels biggest hits since debuting in 1999 still possesses charm as well as visual and musical appeal on the bigscreen. ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion. Stephen Hillenburgs enormously clever and appealing animated creation which has been one of the Nickelodeon channels biggest hits since debuting in 1999 still possesses charm as well as visual and musical appeal on the bigscreen. But as with many short-form TV entities when sextupled in length ""SpongeBob"" proves more palatable as scrumptious fast food than full-scale repast. Still B.O. should prove absorbent with the target audience through Thanksgiving and slightly beyond with much more in store down the line as a home entertainment staple. Very popular with college students as well as with parents the show featuring peppy SpongeBob dufus starfish best friend Patrick and curmudgeonly neighbor Squidward has always brandished a hipster veneer outre imagination and sharp design sense that make it by far the most whole-family-friendly Saturday morning cartoon. Another graduate after John Lasseter and Brad Bird of the CalArts animation program Hillenburg also studied and worked in marine biology; these interests have merged and morphed producing a pop impressionistic take on underwater life inhabited by spirited and disarming characters. Amusing live-action opening has a bunch of scruffy pirates singing the familiar ""SpongeBob"" title tune a la Gilbert and Sullivan in gleeful celebration of the discovery of movie ducats in a treasure chest They hightail it to what looks like San Franciscos late lamented Surf Theater to take in the show. At the outset the tranquility of Bikini Bottom is disrupted by two untoward events. After a successful run flipping patties at the Krusty Krab SpongeBob (voiced as always by Tom Kenny) is mortified to be bypassed for the job of manager of the new Krusty Krab 2 by cranky Squidward (Rodger Bumpass). At the same time scheming Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) proprietor of the dismally unsuccessful Chum Bucket eatery contrives to steal the crown of King Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor) and convince the king that Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) was responsible resulting in a death sentence for SpongeBobs greedy encrusted boss. With Neptunes daughter Missy (Scarlett Johansson) imploring her angry dad to delay impaling Krabs on his trident and Plankton taking over Bikini Bottom by turning the population into bucket-helmeted automatons SpongeBob and Patrick venture to deepest Shell City in search of the missing crown. Amid assorted skulls and monsters they find their scariest nemesis in biker hit man Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and in the bargain achieve a measure of ""manhood"" and maturity qualities that could have earned SpongeBob the managerial post in the first place. While the journey is neither uneventful nor without humor a certain tedium sets in that isnt helped by uninspired set pieces such as an interlude in which a depressed SpongeBob and Patrick get ""drunk"" on ice cream at the Goofy Goober nightspot. Giving things a funny jolt however is a live-action comic climax in which a self-deprecating David Hasselhoff gives the intrepid heroes a ride on his back as he speeds them back home across the waves like a human surfboard with a desperate Dennis in hot pursuit.

This feature-length spin-off from the very successful Nickelodeon cartoon series is a welcome uncynical affair. For starters its a good sign when an animated movie is not rammed desperately to the rafters with well-known voice talent. Here Scarlett Johansson and Alec Baldwin offer cameos but the anonymous voices and simple day-glo aesthetic of the TV series remain intact as SpongeBob and his dopey starfish sidekick Patrick are forced to quit their jobs at a submarine fast-food joint in order to rescue the stolen crown of their King Neptune. Its simple road-trip stuff with just enough nudge-wink humour to prevent most parents from reaching for the tranquillizers.Is there a subversive gay subtext to all this as some representatives of the American Christian right have argued? Its certainly got camp value - Patrick ends up in fish-nets and theres a live-action cameo from David Hasselhoff himself - but anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed. This ones ultimately for the kids.

SpongeBob SquarePants SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) hopes to prove to the denizens of Bikini Bottom that hes not wet behind the ears. (Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  SpongeBob Squarepants Details  Watch the Trailer  View More Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Absorbent and yellow and porous is he SpongeBob. Singing along yet? Ahhh its okay. Hes hard to resist this kitchen-sink-sponge kid who dresses in (what else?) square pants and lives at the bottom of the ocean in the amusingly named Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and his fellow cast of characters -- chief among them his doofy friend Patrick a starfish -- have been drawing laughs for five years with their television show on Nickelodeon. Created by Stephen Hillenburg a former marine biologist the ""SpongeBob"" cartoon is a classic Its silly its sweet and its full of all those adolescent jokes many find hard to resist (think flatulence). And for those already acquainted with this sponge and his friends ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" provides an amusing enough romp through his familiar undersea universe -- along with detours to the dreaded Shell City (supposedly protected by a cyclops) and the mainland. The movie opens (well after a live-action spoof featuring a bunch of bumbling pirates thrilled to receive tickets to the SpongeBob movie) with SpongeBob (voiced by Tom Kenny) exuberantly anticipating the announcement that he will be the new manager at the Krusty Krab 2 a franchise of the restaurant where he works. He is giddy He is excited He is about to receive some real grown-up responsibility Or not. To SpongeBobs utter dismay owner Eugene H. Krabs gives the job to persnickety cashier Squidward (voiced by Rodger Bumpass -- and no to all those snickering out there that is not a misprint). SpongeBob Mr. Krabs explains is only a kid. Heartbroken SpongeBob heads off with Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) to the bar at Goofy Goobers where they proceed to order round after round of ice cream which leads to all manner of staggering public singing and on-the-floor collapsing. They wake with bloodshot eyes five oclock shadows and decidedly less square pants. Meanwhile though the evil Plankton jealous as always over the Krusty Krabs success (his own restaurant the Chum Bucket is perpetually empty) has decided to set in motion ""Plan Z."" ""Its evil Its diabolical Its lemon-scented"" he crows. It consists of stealing the crown of King Neptune (guest voice Jeffrey Tambor) and framing Mr. Krabs for the theft. If the crown -- now supposedly in Shell City -- is not returned in six days Neptune will execute Mr. Krabs for the sin of permanently exposing his (gasp) bald spot. Enter SpongeBob who decides that he and Patrick will prove they really arent ""just kids"" by journeying to Shell City to rescue the crown. The adventure that follows occasionally feels drawn out -- the movie after all is seven times as long as the ""SpongeBob"" cartoons which come two to the half-hour. Welcome additions though are Tambor Scarlett Johansson as his softhearted daughter (who makes Patrick slobber and swoon) and Alec Baldwin as Dennis the hit man sent by Plankton. The films also peppered with hilarious musical numbers (including the mustached SpongeBob and Patrick belting out ""Now That Were Men"") those classic 9-year-old boy jokes (Patrick gets depantsed only to be found wearing Goofy Goober underwear); and some truly clever one-liners ""You cant fool me I listen to public radio"" ""I rode the Hasselhoff"" I rode the Hasselhoff? Ah yes the Hasselhoff. In a hilarious spoof David Hasselhoff aka the dean of ""Baywatch"" shows up late in the film to help rescue SpongeBob and Patrick (who we must point out encounter a bit more scariness in the movie than they usually do in the cartoon). We wont spoil all the fun but getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoffs back (and thighs and calves) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy. Like the movie its all in good fun. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some cartoon violence.

Featuring the voices of Tom Kenny Bill Fagerbakke Alec Baldwin Scarlett Johansson Jeffrey Tambor. Directed by Stephen Hillenburg. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). SpongeBob SquarePants who lives in a pineapple under the sea is the anti- Peter Pan . He wants to grow up as soon as possible to live out his dream of managing a fast-food restaurant. It will take the course of the delightful ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" and some awfully big adventures to get him to rethink his position. The ""SpongeBob"" movie retains the 2-D charm of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks -- a little 3-D here a little David Hasselhoff there. The series appeal never lay in its visuals however. ""SpongeBob"" endeared itself to kids and adults through sweetness and cleverness also abundant here. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg made the movie with his team from the show including the voice talents so familiar to fans. The first order of business is tweaking SpongeBobs image as perpetually cheery. Donning his cardboard-box pants and shirt and tie SpongeBob (blessed by Tom Kennys elastic semi-shriek) sings all the way to the Krusty Krab 2 sure that his boss Mr. Krabs will name him manager of the new restaurant. But SpongeBobs uptight neighbor Squidward (Rodger Bumpass sadly underused) gets the gig instead. SpongeBob is told hes too much of a kid to handle the responsibility. Unaware that he has grounds for an age-discrimination lawsuit SpongeBob along with loyal starfish pal Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke the most innocent baritone in show business) decides to tie one on. In a truly inspired sequence SpongeBob and Patrick knock back ice-cream sundaes and go from sentimental to belligerent then to splotchy and hung over. But SpongeBob gets another chance to prove his worthiness. Mean vain King Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor) searching for his stolen crown has frozen chief suspect Mr. Krabs in place until he gets some answers. Quickly forgetting his beef with his boss as is his big-hearted way SpongeBob decides to venture from his hometown of Bikini Bottom to a dangerous faraway city to retrieve the crown. Trying to show once and for all that they are men and not kids SpongeBob and Patrick embark on their quest in a car that looks like a hamburger. They are watched over by the kings benevolent mermaid daughter voiced by a sunny Scarlett Johansson. The celebrity voices never detract from the series regulars. Even Alec Baldwins gravel-voiced hit man out to stomp the young travelers cant upstage SpongeBob and Patrick. Hasselhoff is another matter since his scenes are live action (and too good to give away here). Other encounters are decidedly reminiscent of ""Finding Nemo"" but SpongeBob was under the sea well before the Pixar clownfish. So there. Wherever they go the worst insult one can hurl is calling someone ""kid"" or ""baby."" No wonder SpongeBob and Patrick want to put away their childish things. But the films underlying message is that a well-behaved child gets the best of both worlds. One can be responsible and blow bubbles. Not in the New Age sense but in the actual-kid sense. ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" is rated PG for a few sophomoric gags but nothing too off-color. Slightly more troubling is the sheer volume of bad or nearly bad guys from the sleazy Plankton (Doug ""Mr."" Lawrence giving a tiny creature a boatload of ambition) to King Neptune to the hit man. SpongeBob and Patricks constant state of peril can jangle the nerves. Sometimes you wish they were back in Bikini Bottom irritating the heck out of Squidward. -- Advisory This film contains cartoon violence.

Special note to David Hasselhoff fans who still have baby teeth This ones for you. SpongeBob suits up Nickelodeons top cartoon character is in search of King Neptunes crown possibly stolen by the nefarious Plankton. Paramount Pictures Harmlessly off-the-cuff -- but facing far more pedigreed multiplex competition --SpongeBob barely rates as OK when compared with The Incredibles. The story deals with an underwater King Neptune (voice of Jeffrey Tambor) whose crown has been stolen and his bookish daughter Princess Mindy (Scarlett Johansson) a variation on the closet hottie obscured behind a pair of glasses. About the movie The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie   (out of four) Stars Tom Kenny Alec Baldwin Jeffrey Tambor David Hasselhoff Scarlett Johansson Directors Sherm Cohen Stephen Hillenburg Mark Osborne Distributor Paramount Pictures Rated PG for mild crude humor Opens Friday nationwide Were dealing here with the thefts ramifications and how they affect SpongeBob the Nickelodeon fixture whos either a sponge with two prominent teeth or a pair of teeth surrounded by a sponge. Residing in an aquatic burg called Bikini Bottom (thats about the only jollies ticket-buying dads will get out of this picture) he is foiled in his hopes to be named manager of the new Krusty Krab eatery which leads to a fallback endeavor. With pal Patrick (a low-IQ starfish) SpongeBob hits the watery road to rescue the kings crown. This odysseys tone is less Oz-like than Ozzy Osbourne-like at least when the two meet an intimidatingly anti-social biker with the voice of Alec Baldwin who just a year ago was breaking knees for real in The Cooler. Just about anything goes beginning with a funny live-action bit about pirates thats much less so when the filmmakers press their luck with a reprise. With such a carefree tone displayed throughout SpongeBobs 90 minutes it barely startles a whit when Hasselhoff shows up with digitally enhanced pecs. Aerosmiths Steven Tyler in The Polar Express-- now thats a distraction. Its been quite a movie year for Hasselhoff Dodgeball John Waters NC-17 nymphomania paean A Dirty Shame and now a return to his Baywatch roots where one of his co-stars is plankton. Well you dont just make it to the Old Vic with a snap of the finger. You have to work your way up to it.

Coolest sponge in the sea although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look. Not exactly the sessile aquatic porous being youd find underwater. More like the yellow block youd buy at Safeway -- except with a cheesy grinning face. And tautly stretched underpants around his nether regions. In ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" hes a squeezable delight for a strange coalition of fans young children of course; parents who get a kick out of his asides (not to mention his weirder pals like Patrick Star the starfish); and college-age kids who (this is a theory) get to vicariously relive the childishness theyre supposed to be too cool to enjoy anymore. Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? SpongeBob SquarePants And hes making his big-screen debut in his very own movie. _____More in Movies_____  SpongeBob Squarepants Details  Watch the Trailer  View More Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) is convinced hes getting the manager job at a brand-new fast-food venture the Crusty Crab 2. But manager Eugene H. Krabs (Clancy Brown) gives the job to dour Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass). SpongeBob isnt mature enough Krabs tells him. Not mature enough? NOT MATURE ENOUGH?? Why thats enough to make SpongeBob scream and wail like well a kid. But his chance to prove himself comes soon enough. King Neptune loses his royal crown which the extremely small but evil Sheldon J. Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) has not only filched but fooled the fishtailed ruler into believing was taken by Larry the Lobster (Lawrence as well). SpongeBob and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) have to find the crown before Neptune aims his burning trident at Larry and turns him into lobster crisp. Of course the little comic flourishes are the high points of any SpongeBob adventure. Like the way SpongeBob has absolutely no reaction for about 10 seconds when Plankton baldly states he intends to create evil and mayhem. Or the way SpongeBob showers swallows a bar of soap and lets it froth through his pores. Then theres the extreme flip-outs or glee attacks he and goofy Patrick enjoy. They either cry themselves literally into a puddle or hoot hysterically. SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg a marine biologist-turned-animator throws humorous fish bones to the older crowd too. In a mixture of cartoon and live action our central pals take a ride on the hairy body of David Hasselhoff as a surfing dude ex machina. And adults will enjoy SpongeBobs reaction before and after the news about the managerial job. At first he skips happily toward the Crab 2 repeating ""Im ready promotion Im ready promotion."" But after hearing hes not getting the position he slinks away chanting ""Im ready depression Im ready depression."" Sponge fans are you ready? THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE (PG 88 minutes) -- Contains cartoon butts fart and burp humor an extremely mild obscenity and underwear tug-downs -- all the good stuff. Area theaters.

"The expanded SpongeBob. Slate Sign In Sign Up The expanded SpongeBob. The expanded SpongeBob. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 18 2004 622 PM SpongeBob Squared A longer more conventional kiddie show. By David Edelstein Its hip to be SquarePants Many of us parents suffer through a lot of insipid kid shows for the sake of keeping our young uns company--partly to monitor what they watch partly in the hope that an occasional interjection--""Now why would he want to do that? Isnt that strange? Dont you think thats the silliest thing? Hello?""--will break the hypnotic-trance state before they become entirely passive zombielike receptacles. Weve come to look on Stephen Hillenburgs SpongeBob SquarePants as a gift--a joyful spasm of wacked-out surrealism featuring one of the sweetest characters in cartoondom. This kitchen-sponge-shaped sea sponge with two widely spaced front teeth and a laugh like a dolphin on a sugar high is televisions most happy-go-lucky optimist a child-man who takes joy in even a minimum-wage dead-end fast-food job--at the bottom of the ocean no less. Each episode is nautical whimsy bordering on nonsense with ukulele music and flower-cloud backdrops Its old-fashioned squash-and-stretch animation wedded to a blissfully funny slacker-stoner worldview that as my colleague Virginia Heffernan wrote ""disdains sanctimony and hypocrisy far more than bad behavior"" and ""puts a premium on go-along-get-along happiness."" At 11 short minutes the length of a SpongeBobSquarePants cartoon its just about perfection. Advertisement The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Paramount) is considerably longer than 11 minutes and its not just an elasticized padded-up short. The film tells a classic story with a classic three-act Robert-McKee-certified screenplay structure. To save Mr. Krabs SpongeBobs boss at the Krusty Krab from execution SpongeBob and his imbecilic purple starfish pal Patrick must embark on a heroic quest to recover the crown of King Neptune the tyrannical ruler of Bikini Bottom. Who framed Mr. Krabs? Why none other than that insanely jealous one-eyed proprietor of the rival restaurant the Chum Bucket Plankton--a tiny protozoan whos forever being stepped on and smooshed at the height of his megalomaniacal rants. After being scraped off SpongeBobs shoe Plankton--voiced by a guy who calls himself ""Mr. Lawrence"" and sounds like Fred Flintstone off his meds--announces hes going to get the recipe for Krabby Patties and bring the world to its knees--to which SpongeBob replies cheerfully ""Well good luck with that"" Its a measure of his inability even to comprehend the mendacity of the world that hed risk his life for Mr. Krabs after being passed over for manager of the Krusty Krab 2--and after a post-heartbreak ice cream bender at Goofy Goobers that leaves him a flaming-eyed wreck. All this is amusing enough but I kept waiting for the story to zigzag and go hurtling off into the furthest reaches of absurdity. (One of my favorite SpongeBob cartoons ""Dying for Pie"" ends with an H-bomb explosion in Bikini Bottom--substituting no doubt for Bikini Atoll.) The movie does get crazy sort of finally but the path is pretty straight--or as they say in the screenplay biz linear. King Neptune voiced by Jeffrey Tambor is a dull despot imported from a more Disneyish cartoon universe and his friendly daughter a bespectacled mermaid named Mindy (voiced by Scarlett Johanssen) is only mildly more diverting largely thanks to Patricks habit of drooling and babbling ""Shes hot"" whenever shes in the vicinity. The first part of the movie isnt slow exactly. Its just that the scaffolding is too visible. Things pick up when SpongeBob and Patrick mistakenly convinced of their invincibility do a nonchalant soft-shoe slap-and-tickle in the midst of an abyss as sundry humongous tentacled creatures prepare to eat them. And there are two amazing live-action encounters. One is with a friendly David Hasselhoff to whose leg hairs SpongeBob and Patrick cling during a climactic escape from a hit-man fish (hit-fish?) rasped by Alec Baldwin. The other even more momentous meeting is with an unfriendly cyclops--actually a cackling deep-sea diver fond of drying out sea creatures and turning them into kitschy knickknacks. Here Hillenburg and his animators subject us to the horrifying--mythically horrifying--spectacle of SpongeBob and Patrick drying out under a heat lamp into a real kitchen sponge and a dead starfish. Its enough to make you drop to your knees and pray to be whisked back into the cartoon universe where fish eat at fast-food joints--and you are pretty quickly thank heaven. As SpongeBob Tom Kenny has a Pee-Wee-Herman-meets-Jerry-Lewis-on-helium vocal attack but he makes the part thoroughly his own Its Pee-Wee without the archness Jerry lofted by the purest delight. Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke as the butt-cheek-flashing starfish make beautiful duets--the high-pitched porpoise and the basso doofus. Theres plenty to treasure in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie but for all the spit-and-polish animation and the rollicking soundtrack (which includes an original song by the Flaming Lips as well as Weens gorgeous ""Ocean Man"" from their Mollusk album) this isnt the yellow ones most thrilling hour--or 80 minutes. I know Hillenburg didnt want to make a SpongeBob episode stretched out. He wanted a movie with a beginning middle and end and a fine inspirational message that childlike dorks can be heroes too. But I like my SpongeBob a little less lumbering a little more free-associational without that big heavy anchor of a story structure to weigh him down.

The star of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is the same poriferan who has become a rainmaker for Nickelodeon. And the best moments in his first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg.

Arrested Developments Jeffrey Tambor voices King Neptune Scarlett Johansson speaks as his daughter and Alec Baldwin lends a Clint-ish whisper to a hitman. By the time a SquareChested David Hasselhoff swims by in full 3-D human form poor SpongeBob and Patrick have nearly gone dry on a forced heroes journey involving life lessons about bravery friendship and all that seaweed -- when really nautical nonsense is all we wish for.
