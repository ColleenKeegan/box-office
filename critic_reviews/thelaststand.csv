"Violent Bores << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Theyre Back Baby  Next The Fouettes en Tournant of the WTA Lionsgate Facebook Twitter Print Series Violent Bores Yawning through The Last Stand and Broken City by Wesley Morris on January 18 2013 This is probably not the week to release a movie in which Johnny Knoxville feeds a belt of bullets into an antique machine gun as Arnold Schwarzenegger mows down an assortment of armed and anonymous men. But anything this artillery-crazed and starring a former elected official whose nom de guerre was ""The Governator"" doesnt care about the national climate on guns. Bullets are simply part of the weather in The Last Stand Kevlar being the preferred umbrella. The weaponry is so ridiculously bountiful that the movie must be a defense against something. But its just another lousy action movie. And for more than an hour its less than that. Schwarzenegger plays the sheriff of a sleepy saloony Arizona town that abuts Mexico. A drug lord has sprung himself from a Las Vegas prison and is headed the sheriffs way to speed across a bridge hes had custom-made to cross the border. Its not worth going into why the drug lord has handcuffed a sexy agent inside his speeding Corvette or what Forest Whitaker is doing leading the team of feds pursuing this fugitive. And why go into what nincompoops the sheriffs deputies are? Or how nothing that precedes the big high-noon shootout matters -- not the goon squad captained by Peter Stormare the Nordic nut from Fargo; not the many lifeless scenes with Whitaker and the FBI; not one minute of time spent with Schwarzenegger whose face is too tight and tan and whose hair too fussed over and chestnut to be as Clint Eastwood-crusty as the movie needs. No the entire movie exists for the climactic high-noon shootout in which Stomares team and the sheriffs five-person crew including Knoxville Rodrigo Santoro and Luis Guzman blast away at each other. Its violence has a gathering comedic force. Its vaguely funny the way a flare gun has been rigged to simulate a grenade launcher so that when the flare hits a body it produces fireworks and then detonates sending an arm say hurtling through the air. Its the only kind of mayhem Jee-woon Kim knows. Kim is a relentless South Korean whose specialty is queasy genre junk -- whether its horror (A Tale of Two Sisters); spaghetti western (The Good the Bad the Weird) or vengeful cop procedural (I Saw the Devil). If he can take things too far hell take them even further. An ungainly mix of comedy violence sadism and schlock obviously arouses him. But the fun and tension of his moviemaking gradually devolves into tedium. Even with all the competing tones his movies have one note that Kim is cocky enough to think he can sustain for more than two hours. The Last Stand is his first Hollywood movie and his first in English and until the movies standoff he doesnt get to apply any of his crazy sensibility to the dime-store action-thriller script thats credited to Andrew Knauer. Kim operates in the same family as both John Woo and Quentin Tarantino but he lacks Woos soulfulness and Tarantinos ingenuity. Still when he gets going toward the end of The Last Stand the movie wakes up and manages to distinguish itself at least from whatever straight-to-videoness we typically associate with an actor like Jeff Fahey. The showdown is shot in daylight and the camera zooms and caroms and attached to a school bus spins in the dirt. When Kim tires of guns he stages a second climax -- a two-car chase in a cornfield -- then a third featuring UFC-worthy body-to-body combat. He goes through styles of violence the way you might navigate a department store. Eighth floor. Cutlery Of course the grammar used to create the mayhem is all military. Most of the men in this sequence are ex-soldiers and Marines and the way the artillery is fired or the way these guys tip-toe-sprint across an ominously empty Main Street or walk up a flight of stairs while shooting feels very much like war -- both the news medias approximations of combat and what passes for it in movies and video games. Kim isnt taking seriously any of those serious evocations though. That man-to-man showdown manages to give Schwarzenegger a good line about immigrants and immigrants pride. But its hollow since the violence in the movie has really been scrubbed clean of real politics. Its not small-town Americans trading fire with Mexican drug cartels. Its small-town Americans blowing away enemies in a single-shooter game. Youre never distracted from the stultifying emptiness of it all. The Last Stand yes. But what on earth is it standing for? Broken City is even blander and stands for less. Its a local-government corruption thriller that doesnt care about logic or consistency or the people watching it. It feels like an accident a movie you find in progress on Cinemax at 235 a.m. and cant believe you missed until the moment arrives when you cant believe youre still watching. But a film starring Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones will do that to the best of us. When was the movie even made? 1998? 2003? Last year? Its not just that the music cues are baffling. Yes somebodys got an iPhone and the DJ at a movie-premiere soiree puts on DMXs ""Party Up"" which is 13 years old. (But that could merely signify excellent taste since its the sort of song a DJ should always play.) The reason to feel confused about this movie is that it has Mark Wahlberg as a rogue cop turned private eye. It has Crowe as the mayor of a New York City that may as well be Detroit (that unfortunately would be Broke-Ass City; filmed in New Orleans its actually the Big Easy pretending to be the Big Apple). It has Zeta-Jones in the sort of role that gives you the fake-Faye Dunaway blues. This is a movie that these three would have made 15 years ago when their careers were different. Its the sort of movie you expect from three actors with a lot of promise not from three stars who should know better. But here they are seeming far more washed up than is any kind of right. And in the name of what? A film that reminds us that some public officials are greedy some cops are heartless and the wives of public officials are slutty until proven innocent? Wahlberg is Billy Taggart an NYPD detective who shoots a suspected rapist and murderer in a housing project. A judge exonerates him but the mayor and the chief of police (Jeffrey Wright) ask him to resign lest the question of whether he murdered that rapist persist. Seven years immediately pass and Taggart is working as an underpaid private eye whose services the mayor suddenly needs. The mayors wife is sleeping with another man. And I was certain this was a terrible movie and that no cared how bad it was when Crowe went on a tirade about wanting Taggart to reveal how well-endowed the other man is and whether she fakes her orgasms with him the way she does with the mayor whos campaigning for reelection. Its an embarrassing speech that manages to make the character less credible than he already is. And with still 90 minutes left Its as intriguing as spending 100 minutes watching a lamp. But a lamp at least illuminates. Where all of this leads is so much less interesting than it should be. Ive rarely been this confused by a thriller. Is there something afoot with the mayors rich young opponent (Barry Pepper)? Is that something homosexual or not? How absurd is the scheme that the mayor wants to pull off with that housing project? And why isnt the movie which Brian Tucker wrote and Allen Hughes directed more about that? And why do we have to go to that movie premiere of Taggarts ""indie-film"" actress girlfriend (Natalie Martinez)? And what independent movie has looked this much like both a 98 Degrees music video and an episode of Red Shoe Diaries? Where it all winds up is as intriguing as spending 100 minutes watching a lamp. But a lamp at least illuminates. This is the sort of movie Sidney Lumet made about five times. But even when they didnt work those movies -- Serpico Prince of the City Power Q amp; A Night Falls on Manhattan -- had an electric charge. They had something to say about ego and power and corruption. They were New York movies that could provide an x-ray of their broken city and surprise and move you with their histrionics. Hughes -- working for the first time without his twin brother Albert -- has exactly one great idea and its to shoot Wahlberg drunk on the streets throwing a bottle at an SUV and beating up a guy on the sidewalk. But he gives it to us as a montage that lasts about a minute. This sequence should be the dramatic centerpiece -- since Taggart was an alcoholic who sobered up for his girlfriend and has now thanks to the embarrassment of her movie fallen off the wagon. We see him down three or four or five shots rough up her costar and go on that mini-rampage. But then the phone rings. Its the screenplay calling with shocking news. And Taggart is magically sober enough to resume advancing this nonsense plot. If Broken City couldnt be Sidney Lumet it could at least have been good trash. But its not even filthy enough for that. For one thing Hughes and Tucker arent thinking clearly enough to get the movie down into the gutter. For another I dont know that Hughes couldve gotten his stars to go there with him. None of them wants to commit to breaking a sweat lest we think they actually cared. Only Pepper and Wright lower themselves to the potential luridness. Pepper is a Canadian whos never sounded more from British Columbia than he does here weeping and pontificating. He has to do too much with this vaguely written part which is nice since no one around him is really doing anything with theirs. Wright meanwhile is playing the kind of corkscrewed cop that calls for cockeyed deviance. I also like the sass and backhanded affection Alona Tal uses to play Taggarts assistant. Otherwise this is just more exercise for Zeta-Jones who hasnt carried a movie in almost a decade. She and Crowe are ideally matched. Hes the bigger actor. Shes the better star. But neither does the other any favors. Between this and his two-note singing in Les Miserables Crowes going through a real miscasting phase. Throwing himself into the Seine as he does in Les Mis was a shrewd preemptive strike against having to read the reviews. This time he spares himself the East River but this new part is all wrong for him too. That beefiness of his still bespeaks power but here its not city-hall muscle you sense. Its Wall Street shadiness. Who would vote such a tan oily douchebag to run their city? Hes in the wrong movie. Crowe should be manning heavy weaponry in Arizona. He should be playing the bellicose sheriff not the sleazy mayor.

""The Last Stand"" represents his first starring role in eight years and it seems theres plenty more gas in his tank. The timing for a primed pumped itchy-trigger-finger shoot-em-up leaves something to be desired no doubt but with Nicolas Cage unaccountably AWOL this January Arnie has the knucklehead R-rated action field pretty much to himself. Whats more ""The Last Stand"" brings it. If you park your brain outside and double-park any misgivings about vicarious gun mayhem right alongside its passable fun. Its a modern-day Western -- a souped-up and dumbed-down ""Rio Bravo"" if you will -- with Schwarzenegger making like John Wayne as border town Sheriff Ray Owens the last man standing between a runaway bad guy (Mexican drug baron Eduardo Noreiga) and his freedom. Charting a spectacularly erratic 24-hour course the movie juggles self-consciously hokey small-town comedy with slick (or at least semi-slick) high-tech chase scenes as the road-racing desperado leads Forest Whitaker and the feds on a merry chase through the Southwest in his prototype Corvette 01. The auto action seems a transparent pitch to sell high-end sports cars and inject a little momentum in a movie thats equally content to dawdle over its morning coffee shooting the breeze with amusing (or at least semi-amusing) supporting players like Rays deputies ornery Mike (Luis Guzman in the Walter Brennan role) bumbling Jerry (Zach Gilford) and sexy Sarah (Jaimie Alexander). Johnny Knoxville gets unaccountably prominent billing for little more than an extended cameo as a guy named Dinkum a screwy gun nut with a penchant for cavalier headgear. Hes excruciating but almost puppy-like hes so eager to please. The same might go for director Kim Jee-woon a talented Korean known for macabre ghost stories like ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" whacky adventures (""The Good the Bad the Weird"") and grisly cop thrillers (""I Saw the Devil""). His first U.S. effort is full of bold broad comic book strokes -- some of them pleasingly original like a car chase through a cornfield the husks of corn thudding against the windscreens like oversized bugs. Listen to how he picks out the sound of a helmet rolling across the pavement. Thats a filmmaker alert to his environment and the tools at this command. But theres just as much thats ham-fisted or tin-eared. At best these are stereotypes we might recognize from other B flicks. Theres never a whiff of authenticity except maybe when Harry Dean Stanton appears for a cruelly brief bit part as a cranky local farmer. The uninspired score by Kims countryman Mowg doesnt lift the so-so climactic shoot-out any but the movies tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience. And Arnie? Hes indestructible.

The Last Stand (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Last Stand (R) Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in an improbable - albeit entertaining - action movie. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/17/2013 Editor rating 2 The idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a small town sheriff is ludicrous but then thats the whole point of his new movie Its dumb fun emphasis on the dumb. One does not expect wit or intelligence to play a role in a Schwarzenegger movie -- unless James Cameron is directing and the former governor of California is playing a cyborg -- and so The Last Stand is not in a position to disappoint. Its exactly what you expect it to be. Johnny Knoxville is in it for heavens sake; how can you take it seriously? If youre interested enough to pay for a ticket chances are you will be moderately diverted for awhile though I warn you You will not be transformed by particularly gifted filmmaking. In his first leading role since leaving politics Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens formerly of the L.A.P.D. who has moved to the border town of Sommerton Ariz. to take charge of a tiny police force that has more in common with The Three Stooges than actual useful public servants. Their mettle is tested however when a dangerous drug lord (Eduardo Noriega) escapes during his transfer to Death Row flees Las Vegas and heads south for their little slice of desert paradise to cross the border into Mexico. The feds have the main border crossing shut down. There is only one other road he can take to his destination and it leads straight through downtown Sommerton. No seriously. Apparently there arent any side streets. Owens and his band of cops (Luis Guzman Jaimie Alexander Zach Gilford) know theyre overmatched but theyre bound to try to stop the bad guy anyway even though he appears to have his own army just waiting to help him get home. Helpfully theres an Iraq War veteran (Rodrigo Santoro) locked up in the drunk tank so Owens and his crew decide to hand him a gun too. Plotwise thats about it. A federal agent (Forest Whitaker) tracking the prisoners escape barks orders at his underlings and shouts directions and insults at Owens on the phone (this strategy backfires). Theres a Corvette with a starring role that has enough horsepower to outrun a fighter jet or orbit the Earth or something that may actually be a better actor than Schwarzenegger (hard to tell; it doesnt have any lines). Knoxville shows up as a lunatic Sommerton citizen with a convenient arsenal and a strange array of headgear. Should they choose to accept the challenge gun-control advocates could have a field day with the caressing and fetishization of weapons in this movie as well as the orgy of violence that escalates in the movies final half an hour. Many scenes virtually wait for -- and will clearly receive -- audience applause. Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) handles the action sequences effectively if not spectacularly though The Last Stand could have dispensed with the occasional attempts at sobriety and cut straight to the chase (or chases). Schwarzeneggers political career may not have improved his acting but he has picked up right where he left off.

Area theaters. Everything about ""The Last Stand"" is designed to resuscitate Arnold Schwarzeneggers career. And though its impossible to praise the quality of the product its also easy to see how well it will sell. So consider the title ironic; this jokey action flick will make enough money to ensure that hell be ba-- ... oh forget it. Youll get enough of that sort of thing if you see the movie. Our one-time Terminator is now closer to retirement living out his later years as the sheriff of a tiny Arizona town. Nothing much happens there until he gets a call from FBI agent Bannister (Forest Whitaker). Cartel kingpin Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has escaped custody and is racing for the border. While Bannisters agents blow every opportunity to capture Cortez Sheriff Owens gathers his small crew feisty Sarah (Jaimie Alexander) goofy Mike (Luis Guzman) and gun-crazy Lewis (Johnny Knoxville). When Cortez races into town theyre ready for him. The script is a mess built on lazy cliches stilted jokes and easy payoffs. What the movie does have though is enthusiasm. Director Kim Jee-woon (""The Good the Bad the Weird"") dampens his surreal sensibility but knows to go big -- very very big. Expect crazy chases and ugly standoffs and ultra-bloody shootouts. A fully engaged Whitaker should inspire all Oscar winners who take paycheck roles and Noriega makes a compelling villain. Guzman is shamelessly hammy as our comic relief while Knoxville seems to be improvising his ridiculous role. And then theres Arnold. As a personal tribute ""The Last Stand"" is blatantly needy but cannily self-deprecating. He calls himself old; someone immediately contradicts him. He moves slowly but miraculously puts away criminals half his age. Throughout we are encouraged to cheer him on to build him up and celebrate who he once was and who he is today. He happily plays along delivering justice and quips in equal measure. Some of this is amusing some of it absurd (he righteously declares ""My honor is not for sale""). Most likely it will all be embraced. After all Americans love a comeback story. Especially when it includes cool car chases and wry one-liners.

Never averse to reusing his trademark catchphrases or characters the 65-year-old slab of Austrian beef returns to the private sector with the very definition of an all-American action film -- guns cars and a sexy hostage -- that happens to be directed by Kim Jee-woon a South Korean. Its an enjoyably old-fashioned shoot-out if you can shake off the current headlines and sink in to a fantasy of hyper-violence that plays like an NRA vision of America the Beautiful. (READ Corlisss 1990 profile of Arnold Schwarzenegger by subscribing to TIME) At an age when many Americans make do as Walmart greeters Schwarzenegger nimbly hulks back into the movie spotlight after two terms as California Governor. Through graceful aging and the wonders of medical aesthetics his face has achieved a granite gravitas suitable for the Mount Rushmore of movie studs where he belongs. From his first big movie Conan the Barbarian in 1982 he created a dual image of a comic-book superhero and its perfect deadpan parody muscles on muscles a grim visage and the Teutonic grunt of a Wagner aria as sampled by Megadeth. The franchises he launched have spun on with other actors for decades in updates or remakes of Conan The Terminator Predator and Total Recall. Yet theres nothing to match the original Arnold for grand-scale serious silliness as amply displayed in The Last Stand. (FIND Schwarzenegger on TIMEs list of 25 Greatest Movie Villains) In Andrew Knauers script Schwarzenegger is called Ray Owens -- exactly the anonymous heartland name youd give to the cyborg from another planet -- and serves as the ""pissant county sheriff"" in the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction. The locals take little heed of this judicious soft-spoken Golem leaving their cars in no-parking zones and ignoring his advice to be careful out there. Rays apprehension is on target. The Mexican drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Spanish heartthrob Eduardo Noriega) has escaped from maximum security in Las Vegas taking a sexy FBI agent (Genesis Rodriguez) as hostage and is headed back home in a souped-up Corvette ZR1 that can speed toward the border at 200 mph. From FBI agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) Ray learns that Cortezs route is to pass right through Sommerton where his gang has constructed a bridge across the narrow ravine separating the U.S. from Mexico. ""Ive seen enough bloodshed and death"" says Ray who quit his job as an L.A. cop for the serenity of Sommerton. ""I know whats coming."" (READ Richard Schickel on Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland) So do any citizens whove seen the movies The Last Stand is based on the 1959 Howard Hawks Western Rio Bravo and John Carpenters 1976 sorta-remake Assault on Precinct 13. Both films spent their first two acts assembling the team that would stand strong against an infestation of villains. Same here. To stop Cortez Ray summons a motley posse his game but untested deputies Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman) Jerry Bailey (Zach Gilford) and Sarah Torrance (Jaimie Alexander) plus gun-museum owner Lewis Dinkum (Jackasss Johnny Knoxville) and Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro) Sarahs erstwhile beau and a current resident of the local jail. Problem is that the small-town camaraderie here is perfunctory short on dramatic juice. All the Sommerton stalwarts get too much face time as if the movie were about human beings not archetypes and artillery. (READ Joel Steins profile of Jackass Johnny Knoxville) Slapdash in its character portraits the movie is slambang in its action scenes; it springs to life whenever it promises death. Like an old Fred Astaire musical Top Hat or Swing Time where the dialogue scenes are feeble but the singing and dancing sublime The Last Stand infuses its production numbers -- the big chases break-outs and face-offs -- with a high thrill quotient. Cortezs escape from Bannisters FBI cortege in Vegas has the oversize showmanship of a David Copperfield extravaganza as a giant magnet descends during a stop light and lifts the van to a tall buildings roof whence the drug lord and three abettors ride wires across Las Vegas Blvd. to another building and vanish. (SEE A TIME.com slide show of David Blaines Greatest Hits) Even quiet amiable Sommerton is a place where someone is less likely to say ""Good morning"" than ""Get the Glock."" A Cortez enforcer named Burrell (Fargos Peter Stormare looking here like Louis C.K. doing a Timothy Carey bared-teeth impression) has come to town commandeering a farm by blowing ornery Harry Dean Stanton off his tractor and into the next life. When Sarah and Jerry show up to investigate Burrell douses the field lights and engages them in a firefight with night-vision goggles; its Zero Dark Thirty Homeland Edition. The Main Street showdown has Ray blasting a bad guys brains out as the two men fall from a three-story building then using the town school bus -- fortunately without kids inside -- as a barricade. (READ Massimo Calabresi on the torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty) After the home team fends off the visitors by the simple expedient of shooting straight when the bad guys dont Ray borrows an illegally parked car to pursue Cortez in his ZR1 through a mature cornfield. Think of North by Northwest but in hot rods and with Korean composer Mowg scoring the chase with a Bernard Herrmann Hitchcock-movie theme. (Oddly its from Psycho.) Eventually Ray will throw away his weapons to confront Cortez in a WWE slapdown. Last weeks Gangster Squad climaxed with the same curious retrenchment to caveman fisticuffs. A mans gotta prove hes a man with a gun and then without. (READ Corlisss review of Gangster Squad) Kim Jee-woon made a bunch of vivid melodramas including A Bittersweet Life I Saw the Devil and The Good the Bad the Weird back in South Korea where firearms are hard to come by. (The main character in A Bittersweet Life spends a good part of the film just trying to buy a pistol.) As the first Korean auteur to direct a large-scale American movie Kim is ready to revel in the notion of a 24-seven gun show in a town with a larger arsenal than the directors northern neighbor Kim Jong-un. Everybody in Sommerton is packing including a granny type who runs the antique shop. Among the cache stocked by Knoxvilles Lewis are all manner of assault rifles and a 1939 Vickers machine gun that he endearingly calls ""my crazy little bitch."" When Ray flourishes the Vickers as Cortezs men rumbles on to Main Street he snarls ""Welcome to Sommerton."" (READ TIMEs brief on Kim Jee-woons The Good the Bad the Weird) This is where Im supposed to tut a liberal tut and blame the movie and its ilk for raising gun love to a theology. But what Im thinking watching this scene is An Austrian-born star aiming a British armament at a gang run by a Mexican played by a Spaniard -- in a picture directed by a Korean For good or for ill you decide The Last Stand demonstrates that the U.S. film industry is more than just a prime exporter of our movie values. In calling on Schwarzenegger Noriega and Kim (plus two of his compatriots Mowg and gifted cinematographer Kim Ji-yong) and setting them loose in a Wayne LaPierre wet dream The Last Stand functions as a global outreach initiative for American values the United Nations of blowin stuff up.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 18 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 18 2013 414PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jee-woon Kim Written by Andrew Knauer Jeffrey Nachmanoff George Nolfi Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Johnny Knoxville Forest Whitaker Eduardo Noriega Classification 14A Genre action On the simple surface of things The Last Stand is an occasionally amusing sometimes entertaining and surprisingly well-directed bit of fluff. Thats one way of looking at it. But since the fluff stars A. Schwarzenegger in (minus a fleeting cameo in The Expendables) his starring return to the big screen and since A. Schwarzenegger obviously totes with him a very hefty load of cinematic/political/personal baggage and since most moviegoers are fully aware of that baggages detailed contents theres another way of looking at The Last Stand. Dig just a shade beneath the surface trade in the text for the subtext and a more interesting picture emerges - a little richer sadder almost poignant. Arnie is back again yet now as a storied immigrant nearing the end of his tale hes become an odd sight to behold. Screen grab from online trailer for ""The Last Stand"" Movies Official trailer for The Last Stand But first the simple text. Arnie plays (to the extent he can) a backwater sheriff in an Arizona border town where there aint much sheriffin to do. His underemployed deputies - the young greenhorn the chubby veteran the bright-eyed gal - are the usual comic relief. By contrast Cortez the drug lord (Eduardo Noriega) is a busy bad guy. A posse of FBI agents are transporting him to a federal prison but en route he makes a slick escape with the aid of his private SWAT team then hops into a souped-up Corvette to speed toward a certain sleepy Arizona border town. There the rest of his gang have gathered to await his arrival and to facilitate his flight by (weirdly enough) building a bridge across a canyon into Mexico. Of course Arnie gets wind of the approaching villain and waits too. The clock ticks down High Noon is imminent.So far so fluffy. What mildly distinguishes it is the light and breezy pacing a short but welcome appearance by Harry Dean Stanton as a cranky farmer cum early victim another by Luis Guzman as the chubby deputy cum reluctant hero and Jee-woon Kim. Hes the Korean director imported for the gig and right from the opening frame - a silent night on a two-lane blacktop under a canopy of stars - Kim brings to the action a clean precision that sets it apart from Hollywoods noise-and-chaos norm. You can see the difference in that slick escape sequence; in a follow-up scene across a police roadblock; and especially in a unique car chase through a corn field - a Mustang races after the Corvette until hidden from each other by the tall stalks they stop to engage in a quiet cat-and-mouse game whereupon speeding gives way to loitering. The cliche gets a delightful twist.The result occasionally amusing sometimes entertaining. Which brings us to the subtext and to Arnie. Naturally (or unnaturally) no one will confuse his character for anyone but Arnie not with that facelift and permanent tan and ""Ahnode"" accent. From body-builder to Terminator to Governator Arnie has always played Arnie. The script does specify that the small-town sheriff was once a big-time cop in Los Angeles yet only so a winking Arnie can coyly warn ""L.A.s not all that you think it is."" Later when High Noon brings the confrontation with the Mexican-born drug lord Arnie is also heard to say ""You make us immigrants look bad."" Here the script doesnt even bother to explain the immigrant reference. Hey its Arnie we know already.And thats precisely when the subtext starts to resonate. Arnie come to America the Dream pursued is obviously the classic immigrants tale. Yet his realized Dream is classic not only in its success but also just as emphatically in its limitation. Ultimately for all his accomplishments Arnie remains the foreigner who can never quite melt into the melting pot. He earned riches and fame but only by staying within his assigned role - the robotic Teuton with a robots sense of humour. He married into American royalty the Kennedy clan where he pursued political office and other women exactly like the Kennedy men of yore - but unlike them paid a scandalous price. And like that other inferior actor he made it all the way to the California governors mansion - but unlike him couldnt even aspire to venture into the greatest and whitest house of all.There his American Dream was terminated a victim of the very birthplace that prompted it. The rest is denouement and thats where rather poignantly The Last Stand finds him - confessing to feeling ""old"" looking uninterested behind those squinty eyes a funny-sounding Gary Cooper meeting the enemy on an uncompleted bridge to nowhere. So at the climax standing at last not nearly so tall marooned in a nothing town on the border of his adopted country the immigrant cries out in his Ahnode accent ""This is my home"" But the cry like his tale cuts two ways After all these years and all those dollars and all that celebrity its an assertion that still sounds like a plea.

Because thats all The Last Stand has to offer. (LIONSGATE) Hollywood makes a lot of noise about gun violence. And then they go out and make something like ""The Last Stand"" the kind of bloody bullet-riddled movie even the NRA might shrink from. Mixing messages much? Its a trigger-happy story about a crazed drug lord rampaging his way across the Southwest with only an old sheriff and some hastily deputized civilians - a not-so-well-trained militia - there to stop him. Its a movie where the comic relief is provided by a manic gun nut with a warehouse crammed with ammunition and banned firearms (yes there are still actually a few). And hes one of the heroes. Everyone - even grandmothers at their knitting - has a weapon at the ready and most of it is played for laughs. Even scenes of people firing a powerfully lethal military-issue Vickers gun out of the back of a school bus. For a movie that was ballyhooed as Arnold Schwarzeneggers first lead in a decade would it have been so wrong for the studio to wait a little longer after what happened at Sandy Hook? Of course most action movies - with their narratives of invaded homes overwhelmed lawmen and civilian avengers with dead-eye marksmanship - naturally play to NRA talking points. Nothing new there. But having Johnny Knoxvilles firearm fanatic brag with a wink about how he illegally modified his guns Federal law be damned is something even the fiercest lobbyist might want to tone down these days. The extreme violence is a distraction because at its heart ""The Last Stand"" is as simple and familiar as a favorite cowboy film - particularly ""Rio Bravo"" the Howard Hawks classic that had John Wayne an old coot a drunk a green kid and a lovely lady trying hard to bring a well-connected criminal to justice. ""The Last Stand"" reprises that set-up with Schwarzenegger standing in for the Duke - pretty big boots to fill there -- Luis Guzman taking over Walter Brennans role as the aging grouch and the other parts filled with slight tweaks by Rodrigo Santoro Zach Gilford and Jaimie Alexander. Director Jee-woon Kim - whose eclectic previously all-Korean filmography includes the terrific scareshow ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" -- pours on the style too including lots of scenes of the kingpin racing his Corvette down the highway. But he cant disguise the fact that Schwarzenegger playing this seen-enough sheriff doesnt so much look world-weary as simply tired. Age has narrowed his eyes and thickened his accent; there were lines here even Werner Herzog would have strained to understand. Thick and wooden the star no longer strides; he lumbers. There are some nice touches visually including a car chase through a cornfield. And like several recent films - ""Jack Reacher"" ""Gangster Squad"" - the climax has our hero and villain leaving the guns out of it to finally go hand-to-hand as if to slightly make up for all the over-the-top firepower thats gone before. It doesnt. Although nothing is as crassly calculated as the films hastily shot prologue in which Schwarzenegger introduces the movie and salutes our armed forces as if this film were some sort of tribute to their sacrifice. Its not and the claim is a bait-and-switch and a cowardly distraction. Our men and women in uniform catch enough flak. They dont need movie stars hiding behind them too. Ratings note The film contains extreme violence gore and strong language. The Last Stand (R) Lionsgate (107 min.) Directed by Jee-woon Kim. With Arnold Schwarzenegger Johnny Knoxville.

Continuing the grand tradition of the Western -- and the current p.r. campaign of the NRA -- ""The Last Stand"" celebrates the philosophy that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to the big screen after taking an almost decade-long hiatus to govern California is small-town sheriff Ray Owens who thinks hes got a nice quiet weekend coming to him. Many of the locals are away at a football game and what could possibly happen in a sleepy enclave of stock characters like Sommerton? In the hands of Korean director Kim Jee-Woon (""The Good the Bad the Weird"") quite a lot of nastiness if not originality. Mexican drug kingpin Gabriel Cortez (an icy Eduardo Noriega) masterminds a jailbreak that sees him speeding toward the border in a Corvette ZR1 a car so cool it rivals Arnold as the real star of this picture. Hes got an FBI agent hostage (Genesis Rodriguez) at his side and the agency -- headed by Forest Whitaker -- is in hot pursuit. Preceding Cortezs arrival in Sommerton is a gang of apocalyptic henchmen headed by the reliably ominous Peter Stormare. They lay siege to local lawmen and force Ray and his deputies (Luis Guzman Jaimie Alexander Rodrigo Santoro Zach Gilford) to take -- you guessed it -- a last stand aided by Johnny Knoxville as a loonyantique-firearms collector. Arnold snapping back into action-hero mode with a leathery ease capably wields a gun and a lame one-liner just as if he never left. Shootout after shootout ensues with Sheriff Ray proving you dont need a fancy-pants automatic weapon to blow someones head apart like a ripe watermelon. Heres where ""The Last Stand"" departs from its Western influences; back in the day cowboys were bumped off in a relatively genteel manner. The firepower here whether its the high-tech weaponry of the drug cartel or Knoxvilles WWII tommy gun means nobody is simply shot -- theyre splattered disintegrated. One fleeing villains torso is blasted to smithereens leaving just his momentarily standing legs. Even a local granny gets in on the action whipping a shotgun out from behind her rocking chair to waste a Mexican intruder. ""Put the hurt on em"" she cackles at Ray. Sure violence in movies isnt violence in real life. And when you combine it with intelligent dialogue and pointed social commentary (a la ""Django Unchained"") it can be cathartic. But ""The Last Stand"" absent either of these things just seems to want to gin up a lot of high-fiving for a lot of shooting and right now is the least palatable time I can think of for that.

Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Genesis Rodriguez Jaimie Alexander Rodrigo Santoro Peter Stormare Forest Whitaker Luis Guzman Johnny Knoxville Zach Gilford Director Jee-woon Kim Running time 147 Release Opened Jan 18 2013  Editorial Review The Last Stand movie reviewBy Stephanie MerryFriday January 18 2013Given the aggressive predictability of ""The Last Stand"" Arnold Schwarzeneggers first starring vehicle in nearly a decade it would be fitting to begin this review with some derivative ""Ill be back"" joke. Thats the thing about this corpse pileup of an action movie. It persistently tries to drag the audience down to its mindless level. Schwarzenegger plays Summerton Junction Sheriff Ray Owens. His normally sleepy border town gets a jolt when a dangerous cartel boss escapes from custody in Las Vegas grabs a hostage and plans to cross into Mexico through Rays jurisdiction. Naturally the sheriff isnt going to sit by and watch as some criminal cuts a path through his turf and in a fancy Corvette no less. So Ray gathers a couple of inexperienced cops an ex-Marine-turned-thief and a loony gun enthusiast to block and apprehend the bloodthirsty psychopath. There are a few laughs along the way but the script-writing and filmmaking work toward the common goal of illustrating carnage in the most audacious ways imaginable. Bad guy Gabriel Cortez (played by the unintimidating Eduardo Noriega; the term ""girlie man"" comes to mind) may not stray from highways on his journey toward the border yet hes impossible to track and impervious to blockades. The unbelievable details dont matter when the movies main objective appears to be serving up the types of demises that elicit an ""ohhhhh"" or maybe an ""ewwww"" from the audience. Schwarzenegger is hardly renowned for his natural acting abilities but this role -- a role hes played again and again -- still seems like a burden for the former governor. Each syllable and facial expression comes across as strenuous heavy lifting. And whether its the middling script of halfhearted one-liners or the proximity to Arnold the other usually reliable actors get dragged down too. The talents of Forest Whitaker and Luis Guzman are wasted in the roles of a no-nonsense federal agent and a clown of a deputy respectively. Johnny Knoxville risks no such fate portraying the aforementioned weapons collector with a screw loose. Hes still the same old Jackass. He wanders around in his jammies sporting an earflap cap and vintage goggles and shooting a high-powered weapon at a hanging slab of meat. Its no fault of the movie but the timing couldnt be worse to make the films jester a character with more weapons than brain cells. There are a few heart-pounding car chases but no amount of adrenaline could prevail over the expository dialogue fetishistic attention to death and dismemberment and easily foreseen outcome. In fact the most exciting and unexpected twist during the movie may have been when an audience member decided to answer his cellphone. ""Are you serious?"" another moviegoer yelled. And for the first and only time during the film the tension in the room was palpable.Contains graphic bloody violence and crude language.

With his first produced screenplay writer Andrew Knauer has crafted an action-packed Western laced with comedic elements and propelled by a ticking-clock plot. For his first English-language production director Kim Jee-woon gets to flex his well-established genre-hopping muscles and for his first leading role in a decade Arnold Schwarzenegger is offered endless ammo and quips with which to maintain his superstar status. Im not entirely sure if the end result is quite what any or all of these men might have set out to make but its a sloppy bit of fun once it gets going situated well between both the best and worst that all involved have had to offer audiences. (Im giving Knauer the benefit of the doubt here.) The fairly rough-hewn Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owens sheriff of the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction Arizona whos alerted by FBI Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) as to the coming threat posed by fugitive Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega defined by bland swagger). The drug kingpin has a hostage and a souped-up Corvette at his disposal and with the help of some well-armed lackeys hes making a beeline from Vegas to the Mexican border. Cortez plan has already resulted in nearby bloodshed thanks to the hard-at-work henchmen led by Burrell (Peter Stormare) so Owens plans on doing his part to prevent this bad man from making it through their town backed only by his inexperienced deputies (Luis Guzman Zach Gilford Jaimie Alexander Rodrigo Santoro) and the local gun nut (Johnny Knoxville). The first half is burdened with no small amount of labored set-up mostly doled out through gritted teeth by Whitakers character as we wait for Owens and Cortez to actually come close enough to pose a physical threat to one another. The earlier action sequences are mostly defined by constant push-ins and the aggressive use of Dutch angles often leaving matters a hectic blur in contrast to the remarkable lucidity of the directors earlier work (""I Saw the Devil"" and ""The Good The Bad The Weird"" in particular). In the meantime old flames talk to one another as if its common to rehash one anothers entire backgrounds despite years of assumed familiarity while Guzman Gildford and Knoxville bumble around in the margins. Things bounce back in the films second half which opts for a little less conversation a little more action and proceeds to interpret classic Westerns like ""High Noon"" and ""Rio Bravo"" in the vein of proudly cartoonish violence. Knoxville gets to imitate ""Weirds"" buffoonish bandit Stormares accent selector goes on the fritz and Arnie ensures that baddies get blown up real good. Plenty of lip service is paid to his characters past as an LA narcotics officer but Schwarzenegger knows how to take down thugs and bear the weight of age with equal ease. This isnt his ""Unforgiven"" but it isnt trying to be and God knows that his stiff delivery still cant salvage the worst one-liners. The bloodshed speaks volumes enough though even if it takes some time getting to the mayhem proper. ""The Last Stand"" may not be the glorious comeback project for its star or worthy crossover effort by its director that fans may have hoped for but at the end of the day -- and in the dead of winter -- at least it does what it says on the tin.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 109am on Friday Jan. 18 2013 Friday Jan. 18 2013 Thursday Jan. 17 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The question to be asked with The Last Stand Arnold Schwarzeneggers first return to the big screen (not counting The Expendables 2) after being the governor of California and causing a messy marital scandal is this Does he pick up where he left off as an action hero or is it an embarrassment hurtling him down the road to cinematic obsolescence?The answer falls somewhere squarely in the middle. For sure The Last Stand is no Terminator but it is a fun if predictable action-thriller that has no problem gently mocking his age -- hes 66 -- while simultaneously having him bring down the worlds most dangerous drug-cartel kingpin.Schwarzenegger is Sheriff Ray Owens who presides over his small sun-baked Arizona border town like a caring dad. So when it seems most of the city takes off for a high-school football game Owens is expecting a quiet weekend leaving what little there is to do to his good-hearted but inexperienced deputies work-shy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman) newbie Jerry Bailey (Zach Gilford Friday Night Lights) and no-nonsense Sarah Torrance (former Colleyville Heritage High School student Jaimie Alexander).Little does he know that miles away in Las Vegas Mexican gangster Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has made a daring highly choreographed escape from federal custody. He and his crew are on the lam in a modified Corvette ZR1 reaching speeds of nearly 200 mph as they race toward the border. Cortez plans to smuggle himself back into Mexico over a secret bridge that his associates have been constructing near Owens town.Angry federal agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) who seems to have had a long obsession with capturing the slippery Cortez calls ahead to warn Owens that the dangerous felon is headed his way. So its up to Owens and his ragtag team of law enforcement -- which also includes well-armed town eccentric and comedic relief Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) and boozer Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro) the only occupant in the towns tiny jail -- to keep Cortez from making his escape to Mexican soil.South Korean director Jee-woon Kim (The Good The Bad the Weird; I Saw the Devil) working from a script by Andrew Knauer Jeffrey Nachmanoff and George Nolfi keeps things moving quickly and displays a keen visual eye in his Hollywood debut. The car chase through a cornfield near the end is a nice touch.That helps distract viewers from the storys outbursts of illogic. (No one knows that a large bridge not hidden by foliage and easily seen from the air is being built near their town? Really?)Certainly Schwarzenegger moves a bit slower than he used to. There are a couple of moments when you can almost hear his bones creaking.But he can still deliver a beatdown to the bad guys with the best of them. And thats the main thing anyone going to see this film cares about. With Terminator 5 announced and a fleet of other Schwarzenegger movies in the pipeline those afraid that this indeed would be Arnolds last stand can breathe a sigh of relief.Hell be back.

Credit Merrick Morton/Lionsgate During a delicious 60 seconds or so in Arnold Schwarzeneggers new movie ""The Last Stand"" two bad guys are dispatched to their eternal punishment in memorable fashion. It may say something about Mr. Schwarzeneggers post-gubernatorial future in action movies that he is not the trigger man in either killing.""The Last Stand"" gives Mr. Schwarzenegger his first major role since he left the California governorship and sure he fires some guns and gets a few of those Schwarzenegger one-liners (though none likely to achieve the catchphrase status of ""Ill be back""). But other heroics are parceled out to a supporting cast that includes Luis Guzman Jaimie Alexander and Johnny Knoxville. At 65 Mr. Schwarzenegger can no longer be expected to do it all.Here he plays the sheriff of a small town on the Mexico border an ill-fitting role. Sorry big guy but making small talk with the locals at the diner just isnt you.The sheriff and his deputies have to stop a drug lord who has engineered a particularly improbable escape from custody and is headed for the border in a supercharged Corvette. The South Korean director Kim Jee-woon fails to dazzle with the endless speeding-car sequences but that 60-second flourish during a lengthy firefight is almost worth the tedium.""The Last Stand"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for blood violence and unsafe driving.

Wheres the Fire Coming From? Credit Lionsgate He has repeated the catchphrase over and over again though he really had to say it only once No one ever doubted for a minute that Arnold Schwarzenegger wouldnt be back. How you feel about the hit-or-miss neo-spaghetti-Western The Last Stand may depend on how much you really missed Schwarzenegger while he was taking time off from acting to serve two terms as governor of California. As Ray Owens the sheriff of tiny sleepy Sommerton Junction Schwarzenegger looks kind of OK with a deep Coppertone tan and hedgehog hairdo. Owens used to be a Los Angeles police narcotics guy but a botched operation left him yearning for a quieter life which is why hes retreated to this dusty little border town some 200 miles outside Las Vegas. Now as he learns from a know-it-all FBI agent played by Forest Whitaker an escaped fugitive named Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) is headed his way. At first Owens is mildly indifferent; then he realizes he must protect the townspeople particularly since Cortez has sent an advance team of baddies led by a dyspeptic-looking Peter Stormare to clear the path for his arrival. Monkey See Twenty Villains Arnold Schwarzenegger Should Fight In The Governator Author Interviews Schwarzeneggers Total Recall Of His Life So Far When Owens finally leaps into action he has help from among others a lackadaisical deputy (played with laid-back elan by Luis Guzman) and the half-witted proprietor of a makeshift firearms museum (Johnny Knoxville who clad in pajamas and a pointed medieval warriors helmet resembles a maniacal militant elf). Schwarzenegger still looks robust but he isnt as efficient in the ass-kicking department as he was 30 years ago and the script -- written by Andrew Knauer Jeffrey Nachmanoff and George Nolfi -- reflects that. ""How are you Sheriff?"" one guy asks after seeing Owens take a particularly jarring tumble. ""Old"" Owens replies with more than a hint of resignation. Hey it happens to the best of us. i Sheriffs deputy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman) is Schwarzeneggers laid-back comrade in arms in the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction. Tony Rivetti Jr./Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Tony Rivetti Jr./Lionsgate Sheriffs deputy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman) is Schwarzeneggers laid-back comrade in arms in the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction. Tony Rivetti Jr./Lionsgate Schwarzenegger is the big draw here and he seems to be having a reasonably good time getting roughed up here and there and putting his trademark ""What me worry?"" line delivery to use. (His scenes with the eternal goofball Knoxville are the nuttiest and perhaps the best.) The Last Stand was directed by Korean cult-favorite filmmaker Kim Jee-woon whose previous pictures include the rambunctious 2008 noodle Western The Good the Bad the Weird and from 2003 A Tale of Two Sisters a dreamy enigmatic bit of free-verse horror. The Last Stand isnt as effective as either of those movies. Its attempts at violent humor are scattershot though occasionally Jee-woon and his actors hit the mark. (The sight of crazy old Knoxville using a flare gun as an assault weapon works like a charm for instance.) But most of the action sequences are indistinctly shot and choppily edited; they flip by in a blur of noise. The director does pull off a pretty magnificent cornfield car chase -- two sleek vehicles cut through a thick shaggy carpet of maize like souped-up harvesters the movies way of saying that the simple country life neednt be devoid of thrills. But Jee-woon takes too long to wrap things up fumbling repeatedly on his way to an ending. By the end even Schwarzenegger looks worn out. Maybe being governor wasnt such a hard job after all.

A drug cartel leader busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border where the only thing in his path is a sheriff (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his inexperienced staff. (Photo/Video Lionsgate) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 17 2013 612 p.m. ET First he was the Terminator then the Governator. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has cast himself as the Rejuvenator breathing huffs and puffs of new life into his screen career. Much of ""The Last Stand"" is a wheezy setup for an enjoyably preposterous showdown in a sleepy Arizona border town called Sommerton Junction. Thats where the sheriff Mr. Schwarzeneggers Ray Owens represents this nations last hope of stopping its most-wanted fugitive a Mexican drug-cartel kingpin who is driving toward the border at barely subsonic speeds. The main source of dramatic energy is the fugitives ride a modified Corvette with a 1000-horsepower engine. Still the movie comes up with a couple of tender moments that could pass for human and a mano-a-mano climax in which the superhero of yore the glint in his eye dulled but not extinguished functions as a weirdly touching tyrannosaurus. ENLARGE Arnold Schwarzenegger Lionsgate In celebration of Arnold Schwarzeneggers return to the big screen in a starring role with Lionsgates ""The Last Stand"" here are some of our favorite Arnold one-liners from over the years. (Photo Columbia Pictures) The best way to see this munitions-intensive action adventure if you must see it at all is in the context of a shrewd commercial enterprise. The production is far from lavish. Sequences play out in sub-TV settings; even Las Vegas where the villain Gabriel Cortez ( Eduardo Noriega) escapes from his FBI captors has more than its share of empty streets and blank walls. That said the action component pays off with ritual car chases (in the context of product placements they come down to the black Vette versus a red Chevy Camaro); heavy weaponry such as a World War II Vickers machine gun from a historical-weapons museum that happens to be situated in Sommerton Junctions sandy outskirts and a reasonably buoyant spirit that pits the drug lord Goliath with his small army of tactical support troops against Mr. Schwarzeneggers long-in-the-tooth David. ""The Last Stand"" marks the English-language debut of the Korean director Kim Jee-woon whose eye for graphic action is more reliable than his ear for English nuance; the ponderous pacing of dialogue scenes and the frequency of barely audible lines suggest that the actors were on their own. But the movie isnt about eloquence its about giving Mr. Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age. Johnny Knoxville is likable as the goofy proprietor of the weapons museum and the script provides such agreeably sententious nonsense as the kingpins comment to a terrified hostage in the passenger seat when he puts the Corvettes pedal to the metal. ""Death"" he tells her ""is waiting in the kitchen when you get up at night for a glass of milk."" Watch a clip from the film ""Mama."" Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years. But how alone were they? (Photo/Video Universal) Mama The Mama of this supernatural thriller is not your average nurturer while ""Mama"" itself is above average as a piece of filmmaking even if its scare quotient is middling or below. Thats OK with me. I was content to be impressed by the skill of the first-time director Andres Muschietti; absorbed by the performances and smitten by some startling images. Its also OK that several characters keep asking one another if theyre OK. This gets to be a running gag in a film where no one is OK for a single moment--not young Victoria or younger Lilly two feral sisters who may have spent the last five years alone in a cabin in the woods; not their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who must now help care for them and certainly not Lucass wife Annabel a Goth rocker who becomes the childrens primary caregiver then finds herself engulfed by gothic horror. ENLARGE Megan Charpentier Universal Pictures ENLARGE Jessica Chastain Universal Pictures Annabel is played by Jessica Chastain though you might not know it at first thanks to her mop of black hair and abundant tattoos. Its no stretch to see a commonality between this no-nonsense bass player and Maya Ms. Chastains CIA operative in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Like Maya Annabel combines fear with steely courage. She needs as much of the latter as she can summon up when Megan Charpentiers Victoria wide eyes peering out from behind wire spectacles and Isabelle Nelisses Lilly scuttling around on all fours turn out to have some sort of protean and wildly possessive guardian they choose to call Mama. ""Mama"" was produced by Guillermo del Toro the masterly Mexican director of such action fantasies as ""Mimic"" ""Hellboy"" and the memorably lyrical ""Pans Labyrinth."" This films Argentine director Mr. Muschietti wrote the script with his sister Barbara and Neil Cross; its an expansion of a surreal short that can be seen on YouTube. At times Mr. Muschietti seems to be the cinematic equivalent of an art student learning from the masters by copying them. Many of his tropes will be familiar to Mr. del Toros fans of whom I am one the difference being that the storytelling here can be confusing and the supernatural threat manifests itself in so many differing forms as to be diffuse and in horror terms defused. All the same ""Mama"" announces the arrival of a director who works unusually well with actors--the two children are truly scary--and who creates highly charged environments effective sound designs and powerful fantasy sequences. One irresistible parallel is not to Mr. del Toros work but to Francois Truffauts transcendently beautiful ""The Wild Child"" in which Truffaut himself played Dr. Itard the physician who undertook to civilize a feral boy discovered in the forests of 18th-century France. The doctor in ""Mama"" played by Daniel Kash is a psychologist and a shameless hustler. Academics can be feral too. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Broken City."" Ex-cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) seeks redemption and revenge after being double-crossed and then framed by its most powerful figure Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe). (Photo/Video Fox) Broken City Theres no joy in the city of the title which isnt Mudville but a contemporary version of Sam Spades Manhattan tainted by the moral murk of Gotham City. The only reason to see this dreary parade of deception and venality is Mark Wahlbergs performance as a disgraced ex-cop caught up in the thick of menacing events he cant understand. Its striking how this tightly focused actor can find his own firmly grounded reality in the falsest of surroundings. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg Twentieth Century Fox The film was directed lugubriously by Allen Hughes from a script that Brian Tucker recycled from livelier sources--the films of Sidney Lumet leap to mind. Mr. Wahlbergs Billy Taggart now a private eye struggling to make a living is retained by Mayor Hostetler a smug popinjay played by Russell Crowe. Billys task is to find out who the mayors wife Cathleen is sleeping with; shes played by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems slightly disconsolate and no wonder. But Billys fate is to be used and confused by everyone around him including the citys police commissioner Carl Fairbanks; hes played by Jeffrey Wright who gives his character a nicely menacing ambiguity. The only source of genuine vitality is Alona Tal bright and appealing in the role of Billys adoring secretary and ad hoc bookkeeper. But Ms. Tals role lies between small and tiny and a whole chunk of it is devoted to a discussion of accounts receivable. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Warner Bros./Everett Collection Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003) Arnold Schwarzeneggers guardian robot is back with his vast chest and freeze-dried visage to protect mankinds young savior-to-be John Connor who is played in this go-round by Nick Stahl. This Terminator lets it be known that hes an obsolete design. Kristanna Lokens killer robot T-X is not obsolete; shes drop-dead beautiful and mesmerizing. And so in her way is Claire Danes as Johns reluctant accomplice a veterinarian named Kate Brewster. ""T3"" was directed not by James Cameron but by Jonathan Mostow. While it lacks the elegance of its predecessors its an efficient entertainment at the very least. ENLARGE The Devils Backbone The Devils Backbone (2001) Of the many striking images in Guillermo del Toros dark and absorbing horror film the most memorable is the starkest--an unexploded bomb that stands like the black slab in ""2001"" in the arid courtyard of a Spanish orphanage. The time is the late 1930s. Inside the orphanage which shelters children of Republican fighters and politicians the pale ghost of a young student named Santi wanders the grounds. Outside civil war rages; thats a horror story in itself. This is a horror flick that also functions as an allegory of the war that still haunts Spain eight decades later. ENLARGE Three Kings Three Kings (1999) With Mark Wahlberg making ""Broken City"" look better than it is and David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" up for multiple Oscars the time has come to remind you once again of Mr. Russells action adventure set in the poisonous aftermath of the first Gulf War. A visionary film that leaves you elated and agog its pandemonium with a moral purpose. Mr. Wahlberg is Sgt. Troy Barlow one of three soldiers enlisted by George Clooneys Capt. Archie Gates to liberate tons of gold bullion stolen from Kuwait. The other two are played con brio by Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. --J.M.

Rated R (strong violence language) BOTTOM LINE Plenty of bullets and bloodshed in Arnolds new flick but the star looks rusty and the shtick feels creaky. If this is a test drive for a comeback it barely crosses the finish line. CAST Arnold Schwarzenegger Johnny Knoxville Jaimie Alexander LENGTH 147 ""The Last Stand"" Arnold Schwarzeneggers first star vehicle in more than a decade is not a sci-fi film though it does travel back in time. Not to the 1980s as you might expect but to the decade before when muscle cars and them Duke boys ruled popular culture. If this rubber-burnin action-comedy featured a theme song by Jerry Reed youd swear it was made in 1977. Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens a former LAPD hotshot now minding the sleepy town of Summerton Junction Ariz. ""Should be a quiet weekend"" he muses aloud but no The wanted drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) is racing his ghost-gray Corvette ZR1 (the films real star) toward Summerton on his way to the Mexican border. Most Popular Opinion Ive run the numbers. Donald Trump will win Cops 1 killed 1 hurt after being hit by van Sources Mets pushing for Lucroy Smith Cops Mans body found after fatal stabbing Man gets life without parole in Goode murder Not bad for a cheapo plotline but Andrew Knauers script restricts Schwarzenegger mostly to talking tough while girding for a final-act showdown. Maybe thats intentional. Schwarzenegger 65 looks slow and rusty and his face once so elastic and expressive is nearly immobile. Much of the action is handled by others primarily Jaimie Alexander and Luis Guzman as loyal lawmen Rodrigo Santoro as a good-hearted Marine and Peter Stormare as an oily-haired henchman. Theyre younger and nimbler than Schwarzenegger but also pretty dull. Only Johnny Knoxville surprisingly good as the trigger-happy Lewis Dinkum and Forest Whitaker as a hot-tempered FBI agent are any fun to watch. South Korean director KIM Jee-woon (""The Good the Bad the Weird"") making his first English-language feature busily cooks up an Americana stew of car flick Western and high-tech thriller with some satisfying vehicular crunch and bloody gunplay. But theres no distracting us from Schwarzeneggers diminished physicality. This wont be the stars last stand -- his duet with Sylvester Stallone ""The Tomb"" comes out in September -- but its a disappointing comeback.

(Merrick Morton / Lionsgate )Casting the former governor of California as a small-town sheriff squaring off against a drug lord ""The Last Stand"" puts Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the saddle as an action movie hero. But dont expect any winking nods to his years in public office a this freewheeling vehicle is strictly concerned with cars firepower and massive explosions.Johnny Knoxville offers comic relief as the goofball proprietor of a back-road gun museum which conveniently allows for an odd assortment of weapons to be used in the climactic battle.Its that kind of movie.PHOTOS Schwarzeneggers many sides The good the bad the bad-assSchwarzenegger plays Ray Owens a former L.A. cop who left the big city for a sleepy Arizona border town where nothing ever happens. That is until a drug lord (Eduardo Noriega) slips free from a federal agent (Forest Whitaker) in a stolen custom muscle car with only Arnold standing between him and escape to Mexico.Luis Guzman plays a bumbling deputy Peter Stormare the main henchman and the mighty Harry Dean Stanton has a brief appearance as a crotchety local.""The Last Stand"" marks the English-language debut of Korean director Kim Jee-Woon. Kims sensibility pulses through the film though its toned down from his cult western ""The Good the Bad the Weird"" and certainly not as twisted and gruesome as his revenge thriller ""I Saw the Devil.""INTERACTIVE 80s action heroes reloadKim isnt afraid to balance the action with eccentric humor a muscle cars barrel through a cornfield Main Street becomes a Looney Tunes battleground and a loading-weapons montage is played for cheeky laughs. The obligatory ""Arnold is old"" gags are kept to a minimum.""The Last Stand"" may not herald a full-scale reemergence for Arnold the Action Star but its clearly a step in that direction.In an age when even comic book adaptations have a dour seriousness about them this is a movie content with just being good old-fashioned fun.mark.olsenlatimes.comThe Last StandMPAA rating R for strong bloody violence throughout and languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesPlaying In general release MORE FROM HERO COMPLEX HERO COMPLEX Pop culture unmasked PHOTOS 60 images from The Hobbit VIDEO GAMES The latest news and reviews MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSix years later Californias priority is still jobsJanuary 10 2010Mixed Reviews for Governors CommentJuly 20 2004MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowArnold SchwarzeneggerNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-last-stand-review-arnold-schwarzenegger-20130118,0,1626937.story",200,thelaststand20,thelaststand,latimes

True to his word after two terms as the governor of California the Austrian body-builder-turned-action-hero-turned-cigar-chompin pol has returned to the screen first in the senior citizen smash-em-up ensemble Expendables franchise and now as the hero of The Last Stand a modern-day western in which the Governator stars as a small-town sheriff. More about The Last Stand >> A small-town sheriff who sports Topsiders a leathery tan and a Styrian accent and who brings his experience as a former LAPD narcotics officer to bear on the population of sleepy Sommerton Junction an Arizona burg where everybody knows everybody and the sheriffs deputies are so bored theyre out at Johnny Knoxvilles place shooting slabs of meat for fun. (The Jackass star inexplicably shares top billing even though hes around only to provide intermittent slapstick relief.) But when a notorious Mexican drug cartel king (Eduardo Noriega) escapes from federal custody and aims his Corvette ZR1 straight for the border and straight through Sommerton Junction Sheriff Ray Owens isnt going to let him get by. Round up the bumbling deputies (Luis Guzman Zach Gilford Jaimie Alexander) pull out the vintage weaponry (Knoxvilles doofus is a firearms fetishist) and lets stop this hombre. Directed by Kim Jee-woon the South Korean hitmaker making his U.S. debut The Last Stand allows Schwarzenegger and company plenty of time to exhange pleasantries and the occasional profundity (""Death is waiting for you in the kitchen when you get up in the middle of the night for a glass of milk"" - really). But the director and his stunt team get down to business with the chases and the shootouts police cars arcing into the air in fiery crashes high-speed pursuits down blacktop and through crop fields and Schwarzenegger breaking out his shotgun to blast away an army of henchmen. Forest Whitaker plays the FBI agent busy barking orders and arriving a couple of minutes too late to do any good. Of course hes skeptical about this bumpkin lawman at the outset and of course hes thoroughly impressed by the end. Almost certainly The Last Stand will not be Schwarzeneggers last. For better or for worse (and this is somewhere right in the middle) he is back. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Last Stand The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-stand-the ) Last Stand The (United States 2013) January 17 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Old action heroes dont die or fade away; they just keep going. Once upon a time being an action star had an expiration date. Now as long as theres some acknowledgment of the aging process - a line here a joke there - its viewed as more of an inconvenience than a career-ending condition. As a result big names from the 80s and 90s like Schwarzenegger Stallone and Willis have thriving action careers two decades past their expected ""sell by"" dates. Granted theyre not the surefire box office draws they were in their heydays but a select group of people (probably those who were teenage boys in the 80s) still buy tickets to see these guys. And the fascination with AARP-eligible action heroes explains the success of movies like The Expendables (and its sequel) and Red (which is getting a sequel of its own). Aside from cameos Schwarzenegger hasnt made a movie in ten years. His decade in politics has left its mark on his reputation and career and despite the expert work of makeup artists he looks more grizzled than chiseled. His acting skills havent noticeably improved but no one ever went to a Schwarzenegger movie expecting Oscar-caliber performances. Schwarzenegger has always loitered in the popcorn-munching section of the multiplex and theres no reason to expect that to change now even with the man in his mid-60s. Indeed now that the political phase of his life is in the rearview mirror hes making up for lost time in front of the cameras with no fewer than ten movies in the can in progress or on the drawing board. In many ways The Last Stand feels a little like vintage middle-of-the-road Schwarzenegger. Its a little more jokey and has a stronger comedic flavor than many of his best-remembered efforts; the recipe has been tweaked not overhauled. There are numerous instances of physicality including a ludicrous climactic fight scene but theres a tongue-in-cheek element to these typically accompanied by some kind of reference to Schwarzeneggers age. On more than one occasion he hefts and fires big guns; those are the scenes when viewers are most likely to flashback twenty years. He even gets to utter his trademark line although it like everything else is a little different. When he says ""Iall be right back"" it isnt italicized. The film directed by South Korean Jee-woon Kim hits all the necessary action beats and effectively blends in the humor. The narrative serves the expected purpose of giving Schwarzenegger the opportunity to fire a few guns engage in what looks like a WWE smackdown and utter a few underwhelming one-liners. (Does anyone expect ""Im the sheriff"" to replace ""Hasta la vista baby"" in the Schwarzenegger lexicon?) Its a solid way to re-introduce Arnold to multiplex audiences but one hopes for better things to come. Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owens the sheriff of Sommerton a small town on the Arizona/Mexico border. Ray formerly an elite cop in L.A. came to this out-of-the-way hamlet to wind down without officially retiring but trouble has a way of finding such men when theyre portrayed by Schwarzenegger. In this case the problem is a Mexican drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) who escapes from custody and driving a souped-up Corvette 01 rockets toward Sommerton and the border crossing. After defeating every pursuit vehicle and road block thrown at him by the Feds Cortez thinks hes home free. But his henchman Burrell (Peter Stormare) isnt the only one waiting for him in Sommerton. Sheriff Owens has put together a small team to meet the oncoming storm. In an attempt to broaden The Last Stands appeal beyond Schwarzenegger fans and old-school action film junkies the producers cast the net far and wide when hiring the supporting actors. Johnny Knoxville Jaimie Alexander and Luis Guzman play members of Rays team. Eduardo Noriega brings a certain nasty charm to his part and Peter Stormare accomplishes what Peter Stormare does best - the creepy conscience-free psycho. Despite getting ""co-billing"" with Schwarzenegger Knoxville doesnt have a very large part - in fact hes not on screen long enough to wear out his welcome. As action films go this is a fair-to-middling effort notable almost exclusively for being Schwarzeneggers comeback vehicle. The humor keeps it from becoming completely generic but theres still nothing of particular interest here. Expectations are also key - those who anticipate Schwarzenegger to be the badass of 30 years ago are going to be disappointed. Hes a dinosaur but that works for him because he acknowledges it and soldiers on nonetheless. Put another actor in the part however and this would be headed straight to home video. When one considers movies featuring macho men coming to terms with aging and mortality on screen no two have done it better than John Wayne in The Shootist and Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven. There may be a little of that here but only a little. Instead of this being a farewell its Schwarzenggers fulfillment of his oft-repeated promise hes back. The questions that The Last Stand only begins to answer are what that actually means and whether audiences will care.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune January 18 2013 -- 1039am Handout Mct Forest Whitaker left and Arnold Schwarzenegger star in ""The Last Stand."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Last Stand"" is an unpretentious invigorating action flick thats extra-enjoyable whenever Arnold Schwarzenegger is on the screen demonstrating his flair for self-parody. Its made with a bright quick fresh touch by the Korean Kim Jee-Woon (""The Good the Bad the Weird"") whose scalawag humor and Spielbergian knack for staging imaginative action scenes earned him the chance to direct Schwarzeneggers comeback film. Its a gleefully audacious visceral shoot-em-up that shines a bit brighter arriving in the slow-movie month of January. In sleepy Somerton Junction Ariz. Sheriff Ray Owens (Schwarzenegger) a onetime L.A. vice cop directs a three-person team whose idea of excitement is rescuing the occasional kitten up a tree. Its an easygoing life but trouble is headed their way at 200 miles per hour. A murderous drug kingpin has escaped the FBI and is rocketing south in a supercharged sports car with an advance contingent of thugs at the border town to facilitate his escape to Mexico. With the feds always several steps behind its up to the old lawman and his motley crew of deputies (plus a gonzo gun nut played by Johnny Knoxville and a jailhouse prisoner played by Rodrigo Santoro) to save the day. Its simple foolproof movie material and Kim paces the film expertly spoon-feeding just enough backstory and character points to make us care about the good guys. Schwarzeneggers spare acting works well for a role that is perfectly in his range. The bad guys Eduardo Noriega as the drug kingpin and Peter Stormare as his chief henchman are odious in distinctive ways while Forest Whitaker humanizes his role as the FBI team leader. Screenwriter Andrew Knauer wisely clears the battlefield sending almost the entire population of this sunbaked Podunk to a neighboring town for a big high-school football game so when the inevitable firefights begin there wont be any innocent bystanders in peril. When were settled in and emotionally invested the film kicks into higher gear with muscular kinetic action sequences. The violence is electrifying and excessive but sanitized -- often cheerful. Much of the bloodletting is staged for crowd-pleasing burlesque humor. The crimson splatter is as graceful as calligraphy. There are plenty of casualties yet hardly any sustained suffering. THE LAST STAND  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating R for bloody violence throughout and for language. Its not all action-movie excess though. Theres no fat on this movie yet not all the interesting edges have been shaved off. Theres a fine comic set-piece involving Knoxville in a ""Jackass""-style stunt with a light pole and a tense game of automotive hide-and-seek set in a corn field that Hitchcock would admire. As Arnolds return to the screen and Kims American debut this is a big audience win-win. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Silly I know Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Arnold Schwarzenegger California Movies The Last Stand Entertainment News Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""The Last Stand"" So I just saw the latest Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ""The Last Stand"" in which the 65-year-old one-time bodybuilding champ tries to stage yet another messy jokey meta-style comeback. This is a role very much in the mode of Clint Eastwood or Sylvester Stallone - in fact I kept thinking that Eastwood must have made this film sometime around 1997 - with Schwarzenegger playing a small-town Arizona sheriff forced to go mano a mano under exceptionally unlikely circumstances with an escaped Mexican drug lord. Its one of those mixed-up Hollywood pictures that has too much going on It tries to protect the action-hero status of its visibly enfeebled star and it has Johnny Knoxville of ""Jackass"" in a moronic supporting role and the story doesnt make any sense and its the American debut of whiz-kid Korean action filmmaker Kim Jee-woon (for you film-festival geeks he made ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""The Good the Bad the Weird"").So to call this a good movie is really a stretch; its more like 38 percent of a good movie. But it probably has just enough dumb fun and pointless violence and car chases to seem like a highly viable option for large numbers of people this weekend. Anyway by this point Schwarzenegger is like an old friend whos run a bit to seed and who can resist that? If anything his acting has gotten worse which may have to do with whatever work hes had done on that big Austrian rural rock formation he calls a face. He obviously isnt quite the imposing physical specimen he used to be has had some health problems and doesnt look all that great. But you know exactly what youre going to get with Arnold which is ass-kicking one-liners and a general lack of self-seriousness. Wherever and however he learned it Schwarzenegger has always had a genial arrogance that audiences eat up Hes gettin paid he hopes were having fun and he feels no need to pretend that its art.Then I went home and had the weirdest dream I dreamed that Schwarzenegger of all showbiz people had bailed out of his fading Hollywood career and gone into politics during the nitrous-oxide boom years of the Bush administration. I know this sounds nuts but in my dream he actually got elected governor of California twice the first time in a crazy special election that cost the taxpayers of that perennially strapped state tons of extra money. Heres the part of my dream that was weirdly almost like reality While Schwarzenegger remained personally popular as governor his attempts to enact a right-wing agenda totally failed and he ended up as a bland bipartisan administrator with a failing marriage who was diminished and defeated by the inexorable realities of politics no more able to prevail over lobbyists and entrenched interests and legislative gridlock than anybody else. He actually wound up being replaced -- in my dream of course -- by Jerry Brown the one-time Governor Moonbeam of my California childhood. (I was actually Browns editor for a little while when he wrote an opinion column for Spin magazine in the late 90s and that was kind of weird I can tell you. But I digress) You Might Also Like If this bizarre fantasy were actually real instead of my brains response to a late-night hamburger and that second can of Genesee Cream Ale it would make the Arnold Schwarzenegger of 2013 a strange and pathetic figure with his political career over and his days of box-office supremacy long in the past. ""The Last Stand"" really isnt much of a movie with its rote supporting roles for Forest Whitaker (as an FBI honcho) Eduardo Noriega (as the sinister Sinaloa mobster behind the wheel of a souped-up Corvette show car) and Luis Guzman (as Arnolds lovable but hapless sidekick). But Schwarzeneggers resolute performance in its capable shoot-em-up scenes embody the wizened third-act-of-life defiance that Americans always love. (You just watch Freakin Lance Armstrong the lying-est cheater of all time is gonna be dispensing sage advice to young people on TV inside of a year.) Its almost as if a titanic unstoppable wave of celebritude had crested broken and receded leaving behind a cheerful elderly Austrian muscleman to make B-grade action movies for people to watch in January.

Share Tweet Korean director Kim Ji-woon is among the most gifted versatile genre stylists in the world with a wrestling comedy (The Foul King) an idiosyncratic horror melodrama (A Tale Of Two Sisters) a spaghetti Western/comedy (The Good The Bad The Weird) and a serial-killer thriller (I Saw The Devil) to his credit. But the Hollywood system has a way of chewing up foreign filmmakers even those like Kim who speak the language of Western cinema fluently. The Last Stand bears the additional freight of being Arnold Schwarzeneggers first true starring vehicle since his two-term misadventure as governor of California so Kim has to serve the aging icon as much as he can serve his sensibility. Its a struggle at times mostly because the action-movie cliches havent been weeded out of the script but the film is cheerfully irresistibly destructive--an old-fashioned Rio Bravo shoot-em-up with the hicktown spirit of Tremors though it isnt as good as either. The warmed-over redemption story casts Schwarzenegger as a disgraced LAPD officer who takes a job as sheriff in a sleepy border town where he hopes to forget a botched operation. Keeping the peace in Sommerton Junction isnt much work for this overqualified lawman but when a notorious drug kingpin (Eduardo Noriega) escapes from an FBI convoy and starts barreling toward Mexico at 200 mph Schwarzenegger is called back into action. With just a few other woefully inexperienced deputies--including a prisoner (Rodrigo Santoro) and a local gun hoarder (Johnny Knoxville) granted a temporary badge--Schwarzenegger tries to fend off the kingpins army of mercenaries (led by a hilariously accented Peter Stormare) and keep him from slipping across the border. Apart from a witty opening scene that doubles as a callback to I Saw The Devil The Last Stand has trouble finding its groove in the early going as it splits its time between generic FBI guys (led by Forest Whitaker) and the quirkier denizens of Sommerton Junction. Once trouble finally comes to town however Kim unleashes a squib-exploding bonanza of violence thats complimented by a lightness of spirit from good guy and bad guy alike. Though Schwarzenegger keeps the groaning one-liners to a minimum the film primarily aims to please Redemption setup aside The Last Stand doesnt take itself too seriously. It scores laughs from its goofy trigger-happy characters in the breaks between Kims thrilling flourishes of visual invention. For a lumbering old star like Schwarzenegger with an image tarnished by his time in public service it serves as a generous act of career resuscitation.

"The Last Stand review He promised hed be back | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Stand review He promised hed be backUltra-violent western The Last Stand has the mild novelty of being the first movie starring Arnold Schwarznegger since he stopped being governor.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rodrigo Santoro in The Last Stand.  (Merrick Morton / Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 17 2013The Last StandStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger Forest Whitaker Eduardo Noriega Johnny Knoxville Rodrigo Santoro and Luis Guzman. Directed by Jee-woon Kim. 107 minutes. Opens Jan. 18 at major theatres. 14AFor some bizarre reason the ultra-violent shoot em up The Last Stand has an onscreen timeline. All we really need is a calendar indicating that the month is January.This is the time of the year when under-nourished genre movies and other films that are not being remotely considered for Oscars are dumped upon a slumbering populace.Article Continued BelowThe Last Stand certainly fits the bill. It also has the mild novelty of being the first movie starring Arnold Schwarznegger (if you dont count his ensemble work in The Expendables 2) since he returned to acting after fulfilling his other Hollywood duties as governor of California.It remains to be seen whether Ah-nolds fans will welcome him back but time has not been kind either to him or his character Sheriff Roy Owens. Hes moving visibly slower than before and he never was exactly greased lightning. Schwarzenegger doesnt just telegraph his punches; he sends them via Pony Express. When he moves in close to examine a corpse he has to wear reading glasses.But he still commands the frame and his Sheriff Owens makes for an interesting cat in a film directed by Korean genre technician Jee-woon Kim (The Good the Bad the Weird) thats like a cross between High Noon and a Batman knock-off.Owens has retired from the LAPD after a nasty bit of business. He goes looking for quieter police work and ends up in Sommerton Junction a place on the Arizona-Mexico border that you could call a one-horse town if anybody bothered to get the horse. But theres certainly no shortage of guns and ammo. Even the grannies are packing heat and one guy -- gun nut Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) -- has such an array of lethal firepower he could send Dirty Harry crying for his mommy.Its all going to be needed and very soon because psychopathic druglord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) is heading their way in a souped-up Corvette that can exceed 200 mph.Hes being pursed by dogged FBI agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) whose people ineptly allowed Cortez to be busted out of a maximum security prison. Bannister cant do much on the road because Cortez has a hostage comely FBI agent Ellen Richards (Genesis Rodriguez).Seems the Homeland Security people are also falling down on the job. They havent noticed that Cortezs goons led by Peter Stormares brutal Burrell have built a bridge between the U.S. and Mexico that Cortez plans to sail across in his Corvette -- unless that ""pissant country sheriff"" as Bannister calls Owens can find a way to stop him.Its a toss-up as to whether more bullets or brain cells are expended in the 107 minutes of The Last Stand. Its the kind of western where the sheriff ends up deputizing not just the town gun nut but also the town drunk because his deputies (Luis Guzman Jaimie Alexander and Zach Gilford) range from inexperienced to incompetent.Theres some funny stuff -- both Owens and Cortez do versions of the ""You cant see whats coming"" speech from No Country for Old Men -- and Schwarzenegger is still the No. 1 name on any list of guys youd want protecting your town from a zombie apocalypse prison riot or road-running drug lord.But the hilarity is muted by the really excessive amount of violence. People dont just die in The Last Stand they explode like blood bombs. Its also more than a little uncomfortable watching a school bus mercifully empty of students being used as a battering ram and bullet magnet.It brings to mind thoughts of the pre-Christmas school massacre in Newtown Conn. And also the thought that maybe this is one January where a film like The Last Stand shouldnt have been released as though everything is just (violent) business as usual.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Merrick Morton) Even for an assembly-line movie theres a lot of talent hidden on a Hollywood film set. You wouldnt know it from the faceless results but the man behind the camera for ""The Last Stand"" is Kim Jee-Won the director of the insanely entertaining spaghetti-Western spoof ""The Good The Bad and the Weird."" The big dude playing the Fed who lets a drug kingpin escape from custody and race toward Mexico is Forest Whitaker whos got an Oscar on his mantle next to what must be a big pile of unpaid bills. And that geezer with the impenetrable accent who plays the sheriff of the border town was once a champion bodybuilder the biggest box-office star in the world and the governor of California.Arnold Schwarzeneggers first starring role in a decade focuses attention on his limitations and not in an artful end-of-the-trail way. While Schwarzeneggers age is a plot point as he portrays a marginalized lawman who left the big city after a costly mishap the only excuse for a leading man who cant speak English or emote any better than a cactus plant would be his muscularity but this is one of the weakest action movies hes ever made.After a suave ingenious drug lord named Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) escapes from a Les Vegas jail and sprints toward the border with a souped-up Corvette and a beautiful FBI hostage (Genesis Rodriguez) its almost an hour before the titular showdown. The script by first-timer Andrew Knauer wastes that time cutting between Cortezs waiting henchmen (led inexplicably by Teutonic dandy Peter Stormare) and the oblivious yokels in the town of Sommerton Junction Ariz.While the cast includes Luis Guzman (as a buffoonish deputy) and Johnny Knoxville (as a local gun nut) theres no sense that these are real people in a real town and Schwarzeneggers Sheriff Owens has the weakest backstory of all. ""I have seen enough blood and death"" he muses and apparently so has Kim. The director rations some cursory gunshot violence but doesnt offer the kind of cartoonishly inventive action sequences that marked his previous movie or the overblown ones that marked most of Schwarzeneggers. ""The Last Stand"" is such a false start it could terminate Schwarzeneggers comeback before it begins.What ""The Last Stand""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 146  Content Bloody violence and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Still sporting (at age 65) the kind of Charles Atlas brawn not much seen at the movies in the no-carb era and still able to deliver a catchphrase with deadpan savoir faire Schwarzenegger here plays an ex-LAPD narcotics cop lying low as the sheriff of a sleepy Arizona border town. When a vicious cartel lord (Eduardo Noriega) escapes from FBI custody and heads for Mexico only lawman Arnold his posse of crooked-shooting deputies and a local gun nut (Johnny Knoxville) stand in his way. A veritable feature-length advertisement for assault weapons and the Second Amendment The Last Stand marks the Hollywood debut of prolific Korean genre director Kim Jee-woon (The Good the Bad the Weird I Saw the Devil) who seems to have tamped down his florid extravagance for American consumption--particularly during the movies dreary expository first hour. Then Kim finally lets loose and the imaginatively choreographed mayhem that ensues--culminating in two fast cars chasing each other across a pesky cornfield--can be a wonder to behold.

Texas Chainsaw 3D Review One Interesting Idea Dozens of Stupid Ones Gangster Squad Review Slick and Bloody Good but Weve Seen It Before Broken City Review Tangled Political Web Gets Snarled in This Wobbly Thriller Schwarzeneggers return offers a handful of trashy thrills but even B movies cant be this half-hearted and meandering No one was expecting former California governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers return to the big screen to be a collaboration with Whit Stillman or Lars Von Trier. But even by the big loud standards of a big loud Schwarzenegger movie ""The Last Stand"" feels like a succession of pitches that never amount to a script. One minute its a high-speed chase movie lovingly showing off the Corvette 01 and then its a heavily-armed showdown with a bunch of faceless goons. Sometimes the movie avoids credulity and operates with tongue firmly in cheek but then were supposed to actually care when one minor character dies and another one gets a shot at redemption. Under the direction of acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Jee-woon Kim (""I Saw the Devil"" ""The Good the Bad the Weird"") this could have been great B-movie trash. Instead ""The Last Stand"" is merely a mess. Schwarznegger stars as Ray Owens a former L.A. narcotics cop who left the big city long ago to settle in as sheriff of Summerton Junction a tiny town on the Arizona/Mexico border. With the local high school football team off at an away game Ray looks forward to a quiet weekend. Fat chance Drug lord Gabriel Cortes (Eduardo Noriega ""Open Your Eyes"") gets sprung from U.S. custody in an elaborate escape in Las Vegas taking off in a Corvette with kidnapped federal agent Ellen Richards (Genesis Rodriguez) at his side. As FBI Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) tries and fails to capture or even tail the car a group of suspicious characters (made all the more suspicious because their leader is played by Peter Stormare) turn up in Summerton and kill a farmer (Harry Dean Stanton the new king of the random cameo). By the time Ray and his motley bunch of deputies (including Zach Gifford and Luis Guzman) figure out whats going on its clear that Summerton Junctions police force are the only thing standing between Cortes and the border. Strapped for manpower Ray is forced to deputize local gun nut Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) and war-veteran-turned-town-drunk Frank (Rodrigo Santoro). With this strong crew of character actors (which also includes Richard Dillard as the local diner owner) ""The Last Stand"" seems like its going to offer some laughs and a straightforward succession of action set pieces. (The car stuff is so exciting youll wish there was more of it no matter how shameless a product placement it might be.) But the movies so tonally all over the place -and the many many gun battles are staged with such little aplomb or excitement -- that the movie more often than not feels like its just going through the motions. The same can be said for Schwarzenegger who only rarely feels invested in the goings-on. Playing for neither laughs nor gravitas he instead finds a thoroughly dull middle ground and inhabits it for nearly the entire film. Only in his climactic mano-a-mano showdown with Noriega do we get a glimpse of the action hero of yore but by that point weve had to slog through a very perfunctory adventure. Arnold Schwarzenegger may still have new and interesting tricks up his sleeve as he commences the twilight phase of his screen career but theres little on display in ""The Last Stand"" that indicates hes all that thrilled to be back on the set.

Somehow looking at once blankly inexpressive and doggedly determined a 65-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a creaky but reasonably commercial comeback bid with ""The Last Stand."" Tossing together spare parts from ""Rio Bravo"" ""Jackass"" NRA promos and vintage muscle-car commercials this thin jokey star vehicle elevates a back-of-the-bar-napkin script with a string of proficient and sensationally violent setpieces. Although devotees of Schwarzeneggers pre-gubernatorial heyday and helmer Kim Jee-woons gonzo Korean thrillers will find neither man at his best here this Lionsgate release should capitalize on hardcore-fan interest to eke out solid theatrical and ancillary biz. Schwarzeneggers first star vehicle in the decade since ""T3 Rise of the Machines"" takes its sweet time setting up a bullet-ridden standoff in Sommerton Junction a small Arizona town thats about to get an unwelcome visit from Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) a fugitive drug lord fleeing toward the U.S.-Mexico border. With the feds (led by Forest Whitaker) trying in vain to recapture Cortez as he barrels down the highway at 250 mph in a tricked-out Corvette it falls to Sommertons sheriff Ray Owens (Schwarzenegger) and his motley crew of deputies to protect their town and apprehend the escaped convict. Andrew Knauers first-produced screenplay lays out this standard setup with much drawn-out toggling between the useless feds and the scrappy Sommertonites an assortment of thinly drawn types including a fresh-faced deputy (Jaimie Alexander); a scowling old coot (Luis Guzman); a studly sensitive jailbird (Rodrigo Santoro); and an eccentric illegal-arms dealer (Johnny Knoxville). Theyre a resourceful bunch but as is made clear in a deadly early skirmish with Cortezs henchmen (led by Peter Stormare) which effectively kicks the picture into high gear theyre ill-prepared for the looming bloodbath with one crucial and obvious exception. ""I know whats coming"" Schwarzenegger grunts ""because I have seen enough blood and death."" He sure has and the weight of that legacy lends this often broadly comic endeavor the elegiac tone of a career salute a quality that intermittently distracts from the slapdash construction of the story and the incongruousness of the actors presence in this sun-drenched Arizona backwater. There are some brief references to Owens past as a Los Angeles narcotics cop and the traumatic baggage that sent him into self-imposed exile but fleshing out these points convincingly seems to be the least of the pics priorities. What happens in any event is at once predictable and largely beside the point. Cars run into over and around each other; blood spurts sprays and sometimes explodes in clouds of red smoke; good and bad guys alike run around brandishing dangerous weapons and intimidating accents; various one-liners land with a wink and a thud; Knoxville wears strange hats and enacts reckless stunts that occasionally intersect with the narrative; and Schwarzenegger when hes not plowing his way through reams of semi-intelligible dialogue proves hes still capable of firing off a few rounds and pulling broken glass out of his leg. The cartoonish nature of the proceedings is at times heightened and at other times mitigated by Kims forceful action chops which were recently demonstrated in his spaghetti-Western pastiche ""The Good the Bad the Weird"" and his merciless revenge thriller ""I Saw the Devil."" His Hollywood debut isnt nearly as visceral or unhinged as those earlier efforts though it does offer numerous examples of his skill at staging mayhem on a grand scale as well as in closer more dangerously intimate quarters. The helmer is especially good at integrating his New Mexico locations into the action from a key combat scene on a bridge to a car chase that unfolds with limited visibility in a cornfield. Kims handling of his first English-speaking cast isnt quite as assured although everyone more or less gets by; the strongest impressions are made by Zach Gilfords touchingly inexperienced cop and Noriegas diabolical-looking goatee. Ji Yong Kims sharp HD lensing Mowgs neo-Western-flavored score and Franco Carbones well-mounted production design round out a classy tech package.

TWITTER Schwarzenegger is back in a paint-by-numbers Western from Korean director Kim Jee-woon. The Governator is reduced to a border-town sheriff but still brandishes some big guns in The Last Stand Arnold Schwarzeneggers first starring vehicle in 10 years. The title is already a misnomer The 65-year-old action icon has completed two additional films and has two or three more in the pipeline as he attempts to engineer a viable comeback after his detour through Sacramento. Preoccupied with the the caliber and firepower of its arsenal of artillery to an almost weirdly obsessive degree this often jokey and sometimes abstract shoot-em-up also under present circumstances makes conspicuously tasteless use of a school bus in one of its most violent scenes. At one point in what is not the worst but is very far from the best film the star has made in his career customers clear out of a diner after the lawman enters it and a waitress quips ""You sure are bad for business."" Lionsgate can only hope that the same will not be said about their star after such a long layoff. It seems most likely that this formulaic concoction will connect with a decent number of longtime fans curious to see if their man can still deliver the goods but with better results overseas than domestically. There are moments when Schwarzeneggers Sheriff Ray Owens still in strong shape but undeniably easing into the late afternoon of his life resembles characters Clint Eastwood played back in the 1990s physically capable guys who can still rise to the occasion even if they have slowed a step and will feel the bangs and bruises longer after the actions over. This is a direction the still-imposing former body builder could plausibly pursue for a few more years but the extent of his big-screen return will depend in large measure upon whether or not his name still means much to younger audiences. VIDEO The Last Stand Trailer Marks Arnold Schwarzeneggers Comeback Its pretty certain he wont draw many newcomers to the cause on the basis of this contrivance which is built around a car chase that mostly involves only one car a Corvette ZR1 with more than 1000 horsepower and capable of speeds over 200 miles per hour. South Korean genre director Kim Jee-woon who established his wild action credentials with the outlandish Korean Western The Good the Bad the Weird in 2008 launches his American debut in humorous fashion but things quickly become serious when in related incidents malevolent baddie Burrell (Peter Stormare) guns down an old farmer (an unbilled Harry Dean Stanton) atop his tractor and the biggest and baddest Mexican cartel leader Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) escapes from an FBI caravan led by agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker). Getting behind the wheel of the vette with a female FBI hostage (Genesis Rodriguez) in tow Cortez zooms across the desert at night busting blockades and going so fast that hes gone before radar guns can track him on his way to a secret border crossing near Sheriff Owens town sleepy Summerton Junction Ariz. Learning Cortez is heading his way Owens enlarges his motley crew initially consisting of the enthusiastic Figgie (Luis Guzman) the level-headed Sarah (Jaimie Alexander) and the inept Jerry (Zach Gilford) by reluctantly recruiting jailbird Frank (Rodrigo Santoro) and local nut job Lewis (Johnny Knoxville) who scampers around in a medieval helmet that makes him look like a refugee from Monty Python and who owns a 1939 Vickers repeating gun thats called the ""Nazi Killer"" for a good reason. In a prolonged gun battle these down-home characters dispatch Burrells goons but not before a big yellow school bus (empty of students fortunately) becomes the focal point of much of the most intense shooting which cant help but bring to mind thoughts of the recent tragedy in Connecticut. As Agent Bannisters crew lags far behind their escaped prey all Owens has to do is wait and the arrogant handsome devil will come to him. Kims visual approach conveys no tension just straight action with an assortment of shots that dont always cut together with natural grace or expressiveness but do sometimes grab the eye thanks to an inclination to move from the concrete to the abstract. Nowhere is this more true than in a climactic car chase thats set of all places in a dried-up cornfield where the drivers respective cars plow through stalks that make sweeping patterns with their denseness preventing the adversaries from seeing one another. Its a weird concept with no attachment to realism whatsoever and passably memorable just for that even if it merely serves as a lead-in to a classic Western showdown on a bridge above the border. Looking leaner and rather more drawn than before Schwarzenegger still conveys the old self-confident humorous I-dare-you attitude toward his adversaries. He remains sufficiently powerful-looking to convincingly prevail in combat but comedy might prove the most profitable direction for him to pursue in a general way in the coming years as his kidding sometimes taunting nature provides a good means for him to make light of his various reputations. Shot in New Mexico the production unlike the star has something less than a full-bodied look and lacks any kind of real distinction. It sort of does the job but just barely.
