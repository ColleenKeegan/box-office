This live-action translation of the perennial cartoon favorite is a fine popcorn picture for small fry and perfectly inoffensive for adults. The strong shoulders of its star the heavy promotional campaign and household-name title will carry Universal to brontosaurian B.O. Kids of all ages hungry for this summers dinosaur picture will be more than satisfied with ""The Flintstones."" With all manner of friendly beasts a superenergetic John Goodman and a colorful supporting cast inhabiting a Bedrock that resembles a Stone Age version of Steven Spielberg suburbia this live-action translation of the perennial cartoon favorite is a fine popcorn picture for small fry and perfectly inoffensive for adults. The strong shoulders of its star the heavy promotional campaign and household-name title will carry Universal to brontosaurian B.O. Watching this fast-paced advisedly brief confection is akin to taking a quick spin on the Universal Studios tour with a detour through the City Walk attraction so loaded is it with technical gizmos showbiz in-jokes and product plugs. In a day when popular movies have more in common with theme parks than old-school artistic traditions this one fits right in. This films use of at least a dozen writers of whom only three receive final screen credit was widely reported and choice of a storyline involving embezzlement is slightly puzzling given the 7-year-old target audience. Millions of kids will be learning the word for financial trickery if they ask mommy and daddy about it during unspoolings. Inside humor is tipped from the outset as opening title announces a ""Steven Spielrock"" presentation. First reel will keep tykes eyes popping as the cast of dinosaurs is introduced in rapid succession along with the human characters. There are giant reptiles working in the rock quarry where Fred Flintstone (Goodman) and his buddies toil and dog-and-cat-like pets at home. Fred paddles his car along with his outsized feet and takes his family to the drive-in to see George Lucas ""Tar Wars."" Much of the imagination poured into the pic -- production design by William Sandell and his team the costumes by Rosanna Norton and the special-effects details by many hands -- is exhausted very quickly. Bedrock is a town of slanting rock roofs with animals that wash dishes with their trunks and ""Bedrocks Most Wanted"" hosted by Jay Leno playing on Stone Age TV. Fred of course is the happy rock-solid working man thick of bicep and skull who shockingly wins a promotion out of the rock pile and into the executive suites of Slate amp; Co. when his best friend Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) substitutes his own exam answers for Freds. The boss (Kyle MacLachlan) and his foxy secretary (Halle Berry) easily manipulate the lazy simpleton for their own financial ends setting him up for a big fall as they plot to make off with ill-gotten gains. Meanwhile at home Fred manages to get in hot water with his sprightly wife Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins) whose mother (Elizabeth Taylor) keeps harping about how Wilma could have done a lot better in her choice of husband and still might do so. After lightly going through the motions of a plot it all ends up in the quarry where assorted machinery provides the excuse for a parade of slapstick gags and amusement park-like predicaments that seem mostly lumbering. After the initial pleasure of seeing a cartoon world reinvented for live action and well known toon characters becoming flesh and blood there is little to really compel great interest but the slew of filmmakers have come up with enough contempo references little jokes and bits of business to keep things busy. Pic centers very squarely on Goodman and he brings tremendous energy and enthusiasm to the role of Fred. Its no insult to say that hes quite credible as a caveman and its hard to imagine that anyone else could so plausibly convey both the cartoonlike and everyman qualities most needed for the role. Other performers take a relative back seat but are also well cast. Perkins Moranis and Rosie ODonnell are perfectly fine as Wilma Barney and Betty Rubble. MacLachlan is suitable as the hissable yuppie villain and Berry is slinky as his seductive aide-de-camp. Given that it requires her almost exclusively to complain about Fred the mother role brings out Taylors coarse side although she looks beauteous in her first screen appearance in some time and amusingly ends up in the mouth of a dinosaur. Harvey Korman does very nicely providing a talking bird with an aristocratic voice. For adults one significant point of interest here is that the ostensible attitude of this money machine of a movie which is so loaded with highly calculated marketing and product plugs is pro-working stiff and anti-big business. Such are the paradoxes and contradictions of capitalism. Jokiness extends to the final credits which feature Flintstone-related tunes in rap reggae and Sex Pistols styles.

"The Flintstones (PG) The Flintstones (PG) By The Washington Post May 27 1994 Unless youve been living in a cave youre aware that ""The Flintstones"" is the flick kids want to see this summer. This live-action recycling of the 60s cartoon about a modern Stone Age family should be a sure thing Its fondly familiar to boomers raised on ""Flintstones"" reruns and vitamins and to their kids helplessly in the path of the hurricane of hype the hundreds of tie-in toys and products. But its no ""Jurassic Park"" -- primitively plotted glacially paced ""The Flintstones"" has a heart of stone. The ""RocDonalds"" ads are funnier. Kids will demand to see it anyway of course but its hard to imagine anyone staying interested long in the stale story line about Freds job and office politics. After Fred (John Goodman) lends Barney (Rick Moranis) the clams to adopt wild-child son Bamm-Bamm Barney pays his best pal back by secretly switching aptitude tests at work self-sacrificing his higher score so Fred will win the big promotion from the bronto-crane in the gravel pit to vice president at Slate amp; Co. But in a plot line swiped from ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" Freds new job is a sham set up so bad guy Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and his slinky secretary Rosetta Stone (Halle Berry) can embezzle company funds. Meanwhile as Fred and Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins) get used to the high life their best friends become caveless reduced to Rubble. Goodmans Fred Flintstone is indistinguishable from Roseannes hubby and even his ordinarily screen-filling presence is lost and dwarfed by the vast locations. Moranis barely registers as buddy Barney and Perkins makes an irritatingly whiny Wilma. Rosie ODonnell fares best as Betty Rubble -- her perfect re-creation of Bettys titter gets the movies first real laugh -- but as in the cartoon poor Betty doesnt get much to do. ""The Flintstones"" wakes up whenever Elizabeth Taylor appears as Wilmas overbearing mother Pearl Slaghoople. The special-effects sight gags and prehistorock puns come thick and fast -- starting with a producer credit for ""Steven Spielrock."" And all the gimmicks from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon are here the foot-powered cars the dino-gadgets (a prehistoric porker under the sink serves as a garbage disposal for instance) Dino and sabretooth Kitty animated by Jim Hensons Creature Shop. And the puns -- Fred and Wilma celebrate his promotion with a swank night at Cavern on the Green (where the ""BC""-52s are the entertainment); the local drive-in is showing ""Tar Wars""; and Wilma and Betty watch soaps like ""The Young and the Thumbless."" Get the picture? Directed by ""Beethovens"" Brian Levant ""The Flintstones"" is a 45 million design problem with 98 minutes of weak prehistoric jokes. The ""stone""-shtick gets mighty old after about 15 minutes. More than 30 screenwriters worked on the ""Flintstones"" script and the result just proves the ancient saying about too many cooks.

"The Flintstones (PG) The Flintstones (PG) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer May 27 1994 ""The Flintstones"" a 45 million dinosaur that hired no fewer than 36 screenwriters and stars John Goodman Rick Moranis Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie ODonnell isnt just awful. It bombs itself into the Stone Age. As Fred Flintstone might have put it yabba-dabba-boo. After faithfully duplicating the TV shows familiar opening sequence -- in which Fred Flintstone (Goodman) knocks off work howls for joy slides down his Bronto-crane tail and foot-shuffles away in his prehistoric car -- the movie suffers immediate comic extinction. Leadenly directed and almost soberly scripted it never captures the campy brightness of the original series -- the herky-jerky animation the wacky sound effects the distinctive character voices and that cheesy laugh track. In the third-rate plot (and theres no telling who among the Flintstone 36 came up with this gem) scheming boss Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and his comely secretary (Halle Berry) promote unsuspecting Fred as a vice president then frame him for embezzlement intending to abscond with the ill-gotten profit. Fred enjoying a life of unprecedented luxury is obliged to fire Barney (Moranis) and watch his friend sink into poverty before realizing his mistakes. If the performers are imitating their cartoon forebears it is barely apparent. Goodmans sweat-induced growly offerings completely bypass Freds lovable pigheaded innocence. The actor never attains Freds gravelly timbre. And with his blond-dyed hair and zombielike demeanor Moranis seems more like a zoned-out Warhol groupie than Freds perky buddy. The greatest asset of Perkinss Wilma is that Perkins looks the part. ODonnells dead-on Betty Rubble giggle is the funniest thing in the movie but it merely underlines how bad everyone -- and everything -- else is around her The child actors who play Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles are completely forgettable. Freds pet dinosaur Dino with its chintzy eyes and unconvincing animatronic gyrations looks like a low-budget Muppet. And even Elizabeth Taylor trundled out to play Freds insulting mother-in-law falls disappointingly short of imperious. She isnt exactly helped by the mediocre bones the screenplay tosses her way. While the movie -- officially scripted by Steven E. de Souza Tom Parker and Jim Jennewein -- labors through its primeval ooze it churns out incessant dull visual gags including a Stonehenge-meets-50s-America and the ""pigasaurus"" creature under the sink that serves as a garbage disposal. It also heaves out unfunny Hollywood ""inside"" jokes The movie opens with a ""Steven Spielrock Presents"" credit; Halle Berrys character is named Rosetta Stone; George Lucass ""Tar Wars"" is playing at the local theater. When inevitably Fred -- locked out of the house by his pet saber-toothed tiger -- thumps the door and yells ""Wilma"" it doesnt bring ""The Flintstones"" to a triumphant close. It just sets the audience free.

We know exactly how John Goodman looks in his animal skin. Now were finally getting a glimpse of how the rest of the movie will look when it hits the screen on May 27. Turns out that Universals recently released trailer is a page right out of TV history with scenes adapted from the old cartoon series. Audiences are laughing in recognition as Goodmans Fred skis down the back of his dinosaur steam shovel yelling ""Yabba-dabba-doo""; as he slams on his car brakes (which of course are his two feet); and as he gets himself locked out of his house and pounds on the door shouting ""Wiiiilllllllmmmmma"" In addition to Elizabeth Perkins (Wilma) Rick Moranis (Barney) and Rosie ODonnell (Betty) there are also Kyle MacLachlan Halle Berry Jonathan Winters and Elizabeth Taylor-in prehistoric faux fur. Not to mention the rock group the B- 52s here renamed the B.C. 52s. So what else can we expect to see of the town of Bedrock? Well see in doo time.
