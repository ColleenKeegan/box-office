Comments Exorcist The Beginning The nice thing about a sequel subtitled ""The Beginning"" is that you can be reasonably sure its the end. The Exorcist (1973) included a reference to elderly Father Merrin having performed an exorcism in Africa; this dopey fourth installment jumps back to 1949 and finds Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) estranged from the church but traveling to east Africa to help excavate a pagan temple where Lucifer still hangs out. The serious Catholic themes that made the original film genuinely disturbing have been flattened out into a cartoonish backstory pitting Merrin against Nazi storm troopers but director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger) knows what the franchise is all about and delivers plenty of worms hyenas and blasphemous images. Vittorio Storaro is the cinematographer. R 114 min. By J.R.

Was it worth it? Was it hell. For all its trainspotting references to William Friedkins 1973 original this is cod-religious horror-by-numbers ancient amulet excavated church resurrected evil biblical myth demonic possession exorcism. Not even Stellan Skarsgards intense credible portrayal of the young Lankester Merrin a traumatised ex-priest turned drink-sodden archaeologist can save this sorry mess.Set in colonial east Africa in 1949 it ostensibly charts Merrins rediscovery of his faith. The uncovering of a Byzantine church also reveals a pagan site of human sacrifice hidden beneath. A diabolical evil is unleashed driving Merrins predecessor mad leaving local boy Joseph catatonic and inciting a bloody insurrection by the frightened Turkana people. As Merrin and gutsy doctor Sarah (Izabella Scorupco) seek the source of this malevolent force eager young priest Father Francis (James DArcy) wonders aloud Is the legend true? That after the war in heaven this is the spot where Lucifer fell to earth.Die Hard 2 helmer Harlins head-banging style and visceral images (crucifixions evisceration and maggoty foetuses) are wildly at odds with his allegedly low-key psychological approach. Reams of tedious exposition finally give way to a random jumble of horror movie cliches rising to a shrill pitch of hysteria that is never remotely frightening. Surely Schraders version (now slated for release on DVD in January 2005) must be better than this.

Gory Exorcist prequel digs into priests early days in demon-expelling biz 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Exorcist The Beginning Horror. Starring Stellan Skarsgard James DArcy and Izabella Scorupco. Directed by Renny Harlin. (R 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Not since half the cast of ""Poltergeist"" started dying mysterious deaths has a movie set seemed so obviously possessed by Lucifer himself. ""Exorcist The Beginning"" lost director John Frankenheimer -- he left the project in 2002 and died shortly thereafter -- and the equally reputable Paul Schrader who was reportedly fired. Then in a development more horrifying than anything in the script Warner Bros. hired ""Cutthroat Island"" director Renny Harlin whose leg was broken in 14 places when he was hit by a car during production. And finally the studio delayed the screening until Thursday night a tactic generally used to keep critics from warning moviegoers about a bomb (see ""Alien vs. Predator"" ... or better yet dont). But while the fourth ""Exorcist"" movie may have unmitigated disaster written all over it the finished product is somehow sort-of-kind-of not all that bad. The horror movie is a prequel to William Peter Blattys ""The Exorcist"" which was directed by William Friedkin in 1973. The lone connection is the Father Merrin character played by Max von Sydow in the original and by fellow Swede Stellan Skarsgard here. In ""The Exorcist"" Merrin mentions a demon he confronted in Africa and ""The Beginning"" tells that tale -- explaining in the process how Merrin regained his religious faith and went pro in his career jettisoning demons from puke-spewing pubescent girls. At this point instead of dwelling on whats missing from the film it might be useful to list whats still there. Its clear that at some point someone intended to make a movie worthy of the original and scattered elements of that dream remain intact. ""Exorcist The Beginning"" works with a blasphemous yet surprisingly decent script (""God is not here today priest."" ""Sometimes I think the best view of God is from hell."") and an able cast led by the brooding Skarsgard. As Merrin explores the mystery surrounding a strange church in Kenya that appears to have been buried shortly after it was built hes accompanied by Bond-girl-turned-decent-actress Izabella Scorupco as dedicated aid worker Dr. Sarah Novack. And while Harlins budget was clearly limited (Schrader reportedly completed a film and Warner asked Harlin for a reshoot) at least someone sprang for a good production designer and lead makeup artist. It may have been a mistake to take on another chapter in an inventively terrifying classic such as ""The Exorcist"" but what the prequel lacks in spinning heads it makes up for with horrible facial contusions festering tombs and premature organ donations. There are plenty of distinct Renny Harlin moments throughout the film and many are quite distracting. The version made by Schrader -- who wrote ""Taxi Driver"" and directed ""Affliction"" -- probably didnt include a pack of poorly rendered computerized hyenas ripping apart a boy a gratuitous special effect that is rivaled only by the maggot-infested stillborn baby Harlin treats moviegoers to in the second act. Much like its source material ""Exorcist The Beginning"" is filled with shocking images and its also a great impetus to start a diet. But before the Harlin-bashing gets out of hand it should be noted that he is playing to a modern horror film crowd that expects something scary to pop out of nowhere every few minutes. It must have been hard but he provides all of those mainstream thrills while treating the source material with subtlety nodding to the original film instead of repeating the same formula wholesale. But after a well-paced first two acts ""Exorcist The Beginning"" eventually collapses under its enormous weight. The inevitable exorcism isnt enough -- we also get a full-scale tribal war and a Nazi-saturated flashback subplot that tries to mine ""Sophies Choice"" emotions but ends up confusing the plot. By the time the three or four false endings are finished and the credits roll moviegoers will be left wondering whether Schraders version will be released on DVD. Somewhere in this mediocre horror film theres a worthy sequel. Right now fans of ""The Exorcist"" will have to settle for this ""Beginning."" -- Advisory This film contains violence gore adult language and sexual situations.

"Exorcist Prequel Wont Turn Any Heads washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Exorcist Prequel Wont Turn Any Heads Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday August 21 2004 You say the Samp;M scene has got you down brother? Boy I know how that feels. Somehow the latex hood just doesnt cut it anymore the handcuffs dont degrade you enough the sting of the cat-o-nine-tails just doesnt punish the way it used to. Its a snooze. Wake you when Mistress is done right? Brother have I got a movie for you. For self-abuse for self-flagellation for the utter abrogation of the ego for humiliation beyond measure for the scalding sense of unworthiness nothing these days quite does the trick like ""Exorcist The Beginning."" It manages a trifecta of pain Its dull its grim its stupid. Hows that for a recommendation? In fact far more interesting than the movie is the chronicle of its making. Having used up the sequel gambit (""Exorcists"" 2 and 3 being forgettable) the filmmakers decided to go the prequel route and take us back to the exorcists first set-to with the mind-snatcher literally from hell. One must say its not a bad commercial premise. One must say that not only didnt it turn out it didnt turn out twice. Originally the great director John Frankenheimer signed aboard but before shooting started he walked off the set and promptly died possibly of shame. He was replaced by Paul Schrader who theoretically knows a little about horror having directed ""Cat People."" He actually rewrote this ""Exorcist"" then made it. He finished it. It was done. But uh what about the blood? No blood. A surprise from the writer of ""Taxi Driver"" but no blood. So the whole thing was junked. Renny Harlin a Finnish action specialist (""Die Hard 2"" was his hit) came in with a new writer and literally made another movie which includes less than 10 percent of Schraders footage. But other than to service that small community of masochists one has to wonder why he bothered. Its a botch start to finish. For one thing it never really defines a central dramatic situation that propels the story onward as did William Friedkins deeply terrifying 1973 original. That pop classic derived from William Peter Blattys novel took your soul hostage in the first few minutes telling a story of a child seized by a demon beyond the reach of science degraded and dehumanized until only a man of faith could stand up against the evil that had taken charge. Hmm this one is about a bunch of people hanging out in the desert. You know what Hanging-out movies darn it they just never work. Stellan Skarsgard plays Lankester Merrin the character of the exorcist in Friedkins original there played by Max von Sydow. Skarsgard Swedish = Von Sydow Swedish. See how the Hollywood mind works? Except that Liam Neeson Irish had originally signed to do the part. Anyhow as the film opens Merrin is not an exorcist; hes not even a priest. He keeps flashing back to what looks like a cheesy 50s war movie which explains his loss of faith. Hes become some kind of Indiana Jones-style archaeological relic thief and we watch as hes hired by a mystery organization to infiltrate a dig in East Africa (its 1949) where a mysterious nearly pristine early Christian church has been found buried in the sand. There hes to steal what reports say is a demonic statue. You dont have to pay any attention to this part of the movie because the rest of the movie pays no attention to it either. The dig is marked by three unique factors a beautiful Polish actress (Izabella Scorupco) pretending not to be beautiful (without much success) as she swills Pernod from unmarked bottles; doors that need oiling because every time one opens it screeches like scrap metal in a meat grinder; and lots of gruesome but pointless shock scenes. Hmm do you like it when the baby full of maggots is born to the African chief or when the drunk British site manager is hung upside down in bloody tatters on the altar of a church? Or possibly your thing is watching an African child torn to pieces by killer hyenas for about 19 very long minutes? I must confess losing contact with the plot because it hadnt yet begun by the time the level of groaning in the theater drowned out the dialogue. It seems to end with Merrin fighting a she-demon in the Batcave. Where is Adam West when you need him? Exorcist The Beginning (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme gore.

C- The Exorcist The Beginning Genre Mystery and Thriller Horror; Starring Gabriel Mann Stellan Skarsgard Israel Aduramo Ralph Brown; Director Paul Schrader; Author William Wisher Jr.; Release Date Wide 08/20/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 11 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT If Paul Schrader?s prequel to ""The Exorcist"" which was shot and edited only to be shelved by studio executives is ever released on DVD it will be intriguing to see if there could be even less going on in it than there is in Renny Harlin?s Exorcist The Beginning. Set at an archaeological dig in Cairo in 1949 the new movie is a dusty pinata stuffed with omens and not much more. They include the following flies moths bats crows hyenas Beezlebub sculptures a big Beezlebub statue a baby covered in maggots (that one?s a goodie) an apocalyptic sandstorm and a man cursed with wretched skin. Will the audience glimpse the devil in these details? The power of Renny Harlin?s crassness compels you Stellan Skarsgard has the gravity and hairline to play a younger Max von Sydow but his Father Merrin - I mean Mr. Merrin a former priest who?s lost his faith - keeps flashing back to episodes with the Nazis so that the movie can turn into a solemnly underbaked ""Merrin?s Choice."" The original ""Exorcist"" verged on being demonic child porn. This ""Beginning"" simply feels as if it has no end.

Indeed given its notoriously troubled production history third follow-up to William Friedkins 1973 horror blockbuster earns points simply for not being bad enough to leave a stain on the screen. It could be viewed as a minor miracle that ""Exorcist The Beginning"" doesnt quite live down to expectations raised -- or lowered -- by near-deafening negative advance buzz. Indeed given its notoriously troubled production history third follow-up to William Friedkins 1973 horror blockbuster earns points simply for not being bad enough to leave a stain on the screen. Unfortunately this annoyingly disjointed shocker stumbles badly after promising early scenes and quickly devolves into a chaotic blur of underdeveloped characters illogical transitions and standard-issue scary-movie tropes. Although brand name should guarantee big opening-weekend b.o. drop-off will be quick and precipitous with respectable homevid biz in store. Designed as a prequel to events rendered in Friedkins film (and before that in William Peter Blattys enormously popular novel) ""Exorcist The Beginning"" harkens back to a period when Father Lankester Merrin (portrayed as golden-ager in original pic by Max Von Sydow) took an extended sabbatical from the priesthood. Periodic flashbacks reveal that during World War II in his native Holland Merrin was forced to assist in an atrocity ordered by a Nazi commander. As a result the conscience-wracked Merrin lost his faith and left the church. After a visually striking and effectively portentous prologue pic introduces Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) as a gone-to-seed layman and Oxford-trained archeologist whose post-war wanderings have led him to Cairo circa 1949. Semelier (Ben Cross) a mysterious stranger who claims to work for ""a private collector of rare antiquities"" offers Merrin a sizeable sum to visit a remote site in the Tirkana region of Kenya where British archeologists have unearthed a Christian Byzantine church in pristine condition a church it should be noted that inexplicably dates back to a time centuries before Christianity reached the region. Semelier claims to be interested in finding an ancient relic hidden somewhere in the church. Merrin despite his loss of faith is more interested in learning why anyone built ""a church where no church should be"" in the first place. Merrin resents having to make the journey with an unwelcome traveling companion Father Francis (James DArcy) an idealistic young cleric dispatched by the Vatican to oversee religious aspects of the excavation. (Thats what the guy claims at least.) Once he arrives at the site however Merrin turns his attention to more pressing matters Vandalized religious statuary in the unearthed church rapacious packs of man-eating hyenas on the prowl rising tensions between skittish natives and British troops. Even as hes slowly drawn to Dr. Sarah Novack (Izabella Scorupco) a visiting physician with her own bad memories of wartime horrors the disillusioned ex-priest cant help noticing tell-tale indications of supernatural activity. A bad situation turns much worse when Joseph (Remy Sweeney) a native youngster starts to display signs of Satanic possession. For the benefit of those who turned in late ""Exorcist The Beginning"" started out as a 40 million project directed by Paul Schrader (a replacement for John Frankenheimer who died before filming began) from a script credited to Caleb Carr and William Wisher. After Schrader completed shooting producer James G. Robinson reportedly viewed the rough cut and found it insufficiently scary. So Robinson hired helmer Renny Harlin to more or less start over from scratch working from a revised script by Alexi Hawley while shooting the entire pic at Cinecitta Studios in Rome. The new and allegedly improved version which reportedly cost about 50 million doesnt list Schraders name anywhere in the titles but Carr and Wisher get story credit. (A few location shots in Morocco are said to be the only traces visible here from the Schrader shoot.) The end result is something far short of seamless despite some intriguing bits and pieces and a genuinely exciting climax. Continuity is at best a sometime thing Supporting players appear and disappear at random; character developments are announced rather than dramatized. After a reasonably coherent first act pic proceeds in herky-jerky start-and stop fashion with precious little regard for narrative or emotional consistency. Worse Harlin cant resist the temptation to include cheap scares and even cheaper thrills At one point Scorupco provides peek-a-boo nudity while taking a shower then drapes herself in a towel before wandering down dark hallways in search of things going bump in the night. Here and there however the film cleverly alludes to sights and situations from the first ""Exorcist"" - the makeup for a demon-infested character here vividly evokes look of Linda Blairs bedeviled Regan MacNeil - which goes long way toward capturing at least some of the originals pics creepy flavor. At least ""Beginning"" does something that both John Boormans cockamamie ""Exorcist II The Heretic"" (1977) and Blattys own ill-starred ""Exorcist III"" (1990) failed to do - it actually satisfies aud desire to see another successful exorcism of a demonically-possessed character. As the younger Merrin Skarsgard - whos actually a decade older than Van Sydow was in 74 - does a fine job of conveying the spirit of his predecessors performance while adding his own distinctive touches. Of particular note is Skarsgards body language His Merrin may be disillusioned and despairing but theres usually a conspicuous purposefulness to his stride almost a swagger. Maybe you have to appear that reflexively self-confident if youre going to have any chance of beating the devil. Scorupco is the standout among supporting players. DArcy doesnt get much opportunity to make a compelling impression - it appears much of his part was left on the cutting room floor - but Cross make the absolute most of minimal screen time. Color lensing by Vittorio Storaro (who also shot Schraders version) and production design by Stefano Ortolani enhance overall mood of primordial darkness descending on sunbaked wilds. Trevor Rabins music is very loud and there is rather too much of it. To see Varietys review of Paul Schraders cut ""Exorcist The Prequel click here.
