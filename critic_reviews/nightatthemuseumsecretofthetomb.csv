None of these films has a particularly well-conceived plot or emotional through-line. 94 Shares Share 88 Tweet 6 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Joe Lederer/Twentieth Century Fox The Night at the Museum series hasnt exactly been anybodys idea of great cinema - or even okay cinema. None of these films has a particularly well-conceived plot or emotional through-line. Theyre mainly excuses to showcase characters from different periods in history coming to life often through the magic of CGI - a pleasant diversion for kids an inoffensive babysitter for the parents. But director Shawn Levy at least in the previous two films seemed like he could handle neither the big setpieces nor the more intimate moments he trampled on quiet scenes and drained big ones of their energy. All that said this latest and presumably final entry in the series is not without its virtues. This time around the modesty helps. The idea is that the magic Tablet of Akhmenrah the Egyptian artifact that brings the Museum of Natural Historys various exhibits to life is starting to corrode and its power withering away. That means that the various characters that our hero Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) has befriended over the years - Teddy Roosevelt (the late Robin Williams) Egyptian pharaoh Akhmenrah (Rami Malek) miniature cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and his Roman general friend Octavius (Steve Coogan) among others - are all in danger of turning back to their stiff lifeless wax/bronze/stone/porcelain selves. That necessitates a trip to the British Museum where the rest of Akhmenrahs family can be found (including Ben Kingsley as his father which means that Kingsley is currently in theaters playing an Egyptian pharaoh in this movie and one of their Jewish slaves in Exodus. Its a pageant Rebel Wilson shows up (endearingly) as a British museum security guard and our heroes even have a rather self-important Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) to deal with. The gags this time feel somehow both more throwaway and more inventive. At one point Larry and Teddy Roosevelt jump into an M.C. Escher woodcut and have to navigate its twisted sense of space as they struggle to retrieve the tablet; the result is like an A-Ha video on mushrooms. Meanwhile Jedediah and Octavius find themselves in an interactive diorama of Pompeii outrunning a sea of lava when Dexter the capuchin monkey shows up lumbering among the smoke like Godzilla. Theres a pretty hilarious bit involving Larry and his inarticulate dim caveman doppelganger Laaah; the credits say Stiller plays both parts but I spent the entire movie convinced Laaah was being played by a heavily made-up Tom Cruise and am still not entirely convinced it wasnt him. Anyway its all dumb but fun. Its also curiously affecting for perhaps unintentional reasons. Much of the film involves Larry restoring the tablet of Akhmenrah to keep his friends from effectively dying - or at least returning to their previously lifeless selves a process that begins well before the films climax. That establishes a sad urgency throughout and the fact that the late Robin Williams is but the most prominent member of the supporting cast gives it a kind of weight. This is one of the beloved actors absolute final performances; I think he has an indie yet to be properly released and one last animated role coming up. Playing Teddy Roosevelt in these films was nowhere near a highpoint for Williams but it did speak to his fondness for these CGI-infused kids spectacles. His final farewell here is gentle reflectively and almost unbearably moving. It lends the the film a retroactive grace.

Its got fewer laughs. Considering its a comedy this is not a good thing. The third and -- please Amon-Ra make it so -- final episode in the family-film franchise this new movie (after the last ones detour to the Smithsonian) brings us back to New Yorks Museum of Natural History where the exhibits still come to life each night. Then one evening they start going a little mad. It seems the ancient tablet that revives them is itself losing its power. Guess its time for Larry the guard to fix it -- by taking a trip (and taking some of his special friends along) to the British Museum to meet some new living statues. And hey perhaps while theyre there they can dust off some better jokes Please? Alas no as the big gags here mostly involve a little monkey urinating on people. As Larry Ben Stiller basically replenishes his bank account (and probably tenders a very big apology to Fox for releasing his ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""). Other characters coast on their accents (Owen Wilson as a cowboy Steve Coogan as an ancient Roman) or grunt and mug when they remember. There is a brief lovely moment when a still loose-limbed Dick Van Dyke 89 returns dancing to ""Shake Your Groove Thing."" (Also making a cameo the late Mickey Rooney.) But theres no reason for these actors to be here again and once Van Dyke leaves he leaves a hole. Also bittersweet is the sight of Robin Williams in his last onscreen appearance. Is it just the sharp focus of hindsight or does he already look a little sad a little shaky? Certainly the free-wheeling energy is gone; given several chances to fly he stays earthbound. Thats doubly depressing because not only does it rob us of our last chance to see a comic genius in full form it leaves this ""Museum"" in a pretty shabby state. I laughed once when Kingsleys pharaoh tries to befriend Stiller by telling him how much he used to enjoy having Jewish slaves. (Stiller is naturally unimpressed.) And just hearing Wilsons sagebrush surfer drawl is often enough to bring a smile. But unlike the first film which had the virtue of novelty and the second which had the attraction of Amy Adams theres not much here to justify the admission price. Stiller isnt very funny (especially in his second role as a dumb-as-rocks caveman). One or two of the effects look rushed and Levy seems far more interested in some off-the-topic celebrity cameos than he is in creating any sense of wonder. The exhibits in this ""Night at the Museum"" may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert. Ratings note The film is too scary for the very young and not smart enough for anyone else. Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb (PG) Fox (97 min.) Directed by Shawn Levy.

One scene in the film is a fitting tribute to Williams who died in August.(Kerry Brown) Night at the Museum Funny charming kiddie-flick fare Add to ... John Semley Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 19 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 19 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Shawn Levy Written by Robert Ben Garant David Guion Michael Handelman Thomas Lennon Starring Ben Stiller Robin Williams Owen Wilson Ricky Gervais Ben Kingsley Steve Coogan Rebel Wilson Classification PG Country USA Language English When actors die the films they leave unreleased become imbued with a special quality. These movies are like ghosts the artists unfinished business. Sometimes these performances can effectively serve as cathartic cappers to an actors career as with Philip Seymour Hoffmans victory lap in this years A Most Wanted Man. Other times an actor may be left taking a posthumous final bow in a three-quel to a childrens movie about museum exhibits magically coming to life.So it is with Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb which stands as the final on-screen performance by the late comedian Robin Williams. Though it must have been by sheer dumb luck the ending of the film actually functions as a believably affecting grace note for Williams. As the film narrows toward its ending Williamss character - a reanimated statue of trust-busting U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt - bids farewell to museum night watchman Larry (Ben Stiller). Teddy Globe and Mail screen grab Video Video 2014 in six songs How The Globes Broadsheet Music project came together The New Radicals Video Ballet for urban spaces mounts his steed strikes his most valiant rock-jawed Rough Rider pose and hardens back into plastic as the sun rises. And theres Williams arrested in the gilded amber of time. Its maybe not the most fitting career-encompassing onscreen send-off but its a nice one nonetheless. Call it incidental catharsis.Thing is Because Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb is a modern childrens movie it cant end on a note of well-earned melancholy. So instead the writers slap on an upbeat epilogue where the museums celebrity cast of characters (Williams as Roosevelt Owen Wilson as a cowboy Steve Coogan as a Roman centurion etc.) are reawakened one more time so that they may boogie and breakdance to a live DJ. Any sense of closure is blown open and the lingering melancholy explodes into a bacchanal of CGI stupidity. It might as well unfold superimposed with a movie execs rubber stamp certifying that THIS IS WHAT KIDS WANT.Its too bad because before it resorts to its pandering postscript Secret of the Tomb is funny charming kiddie-flick fare. Setting the scene during a fundraiser gala at New Yorks Museum of Natural History where a self-reflexive voiceover promises the same level of high-tech special effects weve all come to expect things quickly sour as the cast of magically sentient models begin behaving erratically leading to the dismissal of the museums curator (Ricky Gervais).In order to save his bosss job and the museums ""special effects"" Stillers Larry smuggles the gang to Londons British Museum on a mission to reawaken the man who built the magic reanimation tablet a Pharaoh played by Ben Kingsley (on loan from Ridley Scotts ancient-Egyptian epic Exodus Gods and Kings). A subplot involves a reawakened Sir Lancelot sculpture (Dan Stevens of this years under-seen indie actioner The Guest) confusing the magical tablet for the Holy Grail while also suffering a low-grade existential crisis when he realizes hes not actually the legendary Arthurian knight.The SFX set pieces are pretty lame mostly involving a lot of weary running around and tense ticking-clock urgency. What elevates Secret of the Tomb is the classicism of its humour. The frantic energy slows down or grinds to a halt in order to give Stillers straight man a chance to play off one or another of the films comic talents Gervais Williams Dick Van Dyke Rebel Wilson (who is excellent).Given the big-budget kid-cinema trappings it almost feels like these talented comics are carving out a space to be funny among all the mayhem. The volleys of spiked riff-y repartee may not be pandering to what the films presumed child-viewer wants but theyre plenty of fun for any hapless adults who may find themselves dragged to the cinema in tow.

Titles Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Names Robin Williams Ben Stiller Patrick Gallagher Mizuo Peck Rami Malek Still of Robin Williams Ben Stiller Patrick Gallagher Mizuo Peck and Rami Malek in Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb (2014)(Photo Kerry Brown)Its the rare film that features a Neanderthal making out with a British security guard a monkey peeing on a river of lava and Sir Lancelot battling a skeletal Triceratops.Then again maybe its not so rare. Movies are getting more and more weird. At least in the case of ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" all the weirdness turns out to be fun.There are some key elements that make this ""Night at the Museum"" sequel work better than its predecessor. For one all the major characters go on a road trip to London and a different museum comes alive.This movie also introduces two new scene-stealing characters the above-mentioned saucy security guard played by Rebel Wilson and Sir Lancelot played by Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"" ""The Guest""). For good measure star Ben Stiller plays a caveman doppelganger of his security guard character Larry Daley.Larrys problem this time around is the magic tablet that brings all the denizens of his museum to life every night -- its failing. To find out how to fix it he needs to fly to England where the father of Ahk (Rami Malek) the pharaoh who created the tablet is on display. Somehow most of the franchises major characters -- including Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt Owen Wilson as cowboy Jedediah and Steve Coogan as Roman legionnaire Octavius -- come along for the ride.Wackiness as they say ensues. But throughout the film Larry is worrying about his rebellious son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) fretting over his immediate family even as he tries to save his extended magical family. Its sweet and frankly sentimental subtext to a goofy movie just made for family viewing over the holidays.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongNight at the Museum Secret of the TombGRADE BRated PG for mild action some rude humor and brief languageRunning time 97 minutes""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" (PG) This goofy family friendly sequel takes Larry (Ben Stiller) and his museum characters on a trip to London where they hope to save the magic that brings them to life at night.

"Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb doesnt know when to quit review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNight at the Museum Secret of the Tomb doesnt know when to quit reviewThe mystical MacGuffin of the third and supposedly final Night at the Museum movie resembles a giant golden BlackBerry which may explain why it feels like everybody just phoned it in.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 18 2014Night at the Museum Secret of the TombStarring Ben Stiller Robin Williams Owen Wilson Steve Coogan Ben Kingsley Rebel Wilson Dan Stevens and Skyler Gisondo. Directed by Shawn Levy. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 98 minutes. PGThe mystical MacGuffin of the third and supposedly final Night at the Museum movie resembles a giant golden BlackBerry which may explain why it feels like everybody just phoned it in.Especially Robin Williams who sadly ended his own life not long after filming wrapped on Shawn Levys latest franchise frenzy subtitled Secret of the Tomb which shifts much of story to the British Museum.Article Continued BelowWilliams returns among the historical restorations of the Museum crew as the magically revived Teddy Roosevelt and he gets extra screen time. But any final fire in his last major film has been extinguished. The same goes for Mickey Rooney who also died this year and who is seen briefly cameoing his elder guard role in a scene with a cavorting Dick Van Dyke. From left Mizuo Peck Robin Williams Ben Stiller Rami Malek and Patrick Gallagher appear in a scene from Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb.  (Kerry Brown / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  Both departed actors are seen just going through the motions as are most of the familiar participants in this clear cash grab who also include Ben Stiller as frantic night guard Larry (he now does double duty as a caveman named Laa) Owen Wilson as tiny cowboy Jebediah Steve Coogan as equally wee Roman warrior Octavius and Patrick Gallagher as beefy Attila the Hun. (Amy Adams feisty Amelia Earhart is MIA). Its as if theyre all really feeling the effects of the power-down of the aforementioned MacGuffin a golden tablet seen in a 1930s Egyptian prologue (a straight rip from Raiders of the Lost Ark) that explains the reason for the reanimated historical personages of the series. The tablet is inexplicably decaying from ""green rust"" (screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman are dialing it in too) and when it finally stops functioning so will the nightly frolics of Teddy Jebediah Octavius Attila and the others. This contrivance forces a road trip for Larry and his pals from New Yorks American Museum of Natural History to Londons British Museum. It also allows for the introduction of new characters a game Dan Stevens as a ninja-leaping Sir Lancelot and Ben Kingsley and Anjali Jay as the Egyptian royal figures who can solve the ""green rust"" problem. We also get Rebel Wilson who tries way too hard as Larrys British equivalent doing her night-guard thing with more slapstick and less humour.The usual CGI shenanigans ensue including another set of rampaging dinosaur bones and frequent urination from an incontinent capuchin monkey.The proceedings wheeze toward the finish line even at a scant 98 minutes. There are a couple of inspired moments a cat video glimpsed in a YouTube clip at the start is recreated by stone lions and a chase inside M.C. Eschers famous lithograph Relativity briefly makes ""zany"" seem like a compliment.Things get altogether too meta when Sir Lancelot leaves the museum and invades a stage performance of Camelot interrupting performances by Hugh Jackson and Alice Eve. Its not funny when Lancelot keeps mispronouncing Hugh as ""Huge."" Not the first time or the multiple times he does it. He doesnt seem to know when to quit. But hopefully this franchise does and will remain as a trilogy despite any temptation to add further chapters to the London sojourn.

Theres a sprightly shaggy quality on display which instantly distinguishes it from just another big heaping pile of studio money. The fact that the series has since the release of the 2006 first film inspired sleepovers at New Yorks Natural History Museum demonstrates a certain good-heartedness in the franchise that comes through on the screen. Transformers never inspired a sleepover in a truck dealership. This third movie in the series once again stars Ben Stiller as watchman Larry whose exhibitions come to life when the sun goes down. A magical tablet thats rapidly disintegrating compels Larry and his pals (Owen Wilson as a cowboy Steve Coogan as a Roman emperor Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt) to head to the British Museum in London in search of a remedy. A lineup of brief and extended cameos keep the plot buoyant even when the sight of a CG-enchanced Capuchin monkey grows weary. As a security guard Rebel Wilsons not on screen for 60 seconds before describing her blonde pony tail as ""a golden poo sitting on my shoulder."" But she drives within the PG lines all the way to a cute climactic Dirty Dancing homage with a Neanderthal (also played by Stiller). Dan Stevens capping a wild movie year that also included The Guest and A Walk Among the Tombstones plays Sir Lancelot who awakens in the museum and eventually storms the stage of a West End production of Camelot intent on slaying the major Hollywood star playing King Arthur. Many of the jokes of course are groaners. When Teddy Roosevelt begins to malfunction he spits out one-liners from other famous presidents climaxing with the W classic ""Heck of a job Brownie"" However Williams final scene--in his final film--makes for a poignant testament as the tired waxworks Roosevelt chooses peaceful repose over the endless safari. Williams is also a part of the movies most imaginative sequence in which Roosevelt and two other characters all become stuck in M.C. Eschers famous perspective-skewering lithograph Relativity. The animation of the Escher world is a total pop-art blast recalling a-has great 1986 ""Take On Me"" video and the scene ends with a terrific nod to the suspended laws of gravity at play in the piece. It might only last for a minute but no bad movie would ever think to include a minute that absurdly clever.

By 20th Century Fox Pictures on Publish Date December 17 2014. Photo by 20th Century Fox. Watch in Times Video >> embed ""Night at the Museum 3 Secret of the Tomb"" signifies closing time for the franchise in which exhibits come alive and Ben Stiller has to deal with them. The director Shawn Levy and the new writers David Guion and Michael Handelman throw together enough gags and one-liners to ensure a diverting and here and there rather funny journey for the museum stalwart Larry and his menagerie of Teddy Roosevelt a miniature Roman general a Neanderthal a capuchin monkey and others. Photo From left Robin Williams Dan Stevens and Ben Stiller in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb."" Credit Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox Now director of nighttime operations Larry (Mr. Stiller near left) must visit a pharaoh (Ben Kingsley) in the British Museum to learn why Roosevelt and friends went bonkers during a dinner show at the American Museum of Natural History. The problems center on an enchanted Egyptian tablet tied to the animation of the exhibits. The trip introduces new blood to the comedy chiefly a revived Sir Lancelot (a sharp Dan Stevens far left) and a gabby British nightwatchwoman (Rebel Wilson) and Larrys travails with his college-averse son yield lessons about independence.The premise shares something with durable silent-era slapstick yarns even if the material underserves Mr. Stiller Ricky Gervais Steve Coogan and the other comedians. (As Roosevelt Robin Williams serves more as a benevolent fatherly presence.) But the writers turn out amusing riffs on how historical figures might react to the present nice bits of business (like a tumble into an Escher painting) and a passable Passover joke.Its a chronically underachieving movie but relatively amusing in its quaint wish fulfillment.Rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for the wild rumpus to be expected from a museum coming alive.

Comments click to enlarge Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Video Rated PG  97 minutes  2014 Ben Stiller Steve Coogan Owen Wilson Ricky Gervais--all of them were considered edgy when they first arrived on the scene but for some performers an edge is just something you use to pry open the piggy bank. This third and last installment in the money-minting childrens franchise about museum figurines who magically come to life offers one brilliant special-effects sequence in which characters chase each other around the interlocking staircases of an M.C. Escher drawing. Otherwise the tone is set by a scene in which a monkey the size of a building directs a giant piss stream onto a miniature cowboy and centurion (Wilson and Coogan). This was the last feature for both Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams; among those who survived the experience are Rebel Wilson Ben Kingsley Bill Cobbs and Dick Van Dyke. Shawn Levy directed. By J.R.

Ben Stiller and crew go for the easy laughs spackling the cracks in their armor with a cavalcade of marquee-name cameos and one dizzying action scene after another. As Larry night guard at the Museum of Natural History who moonlights as impresario of statues come to life Stiller has a hefty new challenge on his hands A quest to keep a sacred tablet from crumbling and with it all of Larrys animated charges necessitates a trip to the British Museum in London with his posse. That includes Egyptian prince Akhmenrah (Rami Malek) Dexter the crazy capuchin monkey Larrys Neanderthal doppelganger (also played by Stiller the better to show off his chiseled biceps and triceps) thimble-sized cowpoke Jedediah (Owen Wilson) Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) and Teddy Roosevelt (a relatively low-key Robin Williams). While you get the feeling that Williams was just going through the motions his every moment onscreen is bittersweet to watch. An unnecessary annoyance This adventure is a total bro party. The only female character among the rescue squad Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) is figuratively as well as literally a wax figurine whose few lines are superfluous and forgettable. Which makes bubbleheaded irrepressible London guard Tilly (Rebel Wilson of ""Pitch Perfect"" fame) a godsend during the few scenes she shamelessly chews up. This movie could have used less Owen Wilson more Rebel Wilson. Between her dry quipster Steve Coogan as Octavius and former ""Downton Abbey"" milquetoast Dan Stevens as the impossibly handsome peevishly noble and rather dim Sir Lancelot the non-Yanks trounce the Americans in the funny department. (Ricky Gervais in his throwaway role as museum director Dr. McPhee doesnt count.) Simply tossing lots of frantic action scenes and celebrity artifact drive-bys into the sarcophagus -- like a fancy-footed Dick Van Dyke the late Mickey Rooney and Ben Kingsley -- cant hide the antiquated feel of a once-original concept. That said this threequel is the type of harmless escape fare that holiday-movie crowds go for in droves. Kerry Brown  20th Century Fox Night guard Larry (Ben Stiller center) is off on another adventure with statue-come-to-life museum pals including from left Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) Egyptian prince Akhmenrah (Rami Malek) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher).

Updated July 30 2016  353 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Third Night at the Museum is not so charming By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Dec 18 2014 (...) Comedy franchises are so cute when theyre young. But after a few years they start sassing their parents leaving their trash in public places and skipping school.Nobody expects the third ""Night at the Museum"" movie to be smart about history but if its going to be so lazy couldnt it at least be the class clown?The first of the films had an amusing premise. Night watchman Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) discovers that the exhibits at New Yorks Museum of Natural History come alive after closing time. Historical figures such as Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) step out of the displays while a skeletal tyrannosaurus runs amok. In the better second film Larry and the gang must rescue tiny diorama figures Jedediah and Octavius (Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan) from the Smithsonian where they meet Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams sadly missing here).In the tepid new ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" the magic that brings the characters to life is threatened by an ancient curse. Larry learns that former security guard and boyhood explorer Cecil (Dick Van Dyke in a scene that also features the late Mickey Rooney) had found an Egyptian tablet that the locals warned against taking to the museum. Now its set to wreak vengeance.Breaking the curse has something to do with the British Museum so Larry teen son Nicky (Skyler Gisondo) and the mannequins jet to London. (Presumably Attila the Hun and Sacajewea have valid passports.) Slapstick ensues involving a Pharaoh (Ben Kingsley) Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) and an amorous security guard (Rebel Wilson) who takes a shine to Laaa the Neanderthal (Stiller).The special effects remain good but the jokes are creaky the sentiments are forced and the pop-historical lessons are obligatory. Its as if the producers were check-listing the worlds great institutions without learning or caring what makes them special. Granted this series is primarily for kids but nobody should feel dumber after watching a movie with ""museum"" in the title.What ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 137  Content Mild action and some rude humor Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Photo Credit Kerry Brown advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The magic that brings a museums exhibits to life each night is in danger of fading forever. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Williams glows briefly in one of his final roles but the overall magic feels dim. CAST Ben Stiller Dan Stevens Robin Williams LENGTH 137 Theres a farewell feeling to ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" the third installment in the family-film franchise that began in 2006. Not just because museum guard Larry Daley played by Ben Stiller is trying to keep alive the magic that animates his favorite exhibits but because ""Secret of the Tomb"" is one of the last times well see Robin Williams who died this year. ""Secret of the Tomb"" opens with Larry now a high-level staffer at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan realizing that something is wrong with his living displays. The tiny Roman general Octavius and his cowboy friend Jedediah (Steve Coogan and Owen Wilson) are becoming destructive; the prince Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) keeps fainting; Teddy Roosevelt (Williams) starts spewing other presidents quotes (""Heck of a job Brownie""). It turns out that their life source an ancient tablet is beginning to corrode. advertisement | advertise on newsday There isnt much magic left in this franchise either. As Larry looks for answers in Londons British Museum ""Secret of the Tomb"" scrambles for new ways to freshen up its premise with mixed results. Ben Kingsley plays a pharaoh who is delighted to learn that Larry is Jewish (""We owned 40000 of them"") Rebel Wilson goofs around as a snarky British guard and Stiller does double duty as a Neanderthal named Laaa. The most appealing new figure is Dan Stevens of televisions ""Downton Abbey"" as Sir Lancelot who cant understand that he isnt really alive let alone a fictional personage. Like ""Toy Story 3"" and the final ""Harry Potter"" film ""Secret of the Tomb"" tugs at the heartstrings. If you do find yourself choking up its probably because the films themes of mortality and loss are underscored by Williams death. It used to be easy to get irritated by the actors sentimental streak -- the pursed smile the misty eyes -- but here donning granny glasses and a Rough Riders hat for the last time Williams will get to you. ""Secret of the Tomb"" ends with a dedication to him and to Mickey Rooney who briefly reprises his role from the original film.

Despite a few good jokes and sight gags and some amusing cameos you get the feeling that the series is played out. Part of the problem is that the films have been essentially one-joke efforts the joke being that at night the exhibitions at New Yorks Museum of Natural History and Washingtons Smithsonian come to life via special effects posing various comic problems for security guard Larry played by Ben Stiller. Stiller is back for ""Secret of the Tomb"" as is director Shawn Levy and some members of the supporting cast including Robin Williams Owen Wilson Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais. Dexter a Capuchin monkey with a penchant for mischief also returns. In an opening thats an Indiana Jones knockoff -- or homage if you prefer -- the movie introduces an ancient Egyptian gizmo thats central to the (minimal) plot. If the gizmo isnt repaired the living exhibitions will revert to their lifeless selves. To forestall disaster Larry and a group of regulars are required to take off for the British Museum allowing the movie to introduce a few new characters. Among those regulars are Teddy Roosevelt (Williams) the miniature cowboy Jedediah (Wilson) and the tiny centurion Octavius (Coogan). Two new characters stand out Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) who has a pretty good running gag of imitating Stillers facial expressions and Rebel Wilson as a zany security guard. Gervais acquits himself decently as the New York museums director. This was Williams last film and sadly his performance here is not a memorable one. The humor leans heavily on slapstick. But its also punctuated with entertaining cameos including a couple from well-known veteran actors who appeared in the earlier films. Best of all is the unexpected appearance of an especially capable song-and-dance man who will remain nameless in this review. On the level of shtick and spectacle younger audience members will be entertained by the antics of the cowboy-centurion buddy team and CGI fans will savor such effects as a three-handed battle scene set inside an M.C. Escher drawing. Otherwise this film is mainly for ""Night at the Museum"" diehards. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

(Twentieth Century Fox) By Michael OSullivan December 18 2014 The aptly subtitled ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" is a blast of dead air and mummified humor. Suitable only for children too young to remember the first two movies or too undiscerning to care about the level of wit represented by a urinating monkey this tepid retread should be the last item on your holiday list of movie options for the family right after ""Into the Woods"" ""The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies"" ""Unbroken"" and ""Annie."" Relocating the action of the story from New Yorks Museum of Natural History to the British Museum does nothing to resuscitate the creaky franchise which involves hijinks by a bunch of museum artifacts that have sprung to life. It was already moribund by its excursion to Washington in the second installment 2009s ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian."" Even Rebel Wilson playing a saucy cockney counterpart to Ben Stillers American museum guard Larry Daley isnt enough to shock the patient back to life. That said there are a few moments of genuine verve that spike up the generally flatlining plot in which Larry travels to London with such old standbys as Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) the aforementioned monkey and other refugees from museum dioramas back home. Chief among those moments are Larrys interactions with a caveman named La. Also played by Stiller -- whose prominent brow is well utilized in the rendering of Larrys dreadlocked Neanderthal doppelganger -- the almost entirely inarticulate La is a nice counterpart to Larrys wry deadpan. Another clever scene centers on the M.C. Escher print ""Relativity"" into whose optically illusory staircases Larry and the Arthurian knight Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) -- a denizen of the armor hall -- have tumbled in pursuit of the charmed Egyptian tablet that is at the center of all three films. Its a mildly cool special effect as is one involving several bronze lions that come alive only to chase the beam of Larrys flashlight like kittens. The best joke though is a cameo by one of Hollywoods biggest stars playing himself in a gently self-deprecating turn that takes place in the middle of a London theater production of ""Camelot."" I will leave the name unmentioned in hopes of preserving some modicum of surprise. Otherwise the movie is a recycling bin of bits worn out in the earlier films such as a sight gag involving a dinosaur skeleton that acts like a dog. Other than some stock establishing shots of London the British setting is wasted as are Ben Kingsley and Ricky Gervais who at times seem almost embarrassed to be caught on camera. The film ends with on-screen tributes to two actors who died after making ""Secret of the Tomb"" Williams and Mickey Rooney who appears briefly frail and in a wheelchair in a reprise of his role from the first film. The farewell doubles as a sweet send-off to a cash cow thats finally being put out to pasture after running out of milk -- and ideas -- two movies ago.  1/2 PG. Area theaters.

"Night at the Museum 3 review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox A scene from ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb."" A scene from ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb."" (Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The British Museum plays host to the magical out-of-towners. ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" otherwise known as ""Night at the Museum 3"" rates as more determinedly heartfelt than the first and not as witty as the second (and best). Also no Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart in jodhpurs this time around.""Night at the Museum 3"" closes out director Shawn Levys effects-driven family-friendly trilogy with three separate farewells. The most bittersweet parting involves the late Robin Williams. Its both touching and difficult to see Williams looking game but wan portray Teddy Roosevelt one last time as Teddy and his fellow Museum of Natural History dwellers (from Attila the Hun to the T-Rex nicknamed Rexy) travel to Londons British Museum in order to give the movie somewhere to go something to do new institutions to disrupt. Mickey Rooney constitutes another farewell (he died in April; Williams committed suicide in August). He turns up briefly as one of the devious night watchmen from the first picture now in a retirement home with his cohorts played by Dick Van Dyke and Bill Cobbs.The third farewell is to the series itself anchored by Ben Stiller as night guard Larry here upgraded to museum evening events planner animatronic division. Larry and company must discover why the magical Egyptian knickknack known as the Tablet of Ahkmenrah is on the fritz threatening the nocturnal lives of Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) and his pals. Off they go to England; only Ahkmenrahs parents (played by Ben Kingsley and Anjali Jay) can save the day. Levys film sets itself a low bar and then hurdles it. It begins badly with a misjudged action sequence of the gang ruining the reopening of the Hayden Planetarium. It then middles adequately and perks up near the end paradoxically by calming down and laying off the frantic slapstick. No one has any illusions about these movies. Their primary success ingredients are capuchin monkey urine and Stillers deadpan reactions to the latest amazement or indignity.In the new movie theres a pretty good relationship at the core that of single dad Larry and his restless teenager now played appealingly by Skyler Gisondo. Father/son issues abound in the script by David Guion and Michael Handelman. Fruitfully ""Night at the Museum 3"" introduces a new Neanderthal named Laaa played by Stiller. The caveman recognizes in Larry a distant but undeniable blood relative -- the dad (or really great-great-great-great-great-grandson) he never knew he was missing. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are back as the wee cowboy Jedediah and Roman warrior Octavius respectively; Mizuo Peck returns as Sacajawea as always distressingly light on narrative purpose. In the British Museum section of the story the most conspicuous newcomers are Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens of ""Downton Abbey"" amusingly narcissistic) and Rebel Wilson as a randy night guard who takes a shine to Laaa.Its a hectic pileup this movie but at least in its final laps it takes the time to say its goodbyes more or less properly.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 424 p.m. MST December 17 2014Ben Stiller returns for a third time as Larry the museum guard who knows that the displays come to life at night. He heads for London this time but even with a change of scenery the story is tired.Ben Stiller and Rebel Wilson star in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb.""(Photo Joe Lederer/20th Century Fox/AP)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)Ben Stiller returns but his Larry museum-guard character has grown grumpy.Theres a lot of comedy talent on display but they arent given much of interest to do.New characters arrive but theyre only there to serve the mayhem.""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" is a rather lackluster affair a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion.Then again a guy sitting nearby seemed to be weeping during a crucial scene between Ben Stiller and a monkey so what do I know? Sorry. A Capuchin monkey as Larry Stillers museum-guard character would grumpily correct.Larry is grumpy a lot these days it seems. Its kind of a weird way to play him but Stiller and director Shawn Levy are either going for a slightly different feel or just didnt pay much attention.This is the third film in the series and the wear and tear is beginning to show. The characters such as Robin Williams Teddy Roosevelt Steve Coogans tiny Octavius and Owen Wilsons wee Jedediah are back doing what they did in the first two movies. Its kind of cute and occasionally funny but really at this point it feels a little tired.This time around the Tablet of Ahkmenrah which you may recall is what brings the displays at the American Museum of Natural History to life has begun to rapidly corrode and its causing everything to go haywire. (As with many things how and why arent explained nor is the limited duration of the effects.)Whatever the problem is the solution resides at the British Museum in London. Thats where Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) and Shepseheret (Anjali Jay) -- the parents of Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) -- are housed. Merenkahre knows the secrets of the tablet so Larry heads off across the ocean with his son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) in tow; he ships Ahkmenrah over as well.About that son Larry thinks Nick isnt making wise choices about his future (he wants to be a DJ in Ibiza). So a fair amount of father-son bonding is included here. It doesnt really fit (though Gisondo is good) but a computer-generated distraction lurks around every corner to take your mind off all that.Of course Teddy Octavius and Jedediah arrive as stowaways along with Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) and Dexter the monkey -- as well as Laaa a Neanderthal who bears a striking resemblance to Larry (as he must; Stiller also plays him).Larry has no trouble slipping past Tilly (Rebel Wilson) the guard. The tablet activates the displays in London too so theyre joined by Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) who thinks of it all as part of the quest for the Holy Grail. Stevens is pretty funny particularly when he wanders into a stage production of ""Camelot"" starring a game Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve.But ultimately he like everyone else in the movie serves simply to add to the romping around. The solution to the problem with the tablet is surprisingly pedestrian but then complexity isnt something Levy is looking for. A monkey urinating on people is.And Levy gets what he wants. The question is do we? The answer is not really.This is a highly talented cast (though the film really misses Hank Azaria who was in the last one). And you cant help but be a little moved by Williams in his last appearance or Mickey Rooney who also died before the film was released.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Blind armless Roman statues writhing under the beam of a flashlight. Reanimated mummies frantically banging their linen-wrapped fists against display-case glass. Squads of faceless mannequins marching in Confederate uniform. If nothing else Night At The Museum Secret Of The Tomb is a reminder that a lot of popular kids entertainment could easily pass for the stuff of childrens nightmares. Plenty of great films have toed the line between fantasy and horror. (See the collected works of Joe Dante.) Secret Of The Tomb isnt one of them though a viewer cant help but be impressed by how the movie manages to run through the full spectrum of morbid pre-teen obsessions--mummies Pompeii disfigurement being buried alive--without ever registering as anything more than routine family matinee fodder. And yet its a heck of a weird movie in which characters are able to leap into M.C. Eschers Relativity a la Looney Tunes Back In Action Ben Stiller plays dual roles as a millionaire night-shift guard and a magically animated wax caveman made in his likeness and assorted inanimate objects and artworks are brought to life but then left ignorant in ways that are a little bit unsettling. The plot--in short an ancient Egyptian tablet that brings museum exhibits to life is snatched by a wax figure of Lancelot (Dan Stevens) who escapes in search of a West End revival of Camelot--is a school-field-trip daydream dosed with inadvertent creepiness. (The model for this and prior Night At The Museum movies is Joe Johnstons Jumanji itself a kind of Hellraiser for kids.)Director Shawn Levy cut his teeth on 90s Nickelodeon nostalgia staples like Animorphs and The Secret World Of Alex Mack and in many ways his Night At The Museum movies carry on that eras pre-Hunger Games sensibilities; pitched at 10-year-old kids rather than 10-year-old teenagers they might as well be soundtracked by the crinkling of a 100-page Scholastic Press paperback. They traffic in the kind of reassuringly idealized version of adulthood that carries over from picture books into chapter books where grown-ups are defined by their jobs (preferably uniformed) and the old are happy to live in retirement homes. Having sold off his business at the end of Night At The Museum Battle Of The Smithsonian and returned to his job at the American Museum Of Natural History Larry Daley (Stiller) discovers that the tablet which brings the museums exhibits to life after dark is losing its magic causing his assorted taxidermy and undead pals to go berserk and attack patrons. After consulting with former night-shift guard Cecil (Dick Van Dyke) Larry learns that the secret to restoring the tablet was known only to Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) whose mummy is on display in London. Cue ""London Calling"" and Larry sneaking into the British Museum accompanied by his teenage son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) the aforementioned caveman and most of the cast of the previous Night At The Museum movies. Compared to the cameo-packed Battle Of The Smithsonian Secret Of The Tomb is fleet and straightforward--or about as fleet and straightforward as a movie in which a dozen characters of varying size and intelligibility chase after a magic tablet can be. Having found Merenkhare but lost the tablet to a Lancelot who when delusional believes that he exists (a lot to unpack there) Larry and the gang give chase. As sunrise inches closer the wax-figure members of the crew find their limbs stiffening their eyes turning to glass and their minds fading into the museum-exhibit version of Alzheimers. (In the case of Teddy Roosevelt--played by Robin Williams in his final live-action role--that means cycling through broad impressions of other U.S. presidents.)Friends losing control of their senses and attacking each other; the aging process represented by live actors turning into inanimate objects; a characters wax nose melting into a foot-long drip after standing too close to a flame; tiny diorama-sized people being trapped in a scale model of the destruction of Pompeii--frankly there isnt a whole lot about this scenario that isnt disturbing on some level. Secret Of The Tomb plays it as a source of corny jokes pop-culture references and father-son bonding moments. In other words its exactly the kind of film that shouldnt be expected to engage with its assorted bizarre subtexts--but what a movie it could be if it did.

The living exhibits go to London to find a secret power. Director Shawn Levy (137). PG. Area theaters. Theres a serenity to museum visits especially if its a place you know and love. ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" amazingly recaptures that feeling in big-studio franchise form. There are big special effects of course but refreshingly this third (and final?) movie in the franchise is like a pleasant stroll through familiar halls. Which is not to say ""Tomb"" is dull -- but it is surprisingly mellow for a madcap race against time. In the original 2006 film Natural History Museum night guard Larry (Ben Stiller) learned about an Egyptian tablet that brings the institutions wax figures to life every night. The new film opens as Larry prepares to show off the effect for a crowd of well-heeled donors. But something has gone wrong with the relic making Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams); tiny pals cowboy Jed (Owen Wilson) and Roman emperor Octavius (Steve Coogan); Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck); Prince Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek); Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher); the capuchin monkey Dexter; and the others act strangely. The mystical tablet is corroding and only Ahkmenrahs father on exhibit at a British Museum can tell them how to fix it. So off they go taking along Larrys teenage son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) to learn that the tablet needs moonlight or else all the wax heroes -- ours and Larrys best friends for these last eight years -- will go back to lifelessness. Thats it thats the whole quest. But several small treats will keep kids (and their parents) from getting antsy including a fun chase inside of an M.C. Escher staircase painting a scene with Dexter running around with a phone strapped to his back a nice scene where Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) stage-rushes Hugh Jackman as he performs ""Camelot"" in the West End and an appearance by Ben Kingsley as the elder Pharaoh. The new Night at the Museum is the last major film for the late Robin Williams (above as Teddy Roosevelt with Ben Stiller). (Twentieth Century Fox) This is also the final major movie Williams made and its a sweet cinematic goodbye to the late star. Stiller provides heart as Larry but also some nasty dreadlocks as Laaa a new Neanderthal who looks like him. At one point Stiller rants and gestures like prehensile man -- and Laaa mirrors his every move. Its a scene that will earn Stiller a permanent spot in a future museum of silliness. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Joe Lederer/ Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. MOVIE REVIEW Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Running time 97 minutes. Rated PG (some mildly scary sequences; a urinating monkey). At the Empire 34th St. others. For piquing kids interest in history and nature you could do worse than this goofy Ben Stiller franchise. But its third installment is more meh than manic too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors. You get the feeling returning director Shawn Levy is ready to hang it up. An Egyptian tablet that makes the museums inhabitants come alive -- as theyve done in the first two films -- is on the fritz so Stillers night watchman character Larry heads to the British Museum to solicit repair advice from its original owner a pharaoh played by Ben Kingsley (an amusing flip from his other role this season as a Hebrew leader in ""Exodus""). Joining Stiller are regulars Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan as tiny cowboy and Roman figurines and the late Robin Williams in one of his last roles as Teddy Roosevelt. The scene in which his character bids farewell before turning back into wax attains an outsize poignancy for obvious reasons. Theres also a final appearance from Mickey Rooney another recurring character who pops up alongside Dick Van Dyke and Ricky Gervais museum director early on. Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) left and Tilly (Rebel Wilson).Photo Joe Lederer/2014 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation London brings Rebel Wilson as Stillers UK counterpart doing her still-pretty-funny swagger shtick and Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") as a handsome if underwritten Sir Lancelot. Stiller puts in one of the movies funniest performances as a Neanderthal version of himself a coincidental lookalike who takes a monosyllabic shine to Larry (and with whom Wilsons character is smitten). British Museum wonders spring to life of course; some eye-catchers are a grouchy triceratops skeleton and newly awakened Greek statues missing various limbs. One dynamic animated chase sequence takes place inside M.C. Eschers famous lithograph ""Relativity"" with characters tumbling about on staircases to nowhere. But too often the action comes to a screeching halt to indulge a plot line in which Larrys teen son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) argues with his dad about wanting to take a year off before college. What appeal this could possibly have to the films two main demographics is beyond me; life after high school will either be a distant concept or so far in the past itll make them feel like artifacts themselves.

"Review Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb a ho-hum sequel - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb a ho-hum sequelBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 12/17/2014 021503 PM PSTUpdated 12/17/2014 061202 PM PSTThere were a couple of moments in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" featuring the late Robin Williams that likely will strike a chord of emotion for his fans. Seeing the iconic comedian for the last time on the big screen (he has a voice role in ""Absolutely Anything"" which comes out in 2015) might be enough to draw some people to the theater.Thats about it.Unless of course youre a big fan of the franchise. Then by all means hand over the debit card and usher the family in to see the third and presumably last ""Night at the Museum"" flick. However this one isnt a lot different than the others except it comes with a British accent. Its got the same dinosaur gags same obnoxious monkey same overwhelmed Ben Stiller and same unexplainable character dynamics. In other words it delivers the same experience which will probably be more appreciated by the kids.The only difference is that its pretty obvious this is the last one both in application (really -- theres no way any studio would go back to this well again) and plot-wise (I wont spoil the ending for you but seeing Williams in the last few moments is as sad as you think it will be -- especially in the way the film wraps up the story).So the gang is back but the source of their late-night mojo (what essentially turns a museum into a party every night) is running out of juice and the only guy who can fix it happens to be in an exhibit in the British Museum. So Stillers night watchman character Larry Daley -- when hes not spending time nagging his 18-year-old son in a mostly unnecessary side plot -- works to get the magical Egyptian tablet and his buddies to London past a security officer (a semi-funny Rebel Wilson clearly constrained by the PG rating) to find Ahkmenrahs (Rami Malek) father Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) who was there centuries back when the magic tablet was made.Advertisement The movie begins with a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-like scene with British and American archeologists discovering the tablet in the Egyptian desert. A young boy on that journey happened to grow up to be a night watchman at the New York Museum of Natural History which gives director Shawn Levy an excuse to send Larry to the rest home where the three conniving watchmen from the first film are retired (a still-spry Dick Van Dyke Bill Cobbs and the late Mickey Rooney in his final film). Then its off to England and another gauntlet of historical figures and fierce animals that have come alive for the first time once the sun goes down and the tablet is within range. Our heroes run into another dinosaur needing taming a big concrete serpent that comes to life and the dashing and handsome Lancelot (Dan Stevens of ""Downton Abbey"") who while brave and gallant and all that doesnt turn out to be as helpful as he initially seems.The franchises charm is still there. Really theres little to dislike about historical characters coming alive at night and going on adventures involving magic and friendship and a mild layer of amusement (grunting Attila the Hun played by Patrick Gallagher is still worth a few laughs). And this one does produce a satisfying (if some what sad and predictable) ending mostly because of Williams who again plays Teddy Roosevelt with solid vigor.The problem is that weve seen it all before. Sometimes the best thing we can say about a movie rehash like this is its not bad. Stiller is playing the character he plays all too often in movies the nice down-on-his-luck everyguy with something to prove who is usually relegated to rolling his eyes and going with the flow. Stiller does have some fun playing Larrys Neanderthal doppelganger a new character thats mildly amusing. But Levy -- who directed all three movies -- just couldnt muster up enough freshness to make this installment stand out from others. Even a last chance to see the legendary Williams on screen isnt enough to make this ""Museum"" worth the price of admission.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb   Rating PG (mild action some rude humor and brief language)Cast Ben Stiller Robin Williams Owen Wilson Dan Stevens Ben Kingsley Rebel Wilson Steve CooganDirector Shawn LevyRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Ben Stiller and Rebel Wilson go for a romp in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb.""(Photo Joe Lederer AP)The third installment of the Night at the Museum franchise Secret of the Tomb is better than its predecessors funnier and more adventurous thanks to a visit across the pond to the British Museum.Another factor in its appeal is the bittersweet pleasure of seeing Robin Williams who died this summer on screen again. His third performance as Teddy Roosevelt is heartrending -- low-key and genially funny in a way that seems all the more poignant given his larger-than-life persona.Mickey Rooney also has a small affable part in the action comedy ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide).Where the previous films felt frenetic and forced this outing feels breezier more enjoyable and less contrived. Though fitfully funny its appropriate for the whole family offering a limited but kid-friendly sense of history.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Ben Stiller and crew are back in Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb. The gang travels to London to try and find answers after their museum magic begins to run out. Ben Stiller reprises his role as Larry Daley newly promoted from night guard to director of nighttime operations at New Yorks American Museum of Natural History. The exhibits continue to come to life after the sun goes down as they did in the first Museum movie in 2006.This time around after the exhibits go haywire at a black-tie gala in the Hayden Planetarium Larry embarks on a quest to save the museum and ensure that the magic that enlivens the animals and characters in the exhibits remains intact. (The public believes its done with smoke and mirrors and animatronics.)Turns out the ancient enchanted Egyptian tablet of Ahkmenrah responsible for bringing the exhibits to life is beginning to deteriorate. The only answer for restoring it appears to lie within the British Museum in London.So Larry and his son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) transport key characters to the U.K. for more nighttime hijinks.The film has a subplot involving father-son bonding between Larry and Nick and the Natural History Museums Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) and his British Museum-based pharaoh father Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley).The films flashback opening features an Indiana Jones-style archaeological find that eventually leads to spry former museum official Cecil played with verve by Dick Van Dyke.Dexter the Capuchin monkey continues to smack Larry around and piddle about but the ultra-silly slapstick scenes are blessedly kept to a minimum. Theres also an after-dusk romance between a hirsute Neanderthal that looks eerily like Larry (played also by Stiller) and Tilly (Rebel Wilson) the night guard at the British Museum.Capers involve Lancelot (Downton Abbeys Dan Stevens) -- new to the series -- who believes the tablet is his much-coveted Holy Grail. A funny segment involves him charging onto a West End stage during a performance of Camelot with Hugh Jackman (or ""Huge Ackman"" as he calls him).The earlier less-worthy movies spurred museum attendance in New York and launched a nighttime sleepover program at the Natural History Museum that continues. Hopefully this episode filled as it is with comic talent and visual dazzle will have the same effect in London. 22 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1AIewNg",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/17/night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb-review/19156899/,200,nightatthemuseumsecretofthetomb23,nightatthemuseumsecretofthetomb,usatoday

Were supposed to see them out of duty and then write stuff like ""Its OK for the kiddies if you must."" I admit to turning a blind eye to their tendency to get excessively noisy or manic. I just...like...them. Its a pleasure to see what Big Hollywood comes up with when writers production designers and special-effects people are turned loose and challenged to conjure new ideas for what dinosaur bones Teddy Roosevelt statues and Native American maidens modeled out of synthetic material are wont to do when theyre given the gift of life. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The third installment Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb may be the best and even the generally wound-too-tight Ben Stiller -- once again playing a bemused Museum of Natural History guard -- is easy to tolerate. This time around it turns out that the very thing that allows the museums creatures and historical peeps to get up and move around -- a magical golden tablet from ancient Egypt -- has gone out of whack. For some reason Ive already forgotten Stiller needs to go to the British Museum to get things straightened out. This is a good thing because in London there are more and possibly cooler treasures just itching to stretch their legs A blue faience hippo lumbers about happily and a brass Chinese serpent-demon comes to life like a brilliant Ray Harryhausen nightmare.The resuscitated human beings arent half bad either Dan Stevens makes a dashing if bumbling Sir Lancelot. Stiller has a wonderful bit in which the Neanderthal who idolizes him -- played by Stiller himself wearing a prosthetic brow bone and a set of fabulously decrepit fake choppers -- shadows his every move. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan once again make a superb squabbling cowboy-and-centurion duo. And even though reprising his role as the Bull Moose Robin Williams does all of his usual twinkling this time theres something deeply moving about it Secret of the Tomb sends him rough-riding into that good night and its not a bad way to go.Film Details Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time97 min.

After all a museum is a place of learning not just a playground for wacky night watchman Ben Stiller and his gang of mystically revivified exhibits. And yet as the team travel to London to find out whats gone wrong with their magical Egyptian tablet the most worthy figure from British history the writers can think to reincarnate is - wait for it - King Arthurs knight Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens). Sure the script takes pains to point out that hes fictional but still. No Shakespeare? No Liz the First? Just a mythical sidekick? Anyway rant over in all other respects this is the first two movies half-heartedly reheated with an added layer of accidental poignancy thanks to the star appearance of one Robin Williams. He at least emerges with some dignity.

(Video) Steven Spielberg Chris Columbus Bill Cosby React to Robin Williams Shocking Death Pitch Perfect 2 Trailer Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Take on the World (Video) ""Secret of the Tomb"" tries for ""Toy Story 3"" levels of emotion but the signs at this ""Museum"" might as well read ""Do Not Be Touched"" An early scene in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" features an archivist played by the great Andrea Martin playing Candy Crush Saga on her computer. Had the camera remained over Martins shoulder watching her continue to do so for 97 minutes the film would probably have upped its quotient of laughs suspense and genuine emotion. But no instead we have to follow a plainly bored-looking Ben Stiller to London ostensibly to fix the magic tablet that makes all the museum exhibits come alive at night but really to put a button on this shrill kiddie franchise by turning it into a trilogy and suddenly pretending that the prospect of saying farewell to these characters will offer the emotional heft of ""Toy Story 3."" See video Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Trailer Ben Stiller Meets Sir Lancelot From Downton Abbey (Video) The previous chapter of this saga at the very least provided the entertainment factor of Amy Adams playing Amelia Earhart like a screwball comedy ingenue and Hank Azaria channeling Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett as a devious Egyptian monarch. This time were treated to Rebel Wilson as a family-friendly version of Fat Amy from ""Pitch Perfect"" and Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot; the latters preening machismo stops being funny after about three minutes and instead leads to sad thoughts about poor Lady Mary being forced to raise a child on her own at Downton Abbey. Theres the usual chasing and pratfalling and whatnot as Stillers museum guard Larry -- he also does double duty by playing a Neanderthal but the less said about that the better -- tries to figure out why the tablet is disintegrating. ""Secret of the Tomb"" replaces the non-stop frantic action of earlier installments with Larrys troubles as a divorced dad what with son Nick (Skyler Gisondo ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"") wanting to go DJ in Ibiza rather than attend college. Because when young children go to see a movie about dinosaur skeletons and a capuchin monkey (Crystal acting circles around Stiller) who come alive at night in a museum what they really want is to hear a divorced dad nagging his teen son about the value of an education. If the previous ""Museum"" adventures had laid the groundwork for this sort of emotional subplot it would be one thing but to suddenly care about the life choices of a character whos basically the straight man to a tiny cowboy (Owen Wilson) and a tiny Roman centurion (Steve Coogan) and Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) feels like a massive miscalculation. Also read Robin Williams Leaves Behind Four Movies Including Night at the Museum 3 Perhaps director Shawn Levy was still in bourgeois family crisis mode after making the similarly unmoving and unfunny ""This Is Where I Leave You"" or perhaps Stiller insisted on a more fleshed-out character before accepting one last paycheck for this series. Either way its hard to get invested in the father-son dynamic here even it when it represents a diversion from the limp comedy bits and the flatlined suspense. See video Ben Stiller Hangs With Adam Driver Amanda Seyfried in First While Were Young Trailer (Video) There are a few scattered moments of enjoyment whether its a topsy-turvy chase scene in an M.C. Escher painting or Ben Kingsley and Anjali Jay as rulers whose Pharaoh privilege blinds them to the fact that the Hebrews didnt enjoy their bondage. (Kingsley gets more to do in a few quick scenes here than in the entirety of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" go figure.) Sadly ""Secret of the Tomb"" also offers some of our last big-screen moments with Williams and Mickey Rooney; both receive a tribute in the closing credits. The this-is-where-I-leave-the-museum subplot gains poignancy only by virtue of Williams untimely passing this year but in a movie like this you have to take the lumps in your throat wherever you can get them.

The past may be immortal but not so the reanimating magic that turns New Yorks American Museum of Natural History into a dusk-to-dawn happy hour for dinosaurs and Neanderthals explorers and conquerors and a capuchin monkey with an overactive bladder. Such is the dilemma this motley crew (once more under the leadership of Ben Stillers harried night watchman) faces in ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" a most enjoyable capper to director Shawn Levy and producer Chris Columbus cheerfully silly and sneakily smart family-entertainment juggernaut. A fond farewell to the series and to two of its stars -- Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams -- ""Tomb"" offers little in the way of secrets of surprises but should add much holiday cheer to Foxs box-office coffers. The ""Night"" movies havent much endeared themselves to highbrow critics -- among those whove even bothered to write about them -- but its easy to understand the popular appeal of the franchise (987 million worldwide and counting) which has cannily married state-of-the-art special effects to a high-concept premise (loosely adapted from Croatian author Milan Trencs 1993 childrens book) located halfway between ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure."" At the same time the films -- especially the 2006 original (scripted by ""Reno 911"" alums Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant) -- have entertained a slyly subversive commentary on Americans and their relationship to history. In the first film the AMNH was in the midst of declining attendance and budget cuts until word  got out about the institutions enchanted nighttime special effects -- the Disneyfication of history if you will -- and lines formed around the block. And while he was the nominal hero of the piece Stillers Larry Daley was initially depicted as something of an ignoramus who mistook Christopher Columbus for Galileo and Sacagawea for a deaf-mute. It seemed fascinating that such an august institution would allow itself (and its public) to be thusly depicted in a major Hollywood movie -- except that in an equally fascinating convergence of life and art the movie sparked a 20 percent uptick in real-life museum attendance along with a new nighttime sleepover program that continues to this day. That satiric edge was dulled only slightly in the 2009 sequel ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" as a still-beleaguered AMNH willingly divested itself of some of its venerable exhibits to make room for high-tech holographic avatars supposedly more appealing to the smartphone generation (an all-too-believable depiction of how calcified arts-administration types tend to think). So its unsurprising that ""Secret of the Tomb"" brings things full circle by suggesting gently but persistently that the true magic of history needs no hocus-pocus accoutrements. The path to such enlightenment is paved with 90-odd minutes of CGI-enhanced slapstick mayhem starting with a black-tie dinner from hell -- a gala reopening of the Hayden Planetarium during which the museums lauded ""animatronics"" (as the public believes them to be) go haywire pitting Manhattans philanthropic elite against a rampaging T-Rex and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher). Something is amiss it seems with the gilded Tablet of Akmenrah the ancient Egyptian relic responsible for the museums mysterious powers (here seen being excavated during a 1930s archeological dig in a lavish Indiana Jones-style flashback). Solving the mystery entails making a trip to the British Museum home of Akmenrahs parents Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) and Shepseheret (Anjali Jay). (What the p.c. anti-""Exodus"" brigade will make of the fact that the British-Indian Kingsley cast as an Israelite elder in that movie plays a pharaoh here is anyones guess.) Of course a new museum means a raft of other new characters the standouts being ""Downton Abbey"" alum Dan Stevens as a vainglorious Sir Lancelot and Rebel Wilson (clearly constrained by the movies PG rating) as the BMs sex-starved night guard. Mostly though ""Secret of the Tomb"" serves as a reunion of old friends like the Lilliputian-sized cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and Roman general Octavius (Steve Coogan) who find themselves deposited in a scale-model Pompeii (Coogans second visit to the volcanic site this year after ""The Trip to Italy""); and single dad Larrys only child Nick (Skyler Gisondo replacing Jake Cherry) now a moody teen with dreams of becoming an EDM DJ in Ibiza. And if the ""Night at the Museum"" movies are undeniably the sort of work an actor like Coogan takes so that he can afford to make Michael Winterbottom movies -- or in Stillers case work with Noah Baumbach -- the actors nonetheless conjure a warm infectious esprit de corps. Stiller in particular gets to stretch his comic muscles this time by also playing Laaa the latest addition to the museums group of fire-questing Neanderthals who recognizes in Larry a shared genetic connection (the challenges of parenthood being another of the franchises running themes). Levy keeps the London scenes moving at a breezy clip especially once Lancelot convinced that the tablet is actually his coveted Holy Grail absconds into the night ... and onto the stage of a West End revival of Lerner and Loewes ""Camelot."" But as before the movies heart of avuncular wisdom is Teddy Roosevelt played grandly by Williams who couldnt have known this would be one of his last performances yet gives the film an undeniably elegiac touch as noble Teddy diminished by the tablets waning power watches his own extremities turn back into useless wax. Finally Levy and the writers (David Guion Michael Handelman and Mark Friedman) find an out that is at once sweet and sorrowful a closing of the door while still leaving it open just a crack and an altogether satisfying end to a series that has been vastly more entertaining than it had any reason to be. ""Tomb"" is filled with nifty visual gags the best of which is a three-way duel set inside M.C. Eschers physics-defying lithograph ""Relativity"" (a nod to the delirious museum chase from Joe Dantes ""Looney Tunes Back in Action""). Production values are typically topnotch especially the work of returning d.p. Guillermo Navarro who bathes the London scenes in a radiant blue moonlight and VFX supervisor Erik Nashs Oscar-shortlisted effects which achieve a rare seamlessness of practical and computer-generated elements.

Well it will be fun to see him anyway. Reply Scott Foundas says December 14 2014 at 1228 pm A brief cameo (same for Van Dyke and Cobbs) but a welcome one nonetheless.

TWITTER Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Robin Williams and the gang reunite for one final exhibit Its been eight years since the exhibits first came to life in high-concept low-brow Night at the Museum and after itself exhibiting a bit more life with a peppy 2009 sequel the franchise is seriously showing its age with what is purported to be its final installment. Despite relocating across the pond to the esteemed British Museum the creaky Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb fails to capitalize on the comic potential provided by that change of venue. Instead it plays like a contractual obligation with original director Shawn Levy Ben Stiller and company (including Robin Williams in his final screen performance) content to simply reprise the funnier bits from the previous two movies. Read More Ben Stiller and Robin Williams Face Demons in Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb Poster While the dispiritingly dull poorly-paced upshot will probably still unearth untold riches for 20th Century Fox (the first two Museum outings earned some 988 million between them) its still a shame the franchise couldnt have gone out on a more energetic note. After an Indiana Jones-style prologue set in 1938 the action moves to present day where recently-promoted director of nighttime operations Larry Daley (Stiller) discovers those life-like exhibits have developed a disturbing glitch. Tracing the cause to the Ahkmenrahs (Rami Malek) rapidly corroding golden tablet Daley makes a pilgrimage to London accompanied by his son Nicky (with Skyler Gisondo taking over from Jake Cherry) to confer with Ahkmenrahs dad (the always welcome Ben Kingsley). But even with added attractions Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) Rebel Wilson (as a bubbly security guard) and a bunch of cameos including Hugh Jackman and Andrea Martin the film still feels like a tired relic. Theres also an undeniable element of melancholy in seeing Williams (reprising his Teddy Roosevelt) in his swan song and even though the script by David Guion and Michael Handelman (Dinner for Schmucks) doesnt give him much to do he looks tired throughout. The film also marks the penultimate appearance of the late Mickey Rooney briefly reunited here along with Dick Van Dyke and Ernest Tubbs. Read More Shawn Levy Exits Warner Bros. Minecraft Even when Stiller and director Levy attempt to do something different here like having Stiller also play the part of his prehistoric ancestor the clearly improvised interplay fails to match some of the welcome goofy irreverence provided by Hank Azaria and Jonah Hill back at the Smithsonian.
