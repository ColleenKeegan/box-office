"Hail Caesar - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Hail Caesar Posted by Christy Lemire on February 18 2016 1 Comment Universal Pictures Rated PG-13 for some suggestive content and smoking. Running time 106 minutes. Three stars out of four. The Coen brothers -- my favorite filmmakers I should mention at the outset -- have always been hit-and-miss when it comes to straight-up comedies. For every ""Raising Arizona"" or ""The Big Lebowski"" theres an ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or ""The Ladykillers."" All their films have some element of comedy in them of course usually of the dark variety. Even their violent films (""Fargo"" ""No Country for Old Men"") and dramas (""Inside Llewyn Davis"" ""A Serious Man"") feature several moments that make you laugh for the sheer brilliance of their absurdity. Their latest ""Hail Caesar"" is their giddiest comedy to date but its also hit-and-miss within itself. And no this review wont merely serve as a celebration of Joel and Ethan Coens prodigious cinematic output although that would be appropriate given what their new movie is about. ""Hail Caesar"" is an exuberant embrace of Golden-Age Hollywood gliding smoothly through various classic genres over a day in the life of a harried studio executive. Working with their longtime cinematographer the great Roger Deakins the Coens richly recreate a series of fake films which you easily could imagine were real -- and some of them youll wish you actually could see. Those are the thrilling knowing winking highlights of ""Hail Caesar"" which takes place in 1951.  Heres Channing Tatum doing his best Gene Kelly impression as a lonely sailor in a beautifully choreographed fluidly shot dance number (which takes a turn you might not expect -- thats the Coensy humor element at work). Theres Scarlett Johansson brassy in an Esther Williams-style bathing-beauty extravaganza (and heres where Deakins gets to have an unusual amount of fun with Technicolor shades of red yellow and blue). And then theres Coens regular George Clooney as the venerable yet gullible star of the titular film a sword-and-sandal epic thats meant to be the fictional studios year-end prestige picture. (The whole thing is called ""Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ"" one of many examples of the brothers encyclopedic knowledge of and love for classic film. That was the full title of ""Ben-Hur."") I actually wouldnt have minded an entire film of ""Merrily We Danced"" complete with behind-the-scenes turmoil. Its a witty British drawing-room comedy featuring the sweetly guileless Western actor Hobie Doyle (an enormously magnetic Alden Ehrenreich) whos got a winning screen presence as long as he doesnt have to open his mouth. Ralph Fiennes is the fastidious and precise director Laurence Laurentz who steadily loses his patience with the twangy actor whos been thrust upon him. (Just watch the second trailer for ""Hail Caesar"" and tell me you dont want more of this.) It would have been divine to see more of all these supporting players and more including Jonah Hill in a small but intriguing role as a lawyer renowned for his trustworthiness (ha ha). This is all a very long way of saying that the individual films within the film work like gangbusters. Vivid distinct and lively they were obviously made with great craft affection and attention to detail. Its the through-line tying them all together that tends to bog things down. Josh Brolin stars as a studio fixer named Eddie Mannix -- whos actually not based on the real-life studio fixer Eddie Mannix -- a family man and devout Catholic. (The film begins and ends with Mannix making his daily confession of nothing terribly earth-shattering to a vaguely annoyed priest; the streaks of light splitting the booths darkness reveal Deakins at his visually dramatic best.) ""Hail Caesar"" follows Mannix as he tries to keep various simmering crises from boiling over. Theres the terrible casting of Doyle; the increasingly obvious pregnancy of Johanssons starlet DeeAnna Moran; and most pressingly the kidnapping of Clooneys character Baird Whitlock by a shadowy group calling itself The Future. Mannix must tend to all these troubles and more while simultaneously trying to hide them from a pair of inquisitive identical-twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker. (Tilda Swinton does crisp and distinctive double duty as a Hedda Hopper figure and she gets to wear twice the number of gorgeously tailored dresses and hats from the Coens longtime costume designer Mary Zophres). As is often the case in the Coen brothers films religion comes into play not only in Mannixs Catholicism but also in the film-within-the-film ""Hail Caesar"" and in the notion that movies provide something to believe in -- a sense of guidance reliability and hope. This would serve as an excellent double feature with the Coens 2009 film ""A Serious Man"" their semi-autobiographical tale of a Midwestern husband and father (the great Michael Stuhlbarg) struggling to keep his seemingly normal suburban life from spiraling out of control. Both focus on men who trudge along trying to do the right thing in a sea of corruption and selfishness and who rely on their faith to steer them in the right direction when theyre feeling hopelessly lost. Brolins story isnt as flashy or fascinating as the fake films that bring ""Hail Caesar"" so vibrantly to life meandering and tinged with melancholy as it is. And maybe the conclusion -- which is abrupt and unsatisfying -- is intended as such compared to the neatly packaged Hollywood endings that mark the made-up movies in ""Hail Caesar"" (They do this a lot you know -- the ambiguous ending. Often it works and provokes thought and discussion. This time it just kinda ... ends.) Then again maybe this is one of the siblings movies that require repeated viewings to ""get"" what they intended truly. Just to watch Channing Tatum tap-dance on a table top again itd be worth the time investment.

Spent this afternoon with a room full of folks my age watching Hail Caesar. We laughed in all the same places. Ironic dialog meant we had to really pay attention. So typical of the Coen brothers. Such fun thinking back on the 50s tabloids to divine what real life actor/actress was being parodied. The kidnapping plot was HILARIOUS. George Clooney sitting in the living room alone when Monty walks in. HAHAHAHAHA. Particularly interesting the vignettes werent over the top like the MGM musicals. I missed that. The color especially Mannixs scenes slightly white washed. The sets less opulent than movies of that era . . . the boardroom for example seemed bare. Nice touch portraits of actors on the wall but no other accouterments of the era - glasses carafes. Mannixs office too was stark. Not enough papers on his desk. Too neat for a busy man. Only because Id read the movie ending left a lot to be desired I watched Mannixs story closely. I think we got a full story from him. He was overworked. Couldnt keep his promises. Did a bang up job and wondered if the grass might be greener elsewhere. Liked his storyline. The whole thing was a hoot. Id see it again in a flash. Nice love letter to old Hollywood.

Entertainment The New Coen Brothers Movie Is About A Time When Everyone Was In Some Sort Of Closet The Coen brothers new comedy is a delightful but not romantic ode to a time when Hollywood manufactured stars and kept them on a tight leash. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > George Clooney in Hail Caesar Alison Cohen Rosa / Universal Pictures ID 7939439 Hollywood has never been a warm and well-behaved place but there was a time when that was the story it used to tell. Studios created stars and essentially owned them hiring up-and-comers and inventing an image for them making them over changing their names to more glamorous (and sometimes less ethnic) ones setting them up on dates with other celebrities and doing their best to make their scandals disappear. Basically it was Baby youre a star -- now sign this morality clause and agree youll never be seen in public without a full face of makeup.This degree of submission to someone elses branding efforts can feel far removed in our current world in which Kanye West is free to proclaim directly over Twitter that hes not into butt stuff. But theres definitely a retro kick to be gotten from the gap between who these performers actually were and the glamorous personas that were hawked to the public. It was an era in which everyone was in some sort of closet. View this image > Scarlett Johansson in Hail Caesar Alison Cohen Rosa / Universal Pictures ID 7939454 Hail Caesar revels in that gap in Scarlett Johansson as a picture-perfect Esther Williams-style aqua musical star who once out of the water has the ""fish ass"" of her mermaid costume pried off while smoking and matter-of-factly discussing who the studio should arrange for her to marry now that shes pregnant. It delights in George Clooney as a philandering drunk of an A-lister whos utterly unfazed to find himself waking up in a strangers house even after hes told that he didnt black out; he actually was drugged and kidnapped. And it takes joy -- so much joy -- in scene-stealing Alden Ehrenreich as a drawling cowboy savant who gamely goes along with the Capital Pictures recasting of him as a dramatic actor despite being desperately uncomfortable when taken off a horse and placed in a drawing room set.The Coen brothers new comedy isnt quite an homage to 1950s Hollywood but its not a spoof of it either -- it strikes that tone of crisp drollness thats their specialty and that some people misread as aloofness or contempt. But its not. Its the distance needed to admire the absurdities of the world theyve created one of a slightly askew major studio churning out hopeful alterna-hits like the Western Lazy Ol Moon the upper-crust drama Merrily We Dance and the title picture a Biblical epic through which Clooneys character Baird Whitlock swaggers in a toga playing a Roman changed by an encounter with Jesus. The studio vets the religious themes in an early meeting with a rabbi an Eastern Orthodox patriarch a Catholic priest and Protestant minister -- a brilliant breakneck scene involving both differences in belief systems and thoughts on the plausibility of the chariot scene. View this image > Channing Tatum in Hail Caesar Alison Cohen Rosa / Universal Pictures ID 7939459 Its such a funny showy sequence that it feels like it has to be a high point until Johansson as DeeAnna Moran rises like a goddess from the midst of a circle of synchronized swimmers and an animatronic whale for her big number. And then theres the sequence in which Ehrenreichs character Hobie Doyle arrives on the set of his new role and plummy-voiced director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) attempts repeatedly to coach him through the line ""Would that it were so simple."" And of course theres Channing Tatum as Burt Gurney a Gene Kelly-type tapping and leaping his way through a song and dance about sailors heading out to sea that were it real would have been a Celluloid Closet centerpiece.Hail Caesar does feel more like a collection of fantastic bits than a cohesive whole but its overstuffedness is part of its design -- theres no bigger picture to grasp though as Capital Pictures fixer Eddie Mannix (a real person amid the movies series of stand-ins) Josh Brolin strives mightily to find meaning in this strange universe. The last film the Coens made about the old-time movie business Barton Fink portrayed Hollywood as this purgatory in which its title playwright became trapped. But for tireless Eddie who frequents confession enough that his priest suggests he take a break the big question is whether he should take an offer to leave. Hes being courted by Lockheed with the promise of shorter hours better pay and a chance to do ""real"" work rather than spend his days covering up the indiscretions of the commodities the rest of the world calls movie stars. View this image > Josh Brolin in Hail Caesar Alison Cohen Rosa / Universal Pictures ID 7939463 But isnt that real work? Maybe Hail Caesar is a conflicted case for movies in their forever awkward place straddling business and art -- selling entertainment as well as the fame two different flavors of life as people would like it not as it actually is. Everything in Hail Caesar is transactional including the deals that the twin gossip columnists played by Tilda Swinton make about the stories theyre going to publish. Theres even a Communist conspiracy out of Joseph McCarthys wet dreams thats all about reaffirming that this is work and that workers need to be treated well.Its work that doesnt stop at the door of the soundstage as were reminded when Hobie dutifully turns up at the doorstep of fellow actor Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) who hes been told to take to his latest premiere. Shes the only person of color in an unmissable and not historically inaccurate sea of whiteness a Carmen Mirandaesque talent who does an impromptu demonstration of how to dance with something heavy on your head. Carlottas been assigned a stereotypical image in the same way that Hobie has and frankly a more burdensome one. But at dinner together theyre wonderfully unglamorously themselves two people whove traveled a long way and signed on to a sort of devils bargain. Because thats how you become famous.Then again as Baird admits to his kidnappers hes awfully well taken care of manipulated image or not. Its where that Coen distance comes in handy because Hail Caesar manages to relish the glossy strange past without coating it in the uncomfortable romanticization.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Hail Caesar Video Rated PG-13  106 minutes  2016 Backed by Universal Pictures Joel and Ethan Coen revisit the Hollywood satire of Barton Fink (1991) tossing together cartoonish Tinseltown archetypes (George Clooney as a dumbbell screen idol Tilda Swinton as a pair of identical-twin gossip columnists) and swell parodies of MGM classics (an Esther Williams-style water ballet starring Scarlett Johansson a Gene Kelly-style dance number starring Channing Tatum). The centerpiece of it all is a real person--Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) the legendary MGM ""fixer"" who specialized in tamping down scandals involving the studios contract players--though the historical reference points are so muddled that the two-day story would have to be taking place from the early 1940s to the late 50s.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Feb 5 2016 Culture At first glance the Coen brothers latest movie Hail Caesar seems scarcely a Coens movie at all. Bright and genial it lacks the cruel edge of many of their comedies (in particular their most recent 2008s Burn After Reading) and its moderately haphazard episodic plotting is a far cry from the clockwork precision typical of their films.But look a touch more closely and the movies Coen-world antecedents become clear. The Hollywood setting recalls Barton Fink (though far more amiably); the period pastiche calls to mind The Hudsucker Proxy (though far less gratingly); there are echoes of the Los Angeles of Intolerable Cruelty and that of The Big Lebowski (which also bequeathed its looser narrative vibe); and as in O Brother Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis the proceedings are enlivened by a series of delightful musical sequences. The plot even centers on a kidnapping as it has so many times before (Raising Arizona Fargo Lebowski). This is indeed a Coens movie merely one set in a cheerier key than any of its predecessors. Related Story 30 Years of Coens Closing Thoughts and Rankings Josh Brolin stars as Eddie Mannix the ""Head of Physical Production"" at a mythical mid-century Capitol Pictures. (Though he shares a name and a profession with the real-life Hollywood ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix the similarities pretty much end there.) Over the course of a couple days Mannix is required to resolve a series of back-lot crises large and small. An Esther Williamsy star of ""aquamusicals"" (Scarlett Johansson) has gotten herself too pregnant to squeeze comfortably into her mermaid tail and--worse from a studio PR perspective--seems disinclined to marry the dad-to-be. A hokey young star of Western shoot-em-ups (Alden Ehrenreich) is awkwardly rebranded as the leading man for a society picture being directed by a noted aesthete (Ralph Fiennes). Most problematic Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the star of the studios upcoming epic Hail Caesar A Story of the Christ has been kidnapped by a mysterious group calling themselves ""The Future"" who confine him in a sleek ocean-cliff mansion worthy of Tony Stark.If all this werent enough Mannix also has to contend with twin gossip columnists (played by Tilda Swinton) who are circling the studio in search of scandal; a near-fatal accident involving a film editor (Frances McDormand); an accountant (Jonah Hill) enlisted to see whether the pregnant ingenue can legally adopt her own child; and a song-and-dance star (Channing Tatum) harboring more than one Big Secret. Fred Melamed Patrick Fischler David Krumholtz Fisher Stevens and Alex Karpovsky also make appearances as a support group of disgruntled screenwriters--where were they in your hour of need Barton?--who have decided to take matters into their own hands.Clooney is once again sublimely self-mocking in this his fourth outing with the Coens.So Mannix pinballs from crisis to crisis tamping down gossip here and inventing it there. Along the way the movies loose likable structure is able to accommodate parodies of a variety of movie genres from historical epic to cowpoke cornball to drawing-room sizzler. Scene by scene the movie is a bit uneven but its never long before it presents a moment of genuine glee whether it be Mannixs presentation of the Hail Caesar script to a group of religious luminaries for review (""The Bible of course is terrific"" Mannix allows sounding for an instant like Donald Trump); a marvelous exchange in which Fienness director tries to get through to his out-of-his-depth new star (respond to her ""importuning"" he advises with a ""mirthless chuckle""); or an extended gloriously homoerotic Tatum tap-dance number entitled ""No Dames.""Clooney is once again sublimely self-mocking in this his fourth outing with the Coens He has the rare ability to simultaneously be a star and parody one. As the addled cowboy Ehrenreich enlivens every scene in which he appears in particular with his rendition of the cheesily marvelous ballad ""Lazy Ol Moon."" Following minor roles in Blue Jasmine and Stoker the young actor shows hes more than ready for center stage. And Fiennes again proves that his other talents notwithstanding hes one of the most gifted comic actors alive. If the rest of the stars studding the cast are not quite so indelible--a few of the roles are scarcely more than cameos--each one fulfills his or her duties with aplomb. In the center of it all of course is Brolin harried yet stoic a reef of sanity amid a sea of chaos. And no one no one has more fun with a voiceover than the movies narrator Michael Gambon.Is Hail Caesar among the Coens best works? Of course not. But as I noted a while back that is an extraordinarily high bar to clear. Apart from one late misstep--a too-broad comic bit set on the ocean--this latest is an unexpectedly sweet and utterly satisfying confection a loving sendup of the Hollywood of yesteryear. As Mannix frantically juggles the needs of his studio he is simultaneously being courted for an executive position at Lockheed. Dismissing the ""circus"" of Hollywood his recruiter explains to him that ""aviation is serious"" a point he emphasizes by displaying a photo of the H-bomb test at Bikini Atoll. One could hardly ask for a better rebuke to that kind of ""seriousness"" than the glitzy ditzy splendor of Hail Caesar Jump to Comments About the Author Latest Video The Democrats Message of Calm The Atlantics Molly Ball explores Hillary Clintons image of composure in the midst of a troubled country.

A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Rated PG-13 (suggestiveness). There is much to savor in ""Hail Caesar"" Joel and Ethan Coens goofily entertaining poison-pen letter to Hollywood of the early 1950s. The madness revolves around Eddie Mannix (a fine Josh Brolin) a straight-arrow executive at an MGM-like studio who spends one very long day and night fixing personnel problems that threaten to slow down the output of his dream factory. First theres the abduction of the studios biggest star fatuous Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) cast as a Roman centurion who finds Christ in the risible big-budget biblical epic also titled ""Hail Caesar"" While trying to figure out whos making anonymous ransom demands for Baird Eddie also has to deal with the out-of-wedlock pregnancy of DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) an Esther Williams-like swimming star. And he is being hounded by twin gossip columnists (both played by Tilda Swinton) looking for dirt on the studios male stars including Baird and the singing and dancing Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum). As if that werent enough Eddie has to soothe the strained nerves of fussy superstar director Laurence Lorenz (Ralph Fiennes) who has been driven to the brink by Hobie Doyle the singing cowboy improbably assigned the lead in Laurences latest drawing-room comedy. The Coens hit the satiric bulls-eye when it comes to pious religious epics which are still plaguing us six decades later (with movies like ""Risen"" out in two weeks and starring Fiennes brother Joseph in basically the Baird Whitlock role). A scene where Eddie vets the ""Hail Caesar"" script with clerics of various faiths is especially funny. The film is on less sure comic footing when it comes to making fun of the blacklist (via a group of screenwriters who convert Baird to Marxism). DeeAnnas subplot is little more than a single joke involving an accountant (briefly seen Jonah Hill) and a fake adoption scheme. What really makes ""Hail Caesar"" sing are the Coens painstaking period simulations of scenes from five films including not only ""Hail Caesar"" but a synchronized swimming routine a la Busby Berkeley and a corny musical Western. The best of these scenes is the breathtakingly homoerotic musical number ""No Dames"" with Tatum making his impressive singing and tap-dancing debut surrounded by enthusiastic chorus boys -- all of them camping up a storm in white sailor suits. Clooney is rarely less than endearing when he plays an idiot (usually in films written and directed by the Coens) and Fiennes is dryly uproarious when he attempts to coach Hobie how to speak in a totally affected mid-Atlantic accent. The little-known Alden Ehrenreich (""Beautiful Creatures"") does a great job with Hobie who demonstrates his skills with a lariat while on a date with a Carmen Miranda-like singing comedian. ""Hail Caesar"" is not one of the Coens major works but its a very enjoyable lark especially for fans of old Hollywood.

"Hail Caesar | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hail-caesar ) Hail Caesar (U.K./U.S. 2016) February 05 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hail Caesar wont be remembered as one of the Coen Brothers masterpieces. An homage to Hollywood of the 1950s this is more of a niche film than a mainstream offering. Its an opportunity for Joel amp; Ethan Coen to use the era as a cinematic playground. Hail Caesar allows the filmmakers to dabble in 50s-style productions and includes scenes from a Busby Berkeley clone a Gene Kelly-inspired musical a Cecil B. DeMille-influenced ""Prestige"" Bible Epic and some hokey cowboy flicks. Although technically a comedy the film doesnt offer the same level of laughter provided by Raising Arizona The Hudsucker Proxy and The Big Lebowski. Instead its content to gently poke fun at the recognizable and beloved output of an industry that was fighting off the allure of television. There are some good one-liners and offbeat moments (ever hear the one about the priest the rabbi the minister and the movie exec...) but the goal is more to provoke chuckles than guffaws. The absence of a strong narrative is the films weakest aspect. The Coens are so absorbed by their mimicry that they dont invest a lot of effort in the connective tissue. Hail Caesar works best when seen as a series of loosely related vignettes. Its great fun to watch George Clooney do a semi-serious Charlton Heston impersonation or Channing Tatum step into Gene Kellys tap shoes. The production values are second-to-none and when were watching these movies-within-a-movie its almost like viewing clips from lost 1950s artifacts that someone found and restored. Theres pleasure in this experience although perhaps not for the average multiplex-goer who will expect a better ""wraparound"" story to tie everything together. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the head of Capitol Pictures and Hail Caesar chronicles a day in his life. The movie is bookended with trips to a confessional. This is apparently a regular routine; the beleaguered priest informs him that he comes a little too often. Eddie has a lot on his plate. One of his star actors Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been abducted by ""Communists"" and they are demanding a 100000 ransom. Americas Sweetheart DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) has become pregnant out of wedlock so a cover story has to be devised to protect her reputation. Esteemed director Laurence Lorenz (Ralph Fiennes) is on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being required to cast cowboy matinee idol Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) in his latest character-driven piece. Gossip columnist sisters Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton) are badgering Eddie for exclusives while hes weighing an offer to leave the ""circus"" and join Lockheed Martin. The Coens gain traction and mileage by not being overtly satirical with their 50s pastiches. They avoid Mel Brooks territory and instead stay true to the tropes and approaches of the time. The tongue-in-cheek elements are limited; the comedy comes from recognizing that these fake films are representative of the real output of the era. As a result Hail Caesar comes across not as a harsh take-no-prisoners evisceration of Old Hollywood but a playful recreation. One doesnt doubt that studio heads of the time faced many of the issues confronted by Eddie. The degree to which this is representative of how filmmaking actually worked is up for debate but much like My Week with Marilyn there appears to be verisimilitude in how it pulls back the curtain. As with Woody Allen the Coens have reached a level of prestige where they can cherry pick A-listers to appear in relatively small roles. Hail Caesar is an ensemble production. Actors like Scarlett Johannson Ralph Fiennes Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have limited screen time. George Clooney has more of an opportunity to leave an impression but about half of his scenes are clips from the movie-within-a-movie. Only Josh Brolin whose impressive versatility is often overlooked is given the opportunity to develop a character. The Coens have never made movies with the primary goal of achieving huge box office numbers. Their films have often been described as ""quirky"" and have frustrated viewers expecting something more accessible. Theres nothing obscure about Hail Caesar but it is like most Coen Brothers movies made with a select audience in mind. The more 1950s movies a person has seen and the greater their love for Hollywood of 60+ years ago the greater their appreciation will be of what Joel and Ethan have brought to the screen. Appropriately for the time of year Hail Caesar is a Valentine - a love letter to a time when life was simpler and movies were bigger. Even if it accomplishes little else this production captures that with good humor and a little madcap zaniness.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 5 2016 Save for later Saved George Clooney portrays Baird Whitlock in Hail Caesar Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide In ""Hail Caesar"" the Coen brothers Joel and Ethan have come up with another  one of their brainy jokey head-scratchers (as opposed to one of their apocalyptic creepfests like ""No Country For Old Men"" or ""Barton Fink""). Set in 1950s Hollywood it centers on Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a real-life ""fixer"" for MGM - called here Capital Pictures - whose primary job is keeping the studios high-priced stars from publicly shaming themselves. The Coens have an affinity for the waning days of  Hollywoods Golden Age if only because that era allows them to wax nostalgic while at the same time subverting the nostalgia. The film involves the kidnapping of a famous fatuous movie star played by George Clooney by a team of Tinseltown Communists. (Clooney uniformed in Roman legion garb for a biblical costume epic has a lot of fun with this dimwit.) Along the way the Coens work in satirical tributes of spangly musical numbers a la Esther Williams (Scarlett Johansson) and Gene Kelly (Channing Tatum) though both stars go by different names here. The film is often  sharp and amusing but its a doodle in the Coen canon. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for some suggestive content and smoking.)

Meet Eddie Mannix a legendary fixer from the Golden Age of Hollywood who serves as the hero of the Coen brothers new comedy ""Hail Caesar"" Played with hard-bitten charm by Josh Brolin Mannix is a stressed-out guilt-wracked executive whose job is to lie to reporters rough up his stars pay off troublemakers and generally keep Capitol Pictures Studio running smoothly. ""Its so hard"" he tells a priest in near tears. ""I dont know if I can keep doing it. But it seems right."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Mannix is based only loosely on a real-life (and much more unsavory) figure who worked at MGM and reportedly wrecked many a life. Here though hes a true believer in the magic of the movies as are the Coen brothers. For the past 30-odd years the writing-directing siblings have zigzagged through nearly every conceivable genre from the neo-noir ""Blood Simple"" (1984) to the fictional biopic ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013). With ""Hail Ceasar"" they get to put their unique stamp on classic Hollywood. Theres a narrative here though just barely. While shooting the Biblical epic that shares its title with this movie screen star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney in fine comedic form) is kidnapped by Communists. While identical twin gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton doubly magnificent) sniff around the story Mannix gets down to business armed with only a suitcase full of cash and a mighty sense of purpose. Its all an excuse for Mannix (and us) to roam through Capitol Pictures and watch dreams being made. Scarlett Johansson plays DeeAnna Moran an Esther Williams figure whose aquatic ballet (choreographed by Mesha Kussman) is a thing of weird beauty. Alden Ehrenreich is charm incarnate as Hobie Doyle an aw-shucks Western star egregiously miscast in a drawing-room comedy (Ralph Fiennes as its effete director is priceless). Channing Tatum plays Burt Gurney whose sailors-on-leave musical number ""No Dames"" (choreographed by Christopher Gattelli of Broadways ""Newsies"") is an absolute jaw-dropper. 232 MoviesHail Caesar trailer ""Hail Caesar"" doesnt deliver much of a story or even put forth a coherent theme. In the studio-system days it wouldnt have made it past the first script reader. As a cinematic experience though its simply dazzling. ""Hail Caesar"" obeys the first commandment of filmmaking attributed to the old master Billy Wilder Thou shalt not bore.

The Coen brothers do. Westerns romances musicals dance extravaganzas -- the works. (All of which are on gorgeous indulgent display here.) Millions of people used to look to them for -- in the words of Capitol Pictures Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) -- ""information uplift and yes entertainment."" Kind of like religion Its no accident that Mannix delivers that line to a quartet of religious leaders brought in to comment on the presentation of Jesus in Capitols Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ. Its also no accident that this film shares part of that films title. You see Mannix is a man of faith faith in God but also faith in humanity. Despite the waywardness and weakness forever being displayed by the feckless denizens of his industry Mannix has trouble writing people off -- as economic units or as clumps of atoms destined for destruction. Instead he sees them as suffering souls in need of if not salvation then at least information uplift and yes entertainment. Its just possible the Coens feel the same way and thats why they made this picture about a beleaguered studio fixer dealing with among other things a kidnapped movie star a cushy job offer a pregnant mermaid and a habitual temptation.

Photo Courtesy of Universal Studios Once branded as essentially sophomoric Joel and Ethan Coen have over the past decade established their artistic and philosophical seriousness creating their own distinctive border world straddling farce and tragedy. But theyre still kind of sophomoric. Nothing turns them on as much as fooling around with what theyve called ""movie fodder"" -- tired genre archetypes plunked down in radically different contexts and given a fresh antic spin. Their amalgamations can be feats of genius like their stoner-gumshoe farrago The Big Lebowski. Or they can pretty much lie there like much of their new star-packed comedy Hail Caesar which is nothing but movie fodder. Set in the 1950s the film centers on a Hollywood studio called Capitol Pictures and its ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who functions almost like a head of production. Mannix herds wayward actresses and dipsomaniacal actors plugs casting holes and tries to keep the whole multi-ring circus from dissolving into chaos. As he solves problems the Coens serve up parodies of biblical epics soft-shoe sailor musicals water ballets grade-B oaters and drawing-room romances. Related Stories How Channing Tatum Learned to Tap-Dance for Hail Caesar New Hail Caesar Trailer Would That It Were So Simple Every Coen Brothers Movie Ranked From Worst to Best Two of the parodic set pieces are so brilliant that they can hold their own against whats being parodied. Channing Tatum and a group of hoofing sailors do a full-blown production number set in a bar (and behind and on top of a bar) that made me wish the Coens would drop what passes for their story line and turn the film into a musical They could teach Rob Marshall Baz Luhrmann and just about every living music-video director how to stage shoot and edit (judiciously) dance. The other is a kaleidoscopic marvel of a water ballet starring Scarlett Johansson as a mermaid (shell later complain about the tightness of her ""fish ass"") that made me suddenly understand why that ridiculous subgenre once thrilled people to pieces. Wonderful too is the scene in which Ralph Fiennes as aristocratic director Laurence Laurentz (the name looms large) gently attempts to elicit a thoughtful line reading and ""mirthless chuckle"" from a staggeringly miscast cowboy star (Alden Ehrenreich) in a sophisticated love story. The gag falls under the ""low-hanging fruit"" category but the Coens (and Fiennes and Ehrenreich) squeeze every bit of juice from it. I also loved Robert Picardo as a peevish rabbi whos part of a multifaith panel convened to discuss the studios latest Christ epic. With so many good -- no fabulous -- elements why does so much of Hail Caesar feel so overdeliberate? Because everything the Coens do is overdeliberate. ""Overdeliberate"" defines their comic temperament the rhythm of their storytelling. When it fits their material its gangbusters but this milieu begs for a loose scattershot tone one in which every line isnt archly parodic. A major subplot featuring a cabal of communist writers who kidnap a thick-witted leading man (George Clooney) and hold him hostage while indoctrinating him in the evils of capitalism is dead on the screen. And Clooney doesnt rise to the occasion. He seems to like working with the Coens because they always cast him as a dumb guy but his idea of playing dumb is to furrow his brow and either speak very slow or babble hysterically. Maybe the movie would be better if Clooney and Brolin had swapped roles. Good as he is Brolin seems closed down his eyes reduced to slits under his hat brim. He might have made the drunken leading man a volatile innocent buoyed by his contact with Marxist economics while Clooney might have found his comic voice as a well-dressed thug trying to use every drop of his political savvy to keep selfindulgent child-men and -women feel safe and loved. Johansson has a good scene as the mouthy mermaid but once youve registered that Tilda Swinton is playing twin rival gossip columnists each of whom thinks the other cheapens the profession theres nothing to do but stare at her absurd Harlequin-esque plumes. Hail Caesar might play better on the small screen where you can savor its fodder piece by piece. But the Coens might be too much like their main character maintaining too much control and keeping their splendid zanies in line.A A A A A version of this article appears in the February 8 2016 issue of New York Magazine.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 05 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 05 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen Starring George Clooney Josh Brolin Alden Ehrenreich Classification 14A Genre comedy Year 2016 Country U.K./USA Language English In their disappointing new comedy Hail Caesar Ethan and Joel Coen tip their hats to a parade of Hollywood movies from the forties and fifties including the biblical spectacular Ben Hur Gene Kellys shore-leave dance pictures the aqua-musicals of Esther Williams and the Roy Rogers westerns. But mainly they channel Mel Brooks through some very muffled medium. Brookss 1970s spoofs of the western the horror film and the silent movie were broad and crude comedies but they were also socially transgressive - remember the black sheriff in Blazing Saddles - and funny. Here the Coen brothers stack up their affectionate copies of the classics and their satirical skits about the studio system without ever making any telling point about the movies they invoke or the society that produced them.One moment we are watching a highly impressive reproduction of a synchronized aquatic ballet or enjoying a perfectly choreographed tap routine; the next we are listening to a rabbi and a priest bicker about the representation of Christ in the biblical epic that gives the movie its title. Never is there much sense that any of this is building toward anything. A Soviet sub appears at one point but it would take a much larger deus ex machina to rescue this shipwreck.The story which flags badly after its first big revelation and never achieves the madcap tone that would drive the film forward revolves around the kidnapping of movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) from the set of Hail Caesar Turns out to be a plot by a well-meaning study group of Marxist screenwriters which must have seemed like a hilarious idea on paper but as it burbles gently along robs the kidnapping of any real tension while never delivering darker political satire. The flair for black comedy and deadpan that the Coens displayed so delightfully in their early hits has somehow abandoned them.It is the task of the overworked studio executive Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to recue Baird and save the big picture - when hes not trying to find someone to marry a pregnant mermaid (Scarlett Johansson) or convince a high-minded director (Ralph Fiennes) to accept a cowboy star (Alden Ehrenreich) in his society drama while defanging twin gossip columnists (both played by Tilda Swinton in intriguing hats.)In short there are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.Clooney is pleasant enough as he creates a mildly amusing version of a vacuous and self-satisfied star; Channing Tatums big dance number is perfect and Jonah Hill has a well-executed cameo as a studio fixer.But Swintons twins are so identical that joke gets no mileage and Brolins Mannix is far too pleasant well-intentioned and balanced a character to be interesting. The actor seems a bit lost here as to what tone hes after as does much of the rest of the cast.Ultimately the Coens seem to have some point to make about whether the movies are business or art but in marked contrast to Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel whose equally large comic ensemble also included Fiennes and Swinton no sharper purpose ever emerges from the affectionate nostalgia for a gilded age. Considering this is a movie about a Communist plot in McCarthys America thats an epic failure.

Their new dream factory satire ""Hail Caesar"" is set at the same fictional Capitol Pictures studio a decade later. This time the production is crammed with established stars packed with Busby Berkeley aquatic ballet Gene Kelly dancing elaborate musical numbers platoons of extras dressed like Roman soldiers and a blockbuster budget. What it has much less of is interest. The Coens have reportedly had the film on a slow boil since 2004 and it reaches theaters disappointingly overcooked. Taking place in 1951 Tinseltown ""Hail Caesar"" is a cornucopia of film-within-film sequences. It wanders from sound stages to projection rooms to the editing suite where the person snipping the celluloid (Frances McDormand sharing walk-on cameos with veterans like Dolph Lundgren and Christopher Lambert) can be strangled if her scarf slips into the gears. Rather than adding up to an interwoven story line its a long rambling shaggy-dog story. I know there is a dog in it anyway. What they intended this confusing tale to be overall I have no idea. George Clooney who has become the Coens go-to guy for pinhead roles plays Baird Whitlock star of a ponderous sword and sandal religious epic titled ""Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ."" After a movie stand-in (Wayne Knight) slips a mickey into a chalice Whitlock guzzles for the camera the dimwitted star vanishes halting the studios prestige film of the year. Locating him falls to Capitols official problem solver Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin in low-key form). Whether hes bribing police to ignore a bawdy starlet posing for naughty photos or running a half-comic meeting with a priest a minister an orthodox monk and a rabbi on ""Hail Caesars"" theological core he keeps the studio out of scandal and profitable. Mannix an essentially decent fellow who daily confesses to his priest whether he has sinned is wildly overworked putting out fires at a rate that keeps him from ever visiting his family. Hes committed to the job because he loves the fantasy world that solves lifes problems with make-believe. When the Lockheed aircraft corporation offers him a much better package to become their fixer-in-chief hes deeply conflicted. His studio delivers happiness. Lockheed delivers the newly invented hydrogen bomb. Universal Pictures Scarlett Johansson in ""Hail Caesar"" Mannix may be the films leading character but he is hardly the main focus. The Coens way-back machine fills the story with players from golden age Hollywood following them across the storys sidelines like a film buff chasing idols with an autograph book. Scarlett Johansson paddles across the screen as an Esther Williams-style swimming star whose out-of-wedlock pregnancy Mannix hopes to obscure. Ralph Fiennes delivers some verbal slapstick as a posh British director battling to save his sophisticated drama from the star who has been thrust upon it a gauche singing cowboy (Alden Ehrenreich whose casting is one of the films genuine delights). Channing Tatum dons skintight sailor whites as the dancing star of an all-male Navy musical whose ""No Dames"" theme song cuts loose into a gender-bending homoerotic boogie the Village People would envy. If all that added up to a series of consistent punch lines ""Hail Caesar"" would be a treat. Instead the Coens allow scene after scene to overstay its welcome. To have Clooney sit on a chair in his centurion uniform and nearly impale himself on his sword is a buffoonish gag at best. Turning it into a running joke is a waste of time. Using Michael Gambons silver throat for verbose stop-and-go narration and master cinematographer Roger Deakins to mimic the Technicolor sheen and varied screen ratios of Turner Classic Movies is a waste of talent. I left ""Hail Caesar"" feeling it wasnt Baird Whitlock who was abducted. Someone kidnapped the plot. The Coens 17th film is so far from the high-water mark of their recent work that I wished Eddie Mannix had burst onto the sound stage to save it. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The scene plays like a theological joke the Coen version of a priest and a rabbi walk into a movie studio. ""Does the depiction of Jesus Christ cut the mustard?"" asks Mannix succinctly. His agenda is to gain their approval for Capital Pictures latest Bible epic a sword-and-sandals movie led by the dimwitted star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney looking particularly suited to golden age Hollywood). The question of how God should be portrayed in the film - a mere quibble amid the madcap machinery of a Hollywood studio - has been put off. An early reel of the movie leaves a tiny gap ""Divine presence to be shot"" reads the insert. Its something like a summation of Joel and Ethan Coens films Meaning is a missing frame human folly is the star and only the dialogue is divine. ""Hail Caesar"" is by no means their best but its in some ways the Coens most essential. Having long made playthings of old movie genres their romp through vintage Hollywood here is literal. Its a loving satire and merciless ode to moviemaking where hapless souls serve no higher power than the Hollywood machine. Their main character is the stone-face fedora-wearing Mannix a bruising studio executive who keeps the assembly line humming and its contracted stars out of the gossip pages. Hes based on a real and mythic figure of the same name who ruthlessly toiled for Louis B. Mayers MGM. Brolins Mannix though is a family man trying to quit smoking and making constant guilt-ridden trips to his church confessional. Among the tasks before him per orders from above is squeezing the Western star and genuine cowboy Hobie Doyle (newcomer Alden Ehrenreich who steals the movie with some of the best bad actor acting youve ever seen) into ""Merrily We Dance"" a prestige drama from director Laurence Laurentz (a terrific Ralph Fiennes) whose directions - to give ""a mirthless chuckle"" or pronounce the line ""Would it twer so simple"" - confound Doyle. The gulf between on-screen fiction and off-screen reality is comically vast none more so than when star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) having just shot an elaborate Esther Williams-style aquatic scene jumps out of the pool sheds her mermaid fin lights a cigarette and bitterly retorts in a thick Brooklyn accent ""How am I? Wet."" Moran is having a child with unknown paternity - another fire for Mannix to put out. Twin-sister gossip columnists modeled after Hedda Hopper (both played by Tilda Swinton) are threatening to report something ominous about Baird from an older film of his ""On Wings as Eagles."" And aviation giant Lockheed is trying to lure Mannix away from the frivolity of Tinsel Town. But Mannixs biggest problem is finding Baird whos been kidnapped from the set by a group of communist screenwriters who call themselves ""The Future."" Its the main thread of the film but ""Hail Caesar"" isnt much occupied with main threads; theres too much fun to be had. Let loose on a 1951 backlot the Coens find a feast of satire and movie references that come almost too easily to them and ""Hail Caesar"" slides toward becoming more a parade of inspired parodies than one of their more closely stitched odysseys. But as parade floats go few could match some of the lengthy sequences of ""Hail Caesar"" like the dance scene led by Channing Tatum in an ""On the Town"" riff where a bar full of sailors sings and dances to ""No Dames."" Whatever strong-armed money-driven system that spawns such gleeful absurdity cant be all bad. So when Mannix with shades of Ned Beatty in ""Network"" supplies Baird his come-to-Jesus moment - ""You have worth if you serve the picture"" he instructs - there is naturally irony. But theres also affection. As suggested by Mannixs rival opportunity (the Lockheed headhunter flashes a picture of an atom bomb test) there are worse things to believe in.

"Review In the spoof Hail Caesar the Coen brothers let everybody in on the jokes - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Love them or hate them the Coen brothers will leave you laughing with Hail Caesar Hail Caesar AP George Clooney portrays Baird Whitlock in ""Hail Caesar"" George Clooney portrays Baird Whitlock in ""Hail Caesar"" (AP) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Hail Caesar"" indeed.Created by Joel and Ethan Coen those mighty monarchs of sendups and satires this droll tribute to and spoof of Hollywood past amuses from beginning to end with its site specific re-creation of the studio system and the movies that made it famous. A hipster mash note to the way things used to be it will put a smile on your face and keep it there for the duration. Deft movie business comedies are a hardy perennial from the classics ""Show People"" and ""Bombshell"" through the more recent ""Hollywood Boulevard"" and ""The Big Picture."" And the Coens have been there before with 1991s considerably bleaker ""Barton Fink.""See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt; Though the brothers did their share here writing producing and directing as well as jointly editing under their usual Roderick Jaynes pseudonym they were helped enormously by a splendid and committed ensemble cast. Hail Caesar | Trailer Watch the trailer for the film ""Hail Caesar"" Watch the trailer for the film ""Hail Caesar"" See more videos Top-lined by Josh Brolin George Clooney Alden Ehrenreich Ralph Fiennes Scarlett Johansson Tilda Swinton Channing Tatum Frances McDormand and Jonah Hill the films actors up to and including even the smallest speaking parts were as deliciously in on the joke as the Coens.Speaking of jokes the Coens smart script is filled especially in its names with all manner of inside jokes and playful references to real people and places including New Left philosopher Herbert Marcuse and the venerable Sunset Strip eatery Imperial Gardens.When an up-and-coming actress (Veronica Osorio) talks about dancing with fruit on her head the reference is to Carmen Miranda but film buffs will know that the actress name Carlotta Valdez is at the heart of Alfred Hitchcocks ""Vertigo."" And so on. But the great thing about ""Hail Caesar"" is that it is fun whether you get all its references or not. Loving re-creations of classic Hollywood entertainments and lines like ""Forgive me father I have sinned I struck a movie star in anger"" cannot fail to entertain they really cant. There is also a nominal whodunit element to ""Hail Caesar"" involving the mysterious kidnapping of top star Baird Whitlock (Clooney at his daftest) the lead of the Roman epic (""A Tale of the Christ"" is its ""Ben-Hur""-ish subtitle) which gives this film its name. But finding out where Whitlock was taken and why is only one of the films pleasures.The actual plot centers on a day circa 1951 in the life of Eddie Mannix (a fine all--business performance from Brolin) the president of physical production for Capitol Pictures the studio last seen in ""Barton Fink."" (The character is named after a real person who did a similar job for MGM.)A man with a gift for problem-solving Mannix put upon by circumstances like many Coen heroes has difficulties thrown at him around the clock. He saves a naive starlet from French postcard ignominy deals with identical twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both deliciously played by Swinton) who hate each others guts and conducts a clergy focus group about the portrayal of Jesus in ""Hail Caesar"" (""God is a bachelor"" a rabbi grouses. ""He doesnt have children"").What Mannix mostly does is oversee the production of Capitols pictures which gives the Coens the opportunity to show off their versions of classic Hollywood genres including biblical epics like the title film which calls for a visit to the editing room of the veteran C.C Calhoun (McDormand on point as usual.) See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Mannix visits the set of an elaborate aquatic production number a dead ringer for the sequence Busby Berkeley choreographed in ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" (and beautifully photographed here by Coens veteran Roger Deakins.) But instead of Esther Williams Mannix faces off against tough-talking DeeAnna Moran (Johansson) who has trouble fitting in her costume because of a weight gain the morals squad would not approve of.The production president also looks over another number that owes a debt to Berkeley. It stars Burt Gurney (Tatum) dancing like Gene Kelly but looking like Tyrone Power and re-creating a number inspired by the one Berkeley choreographed for James Cagney in ""Footlight Parade."" You get the idea.Despite the good work of all these big names the best of the bunch might be Ehrenreich as slow-talking quick-grinning Hobart ""Hobie"" Doyle Capitols ace singing cowboy who gets tapped to leave the sagebrush behind and don a tuxedo to star in a drawing room drama helmed by Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) a man whose name he cant even pronounce.As these examples hilariously constructed by production designer Jess Gonchor and costume designer Mary Zophres attest the Coens not surprisingly have a sophisticated understanding of Hollywoods ways and means and the ability to make them fun.Although the brothers have at times seemed to be making films only for each other ""Hail Caesar"" a bit like ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" before it wants everyone near and far to come in and enjoy the party. Theyre having the time of their lives and were all fortunate enough to be invited to share in the fun.ALSOSwimming troupe Aqualillies is making a splash in Hollywood with Coen brothers Hail CaesarCoen brothers Hail Caesar is helping boost L.A. film production Hail Caesar reviews Whats not to love?

But save for one word -- sodomy -- and a few less clinical terms that have long been allowed on network TV this genial farce set in 1950s Hollywood couldve almost passed muster under the Hays Code. It follows a frantic couple of days in the life of Eddie Mannix head of Physical Production for Capitol Pictures. Any resemblance between this character and the historical Eddie Mannix a legendary ""fixer"" for MGM Studios during Hollywoods Golden Age is purely ... well the Coens would prefer you not ask such boring questions. But for what its worth movie-Mannixs boss also shares his name with a real-life showbiz mogul of antiquity Nick Schenck. While biographers and historians have linked the real Mannix to any number of dark deeds his Hail Caesar alter ego is surprisingly not such a bad guy. As embodied by Josh Brolin a leading mans man whose rugged charm was on full display in the Coens 2007 best picture-winner No Country for Old Men Eddie is wily enough to succeed in pictures but decent so far as it goes hardworking fair to his employees warm and respectful with his wife a pragmatist with a conscience. (Hes availing himself of the Catholic sacrament of penance when we meet him in point of fact.) But hes no pushover He keeps Capitol Pictures pictures on schedule and on budget and Capitol Pictures stars out of jail and out of the papers. If that means manipulating reporters or making the occasional on-the-spot cash contribution to the Patrolmens Benevolent Association well thats life in the Dream Factory. Eddie finds his considerable problem-solving acumen tested when Baird Whitlock (game George Clooney in his fourth Coen Bros. joint) the affable-but-dim star of Capitols in-production religious epic Hail Caesar is kidnapped. (Yes Raising Arizona Fargo and The Big Lebowski all turned on kidnappings too. One suspects that both Coens carry ransom insurance.) While Eddie hustles to recover his actor and to keep the incident under wraps other production emergencies vie for his attention. For one thing DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johnansson) the star of family ""aquatic pictures"" featuring Busby Berkeley-style choreography is twice-divorced and the mother of a child by a third man -- which means Eddie needs her to choose a spouse pronto for image-maintenance purposes. (After shes pried out of her mermaid prosthetic she gripes ""I dont think Im gonna fit back in that fish ass again."") Then theres the matter of British director Laurence Laurentz -- played by Ralph Fiennes whose walkabout into comedy in recent years is a boon to all humankind. Eddie has forced Laurentz to cast singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich holding his own among much more famous company) in his Noel Coward-style Broadway adaptation Merrily We Dance. Turns out Hobie isnt nearly as comfortable gliding across a drawing room in a tuxedo as he is performing stunts on horseback. While fighting all these fires Eddie is also mulling a generous job offer from Lockheed Aircraft. More money saner hours and says the headhunter a piece of the future. After all whos going to keep going to the pictures once every American home has a television set? This frantic action pauses from time to time to allow the Coens to clear their throats on subjects that only filmmakers as frugal and revered as these two may touch Whitlock soaks up his captors lectures on Marxism like a sponge -- theyre a cabal of disgruntled screenwriters naturally -- while Eddie wrangles the panel of clerics and rabbis hes convened to reassure him that Hail Caesar will not offend any person of faith with its depiction of Jesus Christ. (Whether the extras hanging on crucifixes are entitled to hardship pay is the kind of matter Eddie can resolve himself.) But whatever point the Coens are trying to make about the pageantry of belief systems they never sacrifice buoyancy to make it. Appropriately for a yarn about The Industry some of the best scenes hail from the films within the film. The best of these is No Dames a sailors-on-shore-leave musical starring Bert Gurney (Channing Tatum who is really a pretty good dancer. Who knew?). This long segment is even more homoerotic than the excerpts from Hail Caesar -- the Capitol Pictures Bible epic I mean -- and is easily the most delightful production number in a major motion picture since the Coens lifelong pal Sam Raimi shoehorned one into Spider-Man 3. Itll also make you miss the days long before the Age of Ultron when movie titles had exclamation points instead of colons. Hail Caesar doesnt have the weirdness of its authors other Old Hollywood film 1991s Barton Fink (which also concerned the fictitious Capitol Pictures) or the weary soul of their prior feature 2013s haunting Inside Llewyn Davis. Its pleasures are piecemeal and peculiar like the way Sir Michael Gambon the films narrator elongates the phrase ""in Westerly Malibu."" Or the way Tilda Swinton plays a pair of identical -- and fiercely competitive -- twin gossip columnists. Or the way that a work print of Hail Caesar includes a title card reading DIVINE PRESENCE TO BE SHOT. Theyre not the types to go fumbling for profundity those Coens. Profoundly funny will do.

"Hail Caesar sees Joel and Ethan Coen trade acid for honey review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHail Caesar sees Joel and Ethan Coen trade acid for honey reviewTinseltown 1950s satire Hail Caesar is an affectionate tribute to Old Hollywood by Joel and Ethan Coen that is also one of their most satisfying achievements. George Clooney left and Josh Brolin are Hollywood star and executive in Hail Caesar  (Alison Rosa / Universal Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 4 2016Hail CaesarStarring Josh Brolin George Clooney Ralph Fiennes Scarlett Johansson Channing Tatum Tilda Swinton Frances McDormand and Jonah Hill. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Opens Feb. 5 at GTA theatres. 106 minutes. PGThe Coen Bros. sweet 1950s Hollywood satire Hail Caesar opens with penitent studio fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) devoutly confessing his sins to a Roman Catholic priest.The sins are mild by Tinseltown standards -- Mannix promised his wife hed quit smoking but he hasnt -- and the penance is even milder. The same priest will later instruct Mannix to say five ""Hail Marys"" for slapping around the worlds biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).Article Continued BelowMannix is a believer you see not what youd expect of a man who is as much gangster as father figure using fists bribes and lies to uphold studio standards. And heres an even bigger surprise Joel and Ethan Coen are believers too in a Hollywood moviemaking machine theyve previously been more inclined to mock -- in Barton Fink for example which featured the same fictional Capitol Pictures studio as Hail CaesarThe Coens have replaced the acid in their pens with honey for now at least and the result is an affectionate comedy that is also one of their most satisfying achievements. They truly love movies of Hollywoods Golden Age 1930-60 when studios like MGM (their inspiration for Capitol Pictures) strictly controlled directors and actors while making epics like Ben-Hur Busby Berkeley musicals and entertainments with crooning cowboys and hoofing sailors. (Roger Deakins makes the cinematography golden too shooting on film that has that gleaming Technicolor sheen to it.)Scarlett Johansson stars as DeeAnna Moran an entitled and inconveniently pregnant synchronized swimming star in ""Hail Caesar""The making of Ben-Hur disguised as Hail Caesar in the films title and fictional narrative provides what passes for a plot which is always the least concern of a Coen Bros. movie. Clooneys lead star Whitlock is drugged kidnapped and held for ransom by bickering communist screenwriters who seem to prefer a good argument to money.The commies are in no hurry for resolution. Neither are the Coens who send the dutiful Mannix on problem-solving rounds that will take in multiple amusing Old Hollywood tributes Scarlett Johansson as an entitled and inconveniently pregnant synchronized swimming star; Channing Tatum as a song-and-dance sailor on shore leave; Alden Ehrenreich as a cowboy crooner whom the studio vainly wants to remake as a suave dramatist.The best bits of Hail Caesar are these interludes. The scene where Ralph Fiennes as a prestige film director patiently tries to get the twang out of Ehrenreichs voice is an immediate classic comedy routine. And Tatums skill in the ""No Dames"" musical number is so authentic it could be edited into Gene Kellys Anchors Aweigh with nobody being the wiser.But what about the missing Whitlock? So demands Tilda Swintons scoop-hungry gossipmonger Thora Thacker -- or is it her twin sister Thessaly? Millions of scandal-sheet readers want the facts.""People dont want facts they want to believe"" Mannix replies. With Hail Caesar they get plenty of reasons to happily accept Hollywoods artful artifice on faith. So do the Coens amazingly enough.Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Fiennes in the Coen brothers comedy ""Hail Caesar""  (Universal Pictures)  Read more about George ClooneyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Yet no Coen Brothers film since Barton Fink will so alienate audiences even hardcore fans of their classics such as Fargo The Big Lebowski No Country for Old Men True Grit and Inside Llewyn Davis. That is because this film is completely insane often incomprehensible always sprawling and untidy occasionally idiotic and ultimately sentimentally gooey about Hollywood traditions. Except for the intensely curious and folks who actually work in the industry it may attract next to no one as it opens in theatres. Except maybe 12 angry men of which I am one and a clutch of Hollywood-savvy critics of which I claim to be one. The ""trainwreck"" collision of ideas in it -- from Enlightenment philosopher Georg Hegels master-slave dialectic to chronicles of the drinking whoring and juvenile behaviour of movie stars -- is what kept me enthralled and thus never bored. Even when the plot goes off the rails. This is why I am giving the film a good review despite warning most people to see it at their peril. Just for sheer audacity Hail Caesar demands a five-star rating. For Joel and Ethan Coens screenplay and loosey-goosey direction and jumbled film editing I would assign a one-star rating. That is how I ended up somewhere in the middle with three-and-a-half stars. The plot such as it is revolves around Brolins fictitious Hollywood film studio of which he is the head of production. Brolins Eddie Mannix is famous for his ability to ""fix"" issues from scandals to schedules to casting disasters to the kidnapping of his biggest screen star. Kidnapping? Clooneys character Baird Whitlock is a womanizing drunkard. So it takes some time for Mannix amp; company to realize that while Whitlock was dressed in full Roman regalia for his role in a sword-and-sandal epic that re-tells the story of Christ he has been drugged into a stupor and taken away. A cabal of Communist screenwriters hold him for ransom in a Malibu beach mansion while converting his ""numbskull"" character to their radical politics. Not that he really understands their Hegelian philosophies or how he is going to escape their clutches. The entire rambling film is built around this thin thread while Mannix goes about his other business Such as hiding the kidnapping facts from the twin-sister gossip columnists (both played by Tilda Swinton) hiding the illicit pregnancy of his Esther Williams-style swim star (played by Johansson as a foul guttersnipe) and hiding the acting incompetence of his cowboy-turned-playboy star Hobie Doyle (played with a delightful charm and some Ronald Reagan gravitas by breakout actor Alden Ehrenreich). The film abounds with these references from a Carmen Miranda ""fruithead"" character (Veronica Osorio) to a Gene Kelly actor-dancer-singer type (Channing Tatum) who is hiding a subversive secret behind his slick moves. But every time you delight in one of the films grand set-pieces the Coens undercut the whimsy and nostalgia with some nuttiness that makes no sense. Hail Caesar could drive you as nuts as the filmmakers obviously were when they dreamed this thing up.

Amy Nicholson 02/04/2016 TheAmyNicholson Leave it to the Coen brothers masters of sarcasm to make a movie in which Hollywood is run by Catholics. Hail Caesar opens with two shots of Jesus on the cross and then decisively cuts to a third martyr 50s studio fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who sacrifices his wife and sanity to keep the film cameras cranking. Boy does Mannix suffer. Today -- a day that seems no crazier than other days -- a swimming starlet (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant a top-notch director (Ralph Fiennes) loathes his leading man and twin gossip columnists (both played by Tilda Swinton) threaten to print dirt about Capitol Pictures biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) currently playing a Roman in a blockbuster biblical epic. (At last Clooney has an excuse to resurrect his ER-era Caesar haircut.) Worse Baird has just been kidnapped by a cabal of Communist screenwriters angry that they dont get a bigger share of the profits. To them Mannix isnt a prophet -- hes a parasite. The Coens are more sympathetic. They hand Mannix a rosary send him twice to church frame him before three prop crucifixes and score his crusade with the solemn chants of Gregorian monks. All thats missing is stigmata -- if only his assistant (Heather Goldenhersh) stabbed his hands with a pen. Is Mannixs pain worth it? Absolutely says the narrator (Michael Gambon). Movies arent just entertainment. Theyre ""balm for the ache of a toiling mankind."" When Clooneys doltish superstar swayed by his Communist captors dismisses his own films as factory-made lollipops Mannix slaps him in the face. That slap isnt so saintly. Neither is an early scene in which Mannix knocks around a newbie actress caught posing for cheesecake pictures. Didnt Jesus embrace harlots? Yet when Mannix confesses the days sins to his priest he only apologizes for hitting the dude. (Cue what could be Quentin Tarantinos legit complaint ""How come the Coens get away that? At least my girl was a murderer"") Still a Christlike movie magnate makes sense. Hollywood has convinced the world to worship mortals as gods. The priest deacon rabbi and pastor Mannix asks to approve his Bible flick dont agree on its portrayal of Jesus but they all believe Baird Whitlock is divine. Even young Karol Wojtyla dabbled in acting before becoming Pope John Paul II. UniversalAnd like an omniscient deity Mannix has the power to uncover and absolve everyones secret sins. He stashes drunks in rehab with ""ankle sprains"" and finds husbands for knocked-up starlets to protect their sacred fan-magazine virginity. In this last decade of the star system Mannix is the shepherd of his sheep. He controls his actors careers their love lives and even their self-identity ordering superstar cowboy Hobie Doyle (breakout talent Alden Ehrenreich -- fantastic) to transform into a tuxedoed gentleman for a drawing room romance a role that fits Hobie as comfortably as a lasso choking an ox. When Fienness director orders Hobie to sigh ""Would that it twere so simple"" the kid trips over the words until its the worlds most ironic tongue twister. A Coen brothers comedy works like a prism. Look at it flat-on and its a lark with clever cinematography and cameos like the films unabashed use of heroic close-ups and thick Los Angeles smog that makes Mannix appear to be floating on an angelic cloud plus Coen perennial Frances McDormands one scene as a chain-smoking editor who favors dangerous scarves. (Jayne Mansfields cautionary death is still 16 years ahead.) Its possible to enjoy Hail Caesar simply for the fast jokes and referential musical numbers. Channing Tatums Gene Kelly-eqsue athletic tap dance is a standout marred just a bit by Tatums self-conscious smirk. (Kelly would have simply grinned.) During Johanssons water ballet the old man next to me blurted ""Esther Williams"" and then promptly fell asleep. That the Coens already referenced Busby Berkeley in The Big Lebowski risks younger fans thinking theyre merely paying homage to themselves -- which on some level maybe they are. UniversalHowever hold Hail Caesar at a slant and the Coens have colored the script with a rainbow of allusions. Here Hollywood is the new Roman empire. The stars sashay like fatted calves -- Clooney gives the camera his dopiest cow eyes -- while the extras cast as slaves are treated as such. In this hierarchy the movie-within-a-movies literal Jesus an Akron nobody who won a talent search is treated like a prop on a cross. Even the Biblical epic itself is being made for profit and prestige not preaching. (Theres still so much money in faith-based films in 2016 that two Jesus biopics are opening within the next few weeks alone.) Meanwhile the Communists battle Mannix for Bairds loyalty Will the box office draw put his faith in Das Kapital or Capitol Pictures? Its self-congratulatory fun to spot the parallels in Hail Caesar Yet as those parallels get increasingly crosshatched and contradictory theres a growing suspicion that the Coens would shatter the whole film for a laugh. After all the filmmakers who skewered their own Judaism in A Serious Man certainly have no reverence for Catholics. Their gags exist in their individual moments; stacked together they topple over into nonsense. Is Eddie Mannix a devout saint or a fatuous exec who refers to the Bible as ""a swell story""? Would a man we see go to confession twice in 24 hours shrug off Jesus as ""the swell figure from the East""? And why beatify a character inspired by the real Eddie Mannix an MGM exec for 39 years when Hollywood historians suspect Mannix asked his Mafia connections to murder his first wife and the lover of his second? Theres consistency in the Coens inconsistency. Theyre obsessed with faith in the way a kid too old for Santa spends his last Christmas determined to disprove him. In film after film theyve fixated on morality and justice -- the big questions underpinning every religion -- while ultimately concluding that none of it matters. Bad people win good people lose and eventually everyone dies. We may as well spend two hours of our time on earth applauding Tatums graceful front-flip or watching Clooneys actor tear into a monologue about sacrifice that he sells to everyone on set. Who cares if a higher power hears him? The box office passes final judgment. In the dailies of Hail Caesars fictional Hail Caesar a title card reads ""Divine presence to be shot."" To the Coens is that a promise or a threat?

Here is a movie to celebrate our love of the movies -- even the kitchsy fare like the corny Westerns and the unintentionally campy biblical epics and the dancing sailor movies of the 1940s and 1950s. ""Hail Caesar"" is pure popcorn fun -- a visual treat a comedic tour de force and a sublime and sly slice of satire. What a deep and wonderful love the Coen brothers have for movies. They love paying homage to genres from noir to Depression-era musicals to Westerns they love making movies about movies and with ""Hail Caesar"" they clearly loved making some five movies WITHIN the main movie. Set in the Hollywood of the early 1950s and filmed in gorgeous tones that reflect the time ""Hail Caesar"" stars Josh Brolin in one of the funniest and most oddly endearing performances of his career as Eddie Mannix a square-jawed no-nonsense Hollywood ""fixer"" at the fictional Capitol Studios. (Eddie Mannix was the name of a real MGM production executive/fixer back in the day. This guy is pure fiction.) When a young starlet poses for risque photos when a leading man runs into romantic trouble when a likable family star is pregnant out of wedlock -- Eddie steps in and makes the problems disappear. His job is to keep Capitol Studios productions running on time and under budget to keep his stars out of the gossip rags unless hes controlling the story and to keep the unseen studio boss a ""Mister Skank"" happy. Eddies a good guy plagued by guilt over the smallest thing whether its smoking a few cigarettes or neglecting his wife. Hes in confession so often -- nearly every day -- even his priest says ""Its too soon for you to be back."" In one of the films funniest scenes Eddie meets with a group of religious leaders to make sure ""Hail Caesar"" a big-budget production about a ruthless Roman leader who is transformed by a chance meeting with Jesus isnt offensive. A rabbi reminds Eddie he believes Jesus was just a man; a priest attempts to explain how Jesus is the Son of God but also one with his father; an Orthodox Christian priest says he doesnt buy the scene where a soldier jumps from one moving chariot to another. George Clooney completing what he has called his ""Numbskull Trilogy"" of Coen brothers films (After ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"") hams it up delightfully as Baird Whitlock a vainglorious and not particularly bright movie star who is the lead in ""Hail Caesar"" When Baird goes missing and a ransom note is delivered to the studio Eddie springs into action. He hunts for clues to Bairds disappearance he collects 100000 in cash for the ransom he staves off the pesky inquiries of twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both played by Tilda Swinton) -- AND he puts out other messy fires at the studio. The Roman picture with scenes that look like they could have been culled from ""The Robe"" or ""The Silver Chalice"" is one of five movies within the movie. Were also gifted with  An elaborate synchronized swim musical number starring Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-type star playing a smiling mermaid.  A couple of Westerns both starring Hobie Doyle (a very funny and likable Alden Ehrenreich) a cowboy plucked from obscurity to become a star. Hobies not much of an actor; his signature line is ""Here Whitey"" Whitey being his horse.  A sophisticated comedy of manners directed by one Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes brilliant) a pretentious twit of a director who reminds Eddie that for 20 years the Laurence Laurentz name has meant a certain level of quality.  An exhilarating elaborate impressively choreographed fantastically funny musical number with echoes of films such as ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""Singin in the Rain"" and ""On the Town."" Channing Tatum kills as the song-and-dance man Burt Gurney who is playing a Navy man enjoying one last night with his fellow sailors at a bar called ""The Swinging Dinghy"" before they head out for eight months at sea. In a number called ""No Dames"" Burt sings slides across the bar tap dances over peanut shells dances on tabletops. The longer the number goes on the gayer the subtext to the point where its no longer subtext. What makes all of this so great is the Coen brothers arent mocking these genres; theyre staging and lensing each movie-within-a-movie in a way that mirrors the technology the the sets the available effects the visual style and the acting techniques of the time. Oh right Clooneys Baird Whitlock has been kidnapped What happened to him? Suffice to say THAT plot thread gives the Coen brothers a chance to poke fun at some of the more pretentious condescending morally superior self-appointed Hollywood Communists of the time. Also theres a submarine and a funny dog and Jonah Hill has a terrific cameo and even the actors who have a line or two (or no lines at all) playing a chauffeur or an extra on the Roman film or a vacuuming maid or a cop make valuable contributions to the overall vibe. This is one of my favorite movies ever made about making movies. [s3r star=4/4] Universal Pictures presents a film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Running time 106 minutes.

(Alison Rosa/Universal Pictures via AP) Review Hail Caesar is a minor Coen Brothers comedy By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Feb 4 2016 (...) The Associated Press Scarlett Johansson (left) and Josh Brolin appear in a scene from ""Hail Caesar."" (Alison Rosa/Universal Pictures via AP) Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) cant resist sneaking a cigarette once in a while despite his wifes disapproval. He feels so guilty about it that he confides in a priest. But thats the least of Mannixs problems.As a fixer for Capital Pictures -- one of the major studios in 1950s Hollywood -- its his job to make sure that the press doesnt get wind of scandalous behavior that could offend public morals and threaten the bottom line.That means handling stars like DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) whos not entirely sure just which of her male companions was responsible for her pregnancy but seems more upset about being forced to wear mermaid costumes in her water-based musicals. Mannix is also charged with making sure that the studios star-making plans are carried out even if that means casting Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who owes his fame to cowboy roles in a sophisticated comedy -- much to the consternation of director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes).With increasing competition from television Capital Pictures has a lot riding on the success of a sword-and-sandals epic starring matinee idol Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). So its a crisis for the studio -- and Mannix -- when Whitlock disappears.""Hail Caesar"" is a rare misfire for the writing-directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen who are known for their unique comic sensibility. Although their latest offering has its moments its a letdown coming after their brilliant ode to the 60s folk scene ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013). Hollywood craziness would seem to be ideal grist for the Coen Brothers absurdist mill. Unfortunately ""Hail Caesar"" comes across as far less than the sum of its parts.The starry cast cant be faulted.

But thats what you get in Hail Caesar a wild whoosh of Coen brothers wizardry that left me laughing helplessly and filled with spiritual dread. Thats the Coens for you. Here Ethan and Joel are messing with our heads more in the rat-a-tat style of The Big Lebowski Raising Arizona and Burn After Reading than say Fargo or Barton Fink. But youll still need to buckle up. More News Inside the Coen Brothers Classic Folk Tale Composer Carter Burwell on Carol and the Coen Brothers The Big Lebowski The Decade of the Dude Male Stripper to Movie Star The Evolution of Channing Tatum All Stories >> Related Meet the Coen Brothers New Breakout Star Alden Ehrenreich Hail Caesar actor on impressing the Coens and being discovered in a bat mitzvah video by Steven Spielberg Hail Caesar is set in 1951 Hollywood when studios turned out movies on an assembly line that sometimes often accidentally produced art. The irony is that making movies is often easier than keeping the talent in line. That task falls to Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a studio fixer who cant let the gossips - the brilliant Tilda Swinton plays two of them - know which star is secretly cheating or pregnant or gay or crazy or a Commie bastard. Hail Caesar is basically a day in the life of this studio cop whose job is his religion. And Brolin in a heart-and-soul performance takes this crazy quilt of a movie about a man surrounded by nut jobs and plays it for real. Hes just tremendous. ""Bless me Father for I have sinned"" are the first words we hear from Mannix a married Catholic who exasperates his priest in Confession by asking forgiveness on an almost daily basis. On his own Eddie is an insecure mess. Prowling the studio hes a scary lion. He has to be. Working for Capitol Pictures makes this ex-bouncer an executive baby-sitter. And what babies. Scarlett Johansson is a treat as the studios swim-star sweetheart (think Esther Williams) with a mouth like a gun moll. Channing Tatum is a knockout as a song-and-dance man (think Gene Kelly) with a political agenda. Tatum so nails his joyous tap routine with a chorus of sailors that you long to see a musical built around him. And cheers to the terrific Alden Ehrenreich as the studios cowboy star (think Roy Rogers) a drawling rube who is forced to star as an urban sophisticate a role for which he is unforgettably unsuited. Its howlingly funny to watch a vexed Brit director (a priceless Ralph Fiennes) guide him through countless takes of the line ""Would that it twere so simple."" The scene is one for the comedy time capsule. Related 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 From superhero movies and serious dramas to a new Star Wars movie the years must-sees You dont really notice a plot until the studios star of stars Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) gets kidnapped during production of a biblical epic called Hail Caesar Clooney has a blast adding Whitlock to the series of idiots hes played for the Coens (O Brother Where Art Thou? Intolerable Cruelty). Its blasphemous fun watching him blow his lines in a cathartic scene with a crucified Christ.Whitlock takes nothing seriously not even being a hostage. Thats why Mannix roughs him up hard. Trying to stay moral in this Hollywood Babylon Mannix wrestles with a cosmic question Should he put his faith in the God of Job or the unseen studio deity who phones in his commandments? Mannix sweats it. Maybe the Coens do too. But their film never loses its exhilarating buoyancy. The Coens love these debauched children and the genre films they turn out with such batshit glee. Cinematographer Roger Deakins production designer Jess Gonchor and costume designer Mary Zophres create visual bliss. Hail Caesar is a valentine to on-the-fly filmmaking from two control freaks. And everything nihilistic despair included works like a charm. Its not easy to whip up a fizzy throwaway thats also a serious pleasure. Would that it twere so simple. Yet the Coens pull it off in style. Theyre indispensable.

(  / Universal Pictures) Its fitting that ""Hail Caesar"" is arriving just in time for Valentines Day. This big box of creamy bonbons is a rapturous love letter a loopy affectionately jaundiced portrait of Hollywoods Golden Age at precisely the moment that it was beginning to tarnish. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen this screwball whodunit (or perhaps more accurately whosinit) pays homage not only to the stars who populated showbizs most glamorous firmament but also to the Coens own canon from ""Barton Fink"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" to ""A Serious Man"" and even ""Fargo."" (Listen for the familiar syncopated timpani in Carter Burwells score.) [Qamp;A Coen brothers respond to criticism over diversity talk about ""Hail Caesar""] For Coen fans and movie-trivia mavens ""Hail Caesar"" is a bracing injection straight into their pleasure centers brimming with the brothers signature brio offhand erudition and more inside jokes as the saying once went than there are stars in heaven. Slick silly and often extravagantly pretty its a pastiche that threads a tricky needle conveying the dual nature of cinema as an enchanting art form and a ruthless rationalized industrial practice. Those competing impulses are neatly embodied by the films beleaguered protagonist Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) the harried production chief of Capitol Pictures who as the movie opens in the 1950s is embarking on yet another addled day of problem-solving power playing and ego massaging. (Capitol may be fictional but Mannix is not he was a real-life ""fixer"" at MGM during the studios storied heyday.) As Capitols most dexterous troubleshooter Mannix is used to managing several projects at once dispensing with each crisis -- usually having to do with someone drying out or being discovered in an illicit love nest -- with hard-boiled sometimes bare-knuckled professionalism. George Clooney left and Josh Brolin in ""Hail Caesar"" (Alison Rosa/Universal Pictures) ""Hail Caesar"" follows Mannix through a roughly 24-hour period bracketed by confessions to a Catholic priest during which he emerges as a morally serious man pursuing a vocation in one of the worlds most morally unserious industries. Mannix cant imagine leaving the ""oddballs and misfits"" he spends every waking hour coddling and manipulating. Like the circus worker whose task it is to clean up after the elephants he has become attached to his job despite the occasionally overwhelming stench. Ask the janitor and Mannix why they dont quit and theyll give the same shocked reply ""What and give up show business?"" It may be a cockamamie cavalcade but ""Hail Caesar"" takes full advantage of the glorious view. The conceit of Mannixs day-in-the-life allows the Coens to peek in on all manner of movies that hark back to Hollywoods lacquered genre-driven past. Visiting the sets of a B-western a sophisticated parlor drama an Esther Williams-type swimsuit spectacle and a Gene Kelly musical -- not to mention the eponymous film a hilariously earnest biblical epic called ""Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ"" -- the Coens create a series of movies-within-movies ingeniously adjusting the production values of each one to evoke a bygone cinematic age. Like many of the films that its simultaneously lampooning and celebrating ""Hail Caesar"" features an all-star cast of attractive exceptionally game players including Ralph Fiennes as a pretentious director; Scarlett Johansson as a gorgeously curvy (and getting curvier) swim star; and Channing Tatum who delivers a fabulous dance sequence in the movie at precisely the place where the fabulous dance sequence should go. The breakout star of ""Hail Caesar"" is Alden Ehrenreich a fresh-faced young actor who charms his way through the film as a guileless trick rider and roper. Channing Tatum (center) delivers a fabulous dance sequence in ""Hail Caesar"" (Alison Cohen Rosa/Universal Pictures) George Clooney has just as much fun with his slightly more grizzled portrayal of the dim-witted Baird Whitlock Capitols biggest star who goes mysteriously missing and whose plotline offers something of a funhouse version of ""Trumbo"" and its sometimes sanctimonious treatment of Red Scare-era Hollywood. While ""Hail Caesar"" pokes playful fun at the self-righteous progenitors of what today would be called limousine liberals its difficult to remember a recent movie so tartly on-point in skewering a power-driven industry obsessed with such seemingly meaningless ephemera as screen-credit and commissary pecking orders. At its most sophisticated ""Hail Caesar"" also acknowledges the power of cinema as a colonizing medium able to codify values that once expressed by screen idols seep seamlessly into the public consciousness. One of the films most amusing sequences pays clever Coen-esque tribute to that idea when Mannix assembles a group of religious leaders in order to inoculate ""Hail Caesar"" against religious controversy. The ensuing increasingly tetchy debate manages to entertain competing interpretations of nearly everything under the Southern California sun from script plausibility to the nature of the godhead. [Our definitive ranking of every Coen brothers film ] ""Hail Caesar"" revisits the themes that have preoccupied the Coens throughout their career from vanished forms of popular culture to heady philosophical inquiries. But rather than a mere retread this goofy sometimes corny bagatelle provides an improbably fresh portrayal of Hollywood as hegemonic force an imperium that projects its power through paper-moon artifice and paste-pot aspirations rather than swords sandals or ""the big H-arino"" as one character calls a recent hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll. As lush absurd and damnably seductive as the world it portrays ""Hail Caesar"" doesnt seek to praise old Hollywood exactly. But neither do the Coens want to bury it at least not entirely. Theyre far too forgiving for such cold finality. Theyd rather leave viewers -- along with their flawed sympathetic protagonist -- imbued with the faith that even at its most regimented and impersonal the Dream Factory is still capable of creating wonder beauty and maybe even a touch of the divine.

"The Coen brothers Hail Caesar reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Coen Brothers Hail Caesar Is Silly Epic and One of Their Very Best The Coen Brothers Hail Caesar Is Silly Epic and One of Their Very Best Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 3 2016 1021 AM The Cosmic Purpose of the Film Industry The Coen brothers new movie (about movies) is one of their very best. By David Ehrlich Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Fiennes in Hail Ceasar (c) 2016 Universal Pictures What is Hail Caesar? What isnt Hail Caesar? Its a comedy a noir a historical epic a musical (of two different varieties) and a melodrama. Its a movie about the glory days of the industry that churns them out and how the system so often resembled 1000 spinning plates wobbling in perfect harmony for a split second. Its a film about faith and the pivotal role that it plays in one mans search for meaning amidst the chaos of existence. Its a tale of the Christ told by two Jews who wouldnt trust Jesus to save a cat out of a tree let alone someones mortal soul. That is to say Its a Coen brothers movie and one of their very best. The most obvious point of comparison however isnt a Coen brothers movie at all but rather Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel. The cosmetic connections hit first Both films premiered at the Berlinale and opened in theaters shortly thereafter. Both films shift through several different aspect ratios and feature Ralph Fiennes Tilda Swinton and--wait for it--Fisher Stevens. Both films bake their darker underpinnings beneath a frivolous screwball glaze. More crucially both films probe the ultimate value of storytelling and leverage their findings into lucid summations of their creators entire career and creative worldview. Hail Caesar takes one of the diverse back catalogs in American cinema and forces its various components into a reluctant conversation that changes them all like strangers who are forced into small talk at a cocktail party only to realize that they have the whole world in common. Advertisement The Coens tackled the Old Testament with A Serious Man and with Hail Caesar theyve moved on to the New. Our story begins in the early 1950s Hollywoods golden age. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is technically the head of physical production at Capitol Pictures--the same studio for which Barton Fink was once hired to write low-rent wrestling pictures--but in reality hes a ""fixer"" tasked with keeping pictures on budget stars in line and gossip columnists so focused on chum that they cant sniff the bloated corpse floating a few feet deeper. Introduced inside of a dark confession booth Mannix is starting to doubt the value of his work and the worth of the pictures that he tirelessly endeavors to make possible. Mannix isnt worried about hits or flops; hes worried about the cosmic purpose of the film industry and the existential value of his role in sustaining it. Suffering for the sins of a make-believe world Mannix is effectively the Jesus Christ of the backlot and hes waiting to be crucified at any minute. His faith is being tested. Over the course of 36 hours each one of which assumes the weight of mortality Mannix will be forced to find meaning amidst chaos and to believe--truly believe--in something bigger than himself. ""A day or a lifetime"" read the sign that Barton Fink saw behind the desk of the Hotel Earle. Thats Mannixs choice too. One of the joys of watching Brolin steer his character through a tour of 1000 trials is that his deadpan demeanor makes it hard to divine the difference between a major crisis and an ordinary Tuesday morning. DeeAnna Moran for example is the kind of routine headache Mannix couldnt live without. Played by a wonderfully unsubtle Scarlett Johansson shes Capitol Pictures very own Esther Williams introduced in a gorgeous aqua-musical sequence that naturally ends in an impromptu act of violence. The Virgin Mary of this story Moran is pregnant with the child of a married man and its up to Mannix to defuse the scandal and protect his starlets brand of innocence. He knows exactly what to do--he lives for this. Delightfully complicating Mannixs schedule is young Hobie Doyle (a revelatory Alden Ehrenreich) a Hollywood hillbilly whos being groomed for mainstream stardom. Abruptly promoted from low-rent Westerns to a role in a melodrama that bears a striking resemblance to A Place in the Sun Doyle and his limited skill set immediately become a headache for the films fussy director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). But its nothing that Mannix cant handle. Viciously competitive gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton and Tilda Swinton) picking at the juicy scraps of a potential scandal? A walk in the park. But when doltish movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney playing his fourth and finest Coen brothers idiot) is kidnapped from the set of a wannabe Ben-Hur and ransomed for 100000 by a group who call themselves ""the Future"" you can start to appreciate why the real Eddie Mannix--a fixer for MGM--died of a heart attack. The joke is broad and writ large but delivered so well that it never feels simple. The Future it turns out is the one thing Eddie Mannix never saw coming. Indeed the future is the one thing that Coen brothers characters never seem to think about. Most of them like the doomed hero of The Man Who Wasnt There are small cogs that come unglued in large machines rattling around the metal intestines of a system they can either understand or control but never both at the same time. In Burn After Reading a league of morons confuse an errant CD for top-secret government information kick-starting a chain of events so nonsensical that even the CIA cant figure out what to make of it. In A Serious Man Larry Gopnicks brother works on a book that charts ""a probability map of the universe"" while poor Larry is powerless to do anything in a world crumbling around him but brace for his suffering the Job of Suburbia. In No Country for Old Men Brolin himself played a reluctant Samaritan who openly acknowledged the stupidity of his actions but was powerless to stop himself all the same. For Mannix the future is as much of a threat as it is a temptation--on this of all days hes targeted by a persistent headhunter from Lockheed Martin who tells the fixer that entertainment is frivolous and offers him a small fortune to leave the business before its too late. Advertisement Coen heroes have always self-identified through the lens of their work--one is a police officer one is a lawyer one is a folk singer one is a barber one is a repeat o-ffender--which makes a film studio the Platonic idea of a setting for a Coen brothers movie. At Capitol Pictures every individuals worth is determined by their contribution to the collective which in this case is a movie. With its immaculately restless attention split between actors extras directors and--in one perfect scene--an editor Hail Caesar is a fiercely auteurist work thats generous enough to recognize how a single creative vision hinges on an infinity of singular creative voices. But heres the thing Capitol Pictures is a disaster. We only see its films in fragments but most of those fragments are terrible. Baird Whitlocks biblical epic looks hammy enough to eat for Christmas dinner while TCM would be too embarrassed to play Hobie Doyles latest oater at any hour of the night. Some smart snips might salvage Laurence Laurentzs prestige pic but even Roderick Jaynes can only work so much magic. And then theres the studios latest musical extravaganza in which all-American hunk Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum fulfilling his destiny as the Gene Kelly of our time) plays a horny sailor whos about to set out to sea with his mates. As the fellas sing a magnificently lewd ode to all the women theyre leaving behind on shore (""Well see a lot of fish but well never clog a dish"") its clear that these boys dont need to be on a ship in order to drop anchor. Indulgently long and choreographed to winking perfection the ""Dames"" sequence is one of those primordial jolts of cinematic nirvana that puts everything into perspective. As in many of the scenes in this seriocomic masterpiece the joke is broad and writ large but delivered so well that it never feels simple. On the contrary it convincingly argues the value of filmmaking to a universe of indelible characters who are struggling to understand it for themselves. Its a truth they could see if only they had faith. And that ultimately is what Hail Caesar argues with greater clarity--if not always greater force--than any of the Coens previous films. There is no meaning but that which we convince ourselves. It doesnt matter if you adhere to communism religion or movies The only way you can believe in yourself is if you believe in something bigger. Who wouldnt want to be a lobby boy at the Grand Budapest hotel sir? Its an institution. Top Comment I think the line in Dames is ""clock a dish.""  As in to see a pretty girl.  Better alignment with the first part of the rhyme.  More... Join In The picture--and this is one of the only contemporary films that someone younger than 50 can refer to as such with a straight face--may be too light on its feet to match the tidal pull of Inside Llewyn Davis or A Serious Man but it nevertheless takes you to the same place. If the Coen brothers dramas are cautionary tales their comedies are veritable how-to guides for people who cant help but enjoy a mirthless chuckle at the humility of human existence. Yeah the joke is on us but that doesnt mean it isnt funny. David Ehrlich is a staff writer at Rolling Stone and a film critic for Slate.

"Hail Caesar is an amiable misfire (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Hail Caesar is an amiable misfire (PG-13) Joel and Ethan Coens comedy about 1950s-era Hollywood is a star-studded dud. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/4/2016 Editor rating 2 Hail Caesar isnt the first time brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have made a dud comedy (for more on this see The Ladykillers or Intolerable Cruelty or O Brother Where Art Thou?). But theyve never made one this half-baked and lazy. A barbed-wire valentine to 1950s-era studio Hollywood as well as a meditation on the value of storytelling and the importance of movies Hail Caesar is a goof with something to say.Mostly though its just a goof and not a particularly funny one. The movie is set over the course of one long day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) the head of production and all-around ""fixer"" for the fictional Capital Pictures (the former home of Barton Fink). The movie follows Mannix as he wanders around the back lot putting out fires dealing with temperamental celebrities fending off gossip journalists and contemplating leaving the crazy circus of show business business altogether for a safe quiet job at Lockheed. Eddie (who is named after the famed Hollywood executive known for keeping the private lives of A-list actors private) is the sanest person in a movie stuffed with loonies all of whom need his help. George Clooney plays a matinee idol who is in the middle of shooting a Biblical epic when he is kidnapped by a group of communists who call themselves ""The Future."" Scarlett Johansson is the Esther Williams-like star of aquatic musicals trying to hide her pregnancy from the public.Alden Ehrenreich (Tetro Beautiful Creatures) is a likable lasso wrangler who has been promoted from B-grade Westerns to a high-toned prestige drama directed by a sophisticated fop (Ralph Fiennes). Channing Tatum channels Gene Kelly as the song-and-dance man starring in an Anchors Aweigh clone. Tilda Swinton plays twin sisters rival gossip journalists waging a silent war to see which one can come up with a hat ridiculous enough to outdo Hedda Hopper.Instead of a plot the Coens serve up a string of individual setpieces that allow them to pay homage to golden-era Hollywood. Theres an elaborately choreographed musical number -- a bonafide show-stopper -- in which Tatum does cartwheels and tap-dances while singing a cheerily subversive song. A prolonged scene in which Fiennes tries to direct Ehrenreich to properly enunciate the line ""Would that it were so simple"" is hilarious because the Coens let it run on for so long (they cap the joke 40 minutes later after youve forgotten about it with a knockout punchline).The cast is so over-stuffed that some actors such as Frances McDormand as an editor and Jonah Hill as a shady ""professional person"" pop up for only one scene. The pace is frantic but the movie is sluggish even dull. The story is intentionally episodic but the energy sputters and lags. What should feel like slam-bang farce often plods because the Coens seem interested only in the big splashy tributes to old school Hollywood. Mannix played by Brolin in a perpetual state of quiet suffering is the least memorable protagonist of any movie the Coens have made He could pass for The Man Who Wasnt There. Mannixs inner struggle -- his doubt over whether his lifes work amounts to anything in such a vapid cutthroat industry -- is too noble for a movie as impish and playful as this one. Brolin seems to be acting in a different picture He hasnt gotten with the Hail Caesar program and we dont either.Clooney who the Coens like to cast in stooge roles mugs his way through the movie with diminishing results. Johansson pouts and poses but leaves almost no impression Shes a blank. Ehrenreich steals Hail Caesar from his more famous co-stars giving his earnest cowpoke a sweet genial charm You like him because hes honest and hes real unlike practically everyone else in the film. But the movie isnt about him. Hail Caesar is about having faith in entertainment as a worthy enterprise and championing Hollywood confections as escapist but still worthy art. The movie simply fails to make its case. The Coens feel out of step this time; theyve lost their rhythm the way they did in The Hudsucker Proxy where the style consumed the entire picture turning what should have been humorous and snappy into a grating chore. A scene in which Mannix meets with a reverend a priest a rabbi and an Orthodox scholar to consult on that Biblical epic should have been a classic Instead it thuds. When Fiennes director asks the befuddled Ehrenreich to add a ""mirthless chuckle"" into a line reading you know exactly what hes talking about. Hail Caesar is full of those.

"Hail Caesar review Coen brothers take a satiric stroll through the familiar - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Hail Caesar review Coen brothers take a satiric stroll through the familiar Trailer Hail Caesar Watch the official trailer for ""Hail Caesar"" (ScreenPlay) Watch the official trailer for ""Hail Caesar"" (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune With any sort of comedy set in Old Hollywood the characters names become weirdly important because well ... they just are. In ""Hail Caesar"" theres a smooth British director by the name of Laurence Laurentz whose trademark billing is ""Laurence Laurentz presents."" The studio head mentioned but not seen is a Mr. Nick Skank (think Joseph Schenck a real-life mogul). Dueling Hedda Hopper-brand gossip columnists who happen to be identical twin sisters go by Thora Tacker and Thessaly Tacker.These details like the perfect vaguely threatening hats those last two wear kept me smiling through much of ""Hail Caesar"" But it isnt a laffer in the parlance of Daily Variety. Its a grinner at best and the jokes are surprisingly meager. When Joel and Ethan Coen adapt their sensibilities to accommodate a broader comic style as in ""Burn After Reading"" or ""The Ladykillers"" the results become forced and slightly off. Thats the case here. Still there are compensations. Hail Caesar Universal Pictures In this image released by Universal Pictures George Clooney portrays Baird Whitlock in ""Hail Caesar."" In this image released by Universal Pictures George Clooney portrays Baird Whitlock in ""Hail Caesar."" (Universal Pictures) Set in 1951 the Coens latest takes a wryly sinister look at the Dream Factory as a blithely Commie-infested industry where the struggle between capital and labor resumes with every dawn. The movies motor is a real person fancifully and sentimentally fictionalized by the Coens script. Real-life MGM mogul and legendary ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix has been played in the movies before (notably by Bob Hoskins in the underrated ""Hollywoodland""). For the Coens purposes Mannix nicely handled by Josh Brolin is a bulldog in a fedora always on the move. Hes the one keeping the studios unruly and/or insufferable commodities in line through arm-twisting blackmail strong-arm tactics gentle persuasion and cool-headed negotiation.So its Brolins show mostly even though many in the audience wouldve preferred an Old Hollywood comedy with a little more Scarlett Johansson (she has a couple of scenes as an Esther Williams aqua-star dealing with an inconvenient pregnancy) or a different sort of George Clooney clowning (hes the mugging fatuous sword-and-sandal marquee attraction Baird Whitlock speaking of excellent character names who gets kidnapped by a mysterious cabal declaring itself ""The Future""). The Coens have rarely if ever given ""the people"" what the people think they want. They make their own kinds of movies and often their movies contain many different movies within one movie. ""Hail Caesar"" takes that to the limit. It contains more genre parodies than an old Sid Caesar show. The Coens devote many of their 100 minutes to scenes being filmed or screened from various (fictional) Capitol Pictures (fictional) attractions. Channing Tatum plays the studios resident Gene Kelly or thereabouts performing a sailors-on-leave tap number titled ""No Dames."" (His character has other purposes in the plot as well.) Alden Ehrenreich is the Gene Autry-style singing cowboy struggling with the verbiage in a stuffy Somerset Maugham-ish drawing room property a ""Laurence Laurentz Presents"" production. ""Hail Caesar"" is the name of the ""tale of the Christ"" in the ""Quo Vadis""/""Ben-Hur"" vein starring the Clooney fathead. These characters and subplots combine inside the kidnapping plot involving Whitlock and a deeply disgruntled collection of screenwriters determined to strike back at the forces of capitalism. Hail Caesar Universal Pictures Scarlett Johanson in a scene from ""Hail Caesar"". Scarlett Johanson in a scene from ""Hail Caesar"". (Universal Pictures) The tone of ""Hail Caesar"" is even and assured yet the comic inspiration is sporadic. Somethings missing; the momentum sputters; for every spot-on turn (Ralph Fiennes as Laurentz perfection; Tilda Swinton as the fearsome columnists ditto) you have a Channing Tatum merely guessing at the style required to bring this stuff off properly.The script makes much of Mannixs soul-searching; hes entertaining a job offer from Lockheed where he can make some serious money. But its dirty money; its weapons and warcraft money. ""Hail Caesar"" sees Mannix as a practical warrior in his chosen field and if the real Mannix was a great deal more troubling and flawed a character (theres plenty on the historical record) well the Coens dont owe us a factual treatment of Mannix simply an interesting one. This ones more of a conduit than a fully realized engine.The film this one evokes within the Coens career ""Barton Fink"" was a much stranger and more idiosyncratic achievement though in its Hollywood studio sequences dominated by Michael Lerner and Tony Shalhoub the pacing was breathless and priceless and really really funny. ""Hail Caesar"" is more of a mild satiric stroll through familiar territory. In Mannix its possible to read a kind of idealized self-portrait of the Coens themselves who are the ultimate Hollywood insider/outsiders making big hits (""True Grit"") and wormy crabby more interesting work (""Inside Llewyn Davis""). Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Theres also a slightly wearying air to the genre parodies though I did love the directors on-set coaching of Whitlock gazing upon the Son of God ""Squint Squint at the grandeur"" I may be paraphrasing but thats my favorite line in the picture; it has the throwaway quality of Kaufman and Harts 1930 birth-of-the-talkies stage comedy ""Once in a Lifetime."" What the Hollywood studio mogul declared proudly in that play rings through the ages. ""Thats the way we do things out here"" he said.

Thats true up to a point and that characterization suits the needs of Universal Pictures which has positioned this star-packed midwinter comedy as a box-office bonanza. But theres much more to ""Hail Caesar"" than a period showbiz farce in the Mel Brooks school although Id be willing to bet that Joel and Ethan Coen have obsessively absorbed Brooks movies and method. Underneath the laff-riot and the Hollywood satire ""Hail Caesar"" is a curiously delicate film built on profound affection for American movies and the illusions they build and loaded with in-jokes the mainstream audience will grasp incompletely or not at all.Sure some of ""Hail Caesar"" is not subtle in the least. It features George Clooney as a manly movie star of the early 1950s named Baird Whitlock who plays the lead in a deadly sword-and-sandal epic set in the time of Jesus. (Yeah its called ""Hail Caesar"" The subtitle is ""A Story of the Christ."") Baird is one of those postwar actors who became huge by doing exactly what he was told and is now almost forgotten; he isnt anyone specific from Hollywood history but hes a little bit Kirk Douglas (except worse) a little bit Victor Mature (except better) and a little bit John Wayne (except not as much of a dick). But dont assume this is a ""Clooney movie"" Baird is not a hero a villain or even a buffoon and remains pretty much a cipher throughout the film. It takes him quite a while to figure out that hes been kidnapped let alone why or by whom.Clooney in fact plays the MacGuffin in this movie to use Hitchcocks terminology; hes a plot device around whom the main characters revolve. With considerably less screen time than Clooney Channing Tatum actually makes a stronger impression playing a charismatic faintly metrosexual song-and-dance man in the Gene Kelly vein who has a secret that goes much deeper than the obvious secret everyone knows about. Tatums show-stopping production number with a chorus of sailors in a waterfront bar (yes the ""nautical musical"" was a thing as in ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""Crest of the Wave"" both Kelly vehicles) begins as camp or kitsch and almost immediately pushes past that until its simply flat-out awesome. Thats the level on which ""Hail Caesar"" transcends the slapdash Mel Brooks tradition; if the Coens decide to shoot five minutes of a nautical musical theyre gonna make damn sure its the best nautical musical anybodys ever seen.Go beyond those two big names and the movie gets better still. Since were exploring the ""Jeopardy"" category of ""forgotten movie genres of the 50s"" Alden Ehrenreich a supremely talented 26-year-old actor whos been waiting for his big break -- you might have seen him in ""Stoker"" or ""Beautiful Creatures"" but probably not -- plays an irresistible ""singing cowboy"" star named Hobie Doyle. The Coens pull off the same trick with Hobie as with the tap-dancing sailors At first he seems like an ignorant rube with an Okie accent who has been hopelessly miscast in a Lubitsch-style sex farce directed by a foppish European called Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes coming as close to playing Lord Voldemort again as he ever will). But that too gets turned upside down Hobie is both sincere and talented and his musical ""Lazy Ol Moon"" looks a lot more fun than Laurentzs third-rate imitation of Oscar Wilde or Noel Coward. You Might Also Like And I havent even gotten to Eddie Mannix the strangely heroic and self-sacrificing studio executive played by Josh Brolin. Amid all the more obvious levels of inversion and subversion and satire at work in ""Hail Caesar"" Eddie may be the most extraordinary of all. Has any movie about Hollywood ever depicted a studio boss as a selfless and idealistic figure and explicitly compared him to Jesus Christ? Only the Coens I suspect could come up with such a peculiar and brilliant counter-narrative.If you think Im kidding about the Christ part or if you suspect the Coens would only employ a devout Catholic protagonist as an object of scorn and derision well Im totally not and they actually wouldnt. Not because the Jewish brothers from St. Louis Park Minnesota (setting of ""A Serious Man"" their most autobiographical and most Jewish film) are all that interested in Roman Catholic faith as such. But it presents an intriguing narrative challenge and mockery is way too easy. The first shot of the film (if I remember correctly) is the image of Christ on the cross above the altar where Eddie makes confession -- every single day. Even Eddies priest tells him that its way too often and that his sins barely register and thats about as snarky as the movie gets on that issue.Baird Whitlocks mysterious disappearance from the set of ""Hail Caesar"" -- at first attributed to a daylong bender or a ""chippie"" in some hotel room -- is the biggest problem Eddie faces on the soundstages and back lot of Capitol Pictures. But not the only one. Laurentz despises Hobie; the Esther Williams-style water ballet star played by Scarlett Johansson (really just a cameo) is having a baby with no visible dad; the twin Hedda Hopper-style gossip columnists played by Tilda Swinton have gotten their fangs into an ancient Baird Whitlock scandal about how he got the leading role in a notorious picture called ""On Wings of Eagles."" (Whose title when uttered aloud is always accompanied by a distant cawing sound.) And Eddie himself is being courted for a lucrative job in the aircraft industry. As the recruiter for Lockheed observes reasonably enough ""Whats gonna happen to the pictures when everybody buys a television set?"" Im not super religious when it comes to spoilers (or when it comes to religion) but it wouldnt be fair to tell you much about Bairds kidnapping or what its all about. Except -- I cant help myself -- that Herbert Marcuse is involved and that I believe he is the only real-world individual to be named and portrayed in this movie. If youre already laughing about that youre in good shape but if you dont know who that is it totally does not matter. (On the other hand if youre warming up your blogging fingers for an irate diatribe about how this movies portrayal of Hollywood leftism is scurrilous neo-McCarthyite slander youre on your own.) ""Hail Caesar"" is the only movie anyone will ever make that features both Marcuse and Saul of Tarsus as characters along with a scene that perfectly captures the look and feeling of late Stalinist Soviet propaganda films. Apparently Dolph Lundgren plays a submarine captain though Im not going to tell you where he comes in or how and I didnt know that until I read through the credits. Dolph Lundgren uncredited at the helm of the Red October. This movie is exactly that great. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Mannix (Josh Brolin) is at the center of ""Hail Caesar"" The loose riff on the studio era is set in the early 1950s. But the Mannix here is not really Mannix but a jumping-off point for a fun and sloppy Coen brothers lampoon that compresses real characters reimagines others and brings together some of the periods many styles and currents. ""Hail Caesar"" can be enjoyed by anyone but the more you know about the eras movies the more youll appreciate it. The studio here is Capitol Pictures but its patterned on MGM with Mannix taking orders from a Mr. Schenck out of New York (that is Nicholas Schenck). When we first meet him his studio is funneling lots of money into its latest biblical epic ""Hail Caesar"" -- a sort of combination of the real-life films ""Ben-Hur"" and ""The Robe."" The Coens give us scenes from the film within the film which capture both the magnificence and absurdity of filmmaking at this time. The magnificence was in the Technicolor camera work and the completely uncynical way in which stars were presented as glorious -- such as when George Clooney as a dim-witted actor playing a centurion sits on a horse framed against the sky. A more ironic take on the era comes when the centurion in the desert cuts through to the front of a line of slaves to get water -- and then melts at the sight of Jesus seen only from behind. Clooney is very funny playing the scene with a completely unconvincing look of astonishment and transformation. What makes it funnier is that this is a stock scene that can be found in one form another in every biblical epic of the era. The Coens ""Hail Caesar"" is a flimsy construction that depends on a zany spirit and the charm of individual scenes to hold it together. There are times when this begins to feel like a dubious strategy but each time the movie rights itself. And if you keep your eyes open there is always something to notice Frances McDormand in a subtle tribute to MGMs longtime editor Margaret Booth or a boardroom adorned with nothing but framed photos of Wallace Beery. In the biblical epic you might also note the palm trees of a type that doesnt grow in the Middle East. As the focus of most scenes Brolin walks that distinct Coen brothers line between absurdity and realism sarcasm and pathos. Somehow the Coens get to have it both ways so that we see Mannix as a satirical figure and yet believe in his passion for the movie business. As the film star Clooney has the fun of playing a frivolous happy airhead in the offscreen scenes -- a motormouth with nothing to say -- and a screen idol in the film within a film. If he ever dreamed of being Kirk Douglas here he gets his chance. One of the Coens most inspired bizarre touches is to cast Tilda Swinton as rival gossip columnists twins who hate each other. Shes quite funny -- blithe and vindictive in one incarnation insecure and vindictive in the other. And Ralph Fiennes enlivens a couple of scenes as a refined gay director trying to direct a cowboy actor in a drawing room comedy -- the studio era described in a single sentence.

Its never a good bet but there must be times when all the agony pays off--when for instance you get to stage a water ballet featuring Scarlett Johansson in a shapely spangly mermaids costume or set a scowling George Clooney stomping around in a Roman mini-tunix and gladiator sandals or mount a buoyant song-and-dance number with Channing Tatum as a sailor getting ready to ship out tippety-tapping on tabletops even as he frets about the lack of dames at sea. Joel and Ethan Coen have been in the game long enough to indulge in those kinds of fanciful curlicues and they pack a lot of them into Hail Caesar Josh Brolin stars as a fifties-era Hollywood fixer named Eddie Mannix and hes a busy guy His duties include but are not limited to rescuing an arrogant drunken actor (Clooney) from a bunch of Communist kidnapers and dreaming up clever ways to cover up swimming starlet Johanssons out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Theres a lot going on in Hail Caesar and camera-bulb flashes of brilliance pop here and there. The Coens are in their woolly mode riffing on their fondness for tall tales and outlandish larger-than-life figures Theyve made some of their finest most enjoyable movies--like The Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou?--while chasing this ball-of-yarn muse. But in Hail Caesar their touch isnt light enough. They hit every beat as if it were a gong when what they really need is the tremor of a drumstick grazing the edge of a cymbal. Its as if the Coens want to give themselves over to all-out ridiculousness and simply cant manage In their hearts theyre cerebral guys and they never let us forget it. The super-secret lefty cabal that holds Clooneys superstar hostage is made up of disillusioned Hollywood screenwriters who aim to secretly implant their ideological messages in movie scripts. Thats exactly what the House Un-American Activities Committee in real life accused certain screenwriters of doing but in the Coens hands the gag feels arch and overworked. They fail even more miserably when they go for slapstick laughs In a throwaway scene Frances McDormand plays a film editor who nearly chokes to death when her trailing scarf is caught in the gears of a Moviola. Shes freed just in time--its the joke thats left gasping for breath. But the moments of glory from Hail Caesar would make one hell of a highlights reel. Ralph Fiennes saunters onto the scene as a musty has-been director trying to wrangle a charmingly inept cowboy star--played by relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich--into a stiff costume drama. Fiennes boils over trying to coach the poor kid on how to enunciate the impossible phrase ""Would that it were""--the duo transform the exchange into a Dada musical duet. Tilda Swinton appears in a dual role playing rival gossip columnists who also happen to be sisters One Swinton swans in with a carnival-striped mini hat perched ludicrously and marvelously atop her coiffure an instance of costume design (by Coens regular Mary Zophres) as sight gag. The Coens clearly wanted to fill Hail Caesar with the wonderful trifles contemporary movies no longer have a place for Silly hats on women Esther Williams-style water extravaganzas dancing sailors. Their love for these things is one of their most charming and admirable traits. Hail Caesar doesnt completely hang together. But Johansson in a mermaids tail? Really why else make movies--or go to them? Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Share Tweet ""Were not talking about money--were talking about economics"" Hail Caesar Joel and Ethan Coens broadest comedy since The Ladykillers lampoons Christian and leftist dogma by pitting straw men and stuffed shirts against whatever passes for common sense in the Coensverse embodied by yet another of the sibling duos beloved plainspoken cowboys. The Coens who skew crypto-conservative cant take anything resembling an ideology or counterculture seriously but here they defer to the logic of ""good feels right"" which is just as much of a non-answer as the jargon that gets recited by the movies assorted religious authorities (three priests a minister and a rabbi) and Communists. Like the often overlooked A Serious Man this is all about the absurdity of crises of faith. However the Coens fondness for intentional anti-climax--put to pointed and poignant use in movies like Inside Llewyn Davis No Country For Old Men Barton Fink and A Serious Man--gets the better of them.Perhaps it seems like over-thinking to quibble with the ideological talking points of a movie that mostly dawdles from one skit or cameo to another interspersed with the occasional song-and-dance number and which contains one of the best comic set pieces of the Coens career a director and his recently re-cast lead trying to work through a single awful line of dialogue (""Would that it were so simple"") while filming a turgid melodrama. But like so many of the brothers later films Hail Caesar ends where it started with the characters having huffed and gnashed their teeth and changed nothing--and whereas their great movies side with loser heroes turning failures into studies of people struggling to hold on in the face of apparent meaningless this one seems to be out to teach them a lesson to leave well enough alone. To all those who would characterize the Coens as smug misanthropes Enjoy this bounty of ammunition.Set in Hollywood in the mid-1950s Hail Caesar sometimes feels like the Coens 1941 which is to say that its central joke is that its playing the fears of its era at face value That Tinseltown is a Sodom and Gomorrah of vice and anti-American subtexts and that Soviet submarines lurk in American waters signaled by leftist study groups. Its all extremely on-the-nose; after all this is the kind of film that introduces a gay movie star with a butt-bumping sailor-themed musical number called ""No Dames."" The period setting is sketched in broad strokes (fittingly the only real-life filmmaker name-checked here is Norman Taurog director of Elvis vehicles and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies) giving the Coens a chance to play with dated and outmoded film techniques wipes birds-eye-view matte paintings painted backdrops unconvincing model submarines and in the movies most perverse act of homage a very long driving scene of questionable urgency. The aforementioned crises of faith are represented by Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a devoutly Catholic studio executive who is mulling over a lucrative job offer from Lockheed as he races around town to keep his projects running on schedule and his leads out of the gossip columns and Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the hard-partying star of a religious epic (also called Hail Caesar) kidnapped by reds who turn him on to Karl Marx and against his employers at the unsubtly named Capitol Pictures. What they both need per the Coens is a smack of aw-shucks common sense which comes in the form of stuntman-turned-cowboy-actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich downright revelatory). Doyles folksiness and thick twang are played for laughs but his Western bona fides--complete with a mouth full of false teeth from his days as a horse wrangler--are revered in the manner of No Country For Old Mens Sheriff Ed Tom Bell or The Big Lebowskis nameless stranger. (Compare to Inside Llewyn Davis phony cowboy Al Cody the most pathetic loser in a movie full of them.) Along with the usual putdowns of highfalutin artsy-fartsy types (a dog named Engels; a pronunciation of ""rodeo"" that rivals The Big Lebowskis ""thorough"" and Burn After Readings ""memoir"" at establishing snoot-hood) the movie takes swipes at something the Coens have never shown much of an interest in before Christian iconography represented by the ridiculous film-within-the-film Hail Caesar which ""tastefully"" depicts Christ only from the back as a robed figure with a head of impeccable long straight blond hair. There are other movies seen in various stages of production on the Capitol lot none completely convincing as period pastiche some funny as send-ups of bad filmmaking a musical starring an Esther Williams type named DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) who refers to her mermaid costume as a ""fish ass;"" Merrily We Dance directed by ascot-wearing priss Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes); bits of Doyles singing cowboy movies and the latest from Gene Kelly-esque dancer-athlete Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum showing off a surprisingly passable singing voice).Add in a string of one-scene cameos (everyone from Jonah Hill to Christopher Lambert) wacky gags (like having Tilda Swinton play rival gossip columnists) and an extended scene in which Mannix holds a meeting with religious leaders to consult on Hail Caesar only to have an Orthodox priest complain about the realism of the chariot scenes and a rabbi shrug every answer and what youve got is one overstuffed movie. Though the Coens are celluloid-shooting visual classicists their films often have unusual or lopsided structures introducing major characters very late or taking narrative detours halfway through. And as with so much about this writer-director-producer-editor duo their best and worst instincts are inseparable. The same aversion to classical form thats produced the filmmakers most ingenious shifts and denials of closure turns Hail Caesar into a grab-bag of ideas in various stages of formation full of dead ends and seemingly pointless sequences peppered with out-of-nowhere narration by Michael Gambon. Somewhere in there are stretches of the Coens funniest comedy since The Big Lebowski; it just takes a little patience.

Movie review Hail Caesar by the Coen brothers Article Tweet Universal George Clooney in Hail Caesar Hail Caesar      (out of five) Directors Joel and Ethan Coen Cast Josh Brolin George Clooney Scarlett Johansson Rating PG-13 (suggestive content smoking) Run time 100 min. By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1030am on Friday Feb. 05 2016 Friday Feb. 05 2016 Thursday Feb. 04 2016 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram ""People dont want facts -- they want to believe"" That cry arriving near the end of Joel and Ethan Coens dizzy delightful romp Hail Caesar is as close to a declaration of principles as the fraternal filmmakers have ever made. (Remember this is the same team that bamboozled people 20 years ago into thinking Fargo really was based on actual events.)People do want to believe -- in the magic of movies in the fantastical possibilities of escape provided by the silver screen and in the notion that when we gather in the dark the communal feeling of watching light on a screen borders on religious ritual.As a testament to the Coens skill such high-minded intentions dont deflate the films freewheeling frothy plot which moves at a pace unseen since the glory days of Preston Sturges. Josh Brolin stars as Eddie Mannix the head of production for the fictional Capital Pictures (and yes there really was an actual Eddie Mannix) who spends his days ""fixing"" the varied problems of the movie stars on the lot. Whether its hastily arranging cover for an unwed pregnant starlet scrambling to replace an actor or fending off scoop-hungry gossip columnists Mannix rises early and sleeps little if at all. He is a man who believes -- a supplicant before celluloid aware of its power and willing to go to great lengths to keep the dream factory humming along.A wrench is thrown into the works when movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney having a total blast) mysteriously vanishes from the set of Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ -- a wry homage one of many to Hollywoods mid-1950s infatuation with lavish period epics -- and Mannix must scramble to arrange a ransom while keeping the whole incident hush-hush.To give away much more would spoil the gleeful twists and turns that the Coens who also wrote the screenplay pack into the film. (Also of note cinematographer Roger Deakins loving visual evocations of Hollywoods Golden Age even occasionally framing scenes in the traditional 1.331 ratio.)The entire cast appears to be having just as much fun as Clooney Ralph Fiennes as the effeminate British director Laurence Laurentz Alden Ehrenreich as amiable cowpoke Hobie Doyle Channing Tatum as song-and-dance man Burt Gurney Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker Scarlett Johansson as gruff starlet DeeAnna Moran Frances McDormand as nicotine-stained editor C.C. Calhoun or Jonah Hill as taciturn accountant Joseph Silverman. There isnt a slack performance in the bunch -- often these A-list names are on screen for mere minutes -- and everyone is dialed into the films loopy frequency. Even as its most absurd Hail Caesar has an undertow of melancholy -- the feather-light narrative is given weight by allusions to Hollywoods painful unjust blacklist era and how the once-mighty empire of moviedom has fallen into disrepair (the fall of Rome if you will) -- marking it as a comedy with more on its mind than simple mirth.The Coens have paid warped tribute to Hollywood before. Who could forget the harrowing satire of 1991s Barton Fink? But the jabs are more affectionate than acidic in Hail CaesarTinseltown may not make em like they used to but fortunately for 21st-century audiences the Coen brothers can still make an audience believe.

Officially Mannix is the head of physical production at Capitol Pictures the fabled - and fictitious - dream factory of Joel and Ethan Coens early-50s Hollywood lark Hail Caesar Slideshow Review Despite heavyweight cast Hail Caesar is lightweight comedy Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Hail Caesar >> Unofficially Eddie played with square-jawed gusto by Josh Brolin is a fixer the guy who keeps his pampered stars in line or at least out of the scandal sheets. A water ballet beauty (Scarlett Johansson) pregnant and unwed needs a husband pronto. A singing cowboy (Alden Ehrenreich) needs a date fast and a dialect coach if hes going to make the move to sophisticated romances. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the biggest star of all needs help too. Hes been kidnapped by a gang of disgruntled screenwriters who happen to be ardent Communists. Theyre holding the dashing and slightly dim leading man hostage and holding up production of the costly Roman Empire epic for which Whitlock is striving mightily to remember his lines. The group of Marxist scenarists calls itself The Future which gives the brothers Coen the opportunity to have a studio gofer pull up on his bike and chirp ""Mr. Mannix I know it sounds screwy but someones calling from the future."" Hail Caesar which happens to be the title of the film-within-the-film starring Whitlock and a cast of thousands is a goofy conflation of Coenian elements the numbskull huggermugger of The Big Lebowski the La La Land surrealness of Barton Fink the Old Testament overlay of A Serious Man. But the film which looks great in a well-appointed affectionately fake way is not nearly as good as any of the above. The jokes only go so deep and the homages to vintage musicals (Channing Tatum in a sailors outfit tap-dancing on a bar) and grand costume spectacles (the sword-and-sandals Christ saga starring Whitlock) go only far enough to evoke a kind of kitschy nostalgia. As the center of gravity in this exceedingly lightweight affair - an affair that boasts Ralph Fiennes Jonah Hill Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton among its cast - Mannix has personal dilemmas to contend with too. A Lockheed executive has been dangling a generous job offer Mannixs way a job that comes with none of the craziness of his current gig. He could actually have time with his wife his kid. Whats a studio fixer to do? (Mannixs name and metier are taken from the real-life and legendary figure long in the employ of MGM.) Well what to do? Bark brood and bat around snappy Coen Brothers dialog thats what. Hail Caesar may juggle some heavy stuff - God Commies Box Office Receipts - but no matter how hard Brolins Mannix furrows his brow its impossible to take the guy seriously. Or to believe that hes taking himself seriously. While comedies by nature require little in the way of seriousness a little heft would be nice. Movies are ""a ration of dreams for all the weary people of the world"" somebody hoofing across the studio lot declares. But the rations are pretty meager this time around. sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea Published February 5 2016 -- 918 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Entertainment > Longwood Gardens beloved trippy Nightscape returns Things to Do Philly > East Passyunk Car Show and 11 other ways to recover from the DNC Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

EntertainmentMovies Hail Caesar Fun star turns in Coen brothers latest film Originally published February 3 2016 at 505 pm Updated February 4 2016 at 149 pm George Clooney plays an egotistic leading man in ""Hail Caesar"" (Photo Credit Alison Rosa) Review of ""Hail Caesar"" The Coen brothers make a charming but loosely threaded comedy set in 1951 Hollywood. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic The Coens-on-holiday comedy ""Hail Caesar"" set in 1951 Hollywood sparkles with star turns -- so much so that you get a little dizzy keeping up. George Clooney as egotistic (and not particularly brainy) leading man Baird Whitlock strides through the film in Roman sandals a mini-tunic and a not-quite-caught-up expression. Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-ish swimming starlet who witheringly refers to her mermaid tail as a ""fish ass."" Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists -- each desperate to out-scoop the other each so tightly wound that the feathers on their hats seem like quivering antennae. Alden Ehrenreich charmingly dorky as a young star of cowboy Westerns unable to cope when hes tossed into an elegant drawing-room comedy directed by the very demanding Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes perfection). (Grandly asked to deliver a ""mirthless chuckle"" Ehrenreichs Hobie can only offer a snort.) Then theres Frances McDormand as an ultraefficient film editor who swiftly recovers from near-suffocation when her scarf gets caught in the editing machine (""I shouldnt wear scahves"" is her breezy rejoinder). And Channing Tatum as a smooth song-and-dance man leading an ensemble of tap-dancing sailors in a scene that I could have happily watched all night. (Hiding within Magic Mike apparently was Gene Kelly.) Tying it all together is Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix a ""fixer"" for Capitol Pictures who spends his day looking decisively at his watch while racing from one crisis to another. All this sounds like a dream for movie audiences and Coen fans right? Almost. The individual bits of ""Hail Caesar"" are such fun that its easy to overlook that it doesnt quite add up -- the movie though brief seems to run out of energy before its end. So many of the performances are barely more than cameos; you wish Johansson and McDormand in particular along with a blink-and-youll-miss-him Jonah Hill had more to do. And Mannix though sturdily played by Brolin proves less compelling than those who flit around him. Movie Review    Hail Caesar with George Clooney Josh Brolin Alden Ehrenreich Ralph Fiennes Jonah Hill Scarlett Johansson Frances McDormand Tilda Swinton Channing Tatum. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some suggestive content and smoking. Several theaters. But Ill forgive just about anything from a movie that refers to a stand-in named ""Chunk Mulligan"" or allows its characters to have genuinely surprising (and funny) secrets or includes a song with the lyric ""But mermaids (pronounced moimaids) got no gams"" or that lets Roger Deakins camera linger on Tatum leaning on a piano key singing with all the wide-eyed yearning of any Golden Age star-in-the-making. ""Hail Caesar"" isnt the great film you might like it to be but its very very good fun.

"Review Coen brothers Hail Caesar falls flat - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Coen brothers Hail Caesar falls flatBy Karen DSouzakdsouzamercurynews.comPosted 02/03/2016 113618 AM PSTUpdated 02/03/2016 053226 PM PST Related StoriesFeb 3The Coen brothers Five classic scenes from iconic moviesLend me your ears moviegoers.I come to bury ""Hail Caesar"" not to praise it. Make no mistake I mean no disrespect to Joel and Ethan Coen the Oscar-winning filmmakers who brought us jewels such as ""Fargo"" and ""True Grit."" The Coens have been the kings of quirky for decades with an eclectic canon bursting with gravity wit and style but their empire wobbles with this overstuffed homage to the Hollywood of yore the realm of sleazebags bombshells and movie moguls. An oddball sense of comedy has long been the Coens hallmark but the movie takes itself so painfully seriously that its rarely funny. Ironically ""Caesar"" feels as cheesy as the bloated prestige pictures it sets out to spoof. Think ""Cleopatra"" only with less camp value. At times you suspect the Coens must be going for the mesmerizing slow burn of ""Barton Fink"" or the sizzle of ""Blood Simple"" but the fire here fizzles out all too fast. George Clooney as Baird Whitlock in Hail Caesar (Alison Rosa/Universal Studios) ( Alison Rosa/Universal Studios ) An ornately crafted but emotionally lifeless valentine to the Golden Age of Hollywood ""Caesar"" tries too hard to intoxicate us with its unbridled flashiness from Esther Williams-style water ballets to Ziegfeld-worthy choreography. But theres nothing to ground all this eye candy. Few of the characters are compelling and the narrative loses its pizazz long before the film starts to lecture us about Marxist dialectics the means of production and the alienation of the body politic. Advertisement Until then the plots a trifle about dim-witted Hollywood star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney mugging up a storm) who is kidnapped by radicals from the writers guild creating a mess that only fedora-donning studio fixer Eddie Mannix (a one-note Josh Brolin) can clean up. In between finessing the pregnancy of a starlet (a nicely hard-boiled Scarlett Johansson) and fending off Hedda Hopper-ish twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (each played by a wonderfully witchy Tilda Swinton) Mannix foils the guilds evil communist plot and keeps the studio humming like a beehive. The pompous narration doesnt help matters as the tone of the film veers wildly from noir to nonsense while peppered with a nonstop lineup of cameos ranging from Frances McDormand (a Coen brothers stalwart) to Jonah Hill. To be sure the Coen brothers spared no expense on the epic production numbers. Its hard to resist the pleasures of a chiseled Channing Tatum as the dapper Burt Gurney getting his tap dance on in the manner of Gene Kelly. The homoerotic bits of the sailor dance number are cheeky and Ralph Fiennes is a stitch as a posh director roped into casting a cowboy in a drawing room picture. But for the most part the filmmakers gags fall flat. There are quite a few scenes involving a studio-invented romance between dopey cowboy star Hobie (Alden Ehrenreich) and perky Carmen Miranda look-alike Carlotta (Veronica Osorio) that are utterly mystifying in their total lack of chemistry or drollery or subtext. Johansson all dolled up in period finery has the glamour to give the picture juice but shes not on screen enough. Even Clooney squanders his dapper appeal as the buffoon Baird a hard-partying star so easily duped he almost renounces fame and fortune for a little quality time debating Hegel with the kidnappers. Theres none of the juicy suspense of nabbings and ransoms past such as ""Raising Arizona"" or ""The Big Lebowski."" Even the ""Ben-Hur""-style action sequences which should burst with rousing action feel less than epic to an eye weaned on the blood-splattered pageants of ""Game of Thrones.""Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the film is the nagging feeling that the Coens do indeed have something fascinating to say about the inner workings of Hollywood but the flailing ""Hail Caesar"" isnt it.Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

Its Coen lite basically but still filled with their best signatures cracked humor indelible characters and cinematography so rich and saturated you want to dunk a cookie in it. The only thing missing is a good bloody murder. Josh Brolin stars as Eddie Mannix a studio fixer with a lot to fix His leading man (George Clooney) has been kidnapped by Communists his prize mermaid (Scarlett Johansson) is knocked up and the company cowboy (Alden Ehrenreich) needs to learn how to straddle a new role stat. Plus theres a conniving pair of twin gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton double-dipped) to contain fussy directors to pacify and a ""civilian"" job offer that could take Eddie away from it all. The plots plate-spinning is mostly an excuse though for the Coens to play with their favorite thing filmmaking. There are at least five movies set inside Caesar--including a sublimely silly song-and-dance number starring Channing Tatum as a tap-shoed sailor--and each one from sword-and-sandal epics to costume melodramas and hokey Westerns gets a note-perfect tribute. Its all too winky and meta to amount to much in the end but its also too fun to care.

After all ""Hail Caesar"" is the Coens valentine to the grand old days of movies with Biblical epics mermaid pictures and Westerns being shot on the studio lot.If youre not you could say that for all its love of movies its a disjointed film with charming individual set pieces that never quite add up to a coherent whole. And youd be more accurate with that answer.If that sounds like its an entertaining movie that ultimately disappoints well ... yeah. Not horribly but it doesnt rank near the Coens best even though it feels like it should.We meet Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) an old-time fixer for Capital Pictures in an unusual place for such a person in a confessional where it has been 24 hours since his last confession (its 4 a.m.). Its the 1950s and once hes had his soul cleansed Eddie is working getting a starlet out of a moral jam (""a French postcard situation"" a cop calls it) while trying to quit smoking.AZCENTRALHail Coen Top 10 movies from Joel and Ethan CoenIts the smallest of problems hell face. The studio boss demands that Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) star in the latest movie by the hoity-toity director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) even though for most of Doyles successful career as a cowboy star hes delivered his dialogue to a horse.DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) an Esther Williams-like star who spends a lot of her screen time in pools (dressed as a mermaid for her current picture) needs to find a third husband and fast.Worst of all Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the studios biggest star has gone missing in the middle of shooting a ""Ben Hur""-like epic and right before shooting the movies most important scene.Eddie has to figure all of this out while weighing a lucrative offer from Lockheed. Wave of the future and all that.Meanwhile he meets with religious leaders to make sure Bairds film is offensive to no one and stops by a set while Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) is filming an elaborate song-and-dance number. He also fends off competing twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton plays both) and has to sort of deal with a Communist threat.Channing Tatum sings and dances as a Gene Kelly-esque movie star in ""Hail Caesar"" the latest from the Coen brothers. (Photo Universal Pictures)Its a busy day -- and night -- and Brolin was born to play hard-boiled characters like Eddie. Yet while individually some of the scenes are terrific they dont add up to much making ""Hail Caesar"" one of the Coens lesser comedies better than ""Intolerable Cruelty"" say but nowhere near the genius of ""The Big Lebowski.""Why not? These guys clearly love movies and movies about movies should be right up their alley. Indeed the film-within-a-film bits are among the best things about it. Laurences hopeless efforts to coax something like a proper scene out of Hobie are hilarious if somewhat obvious. Clooney can misfire wildly when playing goofy comedy (see ""Intolerable Cruelty"" again and his own ""Leatherheads""). But here his Baird is if not exactly intelligent at least not so over-the-top stupid that you cant recognize him as a believable character.AZCENTRALHail Caesar (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAnd Tatum is just flat-out terrific in that song-and-dance scene. (He added tap dancing to his repertoire for the film -- and singing.) Its when he shows up later at a crucial point that hes on shakier ground and by that time so is the film.The plot that strings all of these entertaining bits and pieces together simply never coalesces into anything particularly meaningful making it difficult to truly hail ""Hail Caesar""Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Taylor Swift Tom Hiddleston Cant Stop Smiling on Date Night Kelly Clarkson Hilariously Forgets the Lyrics to Her Hit Songs Exclusive Hail Caesar Review George Clooney Channing Tatum Waste Their Talents on a Throwaway Screwball Comedy February 3 2016  900 AM By Mara Reinstein 2 stars (out of 4 stars)George Clooney Scarlett Johansson Josh Brolin Jonah Hill Ralph Fiennes and Channing Tatum must really really really really really really love working with writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen.  Theres no other explanation as to why this A-list ensemble would converge and waste their energies on this throwaway screwball comedy. What could have been a smart-yet-silly love letter to a bygone era is a farce without the laughs. The brothers sense of humor here is so arch that it might as well be set in St. Louis. Instead we go to Hollywood circa the 1950s back in the Golden Age of film. Harried Capitol Studios exec Eddie Mannix (Brolin) makes his living as a troubleshooter cleaning up his star clients messes. (Fun fact alert Mannix was a real-life Hollywood fixer who died in the 1960s.) If that means this family man has to slap an actor across the face to get his way fine. If he needs to feed gossip to a female newspaper columnist and then give contradictory statements to her twin sister ... even better. George Clooney and Amal Alamuddins Love Story Hes earning his paycheck big time lately. On the set of a gladiator epic called Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ dimwitted leading man Baird Whitlock (Clooney) has just been kidnapped from his trailer. The ransom is 100000. Meanwhile a starlet who performs synchronized swimming in water ballets (Johansson speaking in a grating New Yawk accent) just got knocked up. And a snooty British director (Fiennes) throws a hissy fit because he doesnt like the slow-on-the-uptake style of one of his actors. Scarlett Johansson in Hail Caesar Universal Pictures Essentially this is a series of zany vignettes strung together with little payoff. Clooney ends up in a living room where a group of Communist screenwriters (dubbed The Future) intellectually seduce him. Just when theres traction on that story line Johansson and Brolin hatch a plan so she can have her baby and keep it too. (Hill in what amounts to a cameo appears in this sequence.) Considering all the talent involved its only natural to be patient during the waning moments and keep faith that the sublime-ness will soon kick in. It doesnt except in oh-so-small doses Frances McDormand for instance is a hoot (yes a hoot) in her scene as a batty projectionist. More of that please Best and Worst Movie Remakes Dont bother emotionally investing in the characters either. Thats not the point. With lectures on gossip and greed the Coen brothers are now trying to put their own subversive spin on the Hollywood political game. Indeed considering that their droll comedy over the past three decades ranges from O Brother Where Art Thou? to Barton Fink to Raising Arizona more is expected from these Oscar winners than a handful of cheeky laughs and a message along the lines of ""Its so easy to be manipulated in Tinseltown"" And yet the only true standout scene features no spoken dialogue. Surely youve seen the clips by now For six glorious minutes Tatum sings and tap-dances in Anchors Aweigh a Gene Kelly-style musical about sailors in a bar leaving for port. Just in case the Tatum charm-o-meter index isnt already at full capacity after two Magic Mike flicks and his Beyonce-approved turn on Lip Sync Battle this showstopper seals it. Channing Tatums Sexy Shirtless Body Like many moments in the period piece though the enjoyment fades in a hurry. And the two meaningful words that cap off most 1950s films -- The End -- cant arrive soon enough.

Bringing their deadpan absurdism to those final glorious days in L.A. -- before stars ran their own production companies and the studios had to stop owning theaters and that damn television box was in every home in America -- the Coens revel in both the glamour and the squalor of post-war Hollywood with a film that more than makes up in wit and flash what it might lack in substance. See Video George Clooney Gets Kidnapped in First Trailer for Coen Brothers Hail Caesar Studio chief Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) apparently never sleeps; if hes not one step ahead of the cops in getting a starlet out of a risque photo session hes fulfilling seemingly impossible orders from the money men in New York like casting cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich ""Beautiful Creatures"") in an urbane society comedy directed by old studio hand Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). (And if there were another three hours of the increasingly flummoxed Laurentz trying to coax a performance out of the game but out of his depth Doyle Id happily watch it.) Foremost in Eddies mind are the whereabouts of missing matinee idol Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) whose latest epic ""Hail Caesar"" bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Ben-Hur"" down to the ""A Tale of the Christ"" subtitle. Whitlock has been slipped a mickey by some day players who take him to a house in Malibu where the star finds himself being indoctrinated and held hostage by a cell of Communist screenwriters. Also Read George Clooney Reveals Plot Details for His Matt Damon Julianne Moore Movie Suburbicon And as if frustrated directors and ransom demands werent enough to keep Eddie hopping theres aquatic musical star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) whose impending out-of-wedlock pregnancy is starting to show through her bathing suit; lunches with an aerospace executive whos trying to get Eddie away from the picture business and into a 9-to-5 job; clergy of various stripes who all have script notes for ""Hail Caesar""; and twin columnists (both played by Tilda Swinton) out for a scoop. With a team of skilled art directors not to mention legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins the Coens have a blast recalling old Hollywood both in their recreations of actual movie moments (Johanssons channeling of Esther Williams is a little more dead-on than a tap-dancing Channing Tatums Gene Kelly but only by a little) and in making this movie look like something from an earlier era. Late in the film theres a nighttime shot of Channing where hes got a skin tone you havent seen on screen since Nicholas Ray died. Also Read Coen Brothers to Write Possibly Direct Crime Movie Black Money for Warner Bros. And in true old-Hollywood fashion theres a star being born here Ehrenreich whose aw-shucks demeanor in the face of studio duplicity (and hedonism) is consistently hilarious. And heck he even knows how to jump through a lasso. Its no easy feat being the standout here -- the marquee names are all delightfully funny not to mention the passel of character actors playing the blacklisted writers -- but Ehrenreichs going to have moviegoers learning how to spell his name. Theres nothing particularly deep going on but in a way the very breeziness of ""Hail Caesar"" makes it the ultimate homage to the studio era. Sure cinephiles will enjoy catching references to ""Vertigo"" and ""Kiss the Blood Off My Hands"" but overall this is a bright and goofy valentine to a bygone age of moviemaking.

TWITTER 2/5/2016 The Coen brothers latest a comedy about 1950s Hollywood stars Josh Brolin George Clooney Scarlett Johansson Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum. As a comedy about early 1950s Hollywood the Coen brothers Hail Caesar has trouble achieving lift-off and even then can barely manage to stay airborne much longer than Howard Hughes Spruce Goose. But simultaneously hidden in plain sight is a very different film the story of a notorious real-life big studio fixer Eddie Mannix recast here as a secular saint who does nothing but good for the many and diverse people he must tend to in the course of his demanding job. In short the Coens work in mysterious ways in this odd piece one that offers just intermittent pleasures and may be most fruitfully considered alongside one of the brothers most resonant creations A Serious Man; this is a portrait of a righteous man in a morals-free zone. Despite the starry cast this knuckle curveball likely will result in a commercial pop-up. The films religious orientation is set up by the framing device of the tough middle-aged Mannix (Josh Brolin) in confession a daily event at which the worst he can come up with is that he snuck a few cigarettes even though hes trying to quit (the annoyed priest even complains that he comes in too often for the little he has to confess). The context is further cemented by the fact that Capitol Pictures big production of the moment is Hail Caesar subtitled A Tale of the Christ (as was Ben-Hur) and toplining the studios biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) as a Roman aristocrat who comes around to believing in the crucified Jewish preacher a la The Robe. As this is ostensibly a comedy the Coens original screenplay begins layering in the innumerable daily crises Mannix must deal with mostly stemming from self-involved actors not known for their I.Q.s who have a remarkable knack for getting themselves into tight spots from which only Mannix can extricate them. The mans day begins at 5 a.m. and never lets up his labors facilitated by an exceptionally organized secretary and his own resourcefulness and imagination; he is entirely sincere and always places the needs of others and the studio before his own. Right off the bat its clear that from a comedy perspective somethings misfiring; the confession opening isnt funny the Roman saga feels a little off and Mannix is an entirely serious guy. Even a scene in which he solicits script comments from religious leaders of every faith about Hail Caesar isnt terribly humorous. Things pick up a bit with a re-creation of an Esther Williams-style water ballet featuring none other than Scarlett Johansson who talks like a sailor with a New York accent and seems never to be without a sex scandal; the latest is akin to the old ""Loretta Young problem"" something Mannix puts legal wiz Joe Silverman (Jonah Hill) to work on. Then theres the dilemma faced by  director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) a specialist in sophisticated drawing room drama whos suddenly saddled with teaching rope-twirling cowboy actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) how to make refined dialogue effortlessly trip off his tongue as if hed lived in Mayfair all his life. But Mannixs biggest problem is that Baird Whitlock has vanished having passed out after drinking something on the set. In the event Baird has been kidnapped by Hollywood communists. These rich old writers hold their captive at a grand Malibu beach house that looks like it could occupy a site adjacent to where Tony Stark will one day build a far more opulent dwelling. But as they await a 100000 ransom payment the salon Marxists try to get Baird to embrace their line of thinking; hell they even have Herbert Marcuse there with them to lend their ""study group"" additional gravitas. Meanwhile the sun never sets on Eddie Mannixs tasks. In one of their slyest strokes the Coens have cast Tilda Swinton as identical twin gossip columnists who hate each other and are always vying for the same dirt; Eddie manipulates them both like marionettes. Charming Hobie goes on an arranged date to a premiere of his latest film with starlet Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) which sets one of the gossip twins abuzz. All the while Mannix must make an overnight decision whether or not to accept a much more lucrative offer to quit the movie business and join Lockheed which would give him regular hours and allow him to be home with his family for dinner every night. Out of left (or perhaps right under the circumstances) field comes the films dazzling highlight a sailor-themed dance number starring Channing Tatum. A thrill and a delight the sequence would have been right at home in an Arthur Freed/Vincente Minnelli musical of the time and demonstrates that Tatum could have been a star in the old Hollywood just as he is in the new. When all is said and done Mannix does the right thing in every circumstance orchestrating what in Hollywood terms was always considered a happy ending. Sometimes it just requires persuasiveness and common sense at other times some strong-arming. But in religious terms Mannix is a wise man among fools opportunists and the misguided -- a man who makes a difference in the world while making his daily appointed rounds. What would the real Eddie Mannix have thought of such a depiction of himself? The Coens reimagining of a real Hollywood tough guy is interesting for insiders but in their first order of business that of making a rousing comedy about the Hollywood of 65 years ago theyve fallen rather short. There is amusement to be had engaging actors to admire and beautiful craftsmanship to behold but the entertainment quotient is below their usual standard when it comes to the films they target for a mass audience of which this is one. Brolin strides through it all like a Hollywood tough guy with a heart of gold ever-vigilant of those he must protect selfless and always ready with a solution. The Coens like to use Clooney in doofus roles and so it is here the actor playing another actor who wouldnt know a commie from a capitalist. Fiennes has fun with his exasperation over an insurmountable directorial challenge as does Swinton playing the two imperious gossip queens for the price of one. The most pleasant surprise is Ehrenreich who invests his simple sagebrush star with genuine charm and pulls off some very smooth rope moves. But probably the funniest moment belongs to Frances McDormand as the studios chain-smoking chief film cutter (no doubt based on MGMs legendary Margaret Booth) whose relationship with her Moviola becomes altogether too close for comfort. As always with the Coens the film looks impeccable. Employing several Hollywood backlots to evoke the moment when the Old Hollywood was just beginning to show its age (the film is specifically set in 1951) the directors and their ace team of production designer Jess Gonchor cinematographer Roger Deakins (shooting on film) and costume designer Mary Zophres show their customary flair and have fun decking out the varied assortment of films being shot by Capitol at a given moment (although the aspect ratios of them curiously vary).

Anchored by a terrific Josh Brolin as gruff 1950s-era studio ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix ""Hail Caesar"" lacks the bite of the Coens darkest comedies and the bizarro vision of the film industry of ""Barton Fink"" but offers a lighter access point to those same attributes. Its a charming consolidation of their appeal that both celebrates and mocks its target. In short catnip for Coen fans. Energized by the ever-reliable cinematographer Roger Deakins slick colors ""Hail Caesar"" follows Mannix through a series of outrageous conundrums surrounding his talent. While the real-life Mannix served as general manager for MGM ""Hail Caesar"" positions him on a nondescript lot dealing with star troubles big and small. His series of challenges take the place of a cogent plot which this kind of carefree movie doesnt really need anyway. Theres the relatively minor quibbles surrounding DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) a pregnant actress coping with gas troubles in the middle of a spectacular ""Footlight Parade""-like water number and the goofy cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich underrated since his breakout role in Frances Ford Coppolas ""Twixt"" and finally getting his due here) who struggles to tamp down his southern twang for a different kind of role. Pretty boy Burt Gurney a song-and-dance man whos a natural fit for Channing Tatum may or may not harbor a nefarious agenda. Above all else the Cold War setting provides Mannix with his biggest conspiratorial dilemma when the buffoonish actor Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) winds up unwittingly kidnapped by Hollywood Communists in full Roman regalia in the midst of shooting a cheesy crucifixion movie. The Coens cycle through these interlocking incidents with mixed results but unlike the cringe-worthy attempts at throwback comedy in their duds ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"" the snappy energy of each scene holds the proceedings together. A peculiar exchange between Clooneys Baird and his anti-capitalist kidnappers -- among the naifs hes played for the Coens over the years this reigns supreme -- drags on and on but the Coens feel no need to rush ahead. A bizarre riff on the McCarthy-era paranoia of the time the scenario plays out like Hollywood itself dreaming of its own weird myths. Other bits have a similarly listless quality elevated by the Coens unique comic energy. In one standout moment Ralph Fiennes surfaces as an embellished version of Laurence Olivier (he goes by Laurence Laurentz which leads to numerous confusing exchanges) whos tasked by Mannix with getting the one-note buckaroo Doyle to sculpt his language for an off-brand role. (Forcing the actor to repeat the line ""Would that it twere so simple"" to no avail Laurences efforts devolve into a pitch-perfect ""Whos on first"" routine.) Wearing a deep scowl as he puts out one fire after another Brolins Mannix endows the movie with a steady foundation even as it veers all over the place. Some gags are more effective than others but individual subplots hold their own. Tilda Swinton surfaces in a pair of amusing roles as dueling sibling reporters constantly bugging the various power players for dirt -- and mostly confusing them. Doyle finds himself in a sweet romance with Latina star Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio). Tatum performs a phenomenal Gene Kelly-like number in a sailor suit thats like the squeaky-clean alternative to his undulations in ""Magic Mike."" At the same time these ingredients rarely congeal into a single vision. Random cameos from Jonah Hill and Frances McDormand are amusing enough but dont contribute enough to the world for their appearances to register as much more than cheeky asides. And even as it reaches for an outrageous Communist fantasy somewhere near its third act ""Hail Caesar"" ultimately sizzles with an abrupt ending that suggests the Coens didnt know where to stop. In a less exuberant version of this movie that might make the whole enterprise lose its appeal. But the confidence of the Coens freewheeling collage sends a different message -- that even a minor work from this pair can hit all their sweet spots. Despite its lightweight qualities ""Hail Caesar"" is a genuinely entertaining commentary on the insular universe of the studio system or at least the way it has been memorialized by the history books in larger-than-life proportions. The Coens get their cake and eat it too The lavish period details paired with marvelous song-and-dance routines work on their own terms while a firm self-awareness looms over every scene. Its a tricky balance indicative of directors who know exactly what theyre going for An old-fashioned homage to classic Hollywood and a send-up of the very same thing. Grade B+ ""Hail Caesar"" opens nationwide on February 5.

I often found myself smiling while watching without really knowing where the smile had come from. Quietly sly with beautiful staging. The long takes just let you soak in all the details and the costumes crisply define every person on the screen from Brolins baggy suit to Tildas perfect hats to the shiny extras in every scene. Reply JoeM May 12 2016 1209 pm This movie is up there with Burn After Reading...awful. Just awful. Its bizarre how the Coens can make CLASSICS and then make absolute stinkers. A Serious Man and Inside Llewyn Davis are two of my favorite movies. Caesar just meanders jokes fall flat. Like olde timey earth is flat flat.

But like every reflection the picture is the real thing only reversed with fun-house distortions in place of their honest inspirations. So sunny Gene Kelly is transformed into Burt Gurney a slightly more complicated song-and-dance man. An Esther Williams-style star becomes a foul-mouthed flirt; gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons are combined then split into identical twins. And Eddie Mannix studio fixer extraordinaire - the fellow every star called before he called the cops - becomes well Eddie Mannix. Although this time the exec is a devout family man who believes heart and soul in the magic of the glorious motion picture business. Those Coen boys. Such jokers. In fact studio executive Mannix was -- depending on which Hollywood legends you believe -- a tough Jersey guy with murderous mob ties. But in their dizziest reinvention the Coens make him Hollywoods last idealist -- someone who sees the corporate days coming and yet remains devoted to this family business of make-believe. As are the Coens obviously; despite a few real names and situations their wildly fictional ""Hail Caesar"" has as much connection to reality as ""Fargo"" did to the ""true story"" it mockingly claimed to be based on. Its nearly as entertaining too and definitely their lightest film in years. In their rewrite of history Mannix is the head of (the fictional) Capitol Pictures a bursting-at-the-seams dream factory. The studios deep in the midst of a Biblical picture when the leading man -- think George Clooney as an only slightly more serious Victor Mature -- is kidnapped. Mannix has to find him. But meanwhile he has to figure out what to do with a pregnant unwed star with an increasingly prominent belly. Oh and meet the demands of the back East moneyman who wants a molasses-voiced cowpoke cast as the lead in a drawing-room comedy. For movie fans raised on Hollywood histories both true and false ""Hail Caesar"" is a riot of in-jokes and knowing references often with slightly altered names or oft-repeated rumors (just how did Clark Gable get his big break?) assigned to other fictional actors. For most of the performers called upon to play these altered alter-egos the whole thing is a delight. Clooney who often overplays in his Coen comedies is winning as the big dumb studio star while Scarlett Johansson displays a screeching accent that would frighten Lina Lamont. And Channing Tatum shows off even better dance movies than in the ""Magic Mike"" films (although sorry girls -- and boys -- this time he keeps his clothes on). Even better though is Josh Brolin. It may not be fair to still call him ""underrated"" after a good decade of terrific performances but once again hes a slowly dawning delight -- the genuine hurt he shows when someone runs down his studio the anger that finally erupts when a star suggests that the movies arent important. But as usual no one is having more fun than the Coens. Set at an ersatz MGM the film fudges some period details but gets almost everything else right -- the studios rich Technicolor palette a movie-musical style just teetering on the edge of camp. You can almost imagine the directors giggling as they set up their Busby-Berkeley kaleidoscopes or cue up another bit of portentous narration. (They also lightly mock themselves with an ongoing joke that nods to the ""Shut the (bleep) up Donny"" one from ""The Big Lebowski."") The brothers get a few things seriously wrong though particularly with a subplot about Communist screenwriters. By 1951 the blacklist was in effect; these men were in prison or exile not in Malibu mansions. And -- even allowing for the exaggerations of farce -- they werent having meetups with Soviet submarines. Thats the kind of wild fantasy even Joe McCarthy would have shied away from. Yeah yeah I know pal -- its only a movie. But as Eddie would snarl Whaddaya mean ""only""? Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual references and substance abuse. Hail Caesar (PG-13) Universal. (106 min.) Directed by Ethan Coen Joel Coen. With George Clooney Channing Tatum Scarlett Johansson.

But this is a whopper Just before his climactic speech is filmed for the Spartacus-y epic Hail Caesar one of several movies-within-a-movie Baird Whitlock (Clooney) is nabbed and held for 100000 ransom by a shady bunch calling itself ""The Future.""USA TODAYCoens revisit the era of the Hollywood fixerUSA TODAYWhos who in Coens Hail Caesar HollywoodIf only that were all for the embattled Eddie. Theres also the aquatic-movie starlet (Scarlett Johansson) with a bun in the oven and no lack of potential fathers; a song-and-dance man (Channing Tatum) whos not quite what he seems; twin rival gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton times two) digging for scoops about Baird going AWOL; and the chaos that ensues when a snooty English director (a deliciously over-the-top Ralph Fiennes) is forced to work with a young cowboy star (Alden Ehrenreich) whose roping skills are better than his dramatic diction.The films episodic nature is akin to the Coens brilliant O Brother Where Art Thou? their old-timey ode to Homer with Clooney as a pomade-slathered doofus. That cinematic odyssey deftly moved the same characters through a series of situations while Hail Caesar -- though it has a common thread in Mannix -- gets lost in its own hustle and bustle. The plot meanders as Caesar bounces from a high-class British affair to an all-male revue in a seafarers bar and its not until the end when everythings nicely tidied up that the viewer gets a sense of how well-crafted the film actually is.USA TODAYHail Caesar 5 things we learned at the premiereUSA TODAY10 things we learned at the O Brother Where Art Thou? reunionSome bits fall flat yet when the Coens hit theres nothing better especially with their usual ridiculously sublime banter. When Eddie extols the virtues of a stable family life Johanssons swimming thespian tells him in a ""New Yawk"" accent that ""marrying a third louse aint gonna do me no good."" Often the artistic meets the absurd In the middle of a water-filled Busby Berkeley-esque number expertly crafted by the Coens go-to cinematographer Roger Deakins a bandleader under a gigantic seashell gets blindsided by an expertly thrown tiara.While the Magic Mike films showed he has a vast array of dance moves Tatum proves his chops as a Renaissance man crooning and tapping as a screen sailor and lamenting that ""mermaids aint got no gams."" Brolin is also game as the brusque eye in the storm of oddballs though no ones having more fun in this star-studded romp than Clooney as the milquetoast thespian who gets a little Stockholm syndrome and then gets slapped around for it.He may be the worlds top celebrity but for the Coens Clooney is simply their favorite nitwit.He may be the worlds top celebrity but for the Coens Clooney is simply their favorite nitwit.

If theres such a thing as poker-faced exuberance you can feel it in every loving teasing frame of Joel and Ethan Coens ""Hail Caesar"" an inside-showbiz lark that regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost skepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest. Starring Josh Brolin as a hard-working industry ""fixer"" tasked with keeping big-budget productions on track and wayward stars in line this gorgeously crafted romp through the backlots and Malibu enclaves of Hollywoods Golden Age tosses off plenty of eccentric comedy and musical razzle-dazzle before taking on richer more ruminative dimensions ultimately landing on the funny-sad question of whether life is but a dream factory. Although it boasts enough marquee names and splashy crowdpleasing angles to deliver good returns for Universal this is as strange and singular an offering as anything the Coens have ever done and as such its more thoughtful elusive undertones could stand in the way of broader public acceptance. It bows Feb. 5 Stateside a week before premiering overseas as the Berlin Film Festivals opening-night attraction. The high-powered Hollywood fixer has been enjoying an on-screen mini-renaissance on the evidence of Showtimes Liev Schreiber-starring ""Ray Donovan"" and now the Coen brothers lavish throwback to an earlier era of industry damage control as overseen here by the character of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a fictionalized composite of the real-life studio VP Mannix and his head of publicity Howard Strickling. The various scandals that Mannix and Strickling covered up during their decades working together at MGM could easily furnish several films of their own but the Coens generally steer clear of salaciousness in favor of a jaundiced but affectionate character study treating Brolins eternally put-upon Eddie as a beacon of relative sanity and intelligence in a world overrun by irrationality venality and corruption. Indeed had the Coens not already made a film called ""A Serious Man"" neither the title nor the theological baggage would have been misapplied to this version of Eddie a hard-working Catholic family man first seen unburdening his soul to a priest and not just because hes sneaked a few cigarettes behind his wifes back. Its the 50s and as the designated fixer for Capitol Pictures (played here in a sly amalgam of the Universal Warner Bros. Paramount and Sony lots plus the courtyard of Los Angeles Union Station) Eddie is tasked with preserving the illusion of Hollywood glamour and propriety at a time of pervasive moral crackdown and sociopolitical upheaval taking not-always-savory steps to ensure that production runs smoothly and top talents stay out of the headlines. That can mean anything from smacking around an up-and-coming actress caught in an illicit photo shoot to arranging for prized star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson terrifically brassy if a bit underused) to secretly adopt her own out-of-wedlock child (a twist inspired directly by the real-life Mannixs similar arrangement for Loretta Young). It also means enforcing the studios questionable decision to cast the handsome dumb-as-a-stump cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich superb) an audience hit in a recent string of Westerns in an elegant parlor drama called ""Merrily We Dance"" -- to the quiet chagrin of the prestigious director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) whose patient attempts to steer the hopeless Hobie through a single line of dialogue provide the film with one of its most delicious scenes. But Eddies stress load kicks up a notch with the sudden disappearance of Capitols top star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) who is abducted from the set of an expensive Roman epic called ""Hail Caesar"" -- clearly modeled on ""Ben-Hur"" right down to the ""A Tale of the Christ"" subtitle -- which the studio was hoping to be its big year-end cash cow. And so it falls to the fixer to track down Baird and bring him back all while cleverly avoiding the threats and insinuations of rival Hollywood gossip columnists and identical twin sisters Thora and Thessaly Thacker both played by Tilda Swinton in a succession of Hedda Hopper hats (the splendid work of costume designer Mary Zophres). If nothing else then the Coen brothers have employed their gifts for satire and pastiche to concoct a vastly wittier more knowing and entertaining evocation of HUAC-era Hollywood than the recent ""Trumbo"" -- a connection driven home when Baird awakens in Malibu to find hes been kidnapped by a cabal of disgruntled screenwriters who have joined the Communist Party to protest ""the pure instrument of capitalism"" that studios like Capitol (aha) have become. Unsurprisingly the Coens treat this self-righteous statement of principle as an opportunity for ridicule. Basically presented as a series of belligerent reaction shots these socialist scribes (played by actors including Fisher Stevens Patrick Fischler David Krumholtz and Fred Melamed) may well pride themselves on sticking up ""for the little guy"" but the film has no interest in exalting their politics much less their benighted profession. Instead it casts a casually withering stare at every corner and stratum of the industry from the ego-driven auteurs and bed-hopping stars all the way down to the lowly extras who fill their frames and occasionally throw a major wrench into the gears. Its no surprise then that Eddie is eyeing the exit -- or he would be if he had more than a minute to spare for the Lockheed headhunter (Ian Blackman) whos trying to lure him away from the frivolity of Tinseltown and help prepare America for its looming nuclear catastrophe. But try as he might Eddie would rather make movies not war and its this impulse that accounts for why ""Hail Caesar"" despite its wickedly serrated edge never tilts into cynicism or intolerable cruelty. Their craft seemingly honed to an even sharper point of perfectionism and clarity than usual the Coens delight in laying bare the nuts and bolts of the process whether theyre steering us through the gloriously artificial sets used on Bairds Roman epic (built and shot entirely in L.A. as was the custom of the times) or granting us a peek at the film reels running through the old-school Moviola operated by editor C.C. Calhoun (Frances McDormand getting in a terrific gag in a one-scene role). But the most sublime moments in ""Hail Caesar"" occur when the behind-the-scenes machinery drops away the films being produced become the film were watching and were invited to lose ourselves in a state of vintage Hollywood rapture. An early highlight finds Johanssons DeeAnna donning a shiny green mermaid tail in preparation for a stunningly choreographed synchronized-swimming routine straight out of the 1952 Esther Williams tuner ""Million Dollar Mermaid."" Even more dazzling is a musical number (""No Dames"") that pays homage to ""On the Town"" by way of ""South Pacific"" with a sailor-suited Channing Tatum tapping and shuffling about like Gene Kelly reborn all of it filmed by d.p. Roger Deakins in lengthy takes that allow us to see the dancers bodies in full view. The Coens harbor no illusions that the glossy tuners and sword-and-sandal epics of yesteryear were high art but theyve nonetheless fashioned a sophisticated yet utterly sincere tribute to what Andre Bazin called ""the genius of the system"" and it touches an almost hypnotic chord of pleasure. Next to these gemlike moments -- which the Coens judicious editors of their work as always refuse to linger on -- the poky eccentric shaggy-dog story being told here all but fades into insignificance. Compared with the numerous kidnapping plots theyve spun in the past from ""Raising Arizona"" to ""The Big Lebowski"" the mystery of Bairds disappearance is resolved with little tension or surprise; it exists as in so many of their seriocomic fables as a jumping-off point a philosophical point of entry. Brolin marching through the picture wearing a frown and a fedora becomes one of the Coens most endearing and pensive leading men -- a man searching for meaning in an industry that can supply only a reasonable facsimile of it at best. The movies other great performance comes from the 26-year-old Ehrenreich who at last fulfills the promise of his work in ""Tetro"" and the underrated ""Beautiful Creatures"" Astonishingly good at playing a bad actor he turns a hapless matinee-idol stooge into a figure of dogged dependability and surprising selflessness. Are Eddie Mannix and Hobie Doyle meant to be the faux-Hollywood version of the Father and the Son the saving graces of the industry? Only the Coens know. In one amusing early scene Eddie consults an Eastern Orthodox clergyman a Catholic priest a Protestant pastor and a Jewish rabbi to discuss the religious content of Bairds Roman epic; the ensuing discussion pokes deft fun at the petty sectarianism of organized religion and the ease with which it can be pounded and churned into big-screen kitsch. But theres no denying the power of said kitsch in the studios climactic re-creation of Calvary complete with stirring music and soaring speeches turning ""Hail Caesar"" into a rousing new testament to that old-time religion known as the movies.

Jo Long says July 14 2016 at 800 pm ""Hail Caesar"" was very very funny and beautifully done. Reply Edith I Cassie says June 10 2016 at 639 am This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time - if not for Channing Tatums song and dance number it would have been a total waste of money to pay to see it. Reply Soren McCarthy says April 11 2016 at 1145 am I loved this film. It is to Christianity what Lebowski was to Buddhism. Deceptively light and slight that you enjoy the comedy and then themes reveal themselves in sharpening relief after. Explores themes plays them out doesnt force connections doesnt hit you over the head with symbolism (it trusts you). I found it very smart and compelling. I found it ine of the least condescending films exploring theology/ideology and the people who struggle with their place in them. I have sometimes found the Coens cold and smug regarding the human condition. Absolutely not so here. They dont take the easy way (and so overdone) in portrayals of faith this time. Also this reviewer is superb. Reply Brian V Street says March 12 2016 at 526 am It didnt all sink in - maybe because I dont know Hollywood well enough - but there were lots of amusing moments and i got the overall story (I think). Reply Carl says March 11 2016 at 1014 am I had never heard of the Coen brothers before. Now I understand why Reply David says March 10 2016 at 926 am This is such an annoying film that is a hate letter to the 1950s Hollywood with some charming moments but mostly unfunny humor and offensive approach. Reply Kris says March 7 2016 at 1123 pm Im a latecomer to Justin Changs film criticism but hes quickly becoming my first reference point for new releases. Another superb piece of writing.

George Clooney ""HANG IT UP"" Reply randy says February 13 2016 at 620 pm I have seen every movie on the planet This one was so badly wriittenand acting was even worse. Miss this one Reply Pram Hauix says February 8 2016 at 109 pm Visit http//bit.ly/1SXHcgB if you want to Watch Hail Caesar Full Movie HD.. no buffer support any Subtitles Reply Chris Wight says February 7 2016 at 1126 am I saw this last night and I agree with the reviewer. It may seem like its all in-jokes but not to me - I think it was just very very meta -ie playing with just about everything that movies are plot the idea of the climactic moment the images of movies star (and movie reviewers for that matter) the subservience of writers to the stars (Channing Tatum leaping onto a submarine) the status of extras etc etc and as the reviewer says the notion of the true-believer good man Hollywood industry insider. I feel like this a strong addition to the body of work for the Coens ...and I laughed all the way through Also I dont really know enough about Hollywood itself but I strongly suspect the specific choices of actors in each of the major roles in this movie probably has some connection to their real lives and rumors/scandals/reputations etc and is yet another set of jokes I hope so. Reply Rick Cotton says February 6 2016 at 639 pm i wanted so much more. This film was so disappointing so disjointed so incoherently unfunny....and why did Scarjos parts even exist? That entire unmemorable part could easily have been deleted and all to the better. Terrible...just terrible. They could have done so much more than this lame piece of reputation-riding. Clooney was funny but couldnt save this thing. Oh well...no one bats a thousand. Reply dsherm says February 6 2016 at 136 pm I saw this movie last night and was extremely disappointed in the lack of plot the lack of character development and the inside jokes that only film students would understand and appreciate. The truth is they blew it. The movie might as well have been a Capitol Films movie... Reply Jecht says February 6 2016 at 938 am Movie had no climax. So many story lines and no ending in site. For a ""comedy"" I failed to resonate a single chuckle. Came into this movie with a ton of energy left feeling like a deflated baloon. 1.5 stars. To much sizzle (stars) no steak (content). Pass on this one. Reply Tres says February 5 2016 at 1025 pm I saw the film tonight; loved it. Reply bwoolley says February 4 2016 at 351 am Never mind the movie what a sublime piece of film criticism. Beautifully written a joy to read. Reply Rosie says February 3 2016 at 217 pm Sounds great Im just confused as to why its being released in Feb. if its so good. They usually release the flops in Feb. Whats up with this? It sounds more like it would do well in late spring or summer. Why release it now? Reply cadavra says February 3 2016 at 312 pm The studios are finally realizing that releasing movies for grown-ups year-round is smart business. The enormous pile-up of Oscar contenders this past fall kept a lot of worthy films (including TRUMBO) from reaching their full potential. Reply Bobby Galinsky says February 3 2016 at 214 pm Cant wait and most importantly glad the Coen Brothers are still brothers. Hope Ethan doesnt become Ethel and the Coens go the way of the Wachowskis..... Reply Julie says February 5 2016 at 1111 pm How is this relevant or necessary... Reply 85wzen says February 3 2016 at 153 pm Wow glad to hear that the Coen Brothers are still putting it together... very rare in this town to keep that excellence Reply GKN says February 3 2016 at 909 am Cant wait to see this Reply Bill B. says February 3 2016 at 1118 am Me too Reply http//beutiful-house1.com/---/ says February 3 2016 at 836 am Actually the problems that can be caused by traditional chemical products can be enormous. Finally I think parents and grandparents need to make it clear to students that keeping the apartment clean is a personal health issue. Is there anything special that the cleaning service needs to know about. Reply gashrink says February 3 2016 at 1159 am WTF does this have to do with this movie review? Reply Marie says February 3 2016 at 1256 pm Nothing. Mark says February 3 2016 at 706 am Cant wait counting the days. Reply kenfurman46 says February 3 2016 at 701 am Sounds like a critical fave but audience bomb just like the Coens over-rated and venal ode to folk music that died a well deserved miserable death. See it for free on HBO next year so you can go to the kitchen for snacks when it gets just too arch. Reply god says February 3 2016 at 808 am Translation ""I hate the Coens O Brother Where Art Thou? and was waiting for this review to be bad so I could say This should come as no surprise to anyone thats seen their over-rated and venal ode etc. But since it turned out to be a rave review I had to revise my post in order get my points in anyway. Whatever.... at least I was able to post my opinion of Oh Brother on a Hail Ceasar review and I hope what I wrote was very provocative. It was worth waiting all morning for the review to post my message."" Reply Jabari says February 6 2016 at 1249 pm I personally liked O Brother Where Art Thou which was both entertaining and had some point. This movie was/had neither. I wish the Coens would be consistent so I dont waste my time and money seeing whatever this was supposed to be. This solidly falls into line with Burn after reading or as I like to call it ""Burn before watching"" Shawna waldron says February 3 2016 at 700 am I think the writer is sleeping with the Coens.......

It couldnt have been easy for the Coens to just be silly again especially after such recent soulful triumphs like Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and A Serious Man (2009). God love em for insisting on it Hail Caesar weds the backstage Hollywood shenanigans of their 1991 gem Barton Fink to a more manic pace. It doesnt seem new for them yet as super polished mannered slightly surreal comedies go the movie feels as rare as a unicorn. As ever with these siblings the details win us over. Hail Caesar is set within the unusually rich seam of transitional early-50s showbiz a moment when swimming sirens (Scarlett Johansson) and singing cowboys (Alden Ehrenreich deceptively sharp under his 10-gallon hat) rubbed elbows with finicky European directors (Ralph Fiennes extending his sublime comic run from The Grand Budapest Hotel) and secret Communist ""study groups."" At the top of the food chain is Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) a Kirk Douglas-like A-lister whos been drugged and smuggled off the lot of his epic Roman picture. Enter Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) the studios fixer worried about the fallout. The plot never runs out of steam but youll soon see it as an excuse for dazzling bits of business a spaghetti strand turned into a lasso an excruciatingly funny piece of on-set dialogue direction (some cowpokes will never become urbane smoothies) and Channing Tatum in a screwy-sailor dance number that plays like a reason to make the film. Purring over it all is that great wizard Michael Gambon whose stuffy orotund narration supplies a self-mockery thats our cue not to take any of this seriously. Is Mannix occasionally seen in a church confession box actually in pursuit of something higher? Dont be fooled by the backdrop.

It may be second-tier Coen Bros--a little too precious at times no real laugh-out-loud moments and just a touch slow--but thats nothing to scoff out. Wonderful performances signature quirks (the dual Tilda Swinton reporters) and Channing Tatums dance number are all pretty delightful. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 11 2016lily rtastemakerFeaturedI have to say off the bat I am not a huge Cohen brothers fan. The very gimmicky over the top comedy is not really my cop of tea and this film completely follows suit. The film is beautifully shot I will say that. From the costumes to the cinematography landscapes and bright colors it is a dazzling spectacle for the eye. My biggest grappling with this film is that the plot was just not captivating. Nothing really happens. Not a big fan of this one. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 10 2016Nick OFeaturedDespite receiving some criticism for having excessive movie fodder Hail Caesar most definitely still delivers a book on the shelf of Coen brother classics. I read on Vulture the idea of Brolin and Clooney switching roles which I agree would have made the movie a lot better. Clooney playing the self-serving idiot is a somewhat tired theme- see O Brother Where Art Thou Burn After Reading Intolerable Cruelty...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/hail-caesar,200,hailcaesar47,hailcaesar,timeout

(Photo Credit Universal Pictures) Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday February 3 2016 400 AM Title Hail Caesar Film Info A studio problem-solver juggles studio dilemmas in 1950s Hollywood. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. With George Clooney Scarlett Johansson Channing Tatum. Rating PG-13 (140). Area theaters. Genre jumpers Joel and Ethan Coen return to comedy in ""Hail Caesar"" a love letter to the movies and its colorful denizens that couldve been called ""Hail Cinema"" Star-studded and stylish this addition to the brothers acclaimed canon is a looker with laughs and alas dull stretches. Its fun and entertaining -- no more no less no exclamation point. Josh Brolin carries the heavy lifting as Eddie Mannix a 1950s studio fixer with burdens on every set including one where ""Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ"" is underway. The epic is a potential hot potato thanks to the sensitive subject -- so the studio assembles a group of religious leaders to make sure its not offensive. Theyre useless because what the priests rabbis and others want to do is direct. Things get worse when Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the handsome lunkhead star of the movie is kidnapped by a group called ""The Future"" an idea that ends up half as provocative as it wants to be. On a neighboring lot supposedly demure DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is another headache. Shes filming yet another lavishly choreographed aquatic epic but the unplanned bun in DeeAnnas oven sends Eddie into damage-control mode. Josh Brolin (left with Scarlett Johansson) stars as Eddie Mannix a movie studio fixer who has to figure out what happened to his kidnapped star. (Photo Credit Alison Rosa) Meanwhile Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) a singing cowboy is roped into a sophisticated drama. Fussy filmmaker Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) tries to mold this adorable but dopey lump of clay to no avail. And dont forget about dreamy song-and-dance man Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) whos so light on his feet he actually floats. Still theres something shifty about him. All of the Coen Brothers nods to icons like Esther Williams Gene Kelly and Hedda Hopper are amusing but the movie meanders from one thread to another before eventually weaving together. At times you want to hustle it along. Still there are marvelous moments -- like when Hobie uses spaghetti like a lariat or the brothers pay homage to Busby Berkeley-esque water ballets. Scenes of Eddie in a Chinese restaurant are mouthwateringly beautiful. As always theres a hail of a cast. Clooney aces the role of dim puffed-up star and Johansson nails DeeAnnas sweet and bawdy sides. Tatum shows off twinkle-toes unlike anything in ""Magic Mike"" while Frances McDormand makes the most of a cameo as a film editor whose fashion muse is unwisely Isadora Duncan. Tilda Swinton shoots dagger eyes as twin gossip columnists. For all the high-wattage star power its Ehrenreich who shines brightest and lassos our heart. Hes a major charmer in what amounts to a minor Coen Brothers work.

Hollywood Farce Hail Caesar Flames Out Wednesday February 3 2016 at 940 a.m. By Melissa Anderson EXPAND We dont come to praise or bury it really. Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A kick for those whove distractedly thumbed through Hollywood Babylon Joel and Ethan Coens bustling comedy Hail Caesar looks back to the waning days of moviedoms golden age specifically to 1951 when big-studio fixers were still tidying up the messes left by the talent (scrubbing now done by publicists and lawyers). As wed expect the Coens remembrance of this bygone era is mordant though not as enjoyably salacious as Kenneth Angers legendary collection of Tinseltown scandal. But the brothers latest also has a certain buoyancy -- a quality rarely associated with their films especially the bleak Barton Fink (1991) their first treatment of studio-system Hollywood and its pathologies. The fizziness though proves fleeting and Hail Caesar too often goes flat.The central character Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is named after the outsize real-life MGM executive who was tasked with keeping the stars of that blue-chip studio out of the gossip magazines. (He remained employed there until his death in 1963.) The Coens Mannix has the official title ""Head of Physical Production"" at the fictional Capitol Pictures -- the same outfit that employs the blocked writer in Barton Fink. But he shares the actual ones religious faith The frequency of Mannixs visits to the confessional becomes one of the films running jokes. The sins he admits to -- sneaking a couple of cigarettes striking a movie star in anger -- suggest just how far removed from the historical record Brolins character actually is. The real Mannix was suspected of among other grave charges plotting to murder actor George Reeves a sordid tale recounted in 2006s dimwitted Hollywoodland featuring Bob Hoskins as the storied cleanup man.Film Details Hail Caesar RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time106 min. More Info Trailer In Hail Caesar Mannix emerges from church hours before sunrise cleansing his soul before his first workday appointment a 5 a.m. visit to the bungalow of a rising starlet posing for a sweaty photographer; he arrives just minutes before the cops do called out to investigate a ""possible French-postcard situation."" Its a great line one that shows off the filmmakers ear for era- and milieu-specific language -- a consistent pleasure in their movies even for a Coen agnostic like me. (Precision also marks the work of two regular Coen collaborators here cinematographer Roger Deakins and costume designer Mary Zophres.)On the Capitol lot Mannix watches rushes of Hail Caesar A Tale of the Christ a bloated biblical epic starring the studios top box office draw Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) a nitwit who is roofied on set by a pair of toga-clad extras working on behalf of a Communist cell. The movie idol is held for ransom at a Malibu lair where a cabal of tweedy overweening Red screenwriters offer him finger sandwiches and quickly convince him of the nobility of their cause (""Of course Im for the little guy"").Johansson delivers her lines with impeccable Kings County-transplant hauteur.Bairds easy indoctrination at this lavish oceanside redoubt -- and Mannixs efforts to secure the 100000 for the actors release -- provides the main storyline into which the Coens braid multiple subplots some more successful than others. These ancillary scenarios revolve around other Capitol titles in production many rapidly heading toward disaster. Knocked up and unwed aqua-musical star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is having trouble fitting into her mermaid costume her predicament made funnier by Johanssons sharp tough-broad interpretation. ""Pretty boys -- saps and swishes"" DeeAnna snaps at Mannix dismissing the previous suitors and husbands hes quickly had to find for her; Johansson delivers her lines with impeccable Kings County-transplant hauteur.That verve is missing in too many other scenes namely one that features oater leading man/singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) massacring his opening line in a drawing-room comedy helmed by the effete Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Repeated three times too many the wan gag also highlights a rare instance of the otherwise period-detail-obsessive directors being sloppy with their time frame The film that Laurentz is directing Merrily We Dance is emblematic of a genre that enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1930s not the early 50s. Just as tiresome is Mannixs meeting with a quartet of religious leaders who have been asked to endorse Hail Caesar and thus guarantee its triumph at the box office; the setup ensures the inevitable appearance of the filmmakers favorite cliche the tetchy Jew.But something Id never expected to see in a Coen brothers movie -- a song-and-dance number -- is here staged with tremendous brio and cheeky wit. In a clear reference to On the Town MGMs soaring 1949 musical a group of tap-dancing seamen in snug-fitting Navy whites start to croon ""No Dames"" led by Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum perfectly cast) Capitols most athletic hoofer. The tune which starts out as a paean to the opposite sex ends up with the dancers in the kinds of positions that Tom of Finland would immortalize about a decade later. This affectionate sendup is one of a few instances when the Coens film foregrounds Hollywoods lavender shadow history also evinced as Baird regales one of his Marx-reading pipe-smoking captors with a shaggy-dog story about shaving Danny Kayes back. Like the best moments of Hail Caesar these scenes nimbly expose the dream machines hypocrisies while the worst rely on humor already stale by the time of the first HUAC hearing.Hail Caesar Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen Universal Pictures Opens February 5 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Melissa Anderson Follow MelissEAnderson Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
