Comments A Man Apart Vin Diesel stars as a DEA agent trying to track down the drug lord who murdered his wife. The script for this action vehicle is like something youd find under the cushions of Steven Seagals couch but Diesel to his credit digs into his role as if it were Hamlet. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger he projects a funny macho charm a quality that carries him through any number of hackneyed set pieces confronting a crime kingpin in his prison cell extracting a confession from a bad guy with a one-sided game of Russian roulette etc. Larenz Tate is equally game playing Diesels loyal partner; F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator) directed. 109 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for A Man Apart Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

Diesel makes a bid to align himself with the Clint Eastwood-Charles Bronson-Steve McQueen tradition but doesnt measure up to those icons. The grimmer side of Vin Diesel is shown in ""A Man Apart"" a drug crime drama that makes you think its going to go into social and psychological issues typical of the genre but winds up skirting them. As an undercover cop bent on revenge who breaks all the rules Diesel makes a violent bid to align himself with the Clint Eastwood-Charles Bronson-Steve McQueen tradition but his perf here doesnt measure up to those icons. This underserving of the stuff that has made Diesel one of Hollywoods major rising stars will cut into domestic B.O. take but New Line will likely make up for it with rich overseas and ancillary returns. Hints of a troubled pic underlined by several release postponements and fiddlings with the ending (which still doesnt work) prove a bit overstated since helmer F. Gary Grays actioner is extremely good-looking and generally efficient. The cool surfaces and suggestive psychological undercurrents of Michael Manns best crime drama for the screen are plentifully in evidence from periodic contemplative breaks from the action and glimpses of cops private lives to the crystalline widescreen lensing by Eastwoods vet d.p. Jack N. Green. All of the building blocks for an unusually strong look at the drug war appear to be in place and the press kits observation that writers Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring researched the subject for four years appears to be more than hype. But once thoughts of revenge fill the head of Diesels Sean Vetter the direction of the story unfortunately goes south. Seans intro voiceover about how the Mexican cartels ""flood our streets"" with cocaine isnt nearly as interesting as the colorful manner in which he single-handedly arrests cartel lord Memo Lucero (the elegantly gray-bearded Geno Silva looking as dapper as Fernando Rey) after a major bust of his Tijuana nightclub. Hip cop lives happily with wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) at what looks like a SoCal beach house that no cop could afford. He and his friend Demetrius Hicks (Larenz Tate) both switched careers from gangbanging to cartel banging. South of the border Luceros operation -- thought by DEA officials to be dead and buried -- has apparently been revived and is being controlled by a shadowy figure known portentously as El Diablo. The new kingpin delivers a message to Sean by sending henchmen to his beach pad where they kill Stacy and wound Sean. When Demetrius comforts an almost uncontrollably grieving Sean in his hospital bed the emotions are raw but brief as the movie then shifts gears into pure revenge mode. The sniffing down the trail toward El Diablo -- whose actual identity turns out not to be nearly as shocking as the filmmakers suppose -- has its interest and the trail includes a physically impressive very Mann-influenced shootout. But pic fails to explore or justify Seans unprofessional and vicious behavior. This is the ""Dirty Harry"" problem redux and pics refusal to ponder what it is suggesting -- that for cops to win in the drug war they must act like the criminals -- is perhaps a bigger problem politically than it is dramatically. Diesel slips from normalcy into bloody-mindedness without investing Sean with any more than the slightest touches of an interesting flawed and human cop. Since Seans marriage comes across as superficially pleasant as the great ocean view the motivating action plays equally on the surface. While Eastwood finessed this same dilemma with his star power Diesel seems not to have the touch for a similar kind of massaging. Tate leads the supporting cast as the voice of reason but cant make Demetrius eventual extralegal actions convincing. The bad guys range from Silvas completely commanding presence to Timothy Olyphants cartoonish drug supplier Hollywood Jack who seems to be a refugee from the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise. Production package is extremely sleek and ultrapro starting with Greens fine way with light and including productions capacity to re-create several North American settings in the L.A. area and composer Anne Dudleys expansive electronic score -- itself another Mann echo.

Eddie Griffin star of Dysfunktional Family is clearly following in the footsteps of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. Though the 34-year-old star of Undercover Brother is not yet at the peak of his career he is clearly following in the inspired footsteps of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. This film highlights some of the best and raunchiest of his humor. Performing in his hometown of Kansas City he runs through topics including his porn-loving uncle black vs. white church services and Osama bin Laden. (The way to find bin Laden ""Look for the cave with the satellite hookup."") A few riffs are more painful than comic such as the bit about first meeting his father when Griffin was 16. Hes also a little xenophobic and sexist but hes an equal-opportunity offender. He clearly adores his mother a good sport who laughs at most of his jokes except the sexually explicit material. ""She whupped me out of the penitentiary"" Griffin says. Her disciplinary methods seem to have paid off Not only did he escape the fate of his pimp/thief/junkie uncle but her tactics provided a wealth of material. (R strong sexual content language and drug-related humor). -- Claudia Puig A Man Apart DEA agent Vin Diesels idea of ""Miranda"" in A Man Apart must be Carmen and her headgear bananas strawberries and maybe a few camouflaged munitions. Movie reviews Dysfunktional Family (out of four) A Man Apart ( out of four) The Guys ( out of four) Levity ( out of four) In this sometimes speedy crock he demonstrates his respect for suspects rights when he pulls a hairdresser/drug-dealer named Hollywood Jack (Timothy Olyphant) out of a Porsche by the hair. But then Diesel can hardly have any use for hairdressers when blood splatters so frequently on his own mostly follicle-free dome. The lawman he plays has less use for drug dealers than his job mandates. One of their ilk has gunned down his wife in their California beach house digs that would seem to be affordable only if he were taking drug money. Aided by his less volatile partner-pal (Larenz Tate) our enraged vigilante works his way up the dealer food chain from the bottom after they discover a rotting corpse with the name ""Diablo"" carved into it. Guys named Diablo are usually not pillars of society but who is this mysterioso really? Its all fast and furious up to its draggy finale and yes it could spark a sequel. Prepare yourself for coming dread in 18 months A Man Together. (R strong graphic violence language drug content sexuality) -- Mike Clark The Guys Though an interesting two-person drama The Guys is a victim of poor timing. Its about Sept. 11 and as a play just after the terrorist attacks it must have been powerful. Jim Simpson (Sigourney Weavers husband) directed the play and this film. One cant help but wonder why its being released now. That question aside Weaver is captivating and convincing as Joan a reporter helping a fire captain write eulogies for his fallen comrades. Anthony LaPaglias portrayal of taciturn fire captain Nick is moving. When the grief-stricken Nick gradually opens up about his men his gruff descriptions are among the movies best moments. The powerful two-person drama gets watered down by documentary-style footage and voice-overs. But its worth seeing just for Weaver and LaPaglia. (PG thematic elements language.) -- C.P. Levity Here we have one of the more ironic film titles in recent memory. Everything about Levity is heavy and grave. Manuel (Billy Bob Thornton) has been paroled after serving 23 years for murdering a store clerk. Hes so weighed down by guilt that he nearly argues against his own parole. Yet once out he cant help but seek forgiveness from Adele (Holly Hunter) the sister of the boy he killed. He seems on the path to redemption when he falls into a job at an inner-city community house run by an enigmatic preacher (Morgan Freeman) helps a drugged-out rich girl (Kirsten Dunst) and saves Adeles son (Luke Robertson ) from committing a vengeful crime. Its an intriguing movie and Thorntons performance is both fascinating and maddening. With flowing gray hair and formal speech he appears otherworldly even messianic. Hunter is effective as the heartbroken sister. But Robertson seems as if he belongs in the burbs with his surf buddies not in the hood. Levity raises a provocative question Can several good deeds make up for one very bad one? (New York and L.A.; R language) -- C.P.

Directed by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay by Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring. 114 minutes. Rated R for strong graphic violence language drug content and sexuality. Several theaters. Its impossible to watch the hulking heartthrob Vin Diesel on screen without being distracted by his biceps -- first because they seem to be bigger than his head (which isnt tiny either) and second because they are often more expressive than his face. In ""A Man Apart"" a movie that requires Diesel to express some emotion now and then the actor gives his not-inconsiderable all with mixed results. Diesel plays Sean Vetter a drug cop working near the Mexican border on the trail of a major drug lord known as Diablo. Vetter and his pretty wife (Jacqueline Obradors) live in a charming cottage on the beach where she makes candles and they dance together on the shore and kiss as the sun sets behind them and gulls fly across the horizon. In other words since this is a thriller you know theyre doomed. So bad stuff happens causing Vetter to get mildly agitated and to speak a little faster (normally he sounds slow mellow and deep like hes being played on the wrong speed). With partner Demetrius (Larenz Tate) and an associate incongruously known as Big Sexy (George Sharperson) he becomes obsessed with taking down Diablo and the latter half of the movie is a confusing parade of guns bodies and manly posturing. This movie is so testosterone-laden (as Diesels movies inevitably are -- no wimpy romantic comedies for this guy) that one character is seen carrying a gun and a beer in the same hand. The macho atmosphere was enlivened at the preview screening by audible belching from the audience. Director F. Gary Gray who showed that he knows how to make a routine crime thriller sing in 1998s ""The Negotiator"" does what he can to move things along. As with Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey in that movie hes good at establishing connections between men and Diesel and Tate in ""A Man Apart"" have a genuine chemistry and concern for each other as longtime police partners would believably have. And for all the silly larger-than-lifeness of Diesels character Gray lets us get caught up in the story in spite of ourselves; he creates a tension and momentum and even finds a few moments of real humor. But ultimately ""A Man Apart"" is Diesels movie Hes now a full-fledged A-list star pulling in 20 million per movie. Hes certainly convincing as he bashes somebodys head in with his enormous hands or grabs the hair of some bozo who talks back to him. As for acting well there are some things money cant buy. But at 10 million per bicep he may be a relative bargain.

Starring Vin Diesel and Larenz Tate. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The honeymoon stage of Vin Diesels stardom is over. Now were into the early marriage stage where we find out whether he leaves hairs in the sink. Specifically were finding out what we like about him what he can do what he cant what he shouldnt bother trying. File ""A Man Apart"" in which he plays a sensitive Drug Enforcement Administration agent under the category of ""shouldnt bother trying."" Its a film about Central American drug cartels and the dedicated narcotics agents who go up against them. Based on experience its hard to approach a movie like this expecting ""Citizen Kane"" -- odds are its going to be just another bloody cop thriller which it is. But I did expect a good Vin Diesel movie a showcase for this magnetic actors personality. Thats where ""A Man Apart"" falls short. It says something about the impression Diesel has made in just a handful of films that there could already be such a concept as ""a Vin Diesel movie."" In ""XXX"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"" especially Diesel embodied a mix of cynical heroism and counterculture reasonableness and on-the-edge wildness. It seemed to presage something exciting. Put him in the most extreme of situations and hed make sense. Now comes ""A Man Apart"" to show that Diesel can also make sense as a normal guy with a wife and a job which is nice but a letdown. If Diesel is only as cool as we are whats the point of watching him? He plays Vetter an undercover agent who helps bring down a Mexican drug lord (Geno Silva) in the first scene. Then he returns to his loving wife (Jacqueline Obradors) in Southern California where the two get along so well so beautifully with such lovely hopes for the future that theres no doubting it -- shes dead. What is it about the way actors play doomed characters? They have a way of smiling thats not the way people really smile (smirky wise mischievous) but the way people smile only in memory (open unknowing saintly). Just in case we have any doubt that gunmen are about to show up director F. Gary Gray gives us a beautiful shot of the loving couple dancing on the beach two silhouettes against the sunset with birds flying around them. The death of the wife which comes very early is the huge event that propels the action so its a little surprising that Diesel should play the scene so blankly. This is a man whose world has just been destroyed and yet Diesel is so impassive he makes Bruce Willis look like a song-and-dance man. So now we know Big emotions arent Diesels strong suit. Fine. Look at Clint Eastwood who has never expressed an onscreen anguish that didnt look like vague indigestion. Not everyone can do everything. The rest of the movie involves our hero trying to find out who ordered the hit and taking revenge. Unfortunately as is usually the case in action movies revenge proves to be a surprisingly dull motivator. The this-time-its- personal angle tanks more movies than it helps as rage is both unappealing to watch and hard to sustain and grief is just depressing. And so the most lively character in ""A Man Apart"" turns out not to be Vetter but an effete hairdresser a middling drug dealer played to the hilt by Timothy Olyphant in spiked hair and turquoise spandex pants. Vetter and his partner (Larenz Tate) were told are from the mean streets and so theyre ideal undercover men. They dont look like cops. This is smart casting for Diesel whose appearance doesnt automatically connote law enforcement but too little of the movie actually shows him working his trade. When it does and we see Diesel pretending to be a drug dealer (talking the lingo acting touchy ready to fight anybody over anything) ""A Man Apart"" comes alive. But its not alive often enough and most of the movie is in the usual pattern. The evocative title sounds like something out of either Graham Greene or a paper on dismemberment but it doesnt have much to do with the movie. Maybe the idea is that Diesel is unique. He is but not here. Or maybe it refers to the fact that Diesel goes through the movie grieving torn apart. True though lets hope hes in a more buoyant state next time. . This film contains violence and strong language.

"A Man Apart Doesnt Stand Out From the Crowd washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids A Man Apart Doesnt Stand Out From the Crowd Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 4 2003 IT PROBABLY wont shock the western world to learn the latest Vin Diesel action picture is junk. Of course it is. Picture this guy performing in anything that doesnt involve him displaying his biceps high-fiving other bulky guys and casually accepting the inexplicable devotion of nubile women. But for the guys and gals who accept Vin as their personal savior I will say this ""A Man Apart"" has its moments -- funny moments. Someone smart -- probably an uncredited badly paid scriptwriter -- realized that theres nothing to slake an insufferable action stars narcissism like humor. So while youre enduring the usual formulaic yada yada -- from the usual slain wife to the drug cartel lords -- at least there are yuks to enjoy. But first lets cruise through the dreary 411. Diesel plays Sean Vetter a DEA agent who has been tracking drug lord Meno Lucero (Geno Silva). He puts Meno in jail but the drug problem doesnt go away. A new name is circulating among the dealers suppliers and other tattooed movie extras of the Mexico/California continuum Diablo. If youre reading this in a public place suddenly stand up and say in a raspy whisper Diablo. Itll give you street cred. It seems this Diablo wants to take over Menos territory swift and hard. One of the first moves blowing away Seans wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) ""Godfather II"" style (a late-night rat-a-tat-tat bedroom ambush). If youve watched more than one action flick in your life you know Stacy is marital dead meat from the get-go. Why else would we have to endure slow-motion silhouette shots of His Bulkiness cavorting with Stacy on a Malibu beach while seagulls (also silhouetted) screech and flap against the sky. How a DEA agent can afford that beach house without doing a little dealing himself is the movies biggest mystery. The rest is action-movie revenge. Sean is so angry and upset he starts smoking. (This is what passes for character arc in these movies.) He gets reckless too. Beats people bloody and senseless. Of course he gets called off the beat because you know this thing is getting too personal. So he goes outside the law with his DEA buddy Demetrius (Larenz Tate) and a hip-hop buddy named Big Sexy (George Sharperson). Demetrius is a welcome addition because at least hes funny as he reacts to his friends over-the-top intensity. Other amusing stuff includes Big Sexys skinny drug-sniffing chihuahua (I think thats what it is some sort of nasty dog-rat) who can sniff the marijuana roach out of a distant ashtray and scurries around the neighborhood like a cartoon dog. Also comical is a very disconsolate bro from the hood who explains how he escaped Diablos gunmen who attacked his house ""I was hiding in the attic"" And Timothy Olyphant gets a kudo or two for being a completely nutso designer drug dealer who has the good sense to realize hes playing one of the movies many one-dimensional characters so he might as well have insane fun.

Gary Gray; Author Christian Gudegast Paul Scheuring; Release Date Wide 04/04/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted April 2 2003 -- 1200 AM EST A man celebrity bullet-head Vin Diesel. A part DEA special-ops bullet-head Sean Vetter. A plot After Vetter nabs a major kingpin a mysterious new underworld force murders his wife. A movie sour sadistic and stale from sitting on the shelf since the pre-""XXX"" era - an era Im starting to miss. Diesel is one of those less-than-meets-the-eye actors who goes increasingly out of focus the more the camera fixates on him. Armed with muddy enunciation and a dull glare that bespeaks badass catalepsy he doesnt seem capable of more than two levels sulk and smash. Hes supposed to come off as the Fred Flintstone of the narcotics interdiction biz an average Joe Widower whose undercover work seemingly necessitates close proximity to strippers (all lovingly photographed) - but who bristles when a girl offers him a lap dance. (""You should have more respect for yourself"" he growls as Hollywood hypocrisy touches bottom.) Shorn of his Wilma has Vetter gone off the deep end? Is he a good cop? A bad cop? Or just bad at being a cop? (Dispiritingly its the latter His vengeful thug tactics cost a lot of lives and for no apparent gain.) In the end its not important. ""Man"" is a threadbare hand-me-down of an action thriller - even its obligatory twists feel preworn. You wont know who to trust. And you wont care.
