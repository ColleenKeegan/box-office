Certainly its two male protagonists Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) two free-and-easy 19-year-olds tend sheep together in rural Wyoming. They favour denim live close to the land and enjoy - briefly - a loving sexual relationship. But theres little in this film to excite either John Wayne fans or devotees of Warhols Lonesome Cowboys. Instead the films themes of forbidden love lost opportunity marital deception and romantic honesty are quite accessible mainstream even. The revolution is all off-screen what ultimately makes Brokeback Mountain a radical project is that its set to become the first bona fide well-made and commercially successful gay weepie to emerge from Hollywood. Jack and Ennis meet on a Wyoming mountainside one summer when both are employed to watch over the flock of a local farm baron (Randy Quaid). Lee indulges wide shots of flowing rivers travelling sheep wispy clouds and mountain vistas to canonise the pairs experience on Brokeback Mountain. He threatens to over-sweeten us with the shallow beauty of a Marlboro commercial or Wrangler advert until one night on the mountain a drunken Ennis spits on his hand turns Jack over and lights the fuse on an on-off love affair that will stretch painfully over two decades but never escape the macho strictures of the rural worlds to which they belong. Both marry; both have kids; both meet occasionally over 20 years for the odd tryst disguised as a fishing trip. For Jack and Ennis Brokeback Mountain is more than a place; its a symbol of what could have been a state of mind an unattainable nirvana. Brokeback got us good sighs Jack to Ennis as their strained friendship floats through the years forever secret barely defined hardly spoken. Always taking his cue from Proulxs original story (a marvel of epic economy) Lee and his screenwriters Larry McMurty (The Last Picture Show) and Diana Ossana present just enough of the pairs married post-Brokeback lives to remind us of the conservative and traditional nature of their domestic lives. But what makes Brokeback Mountain more interesting than a well-meaning time capsule of period values are the subtle differences in character that Lee carves between Jack and Ennis. Jack is more exuberant more romantic a dreamer who rides the rodeo and hatches impossible plans for him and Ennis to live together. Ennis is a puritan unadventurous and afraid of himself; he takes solace in violence holds back emotionally and creates excuses for the stagnation that defines his life. The film is Enniss tragedy; it becomes painfully obvious that he left his soul on Brokeback Mountain. Its a tough act to witness and one that Heath Ledger handles superbly delivering an increasingly sad mumbling and desperate performance that smacks of loneliness and alienation. And all because the boy loves the boy but barely knows what such love means let alone possesses the tools with which to act on it.What we have here is acutely calibrated storytelling. Nothing is wasted. The pacing is calm the mood sombre and the adaptation is both respectful and imaginative. Lee retains the taut ease of Proulxs prose allowing him to cover a long period of time (about 20 years) without lessening the tragedy at the heart of the tale or offering episodic biographies. Very little is added to Proulxs story; the films screenwriters take smart inspiration from a line here or a comment there spinning them into well-placed new scenes. Brokeback Mountain deserves all the awards and acclaim that its bound to gather in the next couple of months. Its painful stuff moving and intelligent. Lee has taken a story of gay love and placed it where it should be - in the mainstream. Hes delivered a beautifully crafted film to boot.

However... I would like to add a discordant voice here and point out something (at least it seems to me) few people paid attention to I am convinced after having thought about it a long time that its great success and high rating is due to its tragic ending an ending that adds a virtuous note to the film. The question is if Ang Lee had slightly deviated from Anne Proulxs short story and put a less tragic ending would the film have been so highly praised? The answer is I am sure NO because the sacrifice of one of the gay characters is what a great part of the audience unconsciously demanded in order to make the subject matter more acceptable.And this is what fills me with some kind of nausea and makes me think that this film is not as gay-friendly as it seems. Moreover if we compare Brokeback Mountain to the (in my opinion) far superior Mysterious Skin (whose director was  by the way nominated for best director alongside Ang Lee at the Independent Spirit Awards) things become very clear despite its much harder subject the latter does NOT end tragically which would be considered a major sin by many viewers and this is why some courageous films do not stand a single chance against the disguised homophobic weepie I just reviewed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2007Sarah JaneFeaturedOMG this movie is brilliant Even my mother said so and she can be VERY critical when it comes to movies.

"Lost in Loves Rocky Terrain washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Lost in Loves Rocky Terrain Jake Gyllenhaal left and Heath Ledger as lovers in ""Brokeback Mountain."" (By Kimberly French -- Focus Features Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 16 2005 Its hard to know what to make of ""Brokeback Mountain"" one of this seasons most buzzed-about -- and this week at least award-nominated -- movies. On the one hand its high-toned and refined an impeccably pedigreed literary adaptation of a short story by Annie Proulx that was first published in the New Yorker. On the other hand its a potential camp classic larded with unintended humor and ""Saturday Night Live""-ready fodder for instant pop culture parody. The story of two cowboys who fall in love in the 1960s its a genre-subverting exercise similar to Todd Hayness 2002 ""Far From Heaven"" although some theorists might argue that its redundant the idea being that all Westerns have a whiff of lavender about them at least subliminally. A sweeping solemn self-serious chronicle of the mens relationship over several decades ""Brokeback Mountain"" possesses handsome and sympathetic lead players magnificent scenery heartbreaking melodrama righteousness and cultural import. But as a testament to the importance of following ones passion its devoid of one crucial thing passion. This isnt to say that things dont get physical. Because ""Brokeback Mountain"" has been marketed as a breakthrough movie in its portrayal of homosexual relationships from the moment Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) first meet while applying for jobs herding sheep in Wyoming its just a matter of when not if. The consummation of their relationship is a brief violent loveless episode that over their first summer together becomes an idyll of half-naked wrestling nuzzling by the campfire and fistfights that inevitably end in an embrace. They wont meet again until four years later -- by which time Ennis has married Alma (Michelle Williams) and had two daughters. But when Jack shows up on his doorstep the attraction clearly hasnt waned. Jack and Enniss highly charged reunion inspires Jack to suggest that the two run away and start a ranching operation together a suggestion Ennis dismisses out of hand. Over the next several years the two men will have to be satisfied with fishing trips on Brokeback Mountain during which no fish will be caught. (Their subterfuge is often what sparks ""Brokeback Mountains"" unintentional humor such as when Alma finally confronts Ennis by pointedly asking him why he never brought home any trout.) Meanwhile Jack gets married to a rodeo queen (Anne Hathaway) down in Texas sublimating his desire for Ennis in furtive dangerous assignations across the Mexico border. As a tragic evocation of the costs of homophobia -- not just to closeted gay people but also to their families and loved ones -- ""Brokeback Mountain"" is indeed a watershed movie an airing of taboos and secrets that can only be seen as welcome and deeply humanist. (And in its depiction of the violence that threatens Jack and Ennis should their relationship come to light its a sensitive empathic homage to those who have died of hatred including Matthew Shepard who seems to haunt the production from his Wyoming grave.) But director Ang Lee -- who knows his way around gay love (""The Wedding Banquet"") confining social strictures and rituals (""Eat Drink Man Woman"" ""Sense and Sensibility"") and the wages of repression (""The Hulk"") -- treats the source material with such deference that its as if the entire movie were made in New Yorker typescript. Lee and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto frame and shoot everything for maximum grandeur The Wyoming vistas are flawlessly manicured Ledger and Gyllenhaal perfectly costumed and coiffed; even Ennis and Almas sad little apartment over a laundromat seems to have been designed to death. Even more oddly the two men are never portrayed within the welter of a larger life whether its Enniss Wyoming town or an America undergoing seismic social and political changes. Instead Jack and Ennis remain hermetic chiseled paragons atop their Bighorn Olympus. Given such a limited range to play in both Gyllenhaal and Ledger deliver fine performances and they make ""Brokeback Mountain"" memorable not as a stunt or political touchstone but as a good old-fashioned love story. Both are more complicated men than their terse personas would first lead you to believe; indeed its never clear just how surprised either man is by that first encounter in the tent. Ledger is especially impressive as the withdrawn emotionally stunted Ennis who if homosexuality is the love that cannot speak its name cannot speak at all. (Ledger seems to have looked to Billy Bob Thorntons dialect in ""Sling Blade"" as inspiration for Enniss rock-jawed diffidence and he pulls it off with impressive authenticity.) Its Ledgers Ennis who ultimately overcomes the pall of self-importance and sanctimony that hangs over so much of ""Brokeback Mountain."" In the films wrenching final scenes he provides what has been needed all along an immediate shattering sense of sadness and longing and loss. Its as if the movie has finally shifted its focus from the mountain to the man. Brokeback Mountain (134 minutes at Loews Dupont Circle and Landmarks Bethesda Row) is rated R for sex scenes nudity profanity and some violence.

Related Gay cowboys Will audiences accept this Wyoming love story? Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Brokeback Mountain"" with Heath Ledger Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Williams Anne Hathaway Linda Cardellini Anna Faris Randy Quaid. Directed by Ang Lee from a screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based on the short story by Annie Proulx. 134 minutes. Rated R for sexuality nudity language and some violence. Egyptian Harvard Exit. From the spare elegant tinder of Annie Proulxs short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Ang Lee and screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have created a quietly roaring fire. This is an epic love story told in few words; like Lees masterful Jane Austen adaptation ""Sense and Sensibility"" it takes place in a world with a strict code of behavior populated by people who cannot say what they really mean. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are cowboys in 1960s Wyoming. They are in love and they cannot tell the world or even each other. The film spans some 20 years in the lives of Jack and Ennis from their first and only summer together working as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain to their pot-bellied middle age. Over the years they each marry raise children and meet every few years for fishing trips during which little fishing takes place. Theirs is an electric connection begun in a too-small tent on Brokeback and never fading. Both are all too aware of the price of anyone finding out. Ennis the less articulate of the two manages to frame his fears precisely ""This thing grabs hold of us again in the wrong place the wrong time and were dead."" Lee fills his film with long waiting silences punctuated by the endless horizontal lines of the Wyoming and Texas plains. And he gives his actors room to work small miracles of character. Ledgers performance is a revelation; nothing he has done on screen indicated that he was capable of this. Hes a tightly wound man of few words and few visible emotions which Ledger lets slip out like flickers from an ember the nervous eagerness with which he waits at the window for a visit from Jack the ever-so-slight softening of his voice when he speaks of his daughters (""my little girls"") the way he sets his jaw against impossible dreams of a happier future with Jack. ""If you cant fix it"" he says ""youve got to stand it."" Gyllenhaals Jack is a more cheerful presence -- he hasnt given up on his dreams. On a fishing trip he tells Ennis of his plan for the two of them to get a ranch together leaving the wives and children behind. ""Itd be a sweet life"" he says and you know he believes it; Jack has an almost childlike twinkle to his eye and a stubborn refusal to acknowledge complications. The ranch never materializes and their lives go on. Michelle Williams does beautiful work as Ennis young wife Alma a woman a little bit afraid of something she cant name. Finally she sees evidence of what she fears -- Ennis and Jack in a stairwell -- and her face freezes Her world has ended. Anne Hathaway has a sexy swagger as Jacks wife Lureen a practical woman who chooses not to notice her husbands distance. Kate Mara is touching as Ennis grown daughter Alma Jr.; she speaks her fathers language of few words but quiet understanding. And Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie as Jacks parents have a devastating scene late in the film Like their house they seem faded and worn as if the sun was too much for them. The emotional impact of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is all the more stunning for its quietness. Little thats dramatic happens onscreen and its central image couldnt be more prosaic two worn-soft western shirts hanging together. But Lee a master of yearning has created a classic and heartbreaking love story that wont be easily forgotten. It stays with you after youve seen it like a haunting strain of music; both love song and elegy for what might have been.

But lazy designations will go only so far with Brokeback Mountain a film about love and the cost of lying thats exquisite in its beauty painful in its truths. Directed by Ang Lee (back from The Hulk) and based on a story by E. Annie Proulx Brokeback Mountain begins in 1963 and ends around 20 years later at the heart-sore conclusion of an off-and-on affair. Except its never off and rarely on -- and even when its over it isnt. For the tragedy that colors this broad Western canvas is a tragedy of inaction as much as action of fear as much as love. Its the tragedy of silence. In the world of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) two men cant keep house together. They first meet while tending sheep for a rancher (a gruff steady Randy Quaid) in Wyoming. Ennis stays at base camp on Brokeback Mountain in charge of supplies and meals. Jack sleeps with the herd to keep predators at bay. Its just the two of them shell-mouthed Ennis and voluble Jack and for a while Lees movie has the homespun companionable feel that comes from roasting hotdogs by the fire. When a single frigid night turns friends into lovers these mountain scenes become something more -- a refuge or an island of denial. ""You know Im not queer"" says Ennis and Jack replies ""Me neither."" At the close of their first summer they head down the mountain and away into straight parallel lives of marriage and fatherhood. Four years later they meet and head up Brokeback. Some months later the same. Fishing trip they tell their wives. Fishless they return. Thats the rhythm of the film love on the mountain lies down below. The cycle repeats with sad inevitability getting sadder and more inevitable as the years roll on. The upbeat ingenuous Jack asks Ennis to make a life with him but even as he says it even as hope twangs in Gyllenhaals voice like the soundtracks steel guitar you sense it wont be. Ennis wont do it. As a boy he saw the corpse of a gay man bloodied by hate so he knows what the consequences can be. ""Two guys livin together"" he says. ""No way."" All of this depends on Ledger. When he first cracked his mouth to speak I was amazed any sound came out; the space between his lips didnt look big enough. To say that Ledgers work (already nominated for a Golden Globe and bound to be nominated for an Oscar) is a masterpiece of reticence doesnt do it justice. It ranks among the classic virile laconic-cowboy performances in the annals of Western movies -- and so what if the role is gay? The screenplay (by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana) is taciturn in its own way opting to show rather than tell its biggest revelations. Nothing is gratuitous. When Ennis makes love to his wife and we see him -- with one simple gesture -- yearn for Jack we see the resignation on her face too. It is as bleak and profound a moment as youll find all year and it reveals the movies single greatest strength It demonizes no one not Ennis and Jack not their wives (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway). All are players in this tale of tragic mortal longing. Youll only understand it if youre human. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Original Penguin Mens Leather Wallet for 15 + free shipping PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Hamilton Watches Up to 72% off + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

This time you think let the audience find its own way to the hollows and peaks of pleasure. ""Brokeback Mountain"" directed with sharp grace by Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") is the kind of movie people should discover. Yet ""Brokeback"" starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as cowboys involved in a 20-year relationship is hard to ignore as it breaks into a gallop toward Oscar. Earlier in the week this film about love masculinity and the American West received seven Golden Globe nominations including best picture best director best actor (Ledger) and best supporting actress (Michelle Williams). So I share this as a way of tempering things When first I saw the love story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist at the Telluride Film Festival I liked it. Mightily. But I was not smitten. Sure Ledgers tight- lipped depiction of Ennis was an actors promise kept Ledger had been the real surprise of ""Monsters Ball."" And there was a turning-point scene that takes place in a wilderness of such hurting truth it could snap a heart in two. But one could survive the films aching honesty intact. That was the first viewing. But with each visit to ""Brokeback Mountain"" it becomes clearer Lee has given us an impeccable stirring tour de force. We talk of love being the deepest value but we seldom get art that articulates how hard it can be to maintain that vulnerable belief. Add to this pang the movies undeniable romance with the Rocky Mountain West where life is hardscrabble in the plains and jaw-dropping in the pines. Not that ""Brokeback"" is for the dewy-eyed. From Stetson to boot tip Lee and screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have remained true to the vigor the elements-roughened characters of Annie Proulxs short story. ""Brokeback"" is laconic when it needs to be which given its terse source is constant. In 1963 Ennis and Jack meet in the trailer of sheep rancher Jack Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Aguirre sends the two into Wyomings high country. One will keep a base camp; the other must travel and sleep with the sheep. Its a lonesome arrangement. It doesnt last long. Calling ""Brokeback Mountain"" a gay cowboy movie has turned into clumsy shorthand insufficient to the movies core and it has provided joke fodder for late-night talk show hosts. Which isnt to say Lee and his company shy away from sex. What happens between Ennis and Jack on Brokeback takes place quickly unapologetically. (As it did in Proulxs story.) Their hunger is sharp. But its their evolving tenderness that offers a big-screen revelation. Lee honors the irreducible mystery of connection. Its their yearning the romance that is fresh. Ledger hunkers down into Ennis silences almost as if life is backing up on him a reflux of unease. Jack is a different animal. Gyllenhaal gives his character an aliveness a hopefulness a craving he is more in touch with. His is a pre-""coming out"" awareness. Nevertheless Jack knows that its being in love with Ennis that keeps him driving from Texas to Wyoming mile after mile year after year tryst after tryst. When Ennis first meets Jack hes engaged to sweetheart Alma (Williams). Soon they marry and have two girls. Jack marries too. These are not false relationships just incomplete. Not one of the women of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is played as harpy or victim. As Jacks future wife Nureen Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries"") makes her entrance tearing up the turf at a rodeo. Williams makes Almas crushing disappointment ours even as we want Jack and Ennis to be together. What is disgusting is an image Ennis has carried with him since he was a boy. It was a memory his father forced on him and his brother when he took them to a crime scene. A couple of old cowboys lived together and one of them met a brutal end. This wasnt a bashing; it was a lynching and a lesson. As much as ""Brokeback"" resonates with contemporary battles about love and marriage the film remains hushed like Ennis and loving like Jack. And like these indelible cowboys you too may find it impossible not to succumb to the powerful quiet greatness that is ""Brokeback Mountain.""

"Brokeback is an affecting study of stifled passion - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Brokeback is an affecting study of stifled passion By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 16 2005 Yes its the gay cowboy movie. Get over it.The reason to see Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain"" and see it you should isnt its hot-button topicality or its cultural cachet but simply that its a very good movie with a staggeringly fine performance by Heath Ledger.At the same time Brokeback"" has already become the default best picture"" in a weak year -- the one film that critics groups and awards organizations can come to consensus on -- and thats overselling it a little. Its an Ang Lee movie a chamber drama about inarticulate desires from one of the cooler and smarter customers currently working. The intimacy just happens to unfold against an epic Marlboro Man landscape (breathtakingly shot by Rodrigo Prieto) in ways that bring tragedy to the surface while keeping the audience at a certain remove.Brokeback Mountain"" is based on the 1996 short story by Annie Proulx and the script by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana honorably expands on the writers weathered prose. In the summer of 1963 two hard-luck young ranch hands named Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) sign up to work a flock of sheep in the high country of Wyoming; one is assigned to stay at base camp while the other baby-sits the sheep higher up -- its Forest Service land but rancher Randy Quaid is tired of having his stock picked off by coyotes.Jack is a rodeo wannabe just shy of a clown; Ennis is a taciturn piece of work engaged to a small-town girl named Alma (Michelle Williams). What happens between the two men builds slowly then explodes after which they retire to opposite corners. Their rough impulsive coupling could have been a fight. It almost is. Lee films it with the studied frankness of a boxing match or a nature documentary.The two share a blissful summer -- again never speaking of whats happening between them because as Ennis insists I aint no queer"" -- and then return to normal"" lives. Ennis marries Alma and has a couple of kids while Jack hooks up with a rodeo-riding daddys girl (Anne Hathaway defiantly kicking over the traces of The Princess Diaries""). That retreating idyll looms larger and larger for both men -- the one true moment of human connection that neither can fully grasp or let go. They begin to take biannual fishing trips"" up in the mountains.Brokeback"" proceeds to edge forward over the course of two decades children grow wrinkles appear the gulf between husbands and wives widens. The film quietly acknowledges an entire subculture of men who keep their sexuality (gay bi whatever) tucked carefully away while toeing a straight line. The perils of straying off that line are manifestly clear even without Enniss anecdote about the fate of a ranching couple"" he knew in his childhood. The film asks a lot of an audience -- not that cowboys might have physical feelings for each other but the more prosaic business of watching young actors age with the aid of make-up. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway get the short end of the stick; youre painfully aware theyre 20-something stars wearing middle-aged hair. Gyllenhaal also plays the more callow of the two men and coincidentally or not his performance doesnt dig as deep as you want it to.But maybe anyone would look thin next to Ledgers Ennis Del Mar. The actor hunches over and pulls his emotions under his canvas coat; he doesnt age so much as slowly cave in. Thats fitting Ennis is both ennobled and shamed by feelings he doesnt possess words to describe. This thing we have"" is the closest he comes and yet its the only real part of his life despite the damage left in its wake. Ledger turns the classic iconography of the Western male -- a cowboy hat pulled low a measured drawl that says no more than it absolutely has to -- into protective coloring. The genius of the performance is in how little he shows and how much he suggests.The third sharp point of the movies triangle is Williams as Alma whose youth and spiritedness slowly drain away in the face of an infidelity she cant encompass. Theres a beautiful low-rent weariness to the performance -- like something out of an Edward Hopper painting -- and with any justice this long-underrated actress will finally get some mainstream recognition.Brokeback"" may be too polished for some people too elegantly dispassionate in its study of choked passion. Its final image insists rather bluntly on the closets we build for ourselves. The movie sticks with you though as does its belief that love is more important than gender or culture or anything -- that its important enough to be treasured in secret if necessary. Lee stays true to the cowboy stoicism of Proulxs final lines Nothing could be done about it and if you cant fix it youve got to stand it."" Thats the tragedy here and the strength.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

RELATED  Gay cowboy movie shatters stereotypes FACT BOXBrokeback Mountain Starring Heath Ledger Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Williams Anne Hathaway Randy Quaid Directed by Ang Lee Screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based on the short story by E. Annie Proulx Studio Focus Features YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- The script for ""Brokeback Mountain"" based on the short story by Annie Proulx was called the best non-produced screenplay in Hollywood as it floated for seven years through the executive suites of all the major studios. It had also gained the odious nickname of ""the gay cowboy movie"" which made the film toxic to many.Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal had seen the screenplay by the writing team of Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and had been impressed with the results. But it still took two little words whispered into their ears to make them finally sign on to the project. Those two words were Ang Lee.Lee is one of the most respected directors working today. His films include ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""The Hulk."" He had also handled another film that explored gay subject matter ""The Wedding Banquet"" to great critical acclaim.Lee is a sublime storyteller and after all isnt that what a movie is all about?In the case of ""Brokeback Mountain"" all the talent pays off. The combination of the terrific script Lees sensitive and precise direction and the dynamic acting talents of Ledger as ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and Gyllenhaal as rodeo cowboy Jack Twist has resulted in an exquisitely crafted and ultimately melancholy love story -- epic in scope and intensely intimate at the same time.Quite simply this is one of the best films of the year.To label ""Brokeback Mountain"" as ""the gay cowboy movie"" does a great disservice to its haunting love story stretching over decades which survived in a time and place in which the two mens feelings for each other were utterly taboo.Lee promised to not back off from the physical relationship between the two men and to their credit Ledger and Gyllenhaal pull no punches when it comes to the kissing scenes. They also pull no punches when it comes to an actual fight scene between the two of them.The ties that bindNeither Ennis nor Jack identify themselves as gay but after spending a lonely summer on Brokeback Mountain tending sheep for ranch owner Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) their slowly emerging emotional bond turns physical when a booze-driven impromptu primal urge takes over one night. This torrid sexual encounter tastefully filmed shames and excites them in equal measure but is barely acknowledged in the light of day.Ennis manages to mumble ""You know I aint queer"" to which Jack replies ""Me neither.""But their repressed passion for each other continues throughout the summer. When they finally part both think its forever.Ennis remains in Wyoming and marries his long-time sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams) and produces two daughters. Jack continues to ride the rodeo circuit and marries the winsome rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway) a paring which also includes a job with her rich father.Four years pass and one day Ennis receives a note from Jack saying hes going to be passing through and would like to see him. The moment they see each other its clear their physical attraction has not diminished and they find themselves kissing passionately. This act is witnessed by a shocked Alma who has no context in her somewhat limited life experience to understand the scene. She decides to ignore it.But both men now know that their love for each other -- while impossible to acknowledge to the outside world -- is a potent combination. They arrange to see each other once a year under the pretense of fishing trips.Over the years Jack tries unsuccessfully to get Ennis to come with him and build a life on their own but Ennis rejects him every time. The final result is achingly sad.Great performances""Brokeback Mountain"" may be a hard sell to the general public though its earned plenty of critical acclaim -- including the top award at the Venice Film Festival. Its also probably on Oscars best picture radar.The performances are terrific. Ledger is taciturn and brilliantly understated. Ennis is a man who can not access his emotions and Ledgers most powerful moments come with no dialogue; what isnt said speaks volumes. Just a gesture a shrug or momentary glance at Jack conveys what many actors -- and scripts -- would need pages of words to achieve.Gyllenhaal also delivers his best performance to date and with another big film opening this year ""Jarhead"" his stardom is definitely on the rise.But the two women in the film Williams and Hathaway also deserve a lot of credit for adding to the emotional depth this wonderful film achieves. Their roles were greatly expanded from Proulxs short story and the balance of their relationships with their husbands -- and their husbands deep ties to each other -- greatly enrich this unique and brilliant film.Human beings have a deep need to love and to be loved in return. ""Brokeback Mountain"" celebrates that need without making any moral judgments. One line in the film sums it all up ""If you cant fix it you gotta stand it.""

"Brokeback Mountain | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brokeback-mountain ) Brokeback Mountain (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Longing is such a potent element of the human experience that it has formed the fabric of numerous stirring motion pictures. Brokeback Mountain is one such movie - a tale of love and loss of unrealized dreams and of lives wasted by denying passion and accepting convention. The primary difference between Brokeback Mountain and say for example Clint Eastwoods The Bridges of Madison County is that in Ang Lees picture the central relationship is between two men. And this isnt a platonic friendship. These men are as intimately involved as two lovers can be. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) meet in the summer of 1963 when both are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to be sheepherders on Wyomings Brokeback Mountain. Their job keep the sheep moving and make sure as many as possible make it home. Gradually a friendship forms between the two men although neither is a master of words. And one chilly night the relationship turns physical. They agree that what happens on Brokeback Mountain stays on Brokeback Mountain and when the summer is over they have every expectation of never seeing each other again. Ennis is off to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack meets rodeo queen Lureen (Anne Hathaway). But deep down neither can forget their summer together and Jack eventually decides to break the silence and make contact. The richness of the characters and situations in Brokeback Mountain is both its strength and to an extent its undoing. One problem is that many of the subplots only tangentially brushed by the movie prove to be at least as interesting as the main story and it become frustrating to view only snapshots of some of these tales. Alma is as tragic a character as they come and she has to live with the ghost of a memory that will haunt her yet we only see snippets of her life. I realize this is Jack and Ennis story but director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger Hulk) causes us to be so interested in all the characters - even the secondary ones - that there are times when the singleminded focus of the primary plot can make viewers feel cheated. Although the tale is well developed and there is great emotional resonance in the push-and-pull between the characters and their world Brokeback Mountain doesnt break new ground except that this story has not previously been told (at least not in a major motion picture) with the gay spin. The sexuality of the characters is deliberately left ambiguous. Ennis would seem to be a mostly heterosexual individual who loses himself in a moment of passion with another man who subsequently comes to dominate his thoughts. Jack on the other hand is at least bi-sexual with a likely preference of men over women (despite his assertion that hes ""not queer""). While it shouldnt matter that the romance occurs between two men there are some who will feel uncomfortable about the subject matter. One would hope however that Brokeback Mountain wont be pigeonholed as a ""gay cowboy movie."" That may be essentially accurate but its an underrepresentation of whats going on. One of the films strengths is the way in which Lee causes the longing to bubble off the screen. We can feel it. Its a palpable presence. It turns our memories to roads not taken. The other post of Brokeback Mountains foundation is the acting. Gyllenhaal - who may be battling against himself for Oscar contention (hes also good in Jarhead) - has shown in three 2005 films (the third being Proof) that hes a talent to be reckoned with. Jack may be his most challenging role of the year and Gyllenhaal nails it. Heath Ledger is equally as good showing a depth not yet explored (certainly not in his other late-year movie Casanova). Ennis is a taciturn introvert but that doesnt stop Ledger from a subtle exploration of his pain and loneliness. This character is strangled by convention and Ledger successfully shows that in everything from Ennis hangdog look to his slow gait. The primary supporting actors deserve equal recognition. This is the best performance yet from Michelle Williams who has parlayed a popular TV role into a respectable motion picture career. Anne Hathaway bearing a breast as she throws her Disney image aside plays Lureen with the right amount of sass and artificiality. And Randy Quaid gets a chance to play a character who isnt a buffoon although like many ""tough"" men of the 60s hes a homophobe to the bone. Brokeback Mountain spans a time period of nearly twenty years. We only get the highlights but they are enough to give us a picture of the compromises both men have made to steal the occasional moment with each other and the boundaries they are unwilling to cross. Jack wants them to give up their current unsatisfying lives and live with each other; Ennis refuses to consider this because of how they will be viewed by society. The ending is predictably tear-jerking but its filmed with less melodrama than it might be. Lees restraint during this portion of the story is welcome. Another director might have taken things too far in his quest to provoke an emotional reaction. The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx and has been adapted for the screen by Diana Ossana and Lonesome Doves Larry McMurtry. Brokeback Mountain isnt for everyone but for those who are not bothered by the homosexual relationship it offers a study in yearning love and loss. It didnt affect me as deeply as either The Bridges of Madison County or The Remains of the Day (both of which offer similar themes in different settings) but it evokes some of the same feelings. Its a brave and affecting effort from a director from whom we have come to expect worthwhile things.

Its a heart-wrenching portrayal of unfulfilled Wyoming love but this time we dont mean Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur in Shane. Heath Ledger right and Jake Gyllenhaal are drifters who find each other in Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain. Focus Features From the ever unpeggable Ang Lee and adapted from an Annie Proulx short story Mountain is a gay Western with a shot to become much more than a niche movie. Of course when your directorial resume includes Sense and Sensibility and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon you obviously know how to work the angles. And for renewed fire in his belly after his Hulk debacle Lee now turns to more than campfire pork and beans. About the movie Brokeback Mountain     (out of four) Stars Heath Ledger Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Williams Anne Hathaway Linda Cardellini Randy Quaid Director Ang Lee Distributor Focus Features Rating R for sexuality nudity language and some violence Running time 2 hours 14 minutes Opens Friday in New York Los Angeles and San Francisco Modest in scale but with an epic feel this 21/4 hour portrayal of star-crossed sheep tenders casts Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as two ill-educated drifters you sense at once will not be ending their days collecting corporate pensions. Ledger is halfway between inarticulate and taciturn but perhaps wiser than he initially seems. His more outgoing friend-turned-lover is a Texas rodeo cowboy with slightly more worldly experience. Its 1963 and the two are half-dumbstruck by their mutual passion. Ledger has severe childhood memories of violence against a gay resident of the beyond-rural burg where he was raised. After a languorous opening third the movie soars for the duration as it dramatizes the fallout and periodic reunions from the pairs first and only idyllic summer laboring together. And alone. The Larry McMurtry-Diana Ossana screenplay an Oscar-nomination lock has the authentic feel of McMurtrys Lonesome Dove and The Last Picture Show as well as the cumulative power of his Terms of Endearment. For a movie the actors rightfully dominate there are artfully developed female characters potently acted by Michelle Williams Anne Hathaway and Linda Cardellini as wives and lovers either heart-broken over whats happening or cluelessly mystified. Theres nothing fussy or attention-getting about Lees direction or Rodrigo Prietos photography but the selection of shots and the rhythm of their cutting seem unerringly right. And while many of todays movies dont really end -- you see a splice and the end credits roll -- the capper here is a kick in the gut. Its an old-style virtue for a film thats old-style in the best way unassuming but people-oriented and aiming to endure.

"Brokeback Mountain. Slate Sign In Sign Up Brokeback Mountain. Brokeback Mountain. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 8 2005 707 PM Lasso Me Tender Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain and a season of gay cinema. By David Edelstein Let somebody love you Desperado In dubbing Brokeback Mountain (Focus Features) ""Marlboro men in love"" Im not being flip. OK Im not only being flip. Ang Lees films often focus on the tension between peoples formal roles--those ritualized culturally mandated poses they feel compelled to strike--and the passions under the surface that struggle to express themselves. Even manners as elaborate as the ones in the martial-artsy (a readers phrase) Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon were destabilized by the characters unruly ardor and volcanic sex drives. So in Brokeback Mountain--adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana from a plain but evocative story by Annie Proulx--you have two guys with slim hips and dungarees and cowboy hats pulled low. They lean against pickups smoke cigarettes and trade monosyllables (if that). Theyre suitable for framing. But in the course of an early 1960s summer herding sheep on an isolated Wyoming mountain they find themselves growing closer and closer and ... yes on Brokeback Mountain they make the beast with two broken backs. Advertisement Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play the men. Gyllenhaals Jack Twist is the more extroverted one the rodeo rider the cowboy who makes cow eyes. Ledgers Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential Westerner of few words and the words he says are not always audible He speaks with a Wild West lockjaw thats sometimes annoying but also weirdly hypnotic. Ledgers performance is prime Oscar bait Hes ostentatiously immobile with uncanny low tones--his voice is 50 fathoms deep. The whole performance is subtextual. What does Brokeback Mountain (the place) symbolize? Its the natural world in which societys strictures fall away and these men can be true to their own natures--where dinners of canned beans yield to elk-hunting shirtless romps and hungry coupling. Lee and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto mirror the forces in play with vast mountain backdrops full of mysterious planes huge cumulous clouds slashes of lightning in the far distance and hailstones the size of apples. When Jake and Ennis return as they must to civilization they live amid squat faceless pre-fab buildings set far apart from one another and the flat landscapes once again mirror their emotions--now flat-lined. They take wives--Michelle Williams as Ennis high-school sweetheart Alma and Anne Hathaway as Lureen a kind of Texas rodeo queen with a wealthy daddy whos the perfect trophy for an up-and-comer like Jake. But these are passionless unions and Ennis drift into unemployment and alcoholism is relentless. Despite the physical distance between them (Ennis is in Wyoming Jake in Texas) they come together again and again and head back to the wild--aware that if theyre caught they could be lynched by all their neighbors those less-than-liberal ""real"" men who wouldnt know a real man if he fucked them in the ass. (Or maybe thats the only way they would know a real man.) The lovers wonder Can you build on Brokeback Mountain? Cartman on South Park famously dismissed independent movies as ""gay cowboys eating pudding."" I have no idea where the pudding image came from but Im bound to say that Brokeback Mountain could use a little more of it--by which I mean more sweat and other bodily fluids. Ang Lees formalism is so extreme that its often laughable and the sex is depicted as a holy union Gay love has never been so sacred. On the other hand Lee treats the wives as either sexless drudges (Williams) or lacquered mannequins (Hathaway). Williams gives a fine performance (more Oscar bait) as the kind of wife who inevitably gets labeled ""long-suffering"" but she seems to exist only in relation to her husband and only then to drag him down. Advertisement As distant as I felt from the movie there were people around me weeping uncontrollably at the end--gay men some of them and a few women who were moved by the spectacle of cowboys in tears. (This is actually something of a chick flick.) And I did find Brokeback Mountain more powerful in retrospect when its tone and images and emotions lingered beyond all its elevated Oscar-worthiness. There were also moments in which Lee deconstructed the cowboy persona so completely that he made me wonder Are a lot of cowboys like totally gay? Theres certainly a lot of breaking free for the holidays Tis the season to be gay--transvestite transsexual or prone to burst into song to express the anguish of AIDS. Mysterious and transfixing ... Youll be singing along to the soundtrack of Neil Jordans enchanting Breakfast on Pluto (Sony Pictures Classics) which boasts the most felicitous use of wall-to-wall pop songs Ive ever heard. T. Rexs ""Children of the Revolution"" is a special treat and while I hoped never to hear Bobby Goldsboros ""Honey"" again in this lifetime in context its extraordinarily winsome. The tone throughout is an improbably cheerful plaintiveness. Jordan adapted the movie with Patrick McCabe from McCabes novel. (They also made The Butcher Boy together.) Their small-town Irish hero/heroine--as the title would suggest a farther-out Holly Golightly--is Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden (Cillian Murphy). In chapters with superimposed titles he tells the story of his life beginning with being dumped by his mother on the steps of a church where the priest Father Bernard (Liam Neeson) squeamishly hands him off to a brusque foster mother. Shes none too happy when she finds the 10-year-old Patrick (played by Conor McEvoy) modeling her dresses She warns him that the next time shell make him parade through the street dressed like that and he says ""Promise?"" Advertisement Subtitled birds comment wryly on this turn--an example of Jordans playful technique the gaiety juxtaposed against acts of shocking brutality. (The Irish Republican Army looms large in the mid-70s.) Patrick/Kitten grows up obsessed with his absent mom whos said to resemble Mitzi Gaynor and flits off to London to track her down. Patricks poverty and homelessness in the big city is the stuff of nightmares but you never catch him brooding on it. Theres a bubble around him. In truth he seems slightly bonkers--on Pluto. And while bad people do bad things to him others treat him kindly Among his contacts are Brendan Gleesons surprisingly tender drunken laborer and Stephen Reas sad-sack Stan Laurel-esque magician. (Theres a touching semiparodic reenactment of Jordans The Crying Game.) Even a police investigator (Ian Hart) who roughs him up ultimately carts him to a welcoming house of ill repute to earn a ""decent"" living. With his unearthly face--high razor-sharp cheekbones that frame irradiated blue eyes--Cillian Murphy makes a mysterious and transfixing object. A more down-to-earth actor would sentimentalize Breakfast on Pluto and make for an awkward fit with its peculiar mix of tones. Murphys strangeness--his chill estrangement--makes his campy ""Kitten"" persona more poignant. Transvestitism is the only way that such a damaged soul can find beauty and harmony in a cold and colorless world. A thrill a minute Felicity Huffmans face is what holds you in Duncan Tuckers delightful Transamerica (The Weinstein Company) too but her semi-transsexual Bree (nee Stanley) Osbourne is the antithesis of a camp drag queen. A mismatched buddy road-trip picture in which the Los Angelino Bree shortly before her final operation discovers shes the father of a teenage son a homeless-in-Manhattan delinquent named Toby (soulful newcomer Kevin Zegers) Transamerica skirts sitcom terrain. But Huffman has purged all extravagant artifice from her manner. Shes smart enough to know that Bree would never risk calling attention to that artifice. A prim social conservative she doesnt believe that she is artificial. Despite a brief teenage experiment with a woman (it yielded Toby) she has no doubt that her male organ was a genetic screw-up. Advertisement Huffmans performance is a thrill-a-minute--and a thrill-a-motion. An actress playing a man playing a woman is a mind- as well as gender-bender but Huffmans face is made up to look as if shes right on the male-female border and her ladylike movements are studied with the timing always slightly off Before our eyes she deconstructs a woman and then puts her back together. When in Texas a Native American (Graham Greene) in a cowboy hat takes Bree for a born female and admires her form she shivers with pleasure and I felt sad that he would ever have to know the (rather misleading) truth. Toby opines that its weird to see an ""Indian in a cowboy hat."" He has a greater job of reorienting himself ahead of him He doesnt know that this uptight woman who bailed him out of juvenile detention (posing as a Christian do-gooder) is his sperm-donor. Transamerica has a couple of melodramatic turns and the paternity revelation is delayed unconscionably. But the movie builds to a marvelously over-the-top sequence in Brees upper-middle-class home in which her horrified Christian mother (a hilarious Fionnula Flanagan) lavishes attention on her new grandson (who doesnt know hes her grandson); her hapless Jewish father (Burt Young) fumbles to explain the family position on their sons transsexuality (""We love you but we dont respect you""); her cynical recovering-drug-addict sister (Carrie Preston) struggles to reconcile the trippy discontinuum between her brother and Bree; and Toby decides he wouldnt mind becoming Brees lover. Farce born of sadly irreconcilable impulses Bravo Cringe-worthy In a rare burst of discretion Ive put off writing about Rent (Columbia) in part because I dont want to seem unsympathetic to the emotions that gave birth to Jonathan Larsons musical and its subsequent--posthumous--enshrinement in Broadway culture. I dont share the view of some critics that this souped-up La Boheme is faux bohemianism no more authentic than a Gap ad. Its real--and on screen its really cringe-worthy. Not quite Phantom of the Opera cringe-worthy but not as much fun to blow raspberries at either. Rent is set in 1989 when too many people had already died from AIDS and too many were about to--before the current cocktail of meds brought the virus under control (somewhat). Most of the major characters are sick and when they open their mouths to sing--its undistinguished Lite Rock in the promiscuously emotive style of the numbers on American Idol--theyre quickly joined by other members of the large ensemble. I can see how comforting and inspiring this instant communal oneness might seem to some people but I found it tiresomely undramatic even saccharine. Not to mention monotonous. Chris Columbus directs fluidly (for him) but in a family-movie style that makes the musical seem even more homogenized than it probably is. Its like a ride at Disney World the Urban AIDS-Victim Jamboree. Click here to read David Leavitts essay on whether Brokeback Mountain is a gay film.

In his new film ""Brokeback Mountain"" they rarely start. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a ranch hand who is hired along with sometime Texas rodeo rider Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) for a summer job herding sheep on Wyomings Brokeback Mountain. Theyve never met before and for a while they communicate - or at least Ennis does - mostly through grunts and mumbles.Their closeness is that of the classic Westerners - what is not spoken is more eloquent than that which is. But then the film takes a startling turn. On a cold night Ennis and Jack lie together for warmth and then suddenly have sex.In most Westerns the devotion between cowboys is depicted as deeper and more spiritually sustaining than the love between a man and a woman. ""Brokeback Mountain"" which screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana expertly expanded from the celebrated 1997 short story by Annie Proulx makes explicit the sexual undercurrent that rightly or wrongly not a few critics have at times detected in the intense masculine bonds of these strong silent types. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In this sense as well as in the graphic nature of some of the sex scenes ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a zeitgeist-capturing moment for Hollywood. But ultimately its timing may well be a matter for the sociologists. As too will be the response from the general audience which inevitably and understandably will be sharply divided. After all nothing like this film has ever really been seen before from a major movie company. Im referring not only to the films sexual content here. What is truly distinctive about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that it brings to life a love story that after all these years of love stories is essentially new to mainstream movies and it does so without special pleading or sentimentality. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Ennis and Jack come down off the mountain that summer not knowing if they will ever see each other again. They barely acknowledge what went on between them and no future plans are made. But as Jack drives off Ennis throws up. He cant comprehend the chasm that has opened up inside him.For the next 20 years from the early 1960s to the late 70s Ennis and Jack both of whom become husbands and fathers hook up for brief intense getaways. Jack wants to leave his family for Ennis who can only respond by saying ""If you cant fix it you gotta stand it.""He is the more emotionally armored of the two and for much of the movie he is unable to acknowledge his passion for Jack. As his marriage to a good woman (the remarkable Michelle Williams) breaks up his violent outbursts which are really a form of self-abasement become the only way he can act out his despair and bewilderment. Ang Lee is a remarkable humanist. He shows us not only the emotional damage that Jack and Ennis undergo but also the toll that is taken on their wives and children. No one is a villain and no one is spared from sorrow.Gyllenhaal has a rare ability to bring out the youthful ardor in his characters without seeming callow. It is a gift that stands him in good stead because we must believe that the smitten Jack over a period of two decades is capable of sustaining a deepening passion. Ledger does something even more difficult He gives us a full-scale portrait of a man who is so imprisoned by tradition and inhibition that he can never break out. Ledgers underplaying is a sign of grace. It is an acknowledgment that for some men there is pain too deep for words.Ennis we are made to believe is the Old West while Jack who imagines they can have a life together is a precursor of the New West. But both are in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tragedy because these men have found something that many people of whatever sexual persuasion never find - true love. And they cant do anything about it. Grade A Strong caution Rated R for sexuality nudity language and some violence.

Photo Courtesy of Focus Features Photo Courtesy Of Focus Features Image 2 of 2 x x Photo X Just your average Marlboro men -- who fall in love Ledger Gyllenhaal two cowboys who cant admit theyre in love 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Brokeback Mountain Drama. Starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Ang Lee. (R. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Brokeback Mountain"" is already being talked about as the ""gay cowboy movie"" shorthand that neither does it justice nor gives the right impression. It makes it sound either cavalier or easy to categorize when the relationship depicted in the movie is a lot more complicated and difficult to pinpoint. Its about two men who are in love and it makes no sense. It makes no sense in terms of who they are where they are how they live and how they see themselves. It makes no sense in terms of what they do for a living or how they would probably vote in a national election. It makes no sense except in one place in the world the place where it started on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. And though they come down from that mountain and go about their lives they keep going back to it over the course of years because however much the love doesnt make sense its real -- so real it makes their lives unreal. There are kids marriages jobs nights of drinking heterosexual flings in-laws and holidays to celebrate and they do everything theyre expected to do but numb. Then every so often they meet back up on the mountain and get to be themselves for a few stolen days. The situation carries a lot of emotional power largely because its so specific and yet undefined. The two guys -- cowboys -- are in love with each other but we dont ever quite know if theyre in love with each other because theyre gay or if theyre gay because theyre in love with each other. Its possible that if these fellows had never met one or both would have gone through life straight. Thats one way of looking at the movie though only one. In any case because their attraction is not defined as some inevitable consequence of sexual orientation but as something that just happens to them we see them as irreplaceable to each other -- like Romeo and Juliet. Theres no notion that either could go out tomorrow or 10 years from now and find someone else. ""Brokeback Mountain"" based on Annie Proulxs 1997 story is directed by Ang Lee in a style that pays attention to the nuances of expression to the thoughts and emotions being articulated between the words and in the pauses. This is necessary because cowboys dont do much talking. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play Ennis and Jack respectively who meet when theyre hired to tend a herd of sheep in Wyoming in 1963. Theyre both tight-lipped fellows but Ledger is the more closed off of the two. He adopts a manner of speaking that suggests repression a pressing down of the vocal cords as though jealous of any word that might escape. Its up to interpretation whether he knows at first the thing that hes trying to hide. In any case nature will out and it does one night with a suddenness bordering on violence when the two men share a tent. The idea of two Marlboro men having sex in a tent is in itself an unexpected twist on a traditional image of American manhood. They cook beans make coffee share rodeo stories and do all the things that cowboys usually do. They are Western outdoorsmen in the true American tradition and they cant be transplanted which makes their love all the more difficult. You cant be a gay couple in a small Western town in 1963 and you cant be a cowboy in New York or San Francisco. Both actors do memorable work but Ledger has the better role and he makes the strongest choices. He gives Ennis a voice and mannerisms that are utterly idiosyncratic and then inhabits those choices psychologically making sense of the locked-down speech the haunted look and the strong but diffident manner. He completely transforms himself. Its a performance that was thought through in detail and then lived in the moment and its one of the most beautiful things in movies this year. Lees attention to the unspoken carries over into the domestic scenes of the men with their respective wives. As with the men there are things the wives dont dare say out loud as well but we can read their thoughts and see the toll the years take. Anne Hathaway the star of the innocuous ""Princess Diaries"" movies plays Jacks wife in a committed portrait of a woman getting blonder and blonder and more bitter and pinched over the course of some 15 years. Its a brilliant and insightful performance a time-lapse photography demonstration of what happens to someone who expected to be loved but wasnt. -- Advisory Sex scenes adult subject matter strong language.

Still I couldnt see this minimally told tale as a feature-length movie let alone an Ang Lee movie that moseys along for 134 leisurely minutes. In fact husband and wife screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana labored seven years to get the project off the ground and given the storys frankly carnal homosexual theme its remarkable they got it made at all in an industry that prefers its gay movies gussied up in lifestyle and no sex please. Youd think Lee would steer clear of all things Western after his disastrous dabble with the form in his very odd 1999 bomb Ride With the Devil. But notwithstanding its setting home on the Texas-Wyoming range Brokeback Mountain is no ordinary Western. If anything the movie is a refutation of the forms macho posturing -- an old-fashioned romantic weepie whose protagonists happen to be two men boldly played by two of Hollywoods hottest young hetero studs. Over the course of a long Wyoming summer in 1963 Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) a freelance ranch hand and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) a rodeo rider are thrown together on a gig herding sheep. Behind them is space -- the airy lonely infinity of a Wyoming mountain snowcapped and freezing even in August -- and time long hours measured out by a lonely guitar when nothing or anything can happen. After a night of spontaneous rough sex in a pup tent the two grow so close in body and spirit that when the job ends and they have to part the inexpressive Ennis slugs his lover without warning drives off then stops his truck for a dry heave in an alleyway.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Behind them too and cementing their mutual attraction is the shared experience of a dying world -- not the movie-cowboy landscape of lone rangers riding stoically into sunsets but the hand-to-mouth life of itinerant ranch hands their livelihood squeezed as farms are sold off to real estate sharks -- forcing them to abandon the outdoor work they love for cramped lives in small-town city apartments or trailers. It will be four years before Ennis and Jack meet again and by then they have both married and fathered children -- Ennis with his longtime sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack with rodeo queen Lureen portrayed as best she can by a woefully miscast Anne Hathaway who looks as if she just breezed in from tea with Julie Andrews. Lee whos a far more feminine director than the ballsy Proulx is a writer is instinctively drawn to domesticity and to women. Ensemble pieces come naturally to him and if broadening the focus of Proulxs tautly written two-hander gives Williams whos Ledgers partner in real life the chance to show what an intelligent young actress she is -- when Alma stumbles on a sensational clinch between Jack and Ennis Williams makes her silent anguish palpable -- it also drains energy from the implacable male passion that courses through Ennis and Jacks infrequent ""fishing trips"" in the wild. Still Lees delicacy remains true to Proulxs intent. He doesnt force the gay issue or reduce the two men to desperate closet cases. Instead he shows us the uncorking of a deep inchoate affinity between two very different personalities headlong impulsive puppyish Jack a romantic who wants his lover to come away with him; and quick-tempered Ennis whose fear of being outed is shaped by a childhood experience that showed him what happens to homosexuals in a hypermasculine society. Brokeback Mountain is at once the gayest and the least gay Hollywood film Ive seen which is another way of saying that Lee has a knack for culling universality from the most specific identities. Since Jack is an open book Gyllenhaal has the easy role but I suspect its posters of Ledger that will be going up on walls all over West Hollywood and far beyond. Rather than play down his instinctive animal masculinity Ledger gathers it into a tight tense ball of desire jockeying for space with rage and self-control and in the process so individuates the hapless Ennis that we forget until events crowd in to remind us that were witnessing a homosexual love affair imperiled by a cruelly inhospitable culture. What deepens the tragedy of Jack and Ennis is that the obstacles to their love are only partly cultural. The romantic lesson of Brokeback Mountain as in Walk the Line and countless Woody Allen movies is that the heart wants what it wants and should have it regardless. You can argue with that and I suspect that Ang Lee whose subject has often been the saving pragmatism of family and friends has his qualms. But theres no arguing with the ashen collapsed features of the man left behind with only a bloody shirt a picture post card of his beloved Brokeback Mountain and the terrible knowledge that he never wanted what he wanted enough to pay the price of getting it.

Its a landmark film and a triumph for Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who bring deep reserves of feeling to this defiantly erotic love story about two Wyoming ranch hands and the external and internal forces that drive them from desire to denial. Directed with piercing intelligence and delicacy by Lee the film of Annie Proulxs 1997 short story -- the unerring script by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is a model of literary adaptation -- wears its emotions on its sleeve. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> That leaves the film vulnerable. The media keep tagging it as the gay cowboy movie the queer Gone With the Wind the Western that puts the poke in cowpoke. Coupled with the rise of homophobia as church and state shout down gay marriage the film is up against it. Do me a favor See the movie first and make your judgments later. Its an eye-opener. The story begins in 1963 when ranch boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) hires Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) to herd sheep up on Wyomings Brokeback Mountain. Ennis is quiet but whiskey and Jacks talk about his rodeo riding loosens Ennis tongue and his inhibitions. One cold night they share a bedroll. Jack gives the impression of experience. For Ennis this is nothing hed done before but no instructional manual is needed. Proulx writes it this way ""They never talked about sex let it happen at first only in the tent at night then in full daylight with the hot sun striking down and at evening in the fire glow quick rough laughing and snorting no lack of noises but saying not a goddamn word except once Ennis said Im not no queer and Jack jumped in with Me neither. "" Lee and the gifted cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Amores Perros) transform Proulxs terse prose into expansive visual poetry. Shooting in Alberta Canada Lee avoids trite postcard prettiness to find the beauty and terror in nature that mirror the vivid and sometimes violent relationship between the two men. ""Its nobodys business but ours"" Jack tells Ennis. Hes wrong of course. Joe spots them with his binoculars and never hires them again. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams) and has two daughters. Jack moves to Texas marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway) and has a son. Living a lie is easier than dealing with the truth at least it is for Ennis until Jack pays a visit -- his first in four years. Lees filmmaking mastery has never been more evident. Watch the skill with which the Taiwanese director of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Sense and Sensibility walks the volatile ground of this reunion scene. Ennis cant contain his excitement. Running down the steps to greet his friend he collides with Jacks body kissing him fiercely and Jack returning the heat. Alma sees it too from the window finding reinforcement for something shes always felt. Without dialogue Lee creates a whole world that can be read eloquently and movingly on the faces of the actors. And what actors. Though the characters must age twenty years Lee has cast the film young a risk that pays major dividends. Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) excels at showing Lureens journey from cutie-pie to hard case. And Williams (Dawsons Creek) is a revelation using what Proulx calls Almas ""misery voice"" when her husband goes fishing several times a year with Jack. Who can blame her? They never bring home any fish. When Alma remarries and lets Ennis feel the knife of her resentment Williams lets it rip. Of course the movie would not work at all if the two lead actors didnt deliver the goods. Gyllenhaal finds the reckless core in Jack who cruises alleys and bars in Mexico when Ennis rejects his offer to settle down and run his fathers ranch. Ennis lives in fear of coming out -- he relates a harrowing childhood incident in which he saw a man tortured and killed for the crime of living with another man. And so he forbids himself happiness with the one person he has ever truly loved. Ledgers magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesnt just know how Ennis moves speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jacks closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost. As Jack told him once ""That ol Brokeback got us good."" Thats the key reason -- besides its daring its bravery its dead-on relevance to right now -- that this classic in the making ranks high on the list of the years best movies. It gets you good.

That most chameleonlike of directors Ang Lee pulls off yet another surprising left turn in ""Brokeback Mountain."" An achingly sad tale of two damaged souls whose intimate connection across many years cannot ever be properly resolved this ostensible gay Western is marked by a heightened degree of sensitivity and tact as well as an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger. With critical support Focus should have little trouble stirring interest among older sophisticated viewers in urban markets but trying to cross this risky venture over into wider release reps a marketing challenge for the ages; paradoxically young women may well constitute the group that will like the film best. In his uneven Civil War-era drama ""Ride With the Devil"" Lee revealed a touch for portraying neglected aspects of Western Americana a talent he applies and readjusts in an updated context here. Annie Proulxs 1997 short story movingly compressed the long-arc love story of two loner ranch hands into 30 tight pages. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have faithfully and perceptively retained the tone and the particulars of the tale in their screenplay elaborating mainly in the areas of the separate family lives the men pursue during their long separations. Precise build-up over the opening half-hour shows the director thoroughly at home with the emotional reserve of his characters and the iconography of the Wyoming setting. Its 1963 and brawny Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and lean Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) who have never met pose smoke and brood outside a dusty roadside office before taking summer jobs tending a large herd of sheep for a rancher (Randy Quaid); all this is accomplished without the two uttering as much as a word. Running the sheep through stunning country up to Brokeback Mountain (pic was shot in Alberta) Ennis and Jack begin to relate mainly thanks to Jacks relative loquaciousness; hes a Texas boy has done a bit of rodeo riding and is the more easygoing. In his clenched tight-lipped manner Ennis alludes to his parents death in a car wreck his patchy upbringing and education and his engagement to a young lady. The job theyre on is dull even annoying as one of them is supposed to spend nights in a distant pup tent to protect the sheep from predators; the only comfort comes from their conversation and liberal supply of whiskey. One cold and liquor-fueled night Jack insists Ennis get in the tent with him to keep warm. The snuggling quickly and roughly turns into something else. Their primal urges take things to where neither of them has gone before and they can scarcely digest it or talk about it afterward. ""You know I aint queer"" Ennis manages to which Jack concurs ""Me neither."" But it isnt long before theyre at it again establishing an indelible bond they agree no one else can know about or possibly understand. At summers premature end they go their separate ways with just a ""See ya around."" Making all this play in a mainstream-style movie represents a real tightrope walk for the writers director and especially the actors. All hands manage it through a shrewd balance of understated emotion and explosive physicality. The young mens pent-up sexuality expresses itself most comfortably through boyish horsing around but this can also slip over into outright violence as when they hit each other with bloody results. The men cope with their perplexing feelings by ignoring them. Ennis marries a sweet girl Alma (Michelle Williams) and they soon have two daughters. But a quick sex scene in which Ennis flips his wife over on her stomach tells us all we need to know about his true preferences. For his part Jack drifts around marries and has a son with cute Texas girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) whose respectable parents cant abide the no-account cowpoke. At long last Jack lets Ennis know hes coming for a visit sending the latter into a state of barely suppressed anticipation. When they finally see each other after several years they cant restrain themselves kissing passionately where the unfortunate Alma can see them. With the excitement of teenagers the guys check into a motel to reignite things and Jack sums it up when he observes ""That ol Brokeback got us good."" The two thereafter arrange to get away for ""fishing"" trips periodically over the years their marriages slowly failing while their bond holds fast. While the more impulsive Jack keeps pushing the idea of taking off and setting up a ranch together Ennis recalls a devastating childhood incident as a means of ruling this out. Although both men are impaired due to their narrow life histories it is Ennis who is oddly the most damaged and yet the most pragmatic as to how they can continue their relationship however unsatisfactorily. Ultimately its a sorrowful story of men lucky enough to connect but forlornly unable to fulfill their characters and live according to their true natures. Unfortunately the film hits this same note far too often in the latter going; the point is made well before the yarn plays itself out and like virtually every Lee picture this one is too long for its own good. Both young thesps are game credible as cowboys and unselfconscious with the verbal and physical intimacy. But while Gyllenhaal is engaging as the more free-wheeling of the two Ledger is powerfully impressive as a frightened limited man ill-equipped to deal with what life throws at him. Mumbling looking down internalizing everything Ledgers Ennis at times looks as though hes going to explode from his inchoate feelings. Perf could scarcely be more different from his terrific work in the otherwise negligible ""Lords of Dogtown"" and the combo makes it a dazzling year for Ledger. Williams gives Alma a quality of slow-burn devastation that is touching and Hathaway provides an entertaining contrast in wifely disappointment. The numerous small supporting roles are sharply etched a sign of Lees sure hand with the material. The beautiful rugged locations which would have roused Anthony Mann are majestically captured by lenser Rodrigo Prieto. The passing years from the early 60s to the late 70s are subtly indicated in the production and costume design hair styles and gingerly aging makeup while Gustavo Santaolallas conventionally supportive score is nicely abetted by a host of period and setting-appropriate tunes.
