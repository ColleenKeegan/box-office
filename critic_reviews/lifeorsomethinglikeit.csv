The trite homily ""Live every day as if it were your last"" is elaborated at feature length in ""Life or Something Like It."" Playing something other than a bad girl or a vidgame fantasy for a change Angelina Jolie expands her range slightly as a got-it-all Ms. Perfect who is suddenly made to realize that there may be more to life than the superficial pleasures of a great on-air broadcasting job and a studly jock boyfriend. A deeply metaphysical film by contempo Hollywood standards this middlebrow trifle may engage the emotions of a certain tier of young professional women torn by the perceived conflicting desires of realizing career fantasies and settling down with a Regular Joe but overall looms as a B.O. under-achiever. Not at all coincidentally rewritten by Dana Stevens who penned the similarly celestial/philosophical ""City of Angels"" working from an original by John Scott Shepherd (""Joe Somebody"") pic tries to grapple with such weighty issues as fate destiny happiness otherworldly influences and the perfect hairdo. Unfortunately its the type of film that illustrates its heroines conversion from a high-powered lifestyle to a taste for simple pleasures via a montage of her bonding with her new mans young son while taking amusement park rides and eating ice cream. Even more to the point it reduces a womans profound life change to the level of a dramatic gimmick. Jolies Lanie Kerrigan obnoxiously makes no bones about how ""perfect"" her life is what with her star reporter gig at a Seattle TV station her celebrity-enhancing romance with Seattle Mariners slugger Cal (Christian Kane) fab wardrobe and gleaming apartment; teased about her patently phony platinum-blond mane she petulantly replies ""My hair is my trademark."" A narcissist who has meticulously plotted and micro-managed every aspect of her life Lanie is royally pissed when ""noted street savant"" Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub) tells her she will die the following Thursday. But her annoyance turns into genuine concern when Jacks other two predictions of the day come true. When she presses him to forecast another event -- anything to prove he can be wrong -- Jacks clairvoyance is further confirmed which is enough to convince Lanie that she has only five days to live. News comes at an inconvenient time for Lanie as shes just been paged for a big network job in New York. In preparation shes assigned to work with experienced cameraman Pete (Edward Burns) whom she loathes for reasons that can be imagined but are not explained until nearly halfway into the picture. A laid-back guy with permanent stubble and an unwashed look Pete loves giving his self-involved partner a hard time even as his home-style influence is obviously destined to make Lanie see her life in a different light. Once Lanie comes to believe she really is doomed she dumps the suddenly superficial-seeming Cal and tries to spend some quality time with her working-class dad and wealthy but resentful older sister. But more importantly and with Petes willing assistance she loosens up to get back in touch with her regular-gal self rediscovering her inner slob and her ability to laugh at life. And in an unconvincing sequence that shifts the film from the realm of the fancifully acceptable to the thoroughly implausible she expresses musical solidarity on-air with some striking transportation workers in a way that ought to get her fired but instead leads to a professional opportunity that tests her newfound awareness just as Jacks prophesied deadline arrives. Playing a more ""normal"" or at least real-world woman than those with whom she has typically been associated during her meteoric career Jolie is something of an entertaining show unto herself at least for a while as she struts her stuff as a glamourpuss who obviously has far outgrown her hometown and is ready for the big time. Even when while under her weird ""death sentence"" she relaxes enough for a fling with Pete its hard to believe it could ever be anything other than just that so large is her ambition and style. For his part Burns is a tad less taciturn than usual and functions mostly as a rock on which Lanie can either run aground or find refuge. Supporting roles are strictly one-dimensional although Stockard Channing has an arresting few minutes as an old-pro TV personality with whom Lanie has an intense on-air encounter. Stephen Hereks direction is nothing if not slick although he doesnt rise to the satiric occasion provided by the story to score some points at the expense of personality-driven TV. Shot largely in Vancouver pic still conveys a pretty strong Seattle feel.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"USATODAY.com - A comedy or something like it Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/26/2002 - Updated 0118 AM ET A comedy or something like it By Mike Clark USA TODAY AP Angelina Jolie plays Lanie a TV reporter whos often at odds with a cameraman Pete (Edward Burns). Life or Something Like It is the most mawkish major studio release since 2000s The Family Man and like that Nicolas Cage groaner its being misleadingly marketed as a comedy. The movies few laugh lines (wannabe ones at best) are served up for free in the trailer a come-on to snookered audiences who are about to find themselves rudely immersed in sugar. Photographed in close-ups that make her sensual lips look wider than some male film critics biceps Angelina Jolie plays a Seattle TV reporter whose lacquered platinum dye job recalls the old advertisement for Vernors ginger ale ""Aged four years in wood."" Constantly at odds with a staff cameraman and long-ago lover (Ed Burns unwashed) she is now dating a baseball star named Cal and living a shallow life. But a street-person psychic and Burns acquaintance (Tony Shalhoub) is about to shake up her day when he gives her a week to live. Life or Something Like It (out of four) Stars Angelina Jolie Ed Burns Tony Shalhoub Christian Kane Stockard Channing Director Stephen Herek Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for sexual content brief violence and language Opens Friday nationwide With correct predictions of an unlikely final score in a local sports contest and the surprise onset of hail Shalhoubs prognostic prowess is established. Intimidated Jolie whos also awaiting the outcome of a network audition is forced to reassess her life priorities as the Grim Reaper hovers. Do you think just maybe that shes now going to temper her cantankerous relationship with Burns? Especially after the script presents him as a sensitive divorced dad who likes to take his kid to the park? Compared with the day-to-day portrayal of television served up here Death to Smoochy looked like a PBS documentary. During an on-air interview Jolie interjects herself into the story and leads a group of strikers into an extended pro-labor chant of the Rolling Stones Satisfaction. Instead of being carted back to the same mental home where the actress won her Oscar for Girl Interrupted Jolies character now finds the network beckoning. Finally given her big national shot she is similarly cheeky on live TV interviewing a kind of Barbara Walters grande dame. Instead of being banished to the third-ranked station in the 600th largest market ... well youll find out soon enough if you take the plunge. Theres nothing wrong with some respected authority figure telling the overworked to wake up and smell the roses smell the coffee or even smell movies that smell like this one. But the advice rings hollow when the message is conveyed via an industry as inherently high-pressure cutthroat and unforgiving as Hollywoods. Life is a crock -- or something like it.

(Photo Diyah Pera) (HANDOUT PHOTO) Romantic sparks begin to fly between Lanie (ANGELINA JOLIE) and Pete (EDWARD BURNS) much to the surprise of their colleague Vin (MAX BAKER). (Photo Diyah Pera) (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Jolie and Burns give Life to drama 1 / 1 Back to Gallery LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT Romantic drama. Starring Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns. Directed by Stephen Hereck. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Life or Something Like It"" has a premise thats hard to beat In the middle of a live segment a TV newswoman is told by a homeless clairvoyant that she has exactly one week to live. That setup as well as the suspense that goes with it takes this romantic drama a long way toward excellence. What brings it home are two stars who are easy on the eyes (Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns) and a screenplay thats actually about something. ""Life or Something Like It"" deals with the difficulty of striking the right balance -- between living for today and going nowhere or living for tomorrow and having no life. Along the way it dares to suggest something that women often say but movies about women never have the nerve to acknowledge Sometimes a woman cant have it all. To reach the top of ones profession requires a lifetime commitment that entails hard choices and sacrifice. Jolie plays Lanie a local TV journalist in Seattle with future network stardom written all over her. Thats something we have to accept on faith since Jolie doesnt make it easy. Its a weakness of Jolies performance that she didnt bother perfecting her news technique for the role. Her delivery is far too slow for television and her on-camera demeanor would register as snide and off-putting in any market. But Jolie brings other things to the table that are more important. First of all theres the walk. She walks like trouble. She walks like some jungle creature so when we see her in a business suit and a confining hairstyle we get the point before anyone tries to tell us. This is a woman whose ambition is constraining her. This is a woman funneling enormous energy into a life dream that may ultimately be confining. Before the street prophet (Tony Shalhoub) tells her that she has a week left she believes her life to be perfect. She is up for a network job and she is engaged to a star baseball player. In an early scene we see the glamorous couple walking out of a limousine waving to fans -- and we know before they do that this is what their relationship is all about this moment of standing there looking enviable. They dont look like a couple but like someones idea of one. After she hears the prediction -- even though she doesnt fully believe it - - she starts to look at her life. This is where the movie could turn hokey but doesnt. Theres no methodical self-examination and no moment of fake revelation just a letting down of her guard. Jolie knows how to play a woman loosening up. Our heroine skips bathing wears her glasses instead of contacts smokes goes off her diet and blasts music. This may be no way to live on a daily basis but we understand. Something is coming apart and maybe something has to. The movie contrasts Lanies future-directed approach to life with that of her cameraman Pete played by Burns with his usual laid-back decent-guy charm. Pete doesnt worry about getting ahead. He worries about finding pleasure in the moment though the film ever so subtly suggests that his responsibilities might be slightly different if he were a woman. Director Stephen Herek has made some good movies (""Rock Star"" ""101 Dalmatians"" ""Dont Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead"") though until now no one could ever have accused him of subtlety. But ""Life or Something Like It"" has a quiet confidence. It makes its points with economy and understatement and that goes for the performances too. Jolie goes through a lot in the course of the movie but while Herek could have emphasized Lanies transformation he plays it down. Lanie remains the same person as she would in life. Herek also keeps Jolies mannerisms and eccentricity in check and brings out what is apparently her genuine live-wire intelligence. The result is a worthy womans film and Jolies best showcase to date. Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

But a strong ending along with a fine performance by Angelina Jolie help the movie work. Jolie goes platinum blonde in this her first comedic turn. Marilyn Monroe may be dead and gone for lo these many years but her hair is alive and well and sitting on Jolies head. The actress plays Lanie Kerrigan a feature reporter for a Seattle television station. Shes poised for success and climbing the ladder with her exquisitely manicured nails. She has the perfect job the perfect apartment the perfect boyfriend and of course the perfect wardrobe. Shes on the fast track to the fast track and nothing better get in her way. Well there is one fly in her ointment. Her cameraman Pete played by Edward Burns has been there and back. Hes tasted the big time in New York City and gave it all up to be near his son who came to the Northwest with his ex-wife. His values are the exact opposite of Kerrigans family roots commitment and stability. She finds happiness in the trivial and the superficial. They fight like cats and dogs. Of course they fall in love. If that spoils the film for you you dont get out enough.

Life or Something Like It is neither about life nor about anything like life. As far as I can tell this bubbleheaded drama which purports to dramatize the importance of getting ones priorities straight (because no one on her deathbed wishes she had spent more time at work and blah blah blah) is mostly about slapping together a bunch of cliches - outdated cliches at that - regarding the loneliness of ambitious women. Its about patching together a motley ill-fitting cast based primarily on whos available. And its about hoping that audiences will be so fascinated by the extraordinary terrain of headliner Angelina Jolies lips that they wont care how synthetic the whole enterprise really is. Its true Jolies strapping physical presence magnified by the cameras goggling stare is riveting Her exciting oddness lends itself to characters of extreme proportion whether comic-book as in ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" or crazy as in ""Girl Interrupted."" Here she acts with her big eyes sweeping her pupils this way and that in exaggerated gestures of calculated flirtatiousness. And its true this ""Life"" is not worth taking seriously - not when Jolie plays Lanie Kerrigan a Seattle TV reporter with a Marilyn Monroe fixation expressed through a wardrobe of sex-kitten suits and a trademark rain-defying platinum tousle of hair. Lanies burning Ill-show-them desire is to become a network TV celebrity. And to that end the appearance of perfection however empty is crucial Lanies cute shallow Seattle Mariner fiance looks perfect. Her body looks perfect because she works out obsessively often with her pretty second-banana colleague Andrea (Melissa Errico a superb singer and stage actress who one hopes was handsomely paid for this gig). Only Lanies even cuter outspoken cameraman Pete (Edward Burns who one suspects was told that this is as good as its going to get for his limited range) is willing to call Lanie on her crap. And only a sidewalk prophet (Tony Shalhoub who one prays was amused by the opportunity to wear a big black beard) is wake-up call enough for Lanie to take stock He announces that shes going to die in a week. Which may put a crimp in her plans to be the next Barbara Walters. ""Life"" is about how one woman deals with the possibility of death - denial anger bargaining the whole Kubler-Rossian process. Its hardly headline-worthy to report that the obvious attraction between driven glamorous Lanie and laid-back down-to-earth Pete (mapped in dully cute bickering in a script by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens) develops into romance. (Director Stephen Herek who brought us ""Mr. Hollands Opus"" never settles for subtlety when blinking directional signals will do.) But for all the cartoonishness so many simplistic notions and myths about men women work friendship family and sex are strewn so lightly throughout that ""Life"" cannot - or should not - just be shrugged off. In its very casualness this dinky entertainment is a dispiriting measure of having come a damn little way baby. Its 2002 yet Lanie has evidently missed or ignored Michelle Pfeiffers performance in the glossier 1996 cautionary tale of loveless journalistic success ""Up Close amp; Personal"" or Sela Wards in the superior 1995 TV drama ""Almost Golden"" based on the life of the late TV journalist Jessica Savitch. Its 2002 yet Lanies brutal competitiveness can all be traced back to a mean older sister (Lisa Thornhill) whose childhood name for her gawky sibling was ""Pudge."" Its 2002 yet what weve got here is a two-dimensional Monroe wannabe whose struggle for liberation doesnt take place during live coverage of a prison riot (as befell Pfeiffers blondie in ""Up Close""). Rather it occurs during an extended drunken rendition of ""Satisfaction"" that Lanie performs on camera while covering a transit strike (and siding with the striking workers) during which her idiotic antics inspire all of Seattle - picketers cops the guys in the control room - to sing along. In ""Life""s most fascinating and dangerous moments Lanie interviews Deborah Connors a colleague who while absolutely not Ms. Walters herself is positively meant to suggest the celebrity journalist who famously gets her subjects to weep. As Deborah the unerring Stockard Channing steals the movie in her few short scenes - but not just because the actress is so superb. (Shes familiar with the territory having already played an anchor in ""Up Close."") Lanie zeros in for the kill on the woman who forged the path Lanie is no longer sure she wants to pursue. She humiliates Deborah forcing her to talk about the personal happiness she sacrificed for professional success. The political and emotional crimes committed in this one smug overheated exchange - upon the characters upon women upon all viewers chomping popcorn in theater seats - are as insidious as they are unexceptional They add up to emotional blackmail or something like it.
