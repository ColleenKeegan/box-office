"Hesher review A boy bonds with a grown-up Beavis |       NJ.com comments Hesher review A boy bonds with a grown-up Beavis Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 13 2011 at 807 AM View/Post Comments Wrekin Hill EntertainmentJoseph Gordon-Levitt as the colorful but overbearing title character of ""Hesher."" Its easy for an actor to fall in love with a character. But its one of the worst things a writer can do. In ""Hesher"" for example its clear that Joseph Gordon-Levitt loves embodying this protagonist. Hes a long-haired hard-bodied heavy-metal headbanger who tends to enter a scene cursing and exit it only after hes broken a few things. Hes fun to play and Gordon-Levitt plays the hell out of him. Except extreme characters are best used sparingly; put them in every scene and they eat up the oxygen. And thats the mistake filmmaker Spencer Susser makes. He lets Hesher be so constantly here -- and so consistently over-the-top -- that everything else fades away. Hesher enters the young TJs life at a critical juncture -- the tweens mother has just died his father is clinically depressed and the two of them are basically sleepwalking through life at his grandmothers. Heshers about to change all that. Movie Review Hesher (R) Wreckin Hill (105 min.) Directed by Spencer Susser. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Natalie Portman Rainn Wilson. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains strong language violence sexual situations nudity violence and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Because you see despite his homemade tats and rock-out tastes -- hes like Wayne and Garth and Beavis and Butthead combined grown old and gone mad -- Hesher is really an ancient dramatic character. He is the Trickster dropped into an enclosed world to stir things up. And dude is he going to stir some stuff up But the script requires enormous leaps of faith on our part. (I dont care how depressed you are no father is going to simply wave away his son bringing home a freeloading dope-smoking porn-watching violently antisocial 20-something ""friend."") Apart from Gordon-Levitt the best of the cast is Devin Brochu who plays the withdrawn sullen TJ. The rest hide behind props. Natalie Portman -- who now seems legally required to be in two movies a month -- puts on a pair of big plastic eyeglasses to pass as a geeky loser (it doesnt work). To indicate depression Rainn Wilson hides behind a beard. The venerable Piper Laurie asked for dottiness fluffs her thin hair out into a cumulous cloud and putters about in a housecoat. None of it is terribly convincing. Still the obvious culture clash is there and the movie seems to be heading toward one of two roads Either outright comedy (Hesher as the truth-telling antidote to conformity) or coming-of-age drama (Hesher as the initially attractive but definitely dangerous role model that TJ must learn to grow beyond). But then again the filmmaker loves this guy loves his danger. So despite scenes that show Hesher as a simple vandal or violent criminal Susser keeps treating him seriously and keeps bringing him back. And keeps presenting him as somebody we want to see and the family needs to hear even though neither is true. Gordon-Levitt is a sly and inventive actor and it can be genuinely fun to watch him having so much fun. But this character wears out his welcome fast. And when he finally stalks off leaving a Hesher Was Here graffiti in his wake all you can think is -- man what took you so long?

By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 13 2011 1201 a.m. ET If this is only a chick flick then call me a chick. Witty raunchy and affecting ""Bridesmaids"" crosses boundaries by blithely ignoring them. At one moment its a broad-gauge farce that examines sex from a womans point of view. (The findings are mixed at best.) At another its a sophisticated comedy of manners and class that pits two bridesmaids against each other for control of the wedding if not the brides destiny. Through it all--the free-form conversations the brilliant set pieces the preposterous gross-outs the flawless performances--Kristen Wiigs forlorn maid of honor Annie seeks her own destiny with a wrenchingly cockeyed passion. A womans point of view is one of the films great distinctions. The screenplay was written by Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo--both women are wise in the ways of improv as well as TV--and directed with extraordinary finesse by Paul Feig who created the TV series ""Freaks and Geeks."" As a man though Id say its greatest distinction is its inclusiveness and Im not using that sticky term to be PC. The filmmakers and their producer Judd Apatow see the comedy genre as including all sorts of quirks and qualities that make us human--effusiveness obtuseness tenderness fury delicacy idiocy eloquence. Their characters cannot stop talking. A bad thing? No a great thing because the talk is so smart. Theyve staged the best highway sobriety test since ""The Man With Two Brains"" turned baked goods to the best romantic advantage since ""Waitress."" And the movies Mr. Right couldnt be odder or righter. The bride Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is forlorn in her own way. She knows her impending marriage will distance her from Annie her best friend since childhood. She also knows that her wedding plans are being hijacked by the richest and pushiest of her bridesmaids the ethereally insufferable Helen (a beautifully measured performance by Rose Byrne). The Annie-Helen rivalry fuels much of the plot. It starts slowly and slyly at a celebratory party with rival speeches that keep on going and building and getting funnier. That seems to be the scripts organizing principle--first do this then add that then top it then push it a little higher and keep it going as long as theres something to build on. The result isnt organized all that well--a few scenes misfire and the whole thing goes on a bit too long. (The film might have done with less or with none of Annies grotesque English roommates; theyre built on nothing but arbitrary notions.) That said though the wonder is how often ""Bridesmaids"" reaches the heights and sustains the altitude. ENLARGE Kristen Wiigs Annie has a high old time on a plane in Bridesmaids. Universal Studios A sweetly ridiculous riff with a radar speed gun builds on repetition and expectation--how many cars will it take before...? (I cant resist describing some of this delicious stuff but Im not going to spoil it with details.) A tennis game turns savage. Belching forth from nowhere a gastric event grows too ghastly for words. A gathering of bridesmaids on a flight to Vegas out-airplanes ""Airplane"" as it rises to pure--and I use the word advisedly--pandemonium. Each bridesmaid has her daft appeal though none is as genuinely crazed--or outrageously entertaining--as Melissa McCarthys Megan a creature of formidable girth and unstoppable id. (Annies mother is played by the late Jill Clayburgh an actress and comedienne whose career constituted an anthology of lovely performances.) At the heart of the film is poor desperate Annie who lost the bakery she had opened just as the economy tanked and has yet to find herself as a fully functioning adult. Her car is a wreck though its a Lamborghini compared to her love life which centers on a smarmy Narcissus who treats her like a consumer product thats both disposable and renewable. (Its a tribute to the filmmakers verve that theyve kept the sex scenes funny--extremely funny--since what were seeing is sheer self-abasement.) Ms. Wiigs first starring role on the big screen is a sensation; how could it have taken so long? She is wistful but never tearful in the worst of Annies turmoil intensely likable without trying to be unfailingly interesting and in her big moments--one of which involves a giant cookie--a paragon of antic energy. Then theres the man behind the radar gun a cop named Rhodes whos played to perfection by Chris ODowd. (Its an inspired piece of casting.) ""The cop talks weird"" Annies Porsche-driving lover observes at one point and so he does. He talks with a pleasing accent Mr. ODowd is Irish. He speaks with gentle humor and unforced wisdom whether hes citing Annie for dysfunctional tail lights or confronting her to her confusion and dismay with indisputable evidence of her competence. Rhodes doesnt play a huge role in the proceedings but hes worth citing as evidence of the movies excellence. Heres a man written by women who is both a fantasy figure--this is wedding comedy after all not kitchen realism--and a convincingly endearing original. ""Bridesmaids"" gets at so many things with deceptive ease and startling skill--womens anger the loneliness of the single life the marriage trap the pain of sex along with the joy but also friendship sanity and a vision of love. Watch a clip from ""Hesher"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Rainn Wilson and Natalie Portman. Hesher Spencer Sussers debut feature stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a guardian demon who brings life to a bereaved household in what amounts to a long-running home invasion. Mr. Gordon-Levitt is a gifted young actor and a compelling presence in everything he does. In this title role of an outlaw vulgarian and very likely a nut job hes constantly in motion and you cant take your eyes off him. For all of Heshers extravagances though--his foul mouth his wild hair his runaway libido his fondness for heavy metal and his penchant for arson--he isnt particularly interesting not even when hes mentoring T.J. a newly motherless boy played touchingly by Devin Brochu. Thats not the actors fault. The problem lies in the role. Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality--social satirical psychological take your pick--Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy. Almost 80 years ago the peerless French filmmaker Jean Renoir used a similar notion in ""Boudu Saved From Drowning."" (Its readily available on DVD and I wouldnt be surprised if Mr. Susser has seen it.) Michel Simon was the scruffy bum--the protohippie really--who throws himself into the Seine and is saved by a Good Samaritan then turns his rescuers household upside down. But Boudu served Renoir as an instrument of social satire. Hesher serves Mr. Susser who wrote the screenplay with David Michod as not much more than an anxiety-making machine in a movie that otherwise depends on moist cliches (Rainn Wilsons lachrymose widower T.J.s puppy love for Natalie Portmans nebbishy loser) and life-affirming gestures (the movies climax) that feel like borrowings from MTV. The conspicuous exception to these cold calculations is Madeleine the indiscriminately loving grandmother played by my ex-wife Piper Laurie. Madeleine seems to be in the early stages of dementia; at one point she isnt sure if shes sitting in the dark. Everything about this old lady is enchantingly vague--the story she tells about baking a cake with a shortening called Fluffo the basis of her strong bond with Hesher--but nothing needs to be spelled out for Ms. Laurie turns uncertainty into poetry. Her calculation is to toss the calculator. Everything Must Go ENLARGE Will Ferrell as a troubled alcoholic in Everything Must Go based on the Raymond Carver story. Roadside Attractions/Everett Collection According to a screenwriting commonplace--a valid one--big sprawling novels can be rich sources for screenplays (""The Godfather"") while movies adapted from short stories (""The Swimmer"") run the risk of feeling thin. It may seem perverse to mention a film as deservedly obscure as ""The Swimmer"" in the context of Will Ferrells ambitious new vehicle but extreme examples can be illuminating. In that old Burt Lancaster film adapted from a John Cheever story an unhappy suburbanite re-examines his life in the course of swimming home in a succession of neighbors pools. Its nothing but a device and far from a good one. Dan Rush adapted ""Everything Must Go"" from a very short (1600 words) Raymond Carver story about a man sitting on his lawn surrounded by all the things of his life that hes getting rid of in a yard sale. Its a much better movie but still based on a single device and thin and repetitive for the same reason. Watch a clip of Will Ferrells latest movie Everything Must Go. Video courtesy of Roadside Attractions. Indeed its basically a one-man show thats short on conflict. Mr. Ferrells Nick Halsey is an alcoholic who finds himself jobless and then homeless--his wife has shut him out of their suburban house. Contemplating his life as he sits on his lawn in the midst of his worldly goods he has almost no one to talk to but his 12-step sponsor a local cop played by Michael Pena and a neighborhood kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace.) Another neighbor played by Rebecca Hall appears only sporadically and to negligible effect. It would be nice to report that Mr. Ferrell overcomes these dramatic obstacles. Hes a serious actor as well as a fine funnyman. (Check out his performance as a charmingly foolish actor in Woody Allens ""Melinda and Melinda."") But Mr. Rushs film functions for the most part in such a narrow emotional range--from sad through mournful to lugubrious with surprisingly few side trips to anger--that you keep rooting for its star to lighten up which he eventually does when its almost too late. From time to time the movie grabs you (though the music keeps repelling you). Taking stock and letting go--of superfluous things of worn-out love--is a strong theme. But the progression of the script is like Nicks self-help program. Were familiar with the steps. DVD FOCUS Knocked Up (2007) Judd Apatow has already had huge success as a writer-director as well as a producer in mating crowd-pleasing raunchiness with a generous spirit and genuine feeling. In this hit comedy the slob hero played by Seth Rogen hooks up at a bar with a gorgeous blonde played by Katherine Heigl. A few weeks after their drunken encounter (which is much more plausible than it sounds) shes pregnant and hes dumbfounded. But the movie which also features Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd is more than a celebration of slobness. Of all things its a paean to family values. Brick (2005) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Brendan a teenage detective in Rian Johnsons clever parody of film noir thats set in a contemporary California high school. Mr. Johnson has done his homework and he applies the lessons of the film-noir genre with a lively appreciation for atmosphere--Steve Yedlin did the elegant cinematography--and for the pleasures of film-culture clash. (""Bugsy Malone"" meets ""The Big Sleep."") Yet the principle is basically a distancing device--look at us here but imagine us being somewhere else--and the distance grows as the film rolls on. Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) When Will Ferrell plays funny few funnymen are funnier. After a wreck on a Nascar track Mr. Ferrells faux-legendary driver flees his car arms flailing wildly convinced that hes on fire. He isnt but the movie is. This mock-epic send-up of the inspirational sports-movie genre directed by Adam McKay from a script he and Mr. Ferrell wrote burns with a comic intensity that seems too high to be sustainable. Against all odds though the filmmaker and his exuberant cast pull it off right down to a ""Chariots of Fire"" climax. The cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen and John C. Reilly.

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Natalie Portman Director Spencer Susser Running time 142 Release Opened May 13 2011  Editorial Review Even a lout can do some goodBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 13 2011Bad role models sometimes make the most interesting movie characters.The ill-mannered unkempt foulmouthed and hot-tempered title character of ""Hesher"" is just such a walking contradiction. Although he lends his name to this dark and funny drama the long-haired tattooed loner (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is not the focal point of the film. Rather its T. J. Forney (Devin Brochu) a grieving middle-schooler who has lost his mother in a car accident. When the film opens T.J. is pretty much on his own with his father Paul (Rainn Wilson) stuck in a stupor of prescription medication and self-pity and his grandmother Madeleine (Piper Laurie never better) lost in a fog of incipient dementia.If T.J. is the films heart Hesher is just off-center moving through this cinematic universe in a cockeyed orbit that gives the story its offbeat energy and keeps the audience spellbound until the strange and strangely touching conclusion.When we first meet Hesher hes living in an abandoned building. After T.J. throws a rock through his window -- inadvertently bringing the attention of the police -- Hesher must find a new home. Soon hes set up camp in the Forneys garage.Before long Hesher is sharing Grandmas home-cooked meals at the kitchen table and offering his unsolicited services to T.J. as a twisted kind of big brother. Meaning that he is at once both savior -- from for example the local bully -- and tormentor in his own right.Perhaps the worst thing Hesher does in a long string of misdeeds is to betray T.J. by seducing a young grocery-store clerk named Nicole (Natalie Portman) who has taken the boy under her wing filling T.J. with feelings that are part filial and part lustful.The relationship between T.J. and Nicole is just one of several tender off-kilter relationships in ""Hesher."" None however is sweeter or more unexpected than the friendship that develops between Hesher and Madeleine. The scene in which he gently tutors her on the use of a bong -- as a way to cut the harshness of the medical marijuana she smokes for unspecified ailments -- is heartbreaking and funny.Make no mistake though Hesher is not the cliched crazy man with a heart of gold weve seen in far too many movies. (Robin Williams to the white courtesy phone) He is not lovable let alone likable despite a performance by Gordon-Levitt that makes it hard to take your eyes off him. Hesher is not a healer. Hes selfish immature impulsive and quite frankly dangerous. And to the movies great credit hes determined to stay that way. Over the course of the film he doesnt learn any valuable life lessons. And the one time he tries to offer one up -- in a drunken unprintable speech -- his attempt falls apart in an explosion of inarticulate rage punctuated by a beer can hurled at a wall. Hesher doesnt fix things; he breaks them.Which is in the end precisely what T.J. and his father need to knock them out of the emotional logjam theyve found themselves in.That drunken speech Hesher delivers? It culminates in the punch line ""one good nut"" the significance of which cannot be explained in a family newspaper. Trust me its a pretty hilarious line in context. But its also as it turns out a pretty accurate description of ""Hesher."" Contains frequent obscenity and sexual references drug use a brief sex scene violence and other forms of antisocial behavior some of which occurs in the presence of a minor child.

And now a reading from the book of Megadeth. In a more ideal world the heavy-metal angel played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt in ""Hesher"" would meet the simpering wuss he played in ""(500) Days of Summer"" and soundly horsewhip the latter with those twee parentheses that set off the 500 like a little picket fence. In the earlier movie cute lovers would achieve movie cuteness. Maybe theyd sneak into a neighbors backyard to use his pool In this delectably anarchic black comedy Hesher does use a pool uninvited. But he has the wit to fill the pool with lawn furniture and set the diving board on fire. Hesher violent of hair bare of chest black of jeans and sporting a large middle finger tattoo on his back (in case you get behind him) is a burnout who appears in the life of a miserable young boy (Devin Brochu) who is missing his mom. The boy is living in the past. His father (Rainn Wilson) a crumpled ex-man in sweatpants isnt living at all. Only the boys sweetly weird grandmother (Piper Laurie) appreciates the importance of the present although she is aided by what she calls ""medical cigarettes to help with the nausea."" WATCH EXCLUSIVE HESHER CLIP Sharing in the general gloom is a 15-hour-a-week grocery-store cashier (Natalie Portman) who cant afford the cost of a parking ticket. After she rescues the boy T.J. from a bully who forces him to dine on a used urinal cake T.J. launches a one-man charity drive on her behalf ""Nicoles parking ticket fund"" he writes on an envelope. It is perhaps the only problem in the movie that can really be solved. ""Hesher"" is a refreshingly original debut directed and co-written by Spencer Susser who correctly calls his hero a ""heavy-metal Mary Poppins."" It embraces some indie-movie cliches but mainly to rebuke them. Unlike many films that hope to be called black comedy it does not skimp on either the black or the comedy. This touching piece of advice is given in the presence of Grandma ""You should walk with your grandma. So she doesnt get raped."" There are assaults arson and theft of a porn channel all of it stupid and brilliant. Real-life Heshers -- seen snickering six inches off the boundary of high school smoking cigarettes and smashing bottles -- are best avoided during that brief period between the full flowering of their antisocial skills and their inevitable departure to prison or the military or maybe the grave. The screen Hesher though is a cosmic clown an imp of the perverse on a mission of the inappropriate. The movie does turn sentimental in the end yet this too is appropriately metal (it comes with a parable about a missing testicle sacrificed to the imperative of home explosives). And its no secret that the metal bands best number is often the big weepy ballad -- Motley Crues ""Home Sweet Home"" or Extremes ""More Than Words."" Sometimes the only response to despair and cruelty Hesher figures is to make things go boom. In some bizarro Book of Job Id like to see the poor slob fight back as colorfully as Hesher It wouldnt accomplish anything but it would at least show some freaking spirit.

Hesher is worse than bad BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 May 13 2011 (...) Natalie Portman stars as Nicole in Hesher. ""Hesher"" is the definition of a dubious achievement. For the rest of his life Spencer Susser can brag to the other ditch diggers that he persuaded two of the best young actors in Hollywood to star in one of the worst movies ever made.At his trial on fraud charges Susser may insist that he was ""pushing the envelope"" with an anarchic fantasy about seizing the day. But deliberate provocation is not a crime and in some cases its even honorable. The problem here is ineptitude. The characters are sketchy archetypes instead of believable people.The badly drawn boy is 13-year-old T.J. (Devin Brochu) whose mother was recently killed in a car crash. When T.J. directs his rage at the window of a vacant house it arouses a 20-something squatter named Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt with headbanger hair and the phoniest tattoos youve ever seen). Soon Hesher is living in the family garage virtually unnoticed by T.J.s grieving father (Rainn Wilson) but well-fed by the doddering grandma (Piper Laurie).Hesher poses as a protector to the bullied boy yet he almost gets T.J. arrested for a fiery crime he didnt commit and even strikes him with his satanic van. Inexplicably the boy never narcs on this psycho and neither does Nicole (poor Natalie Portman) a plain-Jane grocery clerk who gets sucked into Heshers hateful orbit.The message that these repressed people need someone like Hesher to wake them up is loud but never clear. Does Susser think its a breakthrough when T.J. attacks a classmate with a bolt cutter or when nice-girl Nicole sleeps with the scumbag whod abandoned her at a house he torched? Only a cretinous wannabe hipster would expect us to believe -- let alone cheer -- that a Pabst-swilling shirtless intruder is allowed to wheel a casket from a funeral and down a crowded street. When the blessed credits finally roll the first thing Susser shows us is Heshers tattoo of a raised middle finger.Backatcha dude.

(Merrick Morton) Joe Neumaier Friday May 13 2011 400 AM Title Hersher At a future date when some grad student writes a thesis on Wild Men of the Subconscious in Popular Culture there will certainly be a special place for Hesher. Just as long as it stays there and is never in front of my eyes again.A self-consciously flip comedy-drama that grounds its trite emotions in Deep Meaningful Grief Hesher begins with T.J. (Devin Brochu) a 1980s middle schooler and his disheveled father (Rainn Wilson) reeling from the car-crash death of his mom months earlier. Then along comes Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a mangy-maned ill-mannered foul-mouthed heavy metal pyromaniac with a middle finger tattooed on his back and what may as well be a sandwich board on him proclaiming Life Lessons by Iron John.A squatter without a place to live Hesher first shows up in T.J.s school before clomping half-naked into his house. Soon hes dragging T.J. and his dad out of their morose habits and even seems to romance a dorky grocery store clerk (Natalie Portman in her sixth film in six months but at least back in Garden State mode).Yes that was seems to romance because despite everyone interacting with him including T.J.s elderly grandma (Piper Laurie) Hesher is surely an imaginary character in search of a movie. One is almost tempted to give the hairy hoary guy a pass because Gordon-Levitt as usual goes at the performance full-throttle and with total conviction.But any way you slice it writer-director Spencer Sussers movie is bad company full of wanna-be-outrageous anecdotes from the fringe. Those anecdotes contain like the simple beat-beat of a drum some nuts of wisdom for the emotionally burned men in the movie.Outside the movie however theyll just drive you nuts.

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Devin Brochu and Natalie Portman. Directed by Spencer Susser. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a reason everyone in ""Hesher"" puts up with Hesher that no one calls the cops on him no one challenges him no one questions the wisdom of his observations and no one tries to kill him while hes asleep. The reason - and there is only one reason - is that the movie is called ""Hesher."" He is the central character and the other characters onscreen seem to know it. But wait. The other characters cant know theyre in a movie can they? So it must be that they defer to this violent freeloading slob who has nothing going for him but a superior attitude because its convenient for the filmmaker. If they didnt - if people in ""Hesher"" treated the title character as anyone would in life - they would put distance between themselves and him and the movie would come to a grinding halt in five minutes. That would be a good thing. ""Hesher"" is about as awful as independent films get a mix of ugliness and unearned sentiment with a flat story repellent and pathetic characters and dialogue that consists of lots of stammering and cursing. A nasty little boy (Devin Brochu) lives with his father (Rainn Wilson) and grandmother in the recent aftermath of his mothers death. The father has become a zombie with grief Granny (Piper Laurie nice to see her) is sick and into this power vacuum comes Hesher a long-haired thug who bullies his way into the house and stays there smoking eating their food and threatening people. Its hard to say if writer-director Spencer Susser intends that we find this situation compelling or amusing. My suspicion is that hell take what he can get. One might call the world of ""Hesher"" depressing if the movie were effective enough to incite that emotion. Better to say that its bleak without relief but also without compelling or truthful observation. Were offered a series of repugnant situations and unspecific cliched interactions and were expected to feel something besides impatience. Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to relish playing a character with such power over his environment but the character is fundamentally empty. Natalie Portman - how did they get her for this? Impressive - plays a part-time supermarket cashier who is so broke that a parking ticket is an occasion for panic (and she doesnt even live in San Francisco). The filmmaker gives Portman nothing to do but act nervous and vague and talk as if shed misplaced about 30 IQ points. Portman scholars of the 22nd century will find this a curious entry. -- Advisory This film contains strong language sexual situations and violence. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Hesher Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review HesherSpencer Sussers film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a metal-head who disrupts a mourning family.May 13 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in ""Hesher."" (Merrick Morton Wrekin...)Joseph Gordon-Levitt isnt playing an uninvited guest so much as a manifestation of chaotic grief in ""Hesher"" told from the point of view of a 13-year-old boy (Devin Brochu) whose struggle to overcome the sudden death of his mother is upended by the imposed arrival of the titular character. Gordon-Levitts long-haired chain-smoking often-shirtless metal-head squatter and his prankishly profanely violent antics initially go unremarked on by young TJs catatonic father (Rainn Wilson) and lonely grandmother (Piper Laurie). But they eventually serve as a wake-up call to the whole household that any kind of action is more emotionally healing than inaction. Its not the most complex message a movie about mourning could offer and at times ""Hesher"" flirts with being the type of misery parade as taxing in indies as relentless sunniness is in studio movies. But director Spencer Susser who wrote the film with David Michod has a kinetic filmmaking style and an impish crash-and-burn sense of humor that keeps sentiment at bay long enough to let us appreciate the loose uncomplicated performances from a cast that includes suddenly ubiquitous Oscar winner Natalie Portman as a cash-strapped store clerk who befriends TJ. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAfter a false start Hesher is ready to rockMay 13 2011A ripe season of celluloidMay 1 2011Hesher is a work in progressJanuary 17 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentJoseph Gordon LevittJoseph Gordon-levittCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-hesher-review-20110513,0,5931682.story",200,hesher8,hesher,latimes

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Those of us who are members of the Joseph Gordon-Levitt Fan Club -- and we are anonymous but many -- are in for a body blow with his title performance in ""Hesher. Heres that nice young man from ""Brick and ""(500) Days of Summer the actor who quietly put ""Inception in his pocket and walked away with it and he looks like every mothers worst nightmare. The stringy hair the home-brewed tattoos the mind-bogglingly filthy anecdotes that start and stop with no warning a preference for tighty-whities and nothing else -- Hesher is either a walking id or Jesus Christ returned to earth as a headbanger.Its a fearsome and giddily unhinged performance in a movie that isnt entirely sure what to do with it. In every other respect ""Hesher is a tamped-down independent film about loss in the wastelands of Los Angeles. The central character T.J. (Devin Brochu) is a 10-year-old boy whose mother has recently died in a car crash and whose father (Rainn Wilson) has sunk into a hole of grief in the couch. The kids on his own -- school is a minefield of bullies and Grandma (Piper Laurie) drifts more than she used to -- until he breaks a window in an abandoned house and Hesher charges through the door like a summoned-up demon. Its a genuinely startling appearance not unlike Isabella Rossellini materializing naked on the lawn in ""Blue Velvet.Is Hesher for real? A figment of T.J.s damaged imagination? Other people can see him -- once he moves in Hesher and Grandma strike up a rather sweet friendship of nostalgia and four-letter words -- but his way of showing up at exactly the right/wrong moments in the boys life suggests a more unearthly predisposition. Hes a grubby freewheeling Puck in both the Shakespearean and MTV senses roaming the open roads in a crap-brown van and looking for souls to save and unsettle.Its just that Heshers style of life-coaching is a little unortho dox involving as it does blowing up cars in peoples driveways. Gordon-Levitt gives the character some of the dry semi-comic thoughtfulness he brings to other roles and that gap between detachment and overkill can be explosively funny. Heshers a logical anarchist.But everyone is repressed in this movie except the title character. As the father Wilson valiantly turns down his comic impulses to zero and the legendary Laurie portrays a woman who has come to terms with a lifetime of disappointment. Natalie Portman shows up as a sad little supermarket checkout clerk who becomes T.J.s crush and the object of Heshers leers and while the actress tries to hide her glamour under the bushel of indie realism its a losing battle.Director-cowriter Spencer Susser is the sole American member of the Australian collective Blue Tongue Films but he shares with David Michod (""Animal Kingdom) and the Edgerton brothers (""The Square) an interest in aggro male behavior amid bland washed-out settings. To his credit he doesnt leave much room for sentiment in the relationship between Hesher and T.J. The kid is rightly frightened of his demented mentor and the point may be that any emotion fear included is preferable to being uncomfortably numb.Id even argue that Brochu gives the trickier more subtle performance as a child who has lost all faith with the world yet still tries to make it through the day. Gordon-Levitt by contrast soars on fumes of invention and absurdity. Because hes a gracious actor as well as a good one he makes sure we have almost as high a time as hes having.

Share Tweet In Hesher Natalie Portman plays a sad-sack in mom-jeans whose greatest ambition is to secure 20 hours a week at the grocery store where she toils vacant-eyed and numb for 15 hours a week. That pathetic goal remains forever outside her grasp however so she asks Devin Brochu a sad little boy she has befriended whats wrong with her. Is she not attractive enough to score five more hours a week? Is her personality somehow lacking? Beautiful movie stars often play forgettable-looking losers but Hesher loudly broadcasts its contempt for verisimilitude in ways that go far beyond casting one of the most beautiful women in the world as a forgettable slip of a human being. Part of this is deliberate. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the title character as a trickster slacker-god with a sweet-ass van a dude whose actions deliberately defy understanding. Thats ostensibly what makes him interesting. Whats everyone elses excuse? In a performance that makes excessive demands on his rock-star charisma and offbeat sexuality Gordon-Levitt plays a mysterious drifter who perambulates forcefully into the lives of Brochu; haunted pill-popping dad Rainn Wilson; and grandmother Piper Laurie. Then he refuses to leave. In a sour realm ruled by inertia and apathy Gordon-Levitt functions as a catalyst and inveterate upsetter even though his ambitions and motivations remain cryptic. What does he want? Where does he come from? Director Spencer Susser appears too intoxicated by the title character to risk peering beyond the enigmatic surface for fear of losing some of his mystery as mystery is all Hesher has. The film stacks the deck by making everyone around Gordon-Levitt so sad and gray that he cant help but pop with color and life by comparison; hes pure sex but itd take more than his aggressive swagger to rouse the film from its despondent stupor. A single image defines Heshers busy emptiness Brochu and Portman looking on glumly as Gordon-Levitt jumps from a flaming trampoline into a strangers pool. Its all quirk posturing attitude and needless exertion signifying nothing beyond its own sad need to impress.

"Hesher chokes on its bitterness - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Hesher chokes on its bitterness By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Spoiler alert Heshers final scene is an obscene gesture aimed directly at the moviegoer. Wrekin Hill Entertainment Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the socially irredeemable title character in Hesher. EnlargeClose Wrekin Hill Entertainment Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the socially irredeemable title character in Hesher. If you consider getting flipped the bird to be cutting-edge filmmaking youre going to love Hesher an homage to self-loathing taken out on others. If youre less impressed by shock for shocks sake youre onto something. Dipped in grief and devoid of anything resembling heart Hesher is not the kind of house guest you want dropping by. Played with glassy-eyed defiance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt Hesher enjoys trying to kill cops punching widowers and hitting kids with his van for laughs. As the films ads tout Heshers favorite things include ""loud music. Porn. Burning (expletive) to the ground."" So be it. Lets start with Hesher. Its hard to recall a movie with a protagonist as despicable as our title character a rebel without a pause and apparently clean clothes. Unshaven greasy and sporting a mane of stringy black hair Hesher looks like a stoner Jesus and is the antithesis of Levitts lovelorn suitor in (500) Days of Summer. Hesher  1/2 out of four Stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt Natalie Portman Rainn Wilson Director Spencer Susser Distributor Wrekin Hill Entertainment Rating PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and some drug material Running time 1 hour 42 minutes In select cities Friday An actor though is all those two films share. The movie opens with teenage T.J. (Devin Brochu) bicycling behind a tow truck carrying the wrecked car in which his mother died. When T.J. crashes his bike in the chase he chucks a rock through an abandoned house where Hesher is squatting. The incident triggers a wave of illogic that undoes the premise. Hesher needs a new home so he invades T.J.s house daring grieving father Paul (Rainn Wilson) and spacey grandmother Madeleine (Piper Laurie) to evict him. Natalie Portman plays Nicole a downtrodden cashier intrigued by Hesher and his young flunky. Somewhere in the original script there may have been a redeeming theme to Hesher a message that to live life you must embrace death. But thats lost in a parade of scenes meant simply to startle T.J. drops F-bombs on his dad; Hesher sets fire to his uncles pool home just because; bullies force victims to eat school urinal cakes. Its unflinching stuff and might have worked if there were a reason for any of it. Levitt Portman and Wilson work hard to infuse the film with some likeability. But Hesher (a slang term for mulleted miscreants) doesnt bother explaining things like motive. Suffice to say the kids are mad as hell and theyre not going to take it anymore. The same could go for viewers. Theres an effective next-to-last scene but its overwhelmed by the bitterness that precedes and follows it. Speaking of that middle-finger finale there is one redeeming trait At least it signals the end credits. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

More about Hesher >> Tonally all-over-the-place with a long-haired muscled-up seriously tattooed Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the title role writer-director Spencer Sussers meditation on loss and living and the latent humanity of a profane heavy-metal diehard is mostly notable for the appearance of screen veteran Piper Laurie - bravely assessing the role of a borderline senile senior. Gloom hangs in the air of the ill-lit litter-strewn Forney home. As Hesher begins the schoolkid T.J. (Devin Brochu) is on his bike furiously chasing after a tow-truck thats taking the family car away. Turns out its the car that T.J.s mother died in. His father who was behind the wheel at the time of the crash is played by The Offices Rainn Wilson acting shell-shocked and depressed in a manner far more conspicuous than it should be. Enter Hesher whos a squatter at a construction site and blames T.J. for being discovered and displaced. So he stalks the boy glares menacingly at him in school and then follows him through the working-class corridors of this Southern California community back to the Forney household. Dad just lies there zombielike on the couch and Grandma (Laurie) putters about as if nothing is wrong trying to get someone to accompany her for a walk. Smoking boozing burning stuff down and looking nothing like the sweet greeting-card designer and architecture buff he was in (500) Days of Summer Gordon-Levitt is so committed to his portrayal of this ungracious fellow that the effort shows. Natalie Portman whose production company guided the earnestly edgy indie to fruition takes a stab at supermarket cashier (shades of Jennifer Aniston in The Good Girl) wearing dorky glasses and a sad face and getting both the kid and Hesher to fall for her. Hesher has its genuinely affecting scenes but too much of the time it feels false and shallow. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments click to enlarge Hesher Rated R  100 minutes  2011 In this corrosive domestic drama a young boy whos bullied at school (Devin Brochu) loses his mom in a car crash then suffers the neglect of his depressed father (Rainn Wilson) and spacey grandmother (Piper Laurie). When a mysterious stranger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) abruptly takes up residence with the family one wonders at first if this violent foul-mouthed headbanger is some supernatural manifestation of the hapless kids rage. Things blow up in short order as the new roomie torches property puts the moves on a supermarket cashier the boy adores (Natalie Portman) and leads him into harms way. Writer-director Spencer Susser and cowriter David Michod (Animal Kingdom) generate fresh hells at a surreally rapid clip but cop out with an incongruously sentimental ending.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a crackpot guardian angel in Hesher - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Out of nowhere comes a welcome swift kickHesher a 3 starsMay 12 2011|By Colin Covert McClatchy/Tribune NewsJoseph Gordon-Levitt is a dirtbag heavy-metal nihilist named Hesher.T.J. needs a friend. His mom has just died in a traffic accident. His dad Paul has withdrawn into a haze of tranquilizers and group-therapy blather. His grandma is kind but housebound. The school bully likes pushing him facedown onto urinal cakes. The woman in his life Nicole a nice 20-something grocery clerk with self-esteem issues cant fathom that a 13-year-old could have a life-and-death crush on her. T.J. needs a friend. But what he gets is a dirtbag heavy-metal nihilist named Hesher. Its his lucky day sort of. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is riveting as the title character an ambiguous intriguing mentor/menace. We never learn a thing about this lank-haired hot-tempered force of nature. He shows up whenever T.J. is feeling especially stressed like Charlie Mansons notion of a guardian angel. From Heshers first scene when he is being rousted out of the abandoned housing project where he squats and he casually throws a homemade bomb at the security guard in retaliation his dont-give-a-damn credentials are indisputable. Hes not T.J.s bodyguard. When the boy gets roughed up in the school lavatory Hesher just looks on disgusted that T.J. wont stick up for himself. Hes not a source of street-smart advice; his ramblings sound as if theyre going to resolve into parables then they turn out to be stoner shaggy dog yarns. Still for T.J. floundering in a swamp of loss at the beginning of adolescence a blast of rebellious male energy is what the doctor ordered. Hugs cant teach you everything. Writer/director Spencer Susser deserves credit for pushing the coming-of-age story in the direction of black comedy. Like a long-lost big brother who just made parole Hesher is as likely to maul T.J. taunt him or smack him for smarting off as to stand up for him. But it isnt child abuse; its a variant of the rough play you see in wildlife documentaries. In the process of toughening up T.J. Hesher scars the kid a bit but leaves him more healed than he found him. You can read the story as a psychological fable with T.J. as the questing ego Hesher as the uninhibited id and Paul as the disapproving controlling superego all learning to cooperate. Or you can just kick back and take it on the level of a wild gritty slyly funny Los Angeles fable Mary Poppins meets Charles Bukowski. The cast is noteworthy. Rainn Wilson plays Paul straight and sad; Natalie Portman (who produced the film) is touching as geeky cashier Nicole; John Carroll Lynch is gruff but human as the auto-junkyard owner who becomes T.J.s adversary; and Piper Laurie is a gust of pure weary love as the boys grandmother. Devin Brochu gives the much-battered T.J. the right mix of stubborn pride and wounded self-pity. And Gordon-Levitt is stellar as the anarchic tattooed metalhead. His character will stick with you leaving an impression as raw and visceral as a cigarette burn.

Hey Old Lady Hey Old Lady Credit Wrekin Hill Witnessing An Accident Witnessing An Accident Credit Wrekin Hill Dirty And Wet Dirty And Wet Credit Wrekin Hill When parents talk about someone whod be a bad influence for their children theyre basically talking about Hesher. This 20-something vagrant played as an anarchic overgrown wild child by Joseph Gordon-Levitt wears his hair long and greasy. Hes got a middle-finger tattoo in the small of his back and he exhibits a pronounced fondness for drugs pornography and blowing things up. All of which strange as it may seem makes him exactly what 12-year-old T.J. and his family need in their lives. Which is lucky because after T.J. accidentally gets Hesher kicked out of a house in which hed been squatting Hesher follows him home and without so much as word of introduction moves into the garage strips to his briefs tosses the rest of his clothes in the laundry and settles down to watch TV. Normally youd expect T.J.s dad to call the police but this family isnt entirely functional at present. Just two months earlier they lost T.J.s mom -- the circumstances will be revealed later -- and now Dad is being medicated for depression. Granny isnt really all there even on good days. And the path of least resistance is simply to set another place at the table so T.J. realizes pretty quickly that like it or not Hesher is now part of his life -- albeit an entirely inappropriate part. Now in most movies this would be the moment when the anarchic wild-child starts to develop a protective side helping the family deal with its trauma. In this case Dad could use a wake-up call and T.J. could use help dealing with a school bully. But Hesher doesnt much care about their problems. Bullying interests him only insofar as it gives him an excuse to set fire to a bullys sports car. (Which it does.) When T.J. develops a crush on a supermarket cashier Hesher urges him to ... well lets just say everything he urges is inappropriate the mildest thing he suggests being that they should stalk the object of T.J.s affection as she drives home from work. Thats what theyre doing when she plows absentmindedly into a stopped car. Hesher naturally leaps into the ensuing argument defending her honor by claiming the other car backed into her. Soon hes shuttling her and T.J. to a strangers backyard pool for a victory swim setting fire to the diving board and abandoning them to deal with the police. i Hesher enourages T.J. (Devin Brochu left) to chase after -- some might say stalk -- a local supermarket cashier (Natalie Portman). Merrick Morton/Wrekin Hill hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/Wrekin Hill Hesher enourages T.J. (Devin Brochu left) to chase after -- some might say stalk -- a local supermarket cashier (Natalie Portman). Merrick Morton/Wrekin Hill Director Spencer Susser doesnt try to make Hesher anything other than a sociopath -- a walking profanity-spewing id -- and to his credit neither does Gordon-Levitt. The last time movie audiences saw this actor in Inception he was weightless and adrift in a dream state. Here youd have to say hes adrift again but in a decidedly more down-to-earth sense. Few young actors have been so enviably hard to pigeonhole; hes played a gay hustler in Mysterious Skin a wide-eyed innocent in 500 Days of Summer a businesslike dream-weaver in Inception and now an anarchic oddball with no backstory. No front-story either really. Theres barely a plot for him to work with in Hesher and though there are some relatively big names attached -- The Offices Rainn Wilson as T.J.s dad Piper Laurie as granny Natalie Portman as the cashier -- nobody besides Hesher and T.J. actually has much to do. Perhaps because Gordon-Levitt was a child star himself in 3rd Rock From the Sun hes got a nifty sort of anti-rapport with Devin Brochus T.J. They spend the whole movie sparring with and startling each other never acknowledging that a weird bond is forming between headbanger and middle-schooler. Its the kind of relationship youd never allow if you had any say in their lives but its intriguing to watch how it transforms a film about loss and grief into a surprising anarchic and occasionally rollicking misfit movie -- one in which being a misfit for once doesnt seem such a bad fit.

Hesher whose arrival on screen is almost always heralded by a demonic speed-metal riff is a delinquent sociopath with a heart of gold. Thats the false rather cloying concept behind this smug indie dud and its made all the more irksome by Gordon-Levitts one-note show-offy Keanu-from-hell performance. As the checkout girl everyones got a crush on Natalie Portman makes a winsome return to her Garden State gawkiness.

The titular tattooed pyromaniac (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) crashes the grotty L.A. home of Paul Forney (Rainn Wilson) after a tussle with the latters bullied teenage son T.J. (Devin Brochu) and stirs up the grief and resentment simmering there from a recent family tragedy. T.J.s live-in grandmother (Piper Laurie) and a do-gooder grocery clerk (Natalie Portman) try to shake father and son from their mutual funk but only the expulsive potty-mouthed metal-head makes a dent. Sussers take on this venerable subgenre--think Teorema without the politics or a lactation-free Visitor Q both of which Susser seems to be referencing here--excels at dodging the question of whether Hesher is flesh and blood or a pubescent misfits cheaply menacing id-phantom but lets the raw surprise of Heshers first third bog down in knotty plotting to the point of self-parody (the slo-mo climax is especially awkward). Still Hesher finds uncommon sympathy for people at loose ends and although Hesher himself is sentimentalized and backhandedly inspiring he never softens into an actual role model. For better or worse he remains what he is--and if theres a lesson here (and rest assured there is) its that life typically offers few other options.

A badass loner employs his own peculiarly noxious ways of pulling a boy out of paralyzing grief in ""Hesher."" Debuting director Spencer Susser redeems his willfully antisocial central character via a climactic act of charity bordering on love but prior to that goes out of his way to spike every scene with gratuitous provocations and repetitive vulgarities that become old very quickly. Still the violent anarchist with a giant upraised middle finger tattooed on his back played with manifest enthusiasm by Joseph Gordon-Levitt will appeal to more than a few young males giving this indie with 22 producers a good shot at an active commercial life. ""Hesher"" is far from the first picture to make something of its own from the basic premise of Jean Renoirs ""Boudu Saved from Drowning"" that being the invasion of a household by a wayward unstoppable transformative force of nature. Here the interloper is a Charles Manson lookalike with a tat on his chest of a guy blowing his brains out who without benefit of an invitation plunks himself down in a modest San Fernando Valley home whose occupants are suffocating with the depression of mourning. Prepubescent T.J. (Devin Brochu) goes through the motions of attending school but is obsessed with retrieving from salvage the car in which his mother died in a wreck two months earlier. Dad (Rainn Wilson) has turned into a vegetable while Grandma (Piper Laurie) is at least able to put food into the mouths of the sad dysfunctional males. In a particularly grating subplot little T.J. is violently bullied for unknown reasons by a much bigger boy and Dads half-hearted effort to participate with his son in ""transformational grief therapy"" washes out. In this menagerie of emotional zombies Hesher has free rein. Physically threatening and scarily temperamental the long-haired heavy-metal freak lounges around in his underwear watches porn fills the house with variations on the F-word and soon gets T.J. in enough trouble to land him at the police station. Never supplied with an ounce of backstory Hesher is a hyperactive volcano that erupts several times daily; whatever the reasons he betrays no trace of giving a damn about anyone or anything. One vaguely bright spot in T.J.s life is a literally accidental relationship he forms with impoverished grocery cashier Nicole (co-producer Natalie Portman sporting outsized Sarah Palin-style glasses that give her a queasily strong resemblance to -- Sarah Palin). Typically Hesher spoils the budding friendship by meanly badgering the boy about when hes going to make it sexual while in his spare time giving Grandma pointers on how to use a bong. Young auds who reflexively find this sort of flagrant transgressiveness amusing will no doubt take the picture to heart. But the problem with the script by Susser and David Michod working from a story by Brian Charles Frank is that Heshers uncouth behavior is so aggressively pushed to single-minded crudely exploitative effect. The ending is meant to have made the ordeal all worth it but while the payoff does possess a certain purgative effect akin to the benefits of tough love the value of the journey for the audience as opposed to the characters is highly questionable. Levitt in a flamboyant about-face from ""500 Days of Summer"" is undeniably charismatic as the from-nowhere wild man whom youd never want to meet in real life but who is memorable after a fashion onscreen. An appealing blond kid Brochu holds his own and then some as he gets into innumerable physical and verbal scrapes. Tech package is OK with colors in the interiors overly subdued even for the sought-after mood.
