However NPRs Bob Mondello says it wears a little thin. MELISSA BLOCK host With nearly 100 films competing for summer box office dollars Hollywood studios choose their opening date battles very carefully. Last week the Adam Sandler comedy Click had the weekend virtually to itself. Next week moviegoers will duck the firepower of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest. But this week despite the fact that Superman Returns is soaring over the competition on some 4000 screens another film opens on close to 3000 screens. Its a comedy about the fashion industry specifically aimed at women. Its called The Devil Wears Prada. Bob Mondello says its not quite ready to wear. BOB MONDELLO reporting If youre telling a Cinderella story you need a good wicked stepmother and The Devil Wears Prada has Meryl Streep playing Miranda Priestly. Shes the demanding hard-driving editor of the fashion magazine Runway. And she enters the film at full stride terrorizing her staff. (Soundbite of The Devil Wears Prada) Ms. MERYL STREEP (as Miranda Priestly) I dont understand why its so difficult to confirm an appointment. Unidentified Woman I know. Im sorry Miranda. I actually did confirm - Ms. STREEP Tales of your incompetence do not interest me. Tell Simone Im not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the Brazilian layout. I asked for clean athletic smallish. She sent me dirty tired and paunchy. And RSVP yes to Michael Korrs party. I want the driver to drop me off at 930 and pick me up at 945 sharp. And then call Natalie at Glorias Foods and tell her no for the fortieth time no. I dont want (unintelligible). I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. Then call my ex-husband and remind him - MONDELLO Once wicked stepmother is in place enter Cinderella here called Andy Sachs and played by Anne Hathaway as a fresh out of college crusading journalist interviewing a bit cluelessly for the job of Mirandas assistant. (Soundbite of The Devil Wears Prada) Ms. ANNE HATHAWAY (as Andy Sachs) Basically its this or Auto Universe. Ms. STREEP So you dont read Runway? Ms. HATHAWAY No. Ms. STREEP And before today you had never heard of me? Ms. HATHAWAY No. Ms. STREEP And you have no style or sense of fashion. Ms. HATHAWAY Well um I think that depends on what your - Ms. STREEP No no. That wasnt a question. MONDELLO Andy gets the job despite the interview and when she spills something at lunch is taken under the wing of a fairy godmother of sorts named Nigel. (Soundbite of The Devil Wear Prada) Mr. STANLEY TUCCI (as Nigel) Oh never mind. Im sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from. Ms. HATHAWAY You think my clothes are hideous I get it. But Im not going to be in fashion forever so I dont really see the point of changing everything about myself just because I have this job. Mr. TUCCI Yes thats true. Thats surely what this multibillion-dollar industry is all about anyway isnt it? Inner beauty. MONDELLO Could there be a business more ripe for satire than the fashion industry - outside of Hollywood I mean? In both cases - fashion and Hollywood - the product is by design unnecessary but entertaining. The people making the product are by nature talented but obsessed with the superficial. The public face of both cultures is beautiful. The backstabbing behind the scenes less so. Its a marriage made in heaven no? So why does the movie feel so toothless? Well partly because director David Franco hails from TV sitcoms and cant shake their rhythms. Partly because hes trying to turn Anne Hathaway - whos been groomed to look like Julia Roberts - into Mary Tyler Moore. And partly because hes way too fond of fashion montages. But the bigger problem is that his Cinderella is really hard to root for. To get ahead in a business she sneers at she abandons her friends disses her father mistreats her lover double crosses a coworker and generally turns into a shrew. Hathaway has a nice smile. But even with Streep stealing the picture from her at every possible opportunity it doesnt take long before the Devil Wears Prada wears a little thin. Im Bob Mondello. Copyright (c) 2006 NPR.

Comments The Devil Wears Prada Lauren Weisbergers best-selling novel about a young woman losing her soul at a New York fashion magazine has been turned into an agreeably shallow comedy by director David Frankel a veteran of HBOs equally status-driven Entourage and Sex and the City. Meryl Streep walks away with the movie as the harshly unforgiving editor of a Vogue-like glossy; Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) makes a lovely mannequin as her downtrodden new assistant a Medill grad who trades her journalistic ideals for an endless series of smashing outfits. I didnt believe the moralism of the story arc for a second but obviously some sort of hanger was required. With Stanley Tucci Simon Baker Emily Blunt and Adrian Grenier. PG-13 109 min. By J.R.

But can she put up with the jobs incessant ridiculous demands without going native? The Devil Wears Prada is based on Lauren Weisbergers roman-a-clef about her spell at Vogue a blinkered but scathing rejection of fashmagland transformed by Aline Brosh McKennas script into an aspirational Manhattanite fairy-tale about an ugly duckling who goes to the ball but learns theres no place like home. Its far from perfect - a romantic subplot featuring a smoothie writer and the contrived third-act jeopardy at Paris Fashion Week are both duff - but its often very funny especially Streeps Priestly. She combines stringent expectations with infuriating vagueness and disappointment at the perennial incompetence of those around her. Still the whole thing is humbug a giant ad for the industry it affects to critique; any notion that it would be otherwise went out the window when the director of Sex and the City was given the gig. The dodgy cable-knit polymixes and reckless carb consumption that initially mark Andy out are madeover street crossings become her catwalks and reaching a size four marks a triumph. Sure she jacks it in to work for a community newspaper but when you can wheel on Valentino to croon over the creation with which hes just fabulised Streep-Priestly few 12-year-old girls will be leaving the cinema sighing Yes Let me at that rent-fixing scandal By Ben Walters Posted Tuesday October 3 2006 Details Release details Rated PG Release date Thursday October 5 2006 Duration 109 mins Cast and crew Director David Frankel Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna Cast Adrian GrenierAnne HathawayStanley TucciEmily BluntMeryl StreepSimon Baker Users say (9) 5 out of 5 stars Average User Rating4.8 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star44 star13 star02 star01 star0LiveReviews|91 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshNov 3 2012John CooperFeaturedTerrific acting a sharp script and superb direction and editing make this a classic movie.

"Devil Wears Prada The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; devil-wears-prada-the ) Devil Wears Prada The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Devil Wears Prada is two films in one a caustic energetic satire of the fashion world and a cautionary melodrama. The first works; the second doesnt. Fortunately the running time of the former doubles that of the latter making The Devil Wears Prada more of a hit than a miss. In fact even through some of the weaker parts there are still strong performances by standouts Meryl Streep Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci. The novel by Lauren Weisberger stirred the interest of the fashion industry and fashion-watchers and caused many readers to play the game of trying to match fictional representations with their real-life counterparts. For those who arent members of the fashion inner circle the satire is obvious but some of its targets may not be. That doesnt diminish the enjoyability of the film which is relentless in its cynical attitude toward a culture obsessed with style and an industry that wallows in self-importance. Christopher Guest is one of a few directors who can allow satire to exist without the benefit of window dressing but this isnt one of Guests productions. Hollywood films - and The Devil Wears Prada is a member of that group - require characters and story arcs. Thats where the film gets into trouble. For about 70 minutes it bubbles along lobbing grenades at various targets and tossing in multiple montages. Then the film gets serious. Its trite message - be true to yourself and your friends - rings false and the cloying ending feels like it was written for another film then tacked onto the end of this one. When The Devil Wears Prada downshifts in tone from satire to melodrama its an uneven and unwelcome transition. Suddenly the qualities that make the first two-thirds such sparkling entertainment evaporate. The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) a recently graduated journalism major who is applying for the job of second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) the editor of Runway magazine. Runway is the most influential fashion magazine in the industry and no one wields more power than Miranda. She is revered as a goddess by co-workers and competitors alike. Get a job working for her and stick it out for a year and countless doors will open. This is what Mirandas current 1 assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) is counting on. Others like Nigel (Stanley Tucci) have become fixtures at Runway while waiting for their dream job to materialize. When it comes to fashion Andy has none. She is a size six (""Six is the new fourteen"" quips Nigel) and wears frumpy clothing. Miranda hires her on a whim hoping that Andys smarts will compensate for her lack of dress sense. Its not a promising beginning. Andy despises the shallowness of those who work at Runway and ridicules them to her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and her friends. Then something starts to happen. Like Anakin Skywalker Andy is seduced by the dark side of the force and becomes a loyal subject to Emperor Miranda. Its amazing how much more alive the film is when its concentrating on Andys job. Her personal life and out-of-work relationships are boring. Theres irony here because the films ultimate message is that no business is so important that it should trump interpersonal interests yet The Devil Wears Prada comes alive within the walls of the Runway building. I wonder if director David Frankel (an HBO veteran who has helmed episodes of Entourage and Sex in the City) is aware of the mixed message his film is delivering. Anne Hathaway gives a vanilla performance. She has little presence and tends to blend in with the scenery. Despite being the supposed lead she is upstaged by supporting performers. Meryl Streep gets top billing but has less screen time; nevertheless her humanized Cruella De Vil dominates scenes. Emily Blunt who made an impression in My Summer of Love is rarely outshone nor is Stanley Tucci. When Streep Blunt and Tucci are together the scene crackles with energy. When none of them are present The Devil Wears Prada slips into a black hole. Fortunately such instances are rare. On balance I enjoyed the film despite the whiny final half hour and the artificial conclusion. (Whatever happened to hard-edged endings in satires?) I recognize that the film is being marketed toward women but I see no reason why men cant enjoy what The Devil Wears Prada offers. The kind of corporate culture that comes under assault by Frankel isnt isolated to the fashion industry; viewers might be surprised at the universality of some of the targets. With so many ""loud"" movies opening in multiplexes its refreshing to find something that provides a change of pace.

Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep right) has her new employee (Anne Hathaway) on the ropes in The Devil Wears Prada. Photo Barry Wetcher 20th Century Fox The Devil Wears Prada 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Poor Andy. She has a fabulous job at the worlds premier fashion magazine. She gets tons of free designer clothes and dibs on the latest Marc Jacobs handbag. She travels to Paris for the haute-couture shows. She juggles a relationship with a soulful boyfriend and a sexually charged flirtation with a dreamy writer. But her boss is sooooo mean. Life just isnt fair. That in a nutshell is the plot of The Devil Wears Prada a lightweight chick flick that despite gaping plot holes will likely be a favorite of anyone who adores pretty women in pretty clothes. Based on the hit novel by Lauren Weisberger Devil is probably the most eagerly awaited fashion-themed movie in years. Weisbergers book is a thinly veiled account of her rocky experiences as an assistant to Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour. It caused a stir when it came out in 2003 as fashion gossips compared the ""boss from hell"" character Miranda Priestly the fictional editor of a fictional fashion magazine called Runway to Wintour whose icy demeanor has earned her the nickname ""Nuclear Wintour."" In the book and movie Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent journalism graduate who is so clueless that she has never heard of Runway nor Priestly (Meryl Streep). Andy nevertheless applies to the magazines parent company in New York and interviews for a position as Priestlys ""second assistant."" In a moment of weakness Priestly hires Andy even though she is ""fat"" and has no style -- character flaws that everyone keeps bringing up even though she is a babelicious size 6 and looks like a size 2. Before you can utter the words ""fairy godfather"" a flamboyant art editor (Stanley Tucci) takes her under his wing and transforms her into a style icon using Chanel Dolce amp; Gabbana and other designer castoffs from the sample room. As the lead character in The Princess Diaries The Princess Diaries 2 and Ella Enchanted Hathaway has been through this gawky-to-glamorous routine before. In this updated version the 23-year-old actress learns that expensive and stylish clothes dont make for long-term happiness. ""You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos"" first assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) tells her in one of the movies pivotal moments. (As the haughty assistant who lives for fashion Blunt has many of the movies best lines and steals nearly every scene shes in.) Streep as usual is amazing to watch. She could have been a screaming harridan; instead she deftly underplays the role showing controlled fury with a slightly arched eyebrow or a dismissive ""Thats all."" Streep humanizes Priestly but thats a problem because the character is supposed to be the devil incarnate. The movie softens so many of her rough edges that it defangs her. Shes no longer deliciously evil; shes been reduced to a misunderstood career woman. This devil needs a sharp pitchfork -- fast. Many of the movies fashion moments are right on though. The catty fashion world is filled with skinny uptight humorless women like Emily -- called ""clackers"" because their stilletos ""click clack"" on the tile floors -- who demean others to inflate their sense of self-importance. Andys ""makeover moment"" isnt very true-to-life but it is enjoyable to watch. After she discovers the Runway fashion closet she appears in a montage wearing dozens of fabulous outfits to the tune of Madonnas hit Vogue. Its the best fashion sequence since Rodeo Drive boutique owners sucked up to to Julia Roberts in 1990s Pretty Woman.

"Threadbare Prada wears thin despite devilish Streep - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Devil Wears Prada  1/2 out of fourDirector David FrankelStars Meryl Streep Anne Hathaway Stanley Tucci Simon Baker Emily BluntDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for some sensualityRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Threadbare Prada wears thin despite devilish Streep Updated 6/30/2006 213 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The comic appeal of The Devil Wears Prada is the cinematic equivalent of a size 2 -- wafer-thin and ultimately lacking in meat and substance. True the movie is based on the lightest of best sellers. Lauren Weisbergers 2003 roman a clef makes Bridget Joness Diary look like serious literature. But the movie has inexplicably watered down some of the nasty fun of the novel. Were they afraid audiences would be put off by the relentless cruelty of the devil in question? The fearsome Miranda Priestly the demonic editor of a top fashion magazine played by Meryl Streep has been defanged and in one scene even made sympathetic. The always reliable Streep does a fine job in the role. But its unclear why the screenwriters decided to soften the edges of this Saddam Hussein of the trendy fashion world. Fashionistas will be dazzled by the wardrobe on display here. Not since Sex and the City have so many great clothes shoes and purses been gathered together in one place. Anne Hathaway stars as Andy Sachs a recent college graduate who has aspirations of writing for The New Yorker but winds up as a flunky assistant for the malevolent editor in chief of Runway magazine. The demands on Andy are endless. She is ordered to find unpublished manuscripts of Harry Potter for the editors young daughters forced to go without lunch and bathroom breaks and must weather the taunts and insults leveled at her lack of fashion sense in this designer-drenched environment. This first job is about as hellish as one could imagine yet everyone tells Andy how lucky she is to have a job hundreds of girls would die for. Streep known best for her stellar dramatic work has perfect comic timing. Shes more subtle than her literary counterpart but her delivery is exquisitely stinging. The veteran actress takes something as simple as Mirandas signature ""Thats all"" dismissal and delivers it with an off-handed narcissistic menace that is both hilarious and chilling. When Andy doesnt rush to meet Mirandas every whim with sufficient alacrity Miranda dryly excoriates her ""By all means move at a glacial pace. You know how much that thrills me."" When Streep is on screen the movie is at its best. But far too much time is spent on Andy a not-terribly compelling character. Hathaway is simply no match for Streep -- or even for her snide and sardonic fellow assistant played winningly by Emily Blunt. The movie leaves us longing for more malicious Miranda-isms. Instead it follows a standard chick-flick formula with the requisite boyfriend troubles fashion montages hairstyle adjustments and eventual emotional realization and personal empowerment. Does anyone really think that what women want is this watered-down predictability? When adapting such a slight and gossipy novel to the screen wouldnt it be better if filmmakers offered a surfeit of truly dishy witty entertainment? This skewering of the world of couture is simply not juicy enough.

By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens and Amanda Fortinis Spoiler Special about  The Devil Wears Prada by clicking the arrow on the player below Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada Theres a moment in The Devil Wears Prada (Fox) when Anne Hathaway as the put-upon editorial assistant Andy Sachs defends her monstrous boss fashion editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) by saying ""If she were a man the only thing people would talk about is how good she is at her job."" But by the films end Andy along with the movie itself backs down from this vaguely feminist claim. In the end Mirandas sadistic perfectionism and deliberately insatiable demands arent seen as evidence of her professional acumen or her commitment to Runway magazine; theyre just evidence that shes a royal bitch. The Devil Wears Prada is a movie that revels in pleasure the pleasure of fashion of luxury of power and ambition. Its also a tremendous pleasure to watch. (And who cares if the clothes arent authentic? Theyre fabulous.) Nonetheless theres something mealy-mouthed about the way the movie dangles all the goodies of worldly success before our eyes then scolds its heroine for wanting to grab a little of that pleasure and power for herself. Advertisement When Andy finds herself making choices that privilege the professional over the personal--missing her boyfriends birthday dinner for example when shes required to attend a Runway gala--were meant to understand that shes drunk the Kool-Aid of careerism. Yet the sacrifices we see Andy making for her work--late hours low pay being forced to run menial errands for her superiors--are only comic exaggerations of the standard compromises that many young people male and female are asked to put up with in entry-level jobs. Are we supposed to agree that Andy really has sold her soul by privileging the mandatory work eventover the birthday boy? (Hey she brings him a cupcake at midnight and apologizes profusely wearing a gorgeous evening gown. Ive had way worse birthdays than that.) When at the movies climax Andy wails about having betrayed her friends and family for the sake of her vampiric boss I couldnt help but wonder if Id napped through a scene or two. What did she do that was so shameful? Even the moment thats presented as Andys moral nadir is rigged so as to render her powerless Miranda Priestly the most powerful woman in fashion has just threatened to fire her and blackball her throughout the industry unless she agrees to do something mildly unethical--really its just un-nice--to a Runway colleague (who incidentally has treated Andy like utter dirt from her first day on the job). In other words Andys great descent into the ethical underbelly consists of not being the sweetest and most self-sacrificing person on-screen. To reframe Andys defense of her boss What if this were a movie about a man--a young man apprenticing himself to a hard-boiled older mentor? I cant help but think that the moral compromises required in order to sully the heros character would be much greater and that he wouldnt have to apologize for caring about his job.

Starring Anne Hathaway Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt. Directed by David Frankel. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are two moral seductions in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" a temptation saga about a young woman who takes a job in the fashion industry. The first seduction the least satisfying is contained within the movie. Its the story of how our heroine begins to become seduced by the glamour and the distorted values of the people around her. That seduction is arbitrary necessary to the story but never completely convincing or even important in the grand scheme. The second seduction is what makes the movie. Thats our seduction as an audience watching ""The Devil Wears Prada."" We come into it most of us at least in a state of innocence knowing little about the ways of New Yorks fashion oracles. Were immediately shocked (though amused) by the rudeness the cutthroat cruelty and the callousness. And then about three-quarters in we understand it. Their behavior makes sense not just in a psychological sense but also in a twisted moral sense. We grasp the life view and the code of behavior and in doing so realize weve just completed our own journey to the dark side. Thanks to Meryl Streep whose performance as the editor in chief of the worlds most influential fashion magazine is eerie perfection ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is often quite funny. But its more than that a film that reveals an entire vibrant and sleazy world that most viewers would never have a hint of much less experience. Based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger ""Prada"" just feels authentic from its glossy look to the specific and sometimes curious behavior of the secondary and tertiary characters. To watch it is like being entertained while getting an anthropological crash course. The fashion-world rudeness seems to derive from a belief (or recognition) that people are as replaceable as styles and that just as only a few styles are acceptable at any given moment the same could be said for individuals. The practitioners of this philosophy accept that these rules apply to themselves as well and so they feel no impulse for phony courtesy in dealing with others. To be nice would only encourage weakness or instill a false assurance. Thus when young Andy (Anne Hathaway) shows up for her interview at Runway magazine shes met with a barrage of insults and snide comments by the boss first assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) -- though the contempt is curiously without any particular malice as though the assistant has learned the drill without feeling it. The stage is set for Streeps entrance as the dreaded boss Miranda. Word gets out that she has arrived in the building early which creates pandemonium in the office as desks are cleared hair and clothing are primped and comfortable shoes are replaced with high heels. Were led to expect a screaming harpy but Streep is too smart an actress for that. Shes the boss and the boss doesnt have to raise her voice. Instead she speaks in a quiet monotone complaining and giving orders with an air of mildly pained bewilderment. Her most vicious comments begin in seemingly innocuous ways with ""Why is it impossible that ..."" or ""I really dont understand why ..."" Miranda is much scarier than a demanding screaming boss. She takes pleasure in slipping inside her employees minds and torturing them. At first Andy lives a schizophrenic existence working at the center of the couture world while dressing like a zhlub and living with a scruffy boyfriend (Adrian Grenier). But soon she starts dressing fashionably and this is where the movie threatens to hit a snag. It suggests that Andy who never looked better in her life is compromising her values though what inherent value is there in looking like a slob? It also posits her relationship with her boyfriend as the shining beacon of her life. Yet theres nothing special about the relationship and anyway theyre both really young. A 23-year-old is allowed to change without it being assumed that shes on a moral slide. Perhaps shes simply growing in another direction. If the filmmakers really wanted to make Andy go wrong they should have done it for real instead of expecting that the frustration of her hippie friends should carry moral weight with an audience. Fortunately the story of Andy is just an excuse to show us what Andy witnesses -- the world from the inside of the limousine Paris at night the front row at a high-fashion runway how fashion designers intermingle with fashion editors what those people say how they think. This is where Streep is extraordinary letting us see how Miranda inhabits that world with a complete understanding of peoples frailties machinations and desires. Miranda may be alarming on the outside but on the inside shes terrifying. She doesnt even truly subscribe to the twisted people-are-interchangeable ethos that she expects her underlings to live by. Shes indispensable. Shes the queen. Beneath Streeps coldness theres more coldness and beneath that coldness is something worse. She makes you feel that the devil really does wear Prada. -- Advisory There is a sexual interlude.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If Meryl Streep has her way you will walk out of her latest film with if not sympathy a slightly richer understanding of the devil. As Runway Magazine editor and dominant force in fashion Miranda Priestly she is emotionally dangerous to her minions. It was understood from Lauren Weisbergers best seller ""The Devil Wears Prada"" that the rag-mag editrix might be blond but that her unmistakable tint was that of Vogues reigning diva Anna Wintour. But Streep and director David Frankel wanted to make their portrait of a female powerhouse more complex. In the book Priestly wasnt so innovative in her approach to displeasure. The Miranda of the page shouted; Streeps version hardly changes her inflection. Hush hush not-sweet Miranda. Shes still a lion but shes not channeling Wintour and this suits the movie just fine. Instead of a gossipy comedy ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is more often a fairly sage fable about the price of work. Casting Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs who has the enviable position of being Mirandas newest assistant at Runway only adds to this more mature less ax-grinding tone. Hers is a job ""that millions of girls would kill for."" Or so Andy is told time and again. Die trying to keep Miranda happy is more like it. Miranda is imperious. Whenever she enters her Runway offices she tosses her coat and bag. In a montage of her disregard it becomes coatbagcoatbagcoatbag thrown on her second assistants desk. If the first assistant has mildly elevated tasks Andys job is not glorified. She is just a bona fide aspiring journalist who finds herself in the gofer role. Pick up Starbucks. Hot. Pick up Hermes scarves. Yesterday. Theres a reason Madonnas ""Jump"" plays on the soundtrack. Because every assistant editor or lackey in Mirandas orbit is trained to ask ""how high?"" Streep avoids being simply wicked. Hathaways version of Andy is a little like Dorothy. Indeed one of the high hurdles Miranda sets up brings to mind the Wizard sending Dorothy and the Scarecrow for the witchs broom. Andy doesnt have the smart- aleck knowingness the books narrator did. Hathaway who broke through with ""The Princess Diaries"" and startled in ""Brokeback Mountain"" projects an awareness that never tilts toward cynicism. Andy starts to be changed by her job but she never calculates. It takes her a long time to understand what working for Miranda might cost her. Some of the films early setup is implausible. Andy is a journalist and she shows investigative clips to hot-shot magazine writer and flirt Christian (Simon Baker). Are we really to believe she doesnt know who the top editor at one of the top publishing companies is? Her lack of interest of course is about the frivolity of fashion. Why care? Its a minor quibble one screenwriter Aline Brosch Mc- Kenna does a decent job dispatching. Around the time Andy is ready to quit and goes whining to Runways wiseman Nigel (Stanley Tucci) the movie becomes interesting about ambition power and fashion - both the art and industry of it. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" says in its conflicted but mildly persuasive way that fashion is that odd meeting of the seemingly trivial with the pursuit of something that resonates. Theres zero camp in this mix. But fear not there are still some meows. Mirandas just- promoted first assistant played by Emily Blunt (""My Summer of Love"") is responsible for the easiest of them. But Tucci and Streep have their fun with arch delivery. (Andy before her makeover ""Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like."" Nigel ""Yes but do you?"") Frankel knows his way around this world. He directed episodes of ""Sex and the City"" and also ""Entourage."" Adrian Grenier star of the latter plays Andys boyfriend Nate. The filmmakers decided that is was too pat to have him be a frustrated public school teacher. Instead hes an aspiring chef. When Christian keeps appearing to tempt Andy further trading up from sweet guy to savvy one it doesnt seem so farfetched. Turns out the Faustian bargain doesnt come as one make- or-break deal but as a series of compromises that one justifies as necessary. To tailor an Upton Sinclair quote from a completely different type of film ""It is difficult to get a gal to understand something when her salary depends upon her not understanding it."" ""The Devil Wears Prada"" has the look of many studio movies. But if you pay heed to the craft in the details theres satisfying quality here. And Streep provides a worthy moment of truth the kind hinted at in the phrase ""the eyes are the windows of the soul."" Miranda and Andy are in Paris for the shows. Miranda hears difficult news from home and Andy finds her sitting in her posh suite perched on a sofas edge. Her glasses off. Her guard seemingly down. Streep Frankel and company arent pretending this isnt a twisted world. But the big-screen arrival of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" suggest that merely catty is oh-so-three seasons ago.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 30 2006 Save for later Saved I dont know a Dolce from a Gabbana but my first job as a film critic lo these many years was for Mademoiselle so I know a bit about the inner sanctums of the fashion magazine biz.This knowledge came in handy while I was watching ""The Devil Wears Prada"" adapted from the bestseller by Lauren Weisberger (who had been an assistant to Vogues Anna Wintour). What might seem to some like exaggeration - the stylishly thin lookalike assistants clacking their stilettos in the hallways the silky imperiousness of the diva editors - is the way things are.But realism only goes so far. The film directed by David Frankel (""Sex and the City"" ""Entourage"") may be accurate around the edges but at its heart its a fairy tale. The engagingly frumpy Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent Northwestern graduate who wants to be a serious journalist but ends up improbably landing the job of assistant to (fictitious) Runway magazines ice-queen editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). It is not long before Andy - who Miranda condescendingly refers to as the ""smart fat girl"" - undergoes the obligatory fashion makeover and becomes so immersed in her job that the rest of her life goes blooey. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? She neglects her nice-guy live-in boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) and wrangles with Amandas chief assistant (Emily Blunt); she dances around a dalliance with a well-connected magazine writer (Simon Baker) and endures the withering stares of Mirandas right-hand man (Stanley Tucci in a well-turned performance). She is handed impossible assignments like Mirandas ""request"" for the top-secret galleys of the new Harry Potter book for her twin girls and delivers. She makes it to Paris for the annual designer bash. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Throughout it all we are supposed to see Andy as a sweet humble girl whose head has been turned by all the hoopla. But lovely as she is Hathaway doesnt do much to convey Andys inner struggles with temptation. There is no glint of cutthroat ambition in her no inner diva and so shes a bit wan - a good girl in a bad world.What makes the film more than fairly good fluff is Streeps performance. It would have been easy for her to portray Miranda as a raging caricature but instead she plays it for truth. The cadenced purr of her voice has steel in it - shes a lot scarier than a shouter would be. The manicured and Manolod Miranda with her rock-solid coif is a woman who values control above all things. When she lets her guard down near the end and talks to Andy about the breakup of her own marriage the fissures in her armor show and for a moment she becomes bracingly human. Is there anything this actress cannot do? Grade B- Rated PG-13 for some sensuality.

By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Meryl Streep dressed as Runway editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly.  (Photo Brigitte Lacombe) From the start Superman Returns has a pall that it never shakes off Even the superheroics seem like stopgap measures in a world slipping grimly into the abyss. Before the credits we learn that Superman has been absent from Earth for five years in a search for survivors from his exploded home planet Kryptonclearly a hopeless quest and when he gets back he spends a lot of time in bed in his mothers house. Marlon Brando appears as Jor-El in footage from 1978 the actor relatively sane and trim at least compared with the barking-mad barrage-balloon hed become The sense of prodigious waste is inescapable. The brassy John Williams theme and the familiar flying credits signal that the series wont be starting from scratch the way Batman didwhich means no matter how good the new guy is well feel the loss of the all-too-human Christopher Reeve. As it turns out the new guy Brandon Routh isnt very good at all and when he is its because hes channeling Reeves dithering butterfingers Clark Kent and his sheepishly grinning Man of Steel. In the first scene an elderly woman expires after leaving her fortune to Lex Luthorand shes played by Noel Neill everyones favorite Lois Lane from the fifties TV show. RIP Lois. To cap off the funereal opening the new Luthor is cinemas most convincing sadist Kevin Spacey. Is Superman being resurrected or buried alive? Theres nothing wrong with tortured emotion in comic-book pictures. The genres writers and illustrators have kept their superheroes fresh by finding dark underbellies and kinky variations. (How about that gay Batgirl?) And ever since the Tim BurtonSam Hamm Batman of 1989 it has been de rigueur in movies to focus on the freaky alienation aspect of the superheros life This is how talented people make movies for 14-year-olds while retaining their self-respect. The director of Superman Returns Bryan Singer mined the gay-outsider subtext in the first two X-Men movies (Have you tried not being a mutant? asked a teens distraught parent) and he must have seemed the perfect guy to give this series the depth and urgency that Sam Raimi brought to Spider-Man. BACKSTORYSuperman Returnswould seem to mark the megaplex return of Kevin Spacey but hes recently said that hes not interested in [having a movie career] at all now (which should please critics of Beyond the Sea). Instead hes committed to London where hes controversially presiding as artistic director of the Old Vic theater. Still he had a blast as Lex Luthor even souping up his on-set golf cart. We tied a Superman doll on the back with a chain so I just dragged it around he told the Website Dark Horizons adding that hed scream into a bullhorn Superman must die Once past the overture theres at least a shred of hope that Singer and the screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris are laying the groundwork for a soaring climax. In the Daily Planet newsroom Clark is again an amusingly impotent bystander and these are the best moments in all the Superman sagas the ones where you wait for the doffing of the glasses and loosening of the tie. This time Lois has just won a Pulitzer for an editorial called Why the World Doesnt Need Supermana thinly veiled expression of rage at being abandoned. (The superhero took off for Krypton without telling her or the world.) Could this turn into a comedy of remarriageSuperman and Lois in His Girl Friday? No chance with this Lois Kate Bosworth the blonde surfer-queen of Blue Crush. She isnt a bad actress but shes motorless with guileless little eyes; and the hotshot investigative reporter is now an overprotective single mom with a frail boy and an earnest fiance (James Marsden) whom she doesnt have the wit to manipulate. The bigger problem is that Singers weighty rhythms are disastrous for Superman and the movie actually gets heavier in its last half-hour. Spaceys Luthoruntil now less a supervillain than a clammy businessmanmutilates Superman with sociopathic relish The sequence is so ugly that Luthors lame jokey comeuppance feels monstrously inadequate. But by then the audience has moved far ahead of Singer. A scene in which Lois tries to persuade her fiance to turn his plane around and help the disabled superhero could have been compressed into ten seconds instead of dragged out to a minute and the final scenes would make Wagner check his watch. Its not that the movie is 157 minutes; its that it feels like 157 minutes. Superman Returns has grace notes. The computer artists make Supermans cape billow lyrically and theres a gorgeous moment when Clark uses his X-ray vision to watch Lois lifting off in an elevator. As Luthors moll Parker Posey is splendidly tart although the writers dont seem to be sure if shes dumb or savvy. (Did they change their minds midway through?) In a witty scene one of Luthors thugs joins Loiss son in a piano duet of Heart and Soul while Lois surreptitiously faxes for help. But even here Singer lingers too long. How can you make a superhero movie with no pop pulse? The film of Lauren Weisbergers novel The Devil Wears Pradaa scantily clad revenge memoir of Weisbergers time as Anna Wintours assistant at Vogueis a fairy tale in which the good little aspiring-writer protagonist Andrea (Anne Hathaway) is tempted by the girlie equivalent of George Lucass Dark Side the wicked fashion-obsessed queen (Meryl Streep) of a glossy monthly magazine and her mean shallow minions. Hopelessly ethical and unmaterialistic our heroine nonetheless proves that she can be a triumphant courtier look better in couture than anyone at Vogue (I mean Runway) and retain her commoners integrity.

Fox release will play very well to women of all ages and should show off nice B.O. legs throughout the summer. While men in capes have been wrestling for audience attention Meryl Streep has quietly established herself as queen of the summer first with her delectable turn in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and now with her breathtakingly underplayed performance in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Streep single-handedly elevates this sitcomy but tolerably entertaining adaptation of Lauren Weisbergers bestselling 2003 roman a clef about a personal assistants year of chic hell under the thumb of the dragon lady of the fashion world. Gutsily being opened as counterprogramming to ""Superman Returns"" Fox release will play very well to women of all ages and should show off nice B.O. legs throughout the summer. Weisbergers popular tome offered parsimonious bites of drama along with an array of tiresomely cliched supporting characters but got by as a compendium of jaw-dropping workplace outrages perpetrated by an inhumanly monstrous boss; it didnt hurt that the author had worked for the famous and infamous editor of the worlds best known fashion magazine. To give the material more narrative shape screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (""Laws of Attraction"") has minimized useless characters expanded the bosss role to provide a speck of humanity and upped the dramatic ante with a couple of twists that render the tale less flat. Filmmakers have also toned down the editors most extremely sadistic behavior and removed the explicitly Jewish identities of the two leads. Providing an easy point of identification is Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) a recent Northwestern grad whose good looks are readily apparent to scruffily sweet-faced b.f. Nate (Adrian Grenier) but whose dorky bookworm wardrobe provokes guffaws when she arrives at Runway magazine for a job interview to become assistant to style doyenne Miranda Priestly (Streep). Perhaps because she couldnt care less about fashion and has never heard of Miranda Andy unexpectedly gets ""the job a million girls would die for."" She shares an outer office with brittle Brit Emily (Emily Blunt) who provides the newcomer with a few clues about whats required and how not to get fired. As with the book a good part of the film is devoted to detailing Mirandas reign of terror and the often unconscionable humiliations she visits upon her staff. This material after all reps the meat of the story the inside stuff that feels like secrets revealed by someone with first-hand experience. Viewers are readily turned into wide-eyed voyeurs at the scene of daily worker panic and agony as Miranda as tough as any boot camp sergeant calls size-six Andy fat insists her coffees and lunches be delivered five minutes ago demands a manuscript of the new Harry Potter book for her twin daughters even though it hasnt been published yet and concludes every encounter with a cutting ""Thats all."" As harsh as Miranda is in the film her meanness has been scaled back from the off-the-charts levels of the book; Weisberger viewing her with the one-dimensional horror of a terrified employee portrayed her boss as a monster unleavened by any quality other than professional effectiveness. The film takes a slightly but gratifyingly more expansive view of Miranda as a woman who has consciously made enormous sacrifices to get where she is and to maintain her power. Aiding this effort most of all is Streep. What the books Miranda achieves with hysteria and frequent screeching outbursts the films Miranda manages with withering glances and devastatingly dismissive looks that could wilt poison ivy. Streeps silent reactions are priceless and when the lady does speak it is in dulcet tones that demand extra attentiveness but then reward the listener with barbs from hidden needles. Coutured to the nines and a vision in platinum gray Streep is a wonder. Otherwise the film clunks along through this year-in-the-life in fits and starts. Its amusing to observe Runways fashion queen Nigel (Stanley Tucci very good) setting Andy on a path toward a classy wardrobe and heartening to watch Andy as she occasionally racks up points by anticipating Mirandas needs. On the other hand director David Frankel who has trod these neighborhoods before while helming ""Sex and the City"" lards the proceedings with far too many klutzy montages papered over by a largely irritating selection of pop tunes. Scenes with Andys earnest puppy-dog boyfriend are boringly one-note meant to illustrate her growing distance from values of the heart while the character of a predatory new candidate for Andys attentions (Simon Baker) has been blanded out by removing his danger quotient. Hathaway is fine as the smart but green young woman who finally becomes so good at her thankless job that she comes perilously close to going over to the ""dark side"" repped by Miranda. Also impressing is Blunt (""My Summer of Love"") as Mirandas more senior assistant whose emotional physical and psychic deterioration over the course of the year presents the most vivid manifestation of Mirandas toxic influence. More time could have been spent evoking the color and wild characters of the fashion scene something achieved momentarily when the action moves to Paris in the late going. All the same individual craft achievements are sharp notably those by lenser Florian Ballhaus production designer Jess Gonchor and perhaps above all costume designer Patricia Field (""Sex and the City"") who has turned out myriad appropriately stunning outfits for the entire cast.
