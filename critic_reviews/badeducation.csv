An intricately constructed film noir about obsession role-playing revenge and shifting identities it is obviously influenced by ""Vertigo"" yet ""Bad Education"" feels bracingly new. No one but Almodovar could have made it.The movies present tense is the 1980s. A 27-year-old film director Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) is desperate for a new project when a young actor (Gael Garcia Bernal) comes into his office with a story hes written. He claims to be Ignacio the boy Enrique loved 16 years earlier in a Roman Catholic boarding school. Its the story of their schoolboy affair how they were separated when the pedophile priest Father Manolo banished Ignacio from school in a fit of jealousy. And then it tells of what happened to Ignacio how he became the transvestite performer Zahara (also played by Bernal) determined to get revenge on Father Manolo. Is this all true? And is Ignacio really Ignacio? What Enrique does know is that this must be his next film.""Bad Education"" keeps pulling the rug out from under Enrique and the audience. Like a Chinese box it has layers under layers fictions within fictions. A mystery and an intricate triangular love story its also a tale about storytelling itself the uses of art and artifice to make the unbearable bearable. But the less you know of the plot the better. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Almodovar is famous for his great womens roles. But here for the first time there are no significant womens parts--though theres Bernal in drag which is almost as good. The all-male atmosphere brings with it a cooler tone the grand passions on display burn with a cold fire. Bernal playing what amounts to three different roles is mesmerizing. Its typical of Almodovar that even the child molester Father Manolo is granted a complex humanity. Martinez has the Jimmy Stewart role--Enrique is the obsessed besotted one hunting after the truth--but I wish a more expressive actor had played the part; Martinezs sleek taut face conceals more than it reveals. My only other quibble is with the ending which feels abrupt its like a splash of cold water waking us from a dream we dont want to end.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Bad Almodovar at His Best washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Bad Almodovar at His Best Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 14 2005 DECEPTION and murder blackmail and passion -- these are a few of film noirs favorite things. In ""Bad Education"" Pedro Almodovars uniquely flavored tribute to the genre the Spanish filmmaker adds some thematic favorites of his own including cross-dressing transsexuality heroin addiction and ecclesiastical hypocrisy. The result is one of Almodovars darkest films since the early days of ""Law of Desire"" and ""Matador"" and certainly one of his finest. In Madrid 1980 filmmaker Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) is scrambling for inspiration for his next film. He is snipping tabloid articles about a motorcycle rider who drove dead and frozen for 60 miles before being discovered and a woman who leapt into a zoo pit of alligators hugging them as they devoured her when a young man enters his production office. This stranger is Angel (Gael Garcia Bernal) a bearded actor who claims to be Enriques old parochial school friend Ignacio Rodriguez. ""Angel"" the actor tells Enrique is just a stage name. And he has an old short story for Enrique to consider as his next project which is based on their mutual past. Enrique is stunned. At that school he fell in love with Ignacio a sweet-faced choirboy who hypnotized priests and students alike with his haunting singing voice. But catching the boys in a compromising moment the sexually jealous Father Manolo (Daniel Gimenez-Cacho) expelled Enrique. Can this really be the older Ignacio? He takes the story home and reads. And reads. We watch a reenactment of Angels story in which Angel/Ignacio moonlights as a drag performer named Zahara. Working with his good friend Paquito (Javier Camara the male-nurse star of Almodovars ""Talk to Her"") Angel/Ignacio/Zahara seduces a male customer intending to steal his money when hes asleep. But when he picks through the mans wallet he realizes he has just been intimate with Enrique his former school lover. Enrique continues reading this story utterly captivated. He decides to make that film and despite strong misgivings agrees to cast Angel as the older Ignacio. This is just the beginning of several stories within stories. Like a set of Russian nesting dolls they are similar but subtly different. Each tale has its own combination of fact and fiction. And as you might imagine the entire picture doesnt emerge until the final scene. Although Almodovars actors are usually lead musicians in a complex orchestration Bernal (the star of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries"") is a standout here. Hes a character of multiple roles who switches from gum-chewing high-heeled Zahara to Angel with admirable fluidity. And I dont think I can ever look at Juliette Lewis the same after seeing Bernals blonde-bewigged disguise. The Almodovar mystique is very much in play that combination of farce and tragedy taboo slapstick and tender poignancy. And the writer-director bastes everything in the lurid trappings of soapy Hollywood melodrama (as in the films of Douglas Sirk) noirish classics like ""Laura"" and ""Fallen Angel"" with a little Grand Guignol on the side. (Alberto Iglesiass score is a classic nod to the noir scores of composers like David Raksin and Bernard Herrmann.) There is a deep-seated theme of priestly abuse too. Father Manolos sexual advance toward the young Ignacio (played by Ignacio Perez) after making him sing a Spanish-language version of ""Moon River"" is a poetically haunting and discomforting moment. But Almodovar isnt making a film about priestly transgressions per se hes telling a story of humankinds darkest impulses with the relish of a campfire (emphasis on camp) storyteller trying to keep his listeners bug-eyed with wonder. He succeeds magnificently. BAD EDUCATION (NC-17 109 minutes) -- Contains obscenity sexual scenes drug use and themes of sexual child abuse. In Spanish with subtitles. At Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle.

"Bad Education Powerful Knowledge washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Bad Education Powerful Knowledge Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 14 2005 The Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar is up to his usual tricks in ""Bad Education"" a rapturous movie-within-a-flashback-within-a-fantasy-sequence that combines the melodrama of Douglas Sirk the noir sensibilities of Raymond Chandler the tensile storytelling of Hitchcock and Almodovars own signature sensibility. If ""Talk to Her"" Almodovars last film was a homage to everything female then ""Bad Education"" is his chance to pay respect to the men who have informed his life and work even if their motivations werent always benign. In the movie a young filmmaker named Enrique (Fele Martinez) is paid a visit by an old chum from Catholic school named Angel (Gael Garcia Bernal) who has written a story called ""The Visit"" about their early experiences with a sexually predatory priest named Manolo. Indeed its several unexpected visits that propel ""Bad Education"" along on its twisty course wherein the vagaries of memory desire identity and deception intertwine in an increasingly kaleidoscopic tale of revenge. Its a testament to Almodovars skills as a storyteller and stylist that ""Bad Education"" qualifies as a gripping old-style thriller even when it traffics in the trashy tabloid melodrama and lurid pulp imagery to which Almodovar has always been devoted. Throughout his 30-year career the filmmaker has managed to carve out a niche that only he can occupy as the director of films that although playfully titillating and wildly colorful tell deeply humanist stories about characters for whom he has profound respect. In ""Bad Education"" that is Bernals character who as a young man in Franco-era Spain becomes the object of sexual obsession for Father Manolo when he himself is falling in love with young Enrique. As the story shifts from the 1960s to the 1970s and the 1980s this enigmatic troubled young man remains a mystery until viewers have no clear idea of who the protagonist really is. Luckily this protean increasingly problematic young man is portrayed by Bernal last seen in ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" Here he delivers the most layered difficult performance of his promising career. Whether hes dolled up as the transvestite impersonator of the Spanish cult actress Sara Montiel or shuffling around in a teenagers gym shorts and flip-flops Bernal is never less than believable -- and thoroughly magnetic -- in a role that demands he take on a dizzying array of contradictory personas. That viewers can keep track of the characters who come and go throughout ""Bad Education"" is to the credit of Almodovar whose control of the narrative and its emotional tone is as usual flawless. Perhaps no other director could combine an obsessive knowledge of classic films spiritual yearning sentimentality and camp humor in such convincing and entertaining fashion; surely no one working today does so with Almodovars panache and compassion. (Even Father Manolo ""Bad Educations"" villain is portrayed as a man weakened by his own compulsions rather than unambiguously evil.) More than tweaking his audience with sexually subversive material or dazzling it with his extravagantly lush palette Almodovar is interested in expressing his love for his chosen medium not only its history and grammar but its luminous almost tactile properties. To watch ""Bad Education"" is to revel along with Almodovar in the power of cinema to take us on journeys of breathtaking mystery and dimension and beauty. He worships at the altar of cinema; filmgoers are invited to pray along with him or quietly leave the church. Bad Education (109 minutes at Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle) in Spanish with subtitles is rated NC-17 for a scene of explicit sexual content.

"Bad is Almodovar at his ingenious best - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bad is Almodovar at his ingenious best By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 22 2004 The last shot of Pedro Almodovars Bad Education"" is a close-up of the word passion."" For anybody whos had the pleasure of luxuriating in one of his movies thats a glorious redundancy -- like Nightline"" deciding to end its broadcasts with a shot of the word news.""Bad Education"" is all-consumed with passion and the way it brings out the crazy the bad and the beautiful in people. This is a brilliantly structured hall of mirrors that wraps Catholicism and the movie industry into a tasty film noir. Its Almodovars most ingenious movie since the days of his punk experiments in 1980s Madrid where incidentally a lot of this movie unfolds.After a credit sequence that pays direct homage to Saul Bass and his opening titles work for Hitchcock we move right into the office of Enrique (Fele Martinez) a film director cruising the newspaper for a movie idea. In walks his childhood friend Ignacio (Gael Garcia Bernal). The two were paramours in Catholic school in the mid-60s until Father Manolo a priest obsessed with the angelic choirboy Ignacio expelled Enrique from the boys self-made Eden so he could have Ignacio to himself.In the 16 years since they last saw each other Ignacio now a starving actor who wants to be called Angel has written a screenplay about their childhood. He wants Enrique to direct the script called The Visit."" The director takes it home to read while Almodovar transports us inside its pages.Ignacio/Angel is now a transvestite/junkie/prostitute named Zahara whom we meet performing in a dive bar. The audience is less than riveted which is a put-on because Bernal is so utterly mesmerizing in drag. (His performance in pants is also audacious). Whats especially astounding about Bernal in a curly red wig is the way it hilariously consolidates the movie-star universe Zahara could be Julia Robertss Pretty Woman"" hooker trapped in the same body as Veronica Forque the star of Almodovars 1993 Kika.""On their way home Zahara and her raunchier girlfriend Paca (the great Javier Camara) run into a very drunk hunk whos falling over on his motorcycle. Its Enrique the movie-in-the-movies version played by a different actor. The encounter reminds the destitute Zahara of their mutual troubled past. She shows up at their old school and tries to blackmail Father Manolo (Daniel Gimenez-Cacho) to pay for his past transgressions.Enrique is drawn to this and everything else in Angels script including its memory of those beautiful doomed school years. He even overlooks the depiction of him as a cheap trick presumably because he knows good material when it lands on his desk. Angel meanwhile wants to play Zahara but Enrique doesnt think hes woman enough. Angel pulls out the figurative casting couch and tries to change Enriques mind. Precious little in Bad Education"" is what it appears to be. As the layers of deception are peeled away the movie begins to defy a satisfying synopsis. (You try explaining a jigsaw puzzle) Then again Almodovar doesnt make movies to summarize he make movies to watch. That sounds self-explanatory I know. But the stories here are inextricable from the sounds and images -- Albert Iglesias did the haunting music Jose Luis Alcaine the luscious photography -- and most of the images defy easy description. When someone falls over dead into the keys of a typewriter its metallic arms fly toward the screen in an operatic burst and then collapse back into place. Bad Education"" is a movie so vividly constructed that its greatness lies just outside mere words anyway.Its tempting to think in the initial passages we see of The Visit"" that whats unfolding is Enriques vision of how his movie will go. But if you buy that hes a stand-in for Almodovar at the birth of his film career then thats impossible. Theres no way hed be as incredible a filmmaker then as Almodovar is now.This is the movie the director has been leading up to since he turned a corner in 1995 with The Flower of My Secret."" The elements of his outlaw days that produced such early highs as What Have I Done to Deserve This"" and Law of Desire"" are still intact; the farcical volume of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" and High Heels"" has been turned down; and the perfume and occasional preciousness of All About My Mother"" and Talk to Her"" has faded.Bad Education"" is a marvelously dirty ultimately heartbroken movie about among other things the instability of identities. After Ignacios first sexual encounter with Father Manolo the screen splits in two dividing along the trickle of blood on the boys forehead and warning us that psychologically he is irreparably broken. Almodovars own filmmaking identity has evolved dramatically through the years. His movies typically disguise themselves as lurid. But whats always made him a terrific artist and great entertainer is his gift for finding human sadness and great beauty in what on the surface looks trashy. He pulls this off without seeming tasteless naive or cheap.The achievement of Bad Education"" is its surprising emotional truth which Almodovar introduces through innocent kids and complicates with exploitative adults. Young Ignacio and Enrique have what looks to be a perversely premature connection (how old are they again?) but its the purest mutual love Ive ever seen in an Almodovar film however short-lived it is. When their religion fails them (and therefore their schooling) they find a new church and a new classroom in the only place of worship and higher learning that matters to Almodovar the movies.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Photo Diego Lopez Calvin/Sony Pictures Almodovars noir mystery done in rouge 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Bad Education Drama. Starring Gael Garcia Bernal Fele Martinez Daniel Gimenez Cacho. Directed and written by Pedro Almodovar. NC-17. 109 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Clay.) To be attracted to Gael Garcia Bernal in ""Bad Education"" is to be human. The Mexican actor is irresistible moving from gorgeous femme fatale in full drag to muscular male tart doing push-ups for onlookers while clad only in gym shorts. His most alluring trait however is the secret playing on his pout. Bernal has built a great reputation by appearing in wonderful films from ""Amores Perros"" to ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" that were always slightly better than his appearances in them. ""Bad Education"" Pedro Almodovars intoxicating and flawed noir-melodrama marks the first time Bernal outshines his marquee material -- an achievement ironically that reflects Almodovars superior eye. The Spanish master recognized that Bernal whose chiseled subdued looks usually draw the viewer in gradually might benefit from mascara and rouge. The effect is immediate. In ""Motorcycle Diaries"" Bernal is quietly compelling. In ""Bad Education"" he pops much like the reds that dominate the films palette. Almodovar fans who found ""All About My Mother"" and ""Talk to Her"" too squishy will relish the uncompromising nature of ""Bad Education"" which is part mystery and part expose of sexual abuse by Catholic priests. Yet theres also something to be said for having nice people in a film a feature ""Bad Education"" conspicuously lacks apart from its scenes with children. Saxophone riffs and sunlight streaming through cracked Venetian blinds evoke the 1940s but the film starts in 1980 with a visit by Bernals character a bearded actor named Angel to a filmmaker called Enrique Goded (evoking at once Almodovar Jean-Luc Godard and the Almighty). Angel reminding Enrique (Fele Martinez) of an intimate friendship back at Catholic school when Angel was still known as Ignacio has come seeking acting work. He also drops off a manuscript. ""Bad Education"" then goes inside that manuscript to unveil Zahara Bernals drag character. Like the best noir dames Zahara exhibits criminality and a voracious sexual appetite both on display in a racy scene with the story-within-the- storys version of Enrique. Dont follow? Dont worry because the slippery Angel/Zahara/Ignacio always intrigues thanks partly to Bernals infusion of boldness world-weariness and hints of uncertainty. In the best noir fashion Bernal hints at a certain shadiness stopping just short of biting his lip. The noir fun comes to a halt for a long interlude evoking Ignacio and Enriques time at school. These scenes offer a mix of gloom ceremony and exquisite cinematography. Slow-motion shots of boys frolicking in a lake appear to be from an ad for an exclusive summer camp. Then the queasiness sets in. As the boys in the water are being boys young Ignacio sings ""Moon River"" in a lovely haunting voice serenaded by a priest with lust in his eyes. Scenes of the child and the priest although discreetly staged are tough to watch. Actor Daniel Gimenez Cacho shows the torment of a man attracted to a child and unable to keep from acting on that attraction. The films affinity for this character suggests that Almodovar having elicited sympathy for perversion in the past (""Talk to Her"") wants to do the same here. No dice. By setting the school scenes in the Franco era Almodovar explores a time when abuse by priests was even more hushed and terrifying than it is now. Scenes occurring in 1980 serve a different purpose. They allow Almodovars filmmaker counterpart to be young sexually adventurous and morally ambiguous. The directors naughty side emerges here as if the gravity of the priest- abuse angle were too much to bear. The grown-up Enrique takes advantage of the casting-couch system when not thumbing through tabloids for screenplay ideas. Nearly as handsome as Bernal Martinez provides the films cool center. His director character is a picture of curious containment as he absorbs shocking revelations and patiently awaits more. As mercenary as the films more outwardly evil characters the filmmaker forgets his conscience in pursuit of good material. The films third act occurring with all the characters as adults upends most of what came before it. People skulk around and don big sunglasses as the noir aspect becomes more self-conscious and despite the nastiness of the people involved more delicious. Almodovar like his on-screen alter ego knows a decent story always trumps a sense of decency. -- Advisory This film contains graphic sex scenes disturbing themes and profanity.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Still few could accuse Almodovar of having softened his edge or making overt bids for respectability even if Talk to Her was at the end of the day a necrophilia romance even a mother could love. Indeed whats remarkable about Almodovar isnt just how hes remained faithful to his pet obsessions of gender confusion sexual repression and taboo couplings as his filmmaking style has evolved beyond the rough-hewn camp theatricality of his earliest features -- its that hes plunged even deeper into that perverse abyss. That he is a master now capable of some of the most gloriously expressionistic moving pictures this side of Hitchcock and Welles has only made his subversive side seem that much more radical. Case in point Almodovars latest Bad Education where the sexual-abuse scandals of the Catholic Church become the backdrop for a gleefully macabre film noir whose blindingly intense colors illuminate a wide range of dark habits and where the requisite femmes fatales just might be chicks with dicks.A fractured fairy tale told thrice upon a time Bad Education begins in Madrid in the 1980s where successful young filmmaker Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) contemplates (with some help from the tabloid headlines) the subject of his next project. But Almodovar isnt content to rest here for long. Soon he has us ricocheting like an out-of-control pinball between different time periods and planes of reality fragments of lost innocence and ramparts of blissed-out movie love. Trouble first arrives in the form of aspiring actor Angel (Gael Garcia Bernal) who back when he was called Ignacio was Enriques closest school friend. In truth the two were in love back then much to the chagrin of their teacher Father Manolo (Daniel Gimenez-Cacho) who was himself infatuated with the boy soprano Ignacio. (In what is surely the years most haunting moment musical Ignacios deflowering is set to his high-voiced whine of Henry Mancinis ""Moon River."")Angel has come bearing a gift a manuscript called The Visit which he describes as a fiction inspired by his and Enriques childhood. As Enrique reads the text were treated to scenes (filmed in a narrower aspect ratio than the rest of Bad Education) from the movie version taking shape in his mind. Set in the late 1970s The Visit also depicts a reunion between Enrique and Ignacio -- here a transvestite stage performer known as Zahara (also played by Bernal) -- as well as Ignacio/Zaharas attempt to blackmail Father Manolo with threats of publishing a story (also called ""The Visit"") that exposes their scandalous past. From there The Visit flashes back (thats right a flashback within the movie-within-a-movie) to Enrique and Ignacios childhood -- their first meeting their growing affection for one another and the escape they found from their priestly tormentor in the darkened aisles of their local cinema. And before its all over Bad Education will itself step back in time purporting to show us what really happened in the 1970s between Manolo (now played by Lluis Homar) Ignacio (now played by Francisco Boira) and Ignacios brother Juan (Bernal again).

Because you -- to say nothing of Enrique -- still dont know the half of it.Never one to back away from a challenge Almodovar is said to have spent the better part of a decade developing Bad Education and watching the finished film you get the feeling that much of that time was devoted to figuring out how each and every piece of the films jigsaw structure would snap into place. Its the directors most complexly ordered film to date -- a labyrinth of ids egos and alter egos waiting around blind corners -- and may be the movies most deliriously inventive narrative spiral since Adaptation. And like Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze Almodovar sees the malleability of cinematic time and space as something more than an opportunity for elegantly crafted sleight of hand. As he has shown in the past from the movie-within-a-movie of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown to the play-within-a-movie of All About My Mother Almodovar is a celebrant of the powerful sometimes overpowering identification that can occur between a spectator and a character on stage or screen. He knows how we can lose ourselves in the dark and perchance pick up pieces of somebody else in the process. So Zahara is not merely Ignacio transformed by hair and makeup but rather Ignacio filtered through the sieve of Audrey Hepburn and the Spanish siren Sara Montiel whose faces gazed down upon him in his hour of need.In much the same way Almodovar in Bad Education seems possessed by the spirits of James M. Cain and Patricia Highsmith. And so while much of the attention given to Bad Education thus far has focused on its seemingly ripped-from-the-headlines subject matter the indiscretion of Catholic priests is ultimately but one of many distorted illusions in Almodovars mirrored hallway. Part detective story part investigation of the nature of identity Bad Education is like all of its directors recent work a tightrope walk performed above the chasm between gravity and absurdity tragedy and farce. Only this time hes elected to juggle knives as he makes his way across that great divide. And if this film doesnt push the audience toward the same kind of rapturous emotional involvement as do All About My Mother and Talk to Her Im not sure that its supposed to -- by and large the emotional development of these characters got arrested around the age of 10.It should go without saying that Bad Education is visually stunning From the Saul Bass-inspired titles that tear across the screen to the startling Riefenstahl-like shot of rows of young boys performing school-yard exercises its images stick in your head for months afterward. (And I speak as one who first saw the movie back in May.) But it is Bernal himself who sticks in your head the most. After struggling to get beneath the skin of the sanctified Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries the much-touted Mexican pinup here has a part -- or rather three of them -- that he can really sublimate himself into. And he does just that shifting personae with a chameleonic ease that Tom Ripley might envy.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Bad Education | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bad-education ) Bad Education (Spain 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli In recent years few things have been more certain than the guarantee of something delicious from director Pedro AlmodA3var. AlmodA3var has become like a trusted brand name - reliable and consistent. Unfortunately with his new effort called Bad Education the streak ends. By ordinary standards this movie would be considered unremarkable. However by the standards this director has established Bad Education represents Bad AlmodA3var. If theres one genre with which AlmodA3var is incompatible its film noir. Known for his vivid often garish use of color AlmodA3var is not the kind of director who can work in the murky desaturated realm that defines film noir. He tries with Bad Education but the mismatch is apparent. The palette of hues is toned down but not enough to generate the intense atmosphere that film noir requires. At the same time the high energy that has defined AlmodA3vars career is muted. Bad Education introduces us to Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) an up-and-coming gay film director who is visited by a schoolboy chum Ignacio Rodriguez (Gael GarcAa Bernal). Back when they were pupils at a strict Catholic school the two were in love but Enrique had a rival for Ignacios affections the principal Father Manolo (LluAs Homar). Now years later the two have been re-united. Ignacio gives Enrique a story to read - a true account of their time together as boys with a fictionalized ending. Enrique decides to use this material for his next movie and agrees to cast Ignacio a struggling actor in a key role. But as filming progresses Enrique begins to have doubts about his leading man. Is this really Ignacio or is something more sinister at work? The films portrayal of Enrique leads us to believe that he is at least in part based on AlmodA3var. Its unclear which of the elements are autobiographical but drawing a parallel between Enrique and AlmodA3var during his earliest successful years in the 80s is entirely reasonable especially since the ""present"" sequences of Bad Education are set during that era. Every film noir must have a femme fatale or in this case an homme fatale (since the couplings are all homosexual and there are no significant female roles). Ignacio fills the part adequately but the mysteries explored by the script arent sufficiently compelling to draw the viewer in. Additionally theres little tension or suspense. When the big ""reveal"" occurs its greeted by both the director and his audience with little more than a shrug. Character development is weak perhaps in part because there are so many different variations on the key participants. We encounter Enrique and Igancio as kids as adults in Ignacios story and in Enriques movie adaptation of Ignacios story. AlmodA3var attempts to keep things straight by varying the movies aspect ratio (so we know whether what were seeing is ""real"" or ""dramatized"") but while this limits confusion it doesnt amplify character identification. The performances are fine and there are occasional flashes of the kind of inspired direction we have come to expect from AlmodA3var but ultimately Bad Education must be considered to be a minor effort from a major director.

Pedro Almodovars long-gestated instantly identifiable ""Bad Education"" welds autobiographical matter relating to his troubled religious education onto a classic noir structure repping a generic shift from the classy emotionally involving mellers that have dominated his recent output. Superbly orchestrated visually impressive pic has the potential to extend Almodovars offshore appeal beyond its already broad arthouse-to-crossover base. Pic has already presold to several major territories including the U.S. (where Sony Classics plans a fall release). Following its Spanish bow March 19 pic opens the Cannes Film Festival in May. ""Education"" as per every project by Europes premier arthouse helmer comes with a scent of scandal. Its release comes at a time when revelations of abuse are shaking the foundations of Catholicism in the U.S. Marketing will determine if and how this will affect the films commercial prospects. Classy 60s-style mock thriller credits courtesy of Juan Gatti open onto 1980 Madrid and the office of youthful but blocked movie director Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez). While going through newspaper clippings in search of inspiration hes interrupted by a wannabe actor and old schoolmate (Mexican thesp Gael Garcia Bernal) who gives Enrique a story hes written ""The Visit."" This friend it turns out was Enriques first love at the school they attended a strongly disciplinarian Salesian Catholic institution. Enrique reads ""The Visit"" which then turns into a film within the film. Transvestites Paca (Javier Camara wonderfully mannered in pics sole comic turn) and Zahara (also Garcia Bernal) are treading the boards in a seedy nightclub. After Zahara picks up a character called Enrique (Alberto Ferreiro) -- who falls asleep while theyre having sex -- he realizes Enrique is his old lover from school. Short of money Zahara revisits the school where he meets his former lit teacher Father Manolo (Daniel Gimenez Cacho). He attempts to blackmail the priest with stories about Father Manolos sexual abuse of a boy called Ignacio. Pic then flashbacks to the childhood of a boy called Ignacio (Nacho Perez) with Father Manolo playing the guitar on a river bank as Ignacio in one of pics few nods to the kitsch Almodovar of old sings ""Moon River"" for him. The following scenes which are films strongest depict the priests frustrated love for Ignacio in parallel with Ignacios developing love for a boy called Enrique (Raul Garcia Forneiro). Back in the movie proper Enrique decides to make the script his next project. His school friend-cum-actor is keen to play the role of Zahara. Enrique is not sure about this or even whether his pal is who he says he is. The latter storms off in a rage but accidentally leaves behind his cigarette lighter which has an address of a bar on it. This leads Enrique to Galicia in northern Spain where he meets the school friends mother (Petra Martinez) and finds out the truth. Almodovar aficionados will be reassured that most of his later stylistic hallmarks are present and correct abundant pop-culture refs in the form of cheesy Italian pop songs nods to classic movies (including ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"") and film posters; a brief trip to a pueblo which contrasts with the slick urban setting of the rest of pic; games with identity and fiction vs. reality; and as ever truckloads of transvestites. In terms of plotting ""Education"" is Almodovars most ambitious project to date. But the Russian-doll structure hangs together beautifully and parallels between the three main storylines cleverly lend a sense of mass to the whole edifice even when some developments are over-signaled. The price the pic pays for the pleasing complexity of its plot is a lack of room for maneuvering characterization. One of the joys of Almodovars movies has always been their offbeat throwaway lines or oblique ironic glances; here there are precious few of either. Humor likewise is scarce. The shift away from melodrama leads to a loss of the emotional undertow visible in recent Almodovar pics like ""Talk to Her"" and ""All About My Mother"" with their grief-stricken profoundly sympathetic protags. Its ironic that the most affecting moments are for the hateful but weak Father Manolo as he struggles to control his inner conflict. Other characters are largely a gallery of self-seeking types. The large cast is mostly fine across the board with Garcia Bernal nicely nuancing his overlapping roles (and acquitting himself well in a Spanish rather than Mexican accent). Gimenez Cacho is superb as the quiet-spoken stiff-backed Father Manolo his gaunt features registering both pleasure and shame. Whippet-faced Martinez plays Enrique rather too coolly given the emotional depths the character must be plumbing. Antxon Gomezs sumptuous art direction and Almodovars perfectionist eye pick out prettiness in even the least promising of images such as torn posters on an old cinema wall. But the visual assault of dense creamily rich colors and super-crisp light and shadow always framed to perfection feels at odds with the priests squalid morality. A lengthy swimming pool sequence is erotic but emotionally barren with an emphasis on beauty per se -- dripping buttocks slo-mo bodies under water -- thats closer to pop videos. Contrast between the repressive Spain of the boys childhood and the explosive moral release of the country during the late 70s -- in which Almodovar himself was a key player -- is elegantly rendered by small details. One example is how 60s actress Sara Montiel is shown later to become a gay icon. Tech credits courtesy of Almodovars stalwarts are outstanding with Miguel Rejass sound work deserving special mention. Alberto Iglesias jagged Bernard Herrmann-inspired score is suitably menacing.
