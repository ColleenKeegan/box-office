This feels in its way fated. Here well be with an epic battle on our hands not just superhero versus superhero but franchise versus franchise genre versus genre each one vying to become the film that will do the thing that previous and very worthy entrants--Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Jem and the Holograms Battleship any of the thousands of other films that conflate celebration of the past with cynicism about it--have failed to do to take us via a brazen belief in the power of nostalgia and a deep insistence on the circularity of time to Peak Reboot.Related Story Spinoff City Why Hollywood Is Built on Unoriginal Ideas My Big Fat Greek Wedding was the sleeper hit of the early aughts With a relatively unknown star and a 5 million budget it ended up becoming against all odds a big fat Greek smash. ""The film"" FiveThirtyEight notes ""spent almost a year in theaters and earned more than 360 million (inflation-adjusted) at the domestic box office to become the second-highest-earning romantic comedy in history (behind Pretty Woman)."" The plot if you dont recall was appealingly simple Toula (Nia Vardalos) a hardworking and devoted daughter of Greek immigrants falls in love with a non-Greek guy named Ian (John Corbett). They decide to get married. Toulas meddling overbearing family--walking cliches each and every one of them but charming nonetheless--meddles overbearingly. Many jokes about Greek American culture later Toula and Ian tie the knot. The end.The first film was fluffy and forgettable but it was redeemed by two things first its originality--the sense permeating the film that it was the writer and producer Nia Vardaloss quirky and loving and deeply authentic tribute to her own wacky family--and second its formulaic adherence to the time-honored traditions of the rom-com. Those two disparate things ended up (also against all odds) complementing each other. My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a big hunk of baklava layered nutty shockingly sweet. Not the kind of thing youd want to have every day definitely but totally fine in moderation.My Big Fat Greek Wedding the first one was a big hunk of baklava layered nutty shockingly sweet.All of that helps to explain why My Big Fat Greek Wedding despite its box-office success did not go on to enjoy the afterlife on cable and elsewhere that its fellow successful rom-coms--Pretty Woman Love Actually--did. It also helps to explain why Vardalos tried to make lightning (Greeced lightning?) strike twice spinning the movie into a TV show My Big Fat Greek Life. (The shows life was very very short.)It also helps to explain why some 14 years after the original came out the team has gotten back together for a feature-film sequel to My Big Fat Greek Wedding the bluntly named My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. And here is the case for that film claiming the title from the laconic clutches of Batman v Superman of Peak Reboot It manages to rehash the original almost entirely while lacking nearly all the things that made the first film despite its flaws compelling.The new Wedding finds Toula now a mother of a 17-year-old daughter (who is named Paris) grappling with Pariss impending departure for college. It also finds Toula grappling with what an empty nest will mean for her marriage to Ian which has in general sacrificed passion to partnership. Toulatoo is grappling with the fact that despite the independence she won for herself in the first film she remains in the thrall of her Big Fat Greek Family. (The film is not subtle about this. As Toula narrates ""Families that are close like mine we make it through bad economies and sickness and war because we stick together. But some of us just get stuck."")The big twist (spoiler I guess though its revealed in the trailer) The family through a series of accidents discovers that the person who married Toulas parents never signed their marriage certificate. (""Im a hippie"" Toulas mother shrieks with glee.) And so Mother and father having lived together in their Big Fat Greek House for decades must finally fully get married. The multi-adjectival Wedding in question here thus belongs not to Toula (or as the films promotional posters might suggest to Paris) ... but to Toulas parents.For the most part the film reflects the blunt ""2"" in its title It reads as perfunctory--as a reboot in search of a reason.This trick on the one hand allows the film to recycle many of the gags that made the original so well original. Hello again bottle of medicinal Windex. Hello again scene of middle-aged women getting hair-curled and face-spackled in a salon. (""Greek dont creak"" an aunt announces.) Hello again Toulas dads obsession with proving that all the worlds words derive from ancient Greek. Add to all that the fact that Pariss prom happens to take place at the exact same time as the wedding (a prom held in the afternoon? just go with it) and youve given Wedding 2 the opportunity to benefit from its own circularity Theres one particularly poignant scene that blends Toula and Ian Toulas mother and her father and Paris and her prom date (who is--surprise--also Greek) together into a lovely intergenerational triptych. Its the circle of life rendered through romance (and through John Legend).There are certainly moments of humor and sweetness in all this. Its hard not to experience vicarious delight when youre watching a family who loves each other dancing together at a wedding. (Also Toulas yiayia (Bess Meisler)--an older woman whos perhaps not as aged as she seems--steals every scene shes in.)Mostly though My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 reflects the blunt ""2"" in its title It reads as perfunctory. It reads as a reboot in search of a reason. The characters are thinly sketched (Corbett in particular is given very little to do; John Stamos and Rita Wilson cameo-ing as a local TV reporter and his wife have even less). The jokes are stale. The modern-day-ish updates (Toula teaches her dad how to use a computer a relative comes out as gay autocorrect changes ""spanokopita"" to ""spina bifida"") are for the most part more ""heh"" than ""haha.""The original film too was bolstered by the ideas it considered ideas that helped it to resonate among people who lack a Greek family of their own the immigrant experience that feeling of being both too much and not enough the broader question of what it means really to belong. The sequel given its plot might have accomplished the same thing What happens when marriage cools into mere companionship? What happens when the put-upon daughter becomes the put-upon mom? How do you balance the demands of aging parents with those of aging children?Those are interesting questions but My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 doesnt have much interest in exploring them--or rather its too rushed and too full to squeeze in thoughts about them between all its jokes about the ""seed"" of Alexander the Great. The sequel 14 years after lightning struck the first time is neither thoughtless nor joyless nor offensive; it is neither too complicated nor too simple. It is simply fine. It is simply there. And that of course is exactly what it is supposed to be a film that exists not fully on its own terms but as a cheerful and dutiful reminder of what came before.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2 ) My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (United States 2016) March 26 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli To the extent that My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is about cross-cultural pollination try this one out instead of ""Opa"" how about ""Oy Vey"" Yes theyre back and not because anyone was pining for their return. The ""lovable"" Portokalos family who charmed viewers in the fluffy 2002 surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding have returned to the big screen after a failed flirtation with the small one (in 2003s My Big Fat Greek Life). The intervening years havent been kind to them. Viewers for the most part have forgotten about them and the pathetic effort that is My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 isnt likely to give them a reason to remember. On a weekend when Batman and Superman will be slugging it out My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is likely to sink like a stone into the Aegean Sea (or at least Lake Michigan). My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a fun romantic comedy with a winning love story that although by no means original tossed in some fish-out-of-water elements as generic Caucasian Ian (John Corbett) found himself surrounded by the living caricatures of an extended Greek family. The film had a good time gently poking fun at Old World stereotypes. But writer/actress Nia Vardalos (with no small help from producer Tom Hanks) caught lightning in a bottle. Even had the long-delayed sequel represented great cinema (something its not close to) it wouldnt have been as well-received. The ""right time right place"" is a long time ago in a country far far away. What were left with is something that recalls Crocodile Dundee in L.A. - the misbegotten notion that bringing back characters long past their sell-by date is a good idea. This is a sit com. An 80s-style sit-com. A bad 80s-style sit-com. The dramatic situations are forced and artificial. The jokes are lame provoking (at best) half-hearted chuckles. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 needs a laugh track to tell us when were supposed to laugh. Watching this movie is painful because at one time I remember having liked these people. Now the best of them vary from inconsequential to insufferable. The caricature quotient has been amped up to an annoying level. The first movie used stereotypes to provide touchstones and add to the comedy. This time they define the principals. On top of that theres not much plot so the movie meanders for about 90 minutes before arriving at a tepid climax. The film takes place about 18 years after the original (time having passed a little more quickly in the screen universe than the real one). Ian and Toula (Vardalos) are still married. Hes a calm reasonable guy who has almost nothing to do throughout the film except occasionally to make calm reasonable proclamations. Shes a nervous wreck who in addition to being a helicopter parent is a helicopter daughter and sister. I guess thats what happens when you live next door to your in-laws. Ian and Toula have a daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris). At age 17 shes applying to colleges but while her parents want her to go to Northwestern (and live at home in Chicago) she longs for the distant wilds of New York City. Meanwhile Toulas mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) and father Gus (Michael Constantine) discover that the priest who married them a half-century ago never signed their license. So in order to legitimize their union they have to get married again. This time Maria doesnt want a rush-job - she wants a wedding and reception like her daughters. Most of the cast is back including John Corbett who gave the TV series a pass. He spends the film hanging around the periphery trying not to get in anyones way. Michael Constantine who was 88 years old when the movie was made seems not to be in the best of health so theres something a little sad about watching him gamely follow the scripts dictates. Nia Vardalos who was endearing in 2002 vies with Andrea Martin to see who can be more annoying. They have plenty of competition from the supporting cast. The only one (other than Corbett) to emerge unscathed is Elena Kampouris who does a nice job in a thankless role. Many sequels exist purely to make money. This movies easily predicted box office failure makes it difficult to figure out why it was produced. Thankfully the question of whether or not to see it is a lot easier to answer.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 review Same characters not as much fun - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 review Same characters not as much fun Trailer My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Nia Vardalos and John Corbett return as Toula and Ian Miller in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" opening in theaters March 25 2016. Nia Vardalos and John Corbett return as Toula and Ian Miller in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" opening in theaters March 25 2016. Katie WalshTribune News Service Back in 2002 ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" became a bona fide cultural phenomenon a romantic comedy that mined the cultural specificities of the Greek heritage of unknown writer and star Nia Vardalos. The film picked up an Oscar nomination for Vardalos original screenplay everyone began adding ""My Big Fat"" in front of various nouns and we all learned a thing or two about the versatility of Windex. Fourteen years later Vardalos and gang are back again for another wedding but this time its to drastically diminished returns.The screenplay feels as if it was written the year after the first films success just with a few jokes about Facetime inserted for 2016 topicality. The rest of the jokes either dont land or feel about as fresh as a two-day old spanakopita. The first half of the film is incredibly rough a stilted awkward affair where all the timing is off and none of the half-hearted physical comedy or Greek puns truly land. Part of this is due to Vardalos performance. She plays Toula with a dull listless deer-in-the-headlights gaze. This is clearly a choice for the story -- shes lost the romance and zest in her relationship since being a mom to teenager Paris (Elena Kampouris). At the urging of her Aunt Voula (absolute MVP Andrea Martin) who reminds her she was ""a girlfriend before a mom"" she finally puts on makeup and makes out with her husband the WASPy lumberjack Ian (John Corbett). This seems to wake her up a bit.Still the film has much ground to make up after the rocky start. While the marketing for the movie seems to suggest that her daughter is the one getting married thats a bait and switch. In actuality its Toulas parents who are having another big fat Greek wedding after discovering that their Greek marriage certificate was never signed. Once the wedding swings into gear ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" finally finds its footing. Vardalos as a writer chooses to celebrate Greek culture by consistently placing the family as other using uptight blonde white women -- judgmental neighbors and snooty wedding planners -- as the foils to illustrate their ethnicity as different or distasteful their habits and customs as weird or strange. Eventually Toula stands up to them and they accept their Greek neighbors but in the melting pot of America it seems like this exploration of culture sets different kinds of people apart as much as it brings family together.Theres also the matter of the films reliance on traditional marriage as a cultural institution and carrier of tradition and ritual. While some of the female characters express hesitation about it ultimately they all must embrace this type of coupling in order to come together. Not to mention the antiquated ideas about sex (""keep your knees together"" they admonish Paris) paired with the aggressive TMI about Aunt Voulas intimate life.

You can feel the strain all over this sequel to 2002s My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The charm of the original snuck up on us 14 years ago. The films star Nia Vardalos carved the script out of her own life as a woman who defied her Greek parents had a makeover and married a non-Greek Adonis. Actress Rita Wilson also Greek loved the concept and with her husband Tom Hanks produced the film with Vardalos in the lead.

The entire cast and crew is back -- director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Divine) is the only major newbie -- pushing the same brand of ethnic humor. And I mean really pushing. The appealing Vardalos returns as Toula Portokalos now settled into marriage with hunky Ian (John Corbett) a school principal. Raising their teen daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) has crowded sex out of their relationship though Toulas Greek family still crowds into every corner of her existence in Chicago. Loud and overbearing theyre lovable until theyre not. It doesnt help that Vardalos has written them variations on the same gags she used the first time. Her father Gus (Michael Constantine 88 and still eloquent just by shrugging his shoulders) keeps using Windlex as a cure-all and claiming that the Greeks invented everything this time updated to include Facebook. Her mom Maria (the ever-feisty Lainie Kazan) is getting tired of his act. So are we. Vardalos tries to add a feminist subtext Toula wants to support her daughters desire to leave home get into NYU and escape her suffocating family. And Maria thinks shes found an out when its discovered -- plot-stretcher alert -- that her marriage certificate to Gus was never signed by a priest. Shes free But the threat is toothless. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is really about getting Toulas parents remarried. Cue the big family reunion. Everybodys happy. But how can they be? Its tough to watch good actors especially Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula rinse-recycle-repeat the same jokes. Going back to the well too often helped end My Big Fat Greek Life the 2003 sitcom Vardalos developed from her movie in two short months. What once bubbled up from a sincere love of Greek family has now congealed into the all-too-familiar Hollywood tale of  milking a cash cow until cries for mercy. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 talks plenty about the need to change with the times. But no way does this movie buy into the concept of practice what you preach.

(George Kraychyk) Nia Vardalos and John Corbett reprise their roles in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.(George Kraychyk) review My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Sequels antics feel tired and dated Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 25 2016 1201AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 24 2016 331PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Kirk Jones Written by Nia Vardalos Starring Nia Vardalos John Corbett and Michael Constantine Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2016 Country USA Language English Immigration can pose a particular burden on parents They exchange their ability to raise their children in their own culture for prosperity or security in another. Perhaps the cultural loss explains why some first-generation North Americans are so notoriously anxious that their children marry within their ethnic group. That sorrowful tension lies at the root of Nia Vardaloss work including the 2002 sleeper hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding and now its belated sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. Yet the Winnipeg-born writer and actress is so determined to bury any unpleasantness underneath overblown ethnic stereotypes and sentimental story lines that her comedy can feel painfully superficial. Ah yes the Greeks - crazy but fun. Pass the baklava.So 14 years later Vardalos has reassembled the whole funny gang for another kick at what is already a sadly dented can. If the overbearing parents and looney aunts were passably amusing the first time out when at least their antics were balanced by a strong romantic storyline about the ugly-duckling Toula (Vardalos) and her forbidden WASP boyfriend they now seem really tired and dated.This sequel which suffers from rather slack direction by Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) features fewer memorable lines than the original and less lively comic performances from some of the principals - in particular Michael Constantine as the now-aging patriarch Gus and Vardalos herself.The first third or so just feels like a series of comic skits or standup lines wandering about in search of a movie as Vardalos reintroduces all the familiar characters in Toulas smothering Chicago family. Its still headed by the dictatorial Gus the hyper-patriot who can find the Greek root in any English word and uses Windex for every ailment. Putting up with him is the chief responsibility of Toulas big-hearted mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) while her domineering Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin one cast member who never flags) continues to regale the world with tales of her odd growths and swellings. On the other hand the wizened grandmother Mana-Yiayia (Beth Meisler) never says a word.The stalwart Ian Miller (a pleasant but underused John Corbett) the ever-tolerant outsider Toula married last time out remains surprisingly happy to live next door to his in-laws and has done some crucial work on his Greek comprehension. The one new character is Paris Toula and Ians teenage daughter who is busy applying to out-of-state colleges so she can escape all this. (Elena Kampouris does a rather touching version of a deer caught in the headlights.)There are many plot lines here but little tension Maybe Toula has turned into an overprotective parent herself. Maybe her marriage to Ian is getting stale. Maybe Gus can actually prove he is a direct descendant of Alexander the Great or at least snag Paris a Greek boyfriend. Finally when it turns out that the priest never signed Gus and Marias wedding certificate back in the old country Vardalos has her excuse for another Greek wedding.From there the movie trundles along at a more satisfying pace as the script makes various predictable points about holding tight and letting go while Jones moves the cast through a wedding-planning comedy sitcom style. As Toula and Ian privately re-enact their own nuptials behind a screen at the main event this whole affair looks less like a wedding feast and more like reheated leftovers.

Daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) is choosing a college Theres an episode. One of the cousins (we would never spoil who) is secretly gay And so on.All the while the familys ""wacky"" behavior feels increasingly forced. Its one thing to be close and fiercely protective of one another but when the entire extended family shows up at Paris college fair and begins to muscle a recruiter they look less like a tightly knit family and more like a group of enabling maniacs.The driver of the story is a magically unearthed marriage certificate that shows Gus and his wife of 50 years Maria (Lainie Kazan) were never officially married. That sets up the wedding of the title and gives the family something to fuss and fret and be loud over creating all sorts of false drama.It never works. The jokes about the familys obsession with their Greek heritage are back (all words can be traced back to Greek see even chimichanga) as are the gags about Windex being an all-purpose fixer. But no amount of Windex can fix this stinker.

The sequel is predictable tired formulaic. by Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Close icon Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Perfection were told takes time. Guess thats why it took 14 years for Hollywood to deliver a sequel to My Big Fat Greek Wedding the 2002 sleeper hit that became the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time. I hate to disappoint but unlike 14-year-old single-malt scotch theres nothing special about the new film. Imaginatively titled My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 its a carbon copy of the first picture but without any of the fun. Predictable tired formulaic it makes up for its lack of originality with a bigger budget louder jokes louder costumes and louder music. The first film was something of a watershed. It was successful as a romcom despite leads who didnt look like they belonged in Teen Beat. Set in a middle-class Chicago neighborhood it followed the lives and loves of ordinary-looking slightly overweight - ethnic-looking - folks. Nia Vardalos unassuming picture starring the writer herself as a Greek American whose romance with a WASP (John Corbett) is almost ruined by her meddlesome family was made for 5 million and has brought in more than 368 million. Fans will be delighted to learn that the core cast returns for the sequel including Andrea Martin Gerry Mendicino Ian Gomez and Bess Meisler (as the awesome Yiayia). Theyre joined by a few new faces including John Stamos as a local TV news anchor and Rita Wilson who coproduced both films as his wife. Fourteen years on the Portokalos clan is as close as ever - the entire extended family lives next door to one another in a row of houses on the same street. Toula and Ian (Vardalos and Corbett) have a good marriage and a great teenage kid Paris (Elena Kampouris). But their lives are once again thrown into chaos when Toulas parents Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) discover that their marriage license was never signed. Gasp Theyve been living in sin for 40-odd years When Gus says their priest will sign a new one Maria balks. She kicks him out of the bedroom demanding he take her out on dates and properly propose before shell have him back. Get past that thin reed of a premise and youre in for 90 minutes of madness and mayhem as the clan comes together to put on a memorable wedding for the couple. Never mind that virtually every joke and gag is based on an ethnic stereotype that has been exaggerated to a grotesque degree. The fake Greek American accents are grating. More troubling still director Kirk Jones picture has very little of anything we might recognize as film acting. Like so many comedies today the performers dont try to inhabit their parts. Instead they stand around the set in awkward highly self-conscious poses and throw their lines at each other. Add to this the films saccharine definition of love and its shallow moral lessons and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 becomes a pretty objectionable picture. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 Published March 25 2016 -- 301 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > Game of Thrones Emmy chances next year?

"Review My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 squeezes you in a warm familiar embrace - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 squeezes you in a warm familiar embrace Review My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 squeezes you in a warm familiar embrace George Kraychyk / Universal Pictures Bess Meislers left and Elena Kampouris characters share a moment together as part of the Greek American Portokalos clan in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" Bess Meislers left and Elena Kampouris characters share a moment together as part of the Greek American Portokalos clan in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" (George Kraychyk / Universal Pictures) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter In an era when family films are almost exclusively comic book adaptations and animated adventures ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is a relative rarity a big-hearted relationship-driven movie suitable for a multi-generational audience. No computer-generated cities were harmed in the making of this film -- although a few cliches are pounded relentlessly.As with the original romantic comedy a true word-of-mouth hit that became a box office juggernaut in 2002 ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" finds a universal story in the saga of the suffocating Greek American Portokalos clan. The sequel is a little like a bear hug from a beloved old relative -- the embrace is too tight the perfume is too strong but ultimately it still leaves you feeling good inside. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The first film based on star and screenwriter Nia Vardalos one-woman theater show earned an Academy Award nomination for original screenplay and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for its cast and yielded a short-lived sitcom. Its depiction of a loving -- if crazy -- immigrant family inspired by Vardalos own seemed to catch a cultural moment when audiences were embracing sincerity. Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 walks a precarious counterprogramming path taking on Batman v Superman Steven Zeitchik Ever since Adam and Eve came upon a second tree in the Garden of Eden mankind has been intrigued by counterprogramming. Sure theres an appealing option right in front of us but maybe the other one is a little better? That stretches in a rather different manner all the way to the current moment... Ever since Adam and Eve came upon a second tree in the Garden of Eden mankind has been intrigued by counterprogramming. Sure theres an appealing option right in front of us but maybe the other one is a little better? That stretches in a rather different manner all the way to the current moment... (Steven Zeitchik) Fourteen years later that tone may be a harder sell. This time Vardalos Toula is the daughter of the bride as Lainie Kazans Maria and Michael Constantines Gus discover that their 50-year marriage was never actually official. As her parents deal with marital doubts Toulas own daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) is college shopping and hoping to get some breathing room from her hovering brood.Vardalos mainly sticks to her formula. As in the original film which was directed by Joel Zwick the characters are broad and the conflict comes from tensions between the zany first-generation Greeks and their more toned-down Americanized heirs.Thanks to the charisma and warmth of the older cast members working this time under the laid-back direction of Englishman Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"") this works more often than it doesnt and even familiar jokes manage to land.The filmmakers still rely on sitcom-style gags -- the reveal of a gaudy backyard wedding tent the excessive spritz of a bottle of Windex -- but Vardalos wisely surrenders much of the screen time to her supporting cast and what the movie lacks in polish it makes up for in soul. Constantine delivers an appealing mixture of bravado and bumbling as Gus a man claiming cultural superiority who doesnt know how to use a computer mouse. According to Gus the Greeks invented everything even Italy and now hes on an Internet quest to confirm that he is a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. In a sequence that will feel familiar to anyone who has ever introduced an older relative to Google this quest will take a village. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Its easy to see why the family hovers in Marias orbit as Kazan too projects a confidence and earthy sense of fun even when shes just presiding over her kitchen island. Later in the film when Maria wonders whether a life with Gus was all her destiny held Kazan reveals the vulnerable heart beating under the muumuus. Andrea Martin is also a scene stealer dispensing unsolicited advice (""Shave everything"") with brio.Unfortunately Vardalos and John Corbett who returns as Toulas unfailingly patient WASP husband Ian have a lot less appeal than their older counterparts. Ian is as underwritten as any bland wife character in an Adam Sandler movie and his saintly tolerance for his in-laws leaves Corbett with precious little to do while Vardalos mugging style of acting fails in selling their love. The plot line that this marriage is in a passionless rut may be almost too believable -- at a certain point its not clear these two people even know each other.Perhaps charisma skips a generation because as teenager Paris Kampouris manages the impossible task of playing a sulky adolescent youd actually want to spend time around. Her timing is funny and true in appalled reactions to her grandfathers premature concern for her fertility and her mothers clinging and her budding romance with a cute schoolmate (Alex Wolff) feels sweet rather than saccharine.Its unlikely ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" will ever match the jaw-dropping box office success of the first film but it matches it in one important regard -- heart. And as sequels go you could do a lot worse.rebecca.keeganlatimes.com------------My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2Rated PG-13 for some suggestive materialRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Adam Sandler Andrea Martin Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-greek-wedding2-review-20160325-story.html,200,mybigfatgreekwedding7,mybigfatgreekwedding,latimes

The sequel is a fairly hokey romantic comedy with its fair share of flaws and exactly none of that matters to the 67 trillion fans of the original movie who have patiently waited 14 years for more of the chaotic Portokalos family. Nia Vardalos who created this juggernaut returns in the role of Toula Portokalos dutiful daughter in an extended Greek family. The story picks up 10 years after the first instalment and Toula and her Anglo husband Ian (John Corbett) are now members of the sandwich generation. Their family duties include guiding their somewhat rebellious teenage daughter (the luminous Elena Kampouris) through her university admissions while juggling their responsibilities to the older generation -- Toula helps out at Dancing Zorbas the family restaurant drives her aged parents to doctors appointments and stays on top of whatever the family crisis du jour might be. The entire cast of the original movie is back for this sequel including the redoubtable Lainie Kazan as family matriarch and Michael Constantine as outspoken dad Gus. Those two are at the centre of the story as a glitch in their marriage certificate means they have never legally been married. After 50 years and several children they have to tie the knot again. Yes Another wedding Well not so fast. Maria wants a proper proposal and in the meantime she goes on strike. Gus is horrified to find shes no longer cooking or doing the laundry. The geriatric standoff doesnt last very long and then the over-the-top wedding preparations can begin. But despite the happy nuptials not to mention Gus hectoring his granddaughter to find a husband My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 casts a cold eye on notions of romance and happily ever after. Relationships the movie suggests are more complicated than that. And they require work. And maintenance. As with the original movie Vardalos uses humour to put her point across. Like every sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has the disadvantage of familiarity. The original visual jokes -- Windex bad fashion exaggerated cultural emblems -- dont have the punch of the first go-round. On the other hand My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has the advantage of familiarity you already like the characters and youre rooting for them the family is as manic and troubled as any other (yours even) and the situations are comical but based in reality. Over and above all that pleasant stuff the movie has Andrea Martin who returns as bossy Aunt Voula sometimes dispensing her gonzo brand of sexual advice and sometimes confiding her list of bizarre medical curiosities. She alone may be worth the price of admission.

George Kraychyk/Courtesy of Universal hide caption toggle caption George Kraychyk/Courtesy of Universal Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) gives romantic advice to Toula (Nia Vardalos) in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. George Kraychyk/Courtesy of Universal Its been 14 years -- and one failed TV spinoff -- since Nia Vardalos My Big Fat Greek Wedding became an unlikely pop phenomenon grossing 241 million domestically in theaters alone off a 5 million budget. And its probably taken that long to understand why it took off where so many others didnt Celebrations of ethnic cultures were not uncommon in the indie world especially if food was involved (e.g. Eat Drink Man Woman Big Night etc.) and neither were Hollywood-style romantic comedies on a shoestring. But somehow that combination marshaled around Vardalos magnetism as writer/star crossed over to the mainstream. Plus the Greek jokes landed. The original movie ended in a happily-ever-after postscript that didnt suggest a sequel but the entire family has returned for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and save for a wrinkle or two its as if a day hasnt passed. Those running gags on Windex and the Greek roots to all words have not stopped running and the ratio of broad comedy to broader sentimentality is just as laboratory-precise. Vardalos is so keen on bottling that old magic that her character even retreats to the restaurant where she waitressed in humbler times and puts on the old coke-bottle glasses again. Marvel sequels are scarcely less conservative. And yet its comforting to break bread in Vardalos cheery Chicago enclave again even if youre being served yesterdays dinner out of the microwave. The distance between the original and the sequel actually helps in some regard When Gus (Michael Constantine) the lovable old patriarch of the Portokalos clan unfreezes his car-door lock with a blast of Windex the nostalgic kick is almost Proustian. He only needs to cruise 10 feet down the block before the rest of the family comes bounding out of the gaudy Greek flag-themed homes that line the neighborhood. Their familiarity is the sequels primary bliss. When last we visited House Portokalos Toula (Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) had their big fat Greek nuptials moved into a cozy place next door to Toulas parents Gus and Maria (Lainie Kazan) and were seeing their daughter Paris off to Greek School. Now Paris (Elena Kampouris) is about to ship off for college and shes bucking against her overprotective parents who have the Portokalos instinct to keep her close to home. Meanwhile familiar old marriages are starting to go stale In raising Paris Toula and Ian have forgotten about each other and attempt to rekindle the flame. And while delving into a genealogy project Gus discovers that his marriage certificate was never signed so he and Maria have spent the last 50 years ""living in sin."" The second official wedding between Gus and Maria gives My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 the requisite explosion of taffeta and baklava not to mention an equally generous resolution of dramatic subplots. Gus gets a chance to reconcile with his long-estranged brother (Mark Margolis). Paris goes to prom. Toulas cousin Angelo (Joey Fatone) accounts for why he isnt so great with the ladies. Toula and Ian prepare for life as empty-nesters. And on and on and on. In most other circumstances the abundance of tearjerking payoffs would be shameless but the very concept of too-muchness is built into the machinery. This is not My Quaint Tasteful Limited-Invitation Wedding. This one will wake up the neighborhood. As with the first one My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 seems like a more comfortable prospect for television where the mini-dramas of the Portokalos family can have more room to stretch out. But since the sitcom My Big Fat Greek Life was a sure thing that wasnt -- airing only seven episodes on CBS in 2003 -- Vardalos has brought the franchise all the way back to square one. That she and her cast particularly the wondrous scene-stealer Andrea Martin have produced a crisp carbon copy of the original is no small achievement given the time between movies. As ambitions go however it doesnt get much punier.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Entertainment 03/24/2016 0700am My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Four houses worth of unsubtle fun Nia Vardalos and John Corbett in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" | Universal Richard Roeper Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Entertainment Newsletter Receive Theater Celebrity amp; Entertainment related Updates Sign-Up When they turned the 2002 feature film ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" into a CBS sitcom called ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" just a year later the premiere episode drew a whopping 22.9 million viewers -- but a mere seven episodes later ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" was dead. Too bad. I always thought in the right hands the sweet and funny albeit broad and sometimes stereotype-embracing adventures of Nia Vardalos late-blooming rose and her ridiculously close extended family could have made for a wonderful long-running TV hit. Now nearly a decade and a half after ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" exploded as a critical and word of mouth hit grossing some 241 million in North America Vardalos Toula returns to the big screen in a sequel thats never subtle rarely surprising -- and as rich syrupy sweet and satisfying as a tray of homemade baklava. The eminently likable Vardalos (who scripted the original and the sequel) is front and center as the now 40-something Toula -- but ""MBFGW2"" is a true ensemble comedy with Vardalos having only a little more screen time than about a dozen other characters including  John Corbett as Toulas Anglo husband Ian the principal of the Chicago high school attended by their 17-year-old daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris).  The magnificent veterans Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as Toulas parents Gus and Maria. A running joke has Gus explaining how every term every piece of history and every person he encounters is Greek. (""The Greeks invented Facebook"" Gus says with the upmost confidence even if his explanation is beyond flimsy.)  A typically hilarious Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula.  Joey Fatone as Toulas cousin Angelo who is considering coming out of the closet.  Bess Meisler as Mana-Yiayia the mostly silent great-grandmother who might not be as out of it as she appears to be. The sequel finds Toula at a crossroads. Her only child has gone from calling her ""Mommy"" with unabashed glee to exasperated moans of ""Mother"" when shes embarrassed by mom; her travel agency has closed down and shes back working at her parents restaurant; and she and her husband are so busy with work and parenting and family issues the romance has disappeared from their marriage. Meanwhile Toulas parents learn they were never legally married so they make plans to rectify it but not without much drama. (Merely going to work and school in the morning comes with much drama for this family. They wouldnt have it any other way.) Paris feels smothered by her family and is considering attending school a thousand miles away; Gus estranged brother is about to visit from Greece and the neighbors disapprove of the loud histrionics of the family that has four -- count em four -- side-by-side houses on one street in an otherwise quiet neighborhood. Director Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"" ""Nanny McPhee"") juggles the interconnecting plots in nimble fashion keeping things moving along at a brisk pace. (The running time is a shade past an hour and a half.) The screenplay by Vardalos includes some sharp one-liners some beautifully touching moments -- and a few visual gags that seemed forced and land with a thud. (Many of these bits involve the Yiayia character but she does have a nice moment with her great-granddaughter late in the film.) Ive never been a huge fan of Corbetts laid-back granola-smile style but hes serviceable here in a quiet supporting role. John Stamos has a cheesy cameo as a cheesy anchor for ABC-7 News whose trademark phrase is ""Hey Now Chicago"" (Hed last about a week with that.) On the plus side Vardalos is wonderful and 88-year-old Michael Constantine casually pockets every scene hes in as the Greek patriarch who reminds me of just about every Greek patriarch Ive ever met. He wears his Greek pride on his sleeve he believes Greek daughters and granddaughters should marry fine young Greek men but hes modern enough to accept into the family a man with character and heart. Oh and hes convinced hes a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. Five minutes after he meets you hell be telling you about that.  Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Kirk Jones and written by Nia Vardalos. Running time 94 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for some suggestive material). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Comments click to enlarge My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Video Rated PG-13  94 minutes  2016 This unnecessary sequel reunites most of the cast from the 2002 indie sensation and then lazily recycles its narrative score themes catchphrases and sight gags almost beat for beat. Instead of the traditional Greek father (Michael Constantine) imploring his middle-aged daughter (Nia Vardalos who also scripted) to find a husband before she gets ""too old"" he repeats the line to her 17-year-old daughter (Elena Kampouris) but his ploy doesnt work. Vardalos and Kampouris appear uncomfortable together as if theyre trying on their roles as helicopter mom and angsty teen whereas most of the returning players struggle to dust off their characters quirks and stay animated. Andrea Martins uncouth Aunt Voula is still a riot and Vardalos still strikes sparks with hunky John Corbett but the cuckoo magic that made the original film a sleeper hit has been diluted to fit a Hollywood paradigm of soppy unimaginative nostalgia bait.

John Corbett stars as Toulas husband Ian and Elena Kampouris stars as their troubled teen Paris. In theaters March 25. (Credit Universal Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A Greek woman who married against her familys wishes now has a willful daughter of her own.CAST Nia Vardalos John Corbett Elena KampourisLENGTH 134RATED PG-13 (sexuality and racy humor)BOTTOM LINE Old jokes and little plot but the charming original cast almost compensates. Fourteen years ago ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" became the female ""Rocky"" of its day. Its star Nia Vardalos turned an autobiographical stage show into a sleeper hit film about a Greek wallflower who falls for a forbidden outsider. A rom-com with no name-brand stars ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" charmed audiences with its gentle ethnic jokes underdog story and endearing cast of kooky characters. On a 5 million budget it earned 368 million. Vardalos returns as Toula still married to John Corbett as Ian in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" Also here is virtually the entire original cast even Bess Meisler as ancient Mana-Yiayia still dressed in villager black. Vardalos once again wrote the screenplay. Whats missing is the organic real-life warmth that made the first film so magical. advertisement | advertise on newsday By contrast this sequel feels born in a studio conference room. Its an uneven combination of two unrelated and paper-thin narratives. In one Toula is experiencing deja vu Her daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) a sullen high schooler mortified by her loud Greek relatives has applied for colleges far far from home. Meanwhile Toulas cantankerous parents Kostas (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) have discovered their old-world marriage certificate is incomplete -- theyre not technically married. StoryLI Greeks to unite for Big Fat screeningCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016PhotosBest movies on Netflix Thats where the second big fat Greek wedding will come from but until then well have to sit through a great deal of padding. Maria wants Kostas to re-propose but he refuses. Paris waits for acceptance letters. Kostas estranged brother (Mark Margolis) flies in for a reunion. Someone comes out as gay because thats how these movies go. Old jokes get recycled -- Kostas still has an odd obsession with Windex -- rather than freshened up. None of it strikes a genuine chord partly because the newer characters are so hastily written and partly because the directing by Kirk Jones (""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"") feels perfunctory. Still the vivacious cast -- especially Andrea Martin as bawdy Aunt Voula -- can occasionally liven up the material. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" may not be a wholly cynical exercise but Vardalos heart clearly isnt in it.

(Universal Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 24 2016My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2Starring Nia Vardalos John Corbett Andrea Martin Michael Constantine Lainie Kazan and Elena Kampouris. Opens March 25 at GTA theatres. Directed by Kirk Jones. 94 minutes. PGEarly in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 devoted daughter Toula (Nia Vardalos) persuades her Windex-spritzing father Gus (Michael Constantine) to have a piece of baklava - which of course means a lot of it.""Ill bring the tray"" she tells him.Article Continued BelowThe movie is like that too. This belated sequel to the record-setting 2002 romantic comedy goes full baklava happily loading on the sweet fun. Those who loved the original should at least like the sequel which remarkably has reunited all of the players from the oversized cast.Anyone who somehow missed the first movie or maybe doesnt enjoy baklava can take comfort in knowing that this Greek-immersion experience is painless - and also relativity brisk at a running time of 94 minutes.Writer/actor Vardalos recycles all of her jokes mainly the one about the immense immigrant family in Chicago (Toronto again stands in) that ""sees no difference between hugging and suffocation.""The 10-years-after story finds Toula and her gentle WASP hubby Ian (John Corbett) vainly looking for some alone time to rekindle their romance while at the same time clinging to their college-bound teen daughter Paris (new face Elena Kampouris).Kirk Jones directs employing the family whimsy he mastered in Waking Ned Devine and Nanny McPhee. He and Vardalos hit all the sitcom beats bouzouki music signalling them like a Greek take on Seinfelds funky bass.What about the wedding? The contrivance here isnt that Toula and Ian are forced to remarry which would have been too much. Instead its Gus and his bride Maria (Lainie Kazan) discovering that their half century of wedded fuss isnt legal since the priest neglected to sign their marriage certificate. What to do?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry March 24 Follow stephmerry Nia Vardalos returns as Toula Portokalos in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" (Gold Circle Entertainment/Universal Pictures) How many laughs can Nia Vardalos wring out of the fact that shes Greek? Were about to find out. Fourteen years after ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" became a box office smash and 13 years since the television spinoff ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" bombed were being served another helping of ethnic comedy with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" The characters have aged but the jokes remain the same. Everything about the movie directed by Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"" ""Everybodys Fine"") is familiar down to the introductory voice-over by Toula (Vardalos). For the uninitiated she explains just how close-knit her family is. Multiple generations of the Portokalos clan live on the same Chicago block spending more time together than any family should. By the end of the first movie which centered on Toulas wedding she had come to terms with her meddling relatives. Now shes seeing her suffocating reality through the eyes of her daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris). A mildly rebellious A student the 17-year-old is mortified by her family especially her grandfather Gus (Michael Constantine) whos constantly telling her to find a Greek boy and settle down. Understandably the teen is strongly considering a college far far away. Meanwhile the relationship between Toula and her husband Ian (John Corbett) has lost its spark partly because Toula is so distracted by her efforts to fix her familys problems. Those problems include her octogenarian fathers quest to learn how to use the Internet so that he can find out if hes a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. More pressing Gus discovers that a priest never signed his 50-year-old marriage certificate so he and Toulas mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) technically arent married. And thats how you reverse-engineer a wedding. After all a story has to stay true to its title. Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) left finds many ways to overshare with Toula (Vardalos) right. Its one of the many recurring jokes that are barely warmed over from the original. (George Kraychyk/Universal Pictures) These narratives dont so much unfold as flail. Whats worse none of the quandaries feel particularly urgent. Toula and Ian may not act like newlyweds anymore but theres no real risk of infidelity -- or worse divorce. And while Maria gives Gus a hard time pretending that she might not actually marry him the ceremony is never in doubt. As for Pariss decision between New York University and Northwestern? That actually sounds like a nice dilemma to have. Which brings us to the rehashed comedy. Gus is still explaining how every word has Greek origins. Hes still carrying around Windex touting it as a cure-all. And Toulas Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) is still oversharing details about her unsavory anatomical quirks. At least Vardalos still has an easy screen presence. But she has given herself a lot less to do this time around. Mostly she just stands around reacting to the zany supporting characters that flit in and out. With so many warmed-over jokes youd think that the delivery would at least be on point. But everything including the timing feels off. One montage -- set to ""We Are Family"" -- is too groan-inducing to be forgiven. In the end the movie feels one laugh-track away from a bad sitcom. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains discussion of sex. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint As the title suggests ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" has quite a bit in common with its predecessor. The first became a surprise megahit through an unusual combination of elements an ethnic immigrant romantic comedy. In 2002 when we first met Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos who wrote the script) she was a 30-year-old Hellenic wallflower in need of a makeover. The first line from her kind but domineering dad Gus (Michael Constantine) was ""Youd better get married soon. Youre starting to look old"" This time hes giving identical advice to Toulas teenage daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) whos applying to college far away to escape her Chicago clan where everybody is in each others business. This follow-up feels like a greatest hits collection. If you remember Gus stubborn belief that any word from any language has a Greek root or any problem can be solved with Windex youll find a lot to enjoy here. Toulas husband Ian (John Corbett) has risen from being a high school teacher to principal her old travel agency has closed and a new pair of star-crossed lovers are headed to the altar. Gus and Maria (Lainie Kazan) learn that their priest in the Old Country failed to sign their wedding license making them officially unmarried. Maria demands that Gus make a proposal more romantic than his original ""Im going to America. You coming or not?"" The movie is aiming for a funny and touching portrayal of old age but thinks that honesty and comedy are incompatible. The films approach to character and humor is clearly styled for an elder audience that prefers repeating a punchline at high decibels until it settles in. I suspect that director Kirk Jones told the cast ""Remember play it loud youre performing. Were not real people here."" My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some suggestive material. Andrea Martin as the take-charge aunt overplays expertly. Prepping Toula for a hot relationship-reviving date with Ian she sends her off to the shower with the order ""Shave everything."" Joey Fatone returns as Toulas brother with hammy gusto. Their performances are meatier than Vardalos. She pushes her former leading part to the sidelines making the blustered Toula smile with the forced friendliness of a perfume counter clerk. Whats being presented here is broad jokey burlesque material delivered at a defective rhythm against an ""Isnt this funny?"" soundtrack. It shows us a world where every family problem can be fixed by hugging or buttering garlic bread. Theres certainly an audience for that.

For one thing theres no reason that sequels trailing their predecessors by a decade-plus should be limited to summer blockbusters and cult comedies. Hollywood studios are often correctly charged with catering unproductively to a dwindling audience of teenagers and boy-men and a Greek Wedding follow-up certainly doesnt embrace that demographic. A smaller-scale 14-years-later sequel also presents opportunities to ruminate on the passage of time; in this way My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is at least on paper more akin to Before Midnight than to Jurassic World. Then again My Big Fat Greek Wedding doesnt especially need charity. The 2002 romantic comedy and family farce played for months and made more money than any movie that year not based on a comic book or another movie. Its star and writer Nia Vardalos has done well enough for herself that most of her subsequent film appearances have been starring roles in movies she also wrote. None have come close to Greek Weddings success but what does? Some of these projects have danced around sequelizing her big hit; she reunited with onscreen husband John Corbett for 2009s (mostly loathed) I Hate Valentines Day and a sitcom My Big Fat Greek Life ran for an abbreviated single season during the tail-end of the films theatrical release. That was over a decade ago--almost two full presidential administrations and countless Spider-Man movies--but My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 doesnt offer much sense of how much time has passed since its predecessor. More time in fact has gone by on screen than it has in real life; the daughter of Greek gal Toula (Nia Vardalos) and decidedly non-Greek guy Ian (John Corbett) glimpsed in the first movies epilogue but born well after the events of that 2002 film is now a 17-year-old high school senior. This means that Paris (Elena Kampouris) is weighing her college options with her parents and extended family now hoping against hope that she chooses to stay close to home in Chicago. The smothered have become the smothering the meddled-with have become the meddlers and Paris is appropriately mortified by this turn of events particularly her mothers neediness.Yet the movie doesnt push too hard at the idea of Toula assimilating herself back into her familys roving pack of loud meddlesome Greeks because it doesnt push too hard at any of its unbaked subplots. Toulas family angst shares screen time with another set of wedding plans when her parents Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) find out that they were never technically officially married. This is of no more consequence than any other storyline in the Greek Wedding series but it does give a substantial part to longtime character actor Kazan who hints at a lifetime of accumulated regrets in the run-up to her de facto remarriage. Maria has spent her life attempting to sooth a cranky Greek nationalist obsessed with Alexander The Great working for no pay at a diner whose clientele seems to primarily consist of her extended family and occasionally John Stamos (although its not clear if Stamos cameoing as a handsome newscaster as part of his recent and slightly smug goodwill tour actually orders anything). Kazan briefly taps into a reservoir of sadness about the small joys and noisy agonies of her family life and the movie rushes to resolve her story without quite looking her in the eye.Theres also a sort of accidental poignancy in the movies constant reminders of what a limited performer Vardalos remains even after all these years. In the first film her lack of on-camera practice gave Toula a gawky charm that fit the characters wallflower profile. Fourteen years later shes been polished into looking just plain uncomfortable. She spends much of the movies opening moments staring straight ahead with an expression of vaguely terrified consternation and even in her more relaxed scenes later on her arms often appear rigid at her side. Even her physical comedy basics like spit-takes and pratfalls seem to happen on a mechanical delay maybe because shes often isolated in the frame or paired again with the singularly inexpressive Corbett. They dont have a decent straight-man act between them. Vardalos also hasnt grown much as a writer peppering her script with stock joke phrases like ""you cant unsee that"" and ""... said no one ever."" She somehow restrains herself from using ""dont go there"" or ""awk-ward"" Theres been a slight upgrade in directorial pedigree from sitcom vet Joel Zwick to twinkly feature director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) but My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 often looks washed out and Jones has limited ideas about funny staging. His go-to move is mashing two to 10 people together into an awkward scrum then cutting to Vardalos or Paris watching with wide-eyed discomfort. The would-be secret weapon is Andrea Martin as Toulas aunt mugging like crazy and entering every scene as if waiting for a studio audience to cheer her on; the whole movie is full of laugh-track-ready pauses.Amidst all those pauses all those still-running gags about Windex and Greek origins of words and all those wispy subplots there is the passage of time--always present but only occasionally commented upon. The movies denial of the finite is so pronounced that when Paris attends her prom with a guy shes barely talked to (Alex Wolff brother of Nat and every bit the poor mans version) the bittersweetness of beginning a new relationship as shes preparing to leave for college never lands. Everything in the movie winds up feeling mindlessly cyclical Gus is ailing but maybe Windex will heal him where physical therapy cannot. Toula and Ians child is leaving the nest and all Toula can do is joke about adopting another baby. The Greeks like many people behave as if theyll all live forever and the movie never quibbles. Maybe Vardalos should revisit this material when shes ready to write My Big Fat Greek Funeral.

MOVIE REVIEW MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING 2 Running time 94 minutes. Rated PG-13 (suggestive language). Some things like ouzo and flaming cheese are best left at single servings. Its understandable that creator/writer Nia Vardalos would come back for seconds with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" -- after all the first was a sleeper megahit -- but 14 years later this reunion of cuddly-but-tiresome stereotypes makes you wish shed left well enough alone. Toula (Vardalos) and her genial WASP hubby Ian (John Corbett) are now the parents of a teenager; the goth Paris (Elena Kampouris) chafes at the smothering Portokalos family and longs to go to college far away. As Toula says her relatives ""see no difference between hugging and strangulation."" Director Kirk Jones (""What To Expect When Youre Expecting"") lays it on thick the entire extended clan popping up every time someone goes out to get the mail. The men gripe about the women the women gripe about the men and someone brings out a plate of spanakopita. Joey Fatone (from left) Louis Mandylor Gia Carides and Stavroula Logothettis are back in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" A trumped-up excuse for more nuptials has Toulas father Gus (Michael Constantine) discovering a technicality that means he never officially married her mom Maria (Lainie Kazan). Hes expecting a tirade but she laughs it off ""Im a hippie"" Kazan -- who does have a wonderful laugh -- gets the most interesting storyline with Maria planning a lavish wedding but eventually questioning her entire culture. ""In my day you were raised to be married"" she says and its a lament rather than a lecture. Meanwhile Toula struggles with a marriage thats lost its sizzle amid work teen-wrangling and caring for elderly parents (a savvy plot point for an audience thats likely to skew on the older side). Gus becomes obsessed with proving theyre all related to Alexander the Great via online genealogy but cant figure out how to turn on a computer -- another supposedly hilarious bit. John Stamos and Rita Wilson make wholly useless cameos as neighborhood newcomers. ""MBFGW2"" brings back most of the familiar faces from the first film -- hi Joey Fatone -- and its nice to revisit this ensemble of real-looking people. Occasionally Vardalos still makes a sympathetic narrator rooted in a believable world of worrying about love and money and dealing with a demanding family and making it all work. Andrea Martin has a ball as racy Aunt Voula. One sibling even comes out of the closet. But these bright spots are mostly drowned out by the big fat sequel machine in which everything must be twice as clownish the second time around. Even the ever-resourceful Toula is no match for that.

That was way back in 2002 and now we have ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" Whats next ""Sweet Home Alabama The Next Generation?""The movie brings back most of the cast from the original. That means more Michael Constantine (loud) and Lainie Kazan (even louder) hamming it up as the heads of a sprawling Greek-American clan in Chicago.The action still centers on Toula (Nia Vardalos) who is married to studly school principal Ian (John Corbett). Toula frets constantly about her aging father and her college-bound daughter who is about to leave the nest. ""You baby your parents because you cant baby your baby anymore"" someone tells her offering the kind of musty illogical advice that passes as wisdom in this film.The plot hinges on Toulas parents learning they were never actually married which means its time for another overproduced wedding. The ceremony also gives her stuffy Anglo neighbors a chance to raise their noses and tut-tut about how loud Greeks are. It creates a weirdly meta moment in which stereotyped supporting characters offer stereotypes about the stereotyped main characters.Is Toula (Nia Vardalos) pointing out to Ian (John Corbett) just how long ago the original ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was released? (Photo Universal Pictures)The movie wheezes about with actors offering spit takes (Vardalos) and getting hit in the head with volleyballs (Vardalos again). When those moments dont elicit laughs you are left with awkward silences that just hang in the air. That happens a lot here.The script written by the actress is downright wretched at times. Major developments are introduced and resolved within four minutes. Everyone runs around and talks about being Greek; rather than simply just being Greek. Theres a big difference.The movie also thinks its audience is as dumb as the characters. Throughout the film Toulas daughter is torn between Chicagos Northwestern University and New York University. When she receives her college acceptance letters her father tells they are from ""Northwestern University in Chicago and New York University in New York"" Just in case viewers arent aware where New York University is.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

(George Kraychyk) ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" The Portokalos family is back flailing through another complicated wedding -- and many batches of baklava -- in a remake thats as sweet and insubstantial as dessert. 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" isnt really a sequel not any more than your latest batch of baklava is a sequel to the previous one. Its a remake featuring all the same ingredients cast members and themes (namely parents trying to control their childrens lives swarms of relatives constantly showing up unexpectedly and insanely elaborate weddings to be planned). Considering how virtually none of the cast members appear to have aged in the 14 years since the original youd swear that it actually is the first movie or was perhaps constructed from outtakes. That said these characters have at least theoretically moved on. Toula (Nia Vardalos who wrote both films) and her husband Ian (John Corbett) are now the parents of a photogenically cranky teen named Paris (Elena Kampouris) who -- horrors -- is talking about leaving home to go to college. Though Toulas happy in her marriage her life has gotten a little stale; she spends her time taking care of her garrulous parents (Lainie Kazan Michael Constantine) and working at the familys Greek restaurant where shes taken to wearing the Brown Smock of Doom that symbolizes -- as it did in the first movie -- that she needs a makeover. Movie Review    My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 with Nia Vardalos John Corbett Lainie Kazan Gia Carides Joey Fatone Louis Mandylor Michael Constantine Andrea Martin. Directed by Kirk Jones from a screenplay by Vardalos. 94 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some suggestive material. Several theaters. And presumably because Paris is too young to get married and this film cant exist without a wedding Toulas parents learn that due to a technicality on their wedding certificate theyve never actually been married. Cue the multicolored wedding cake the hanging lights the buffet tables and the Greek dancing Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Will Paris go to college? Will Toula figure out how to keep her hair looking bouncy?) gets wrapped up by the hour mark. But Vardalos has created a community of characters and players so likable it seems almost mean to criticize -- like picking on ones own annoying but beloved relatives. So let me just say that I found a few moments to enjoy -- particularly Andrea Martins Aunt Voula who likes to explain her medical problems to strangers and the performance-artist-like great-grandmother played almost wordlessly by Bess Meisler. But if ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3"" comes to theaters I might stay home. And call my mother. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a forgettable sequel to a forgettable movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Is an Ode to Family Heritage That Should Have Broken Tradition My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Is an Ode to Family Heritage That Should Have Broken Tradition Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 23 2016 706 PM My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 This ode to family heritage would have done better to break with tradition. By David Ehrlich Its hard to feel like youre missing any of the jokes in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 when every punch line is practically written out on cue cards. Above Nia Vardalos and John Corbett. Universal Pictures My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the most successful romantic comedy of all time but only if you measure success with silly metrics like ""money."" Despite grossing 368 million (off a 5 million budget) the film left almost no impression on pop culture. Heralding writer and star Nia Vardalos as the Yakov Smirnoff of the Mediterranean the box office juggernaut permeated the summer of 2002 like a heat wave thats remembered only for the records that it broke. There are certainly rom-coms that have left a more significant legacy--in fact there are tweets that have left a more significant legacy (e.g. that one in which Jaden Smith asked a rhetorical question about mirrors). It was a product of a different time--before video on demand and streaming complicated the indie film business--a time when distributors could plant a movie in theaters like it was a sapling and watch it sprout money for months on end. It was three years before Judd Apatow broke through to a mainstream audience and changed the tone of modern comedy to something a bit more self-aware more pointed and more disparaging in its path toward empathy. Advertisement And yet some things are timeless. The beauty of heritage is rooted in the fact that it never changes and new generations tell the same old jokes about it in order to make sure of that. My Big Fat Greek Wedding struck a chord with audiences in part because it was so overtly attuned to the continuum of tradition the universal difficulties inherent to the process of reconciling the sanctity of the old world with the instability of the new one. It was a comedy as sweet thin and forgettable as a Hallmark card--the kind of movie that felt like it had been made with a laugh track in mind (a suspicion confirmed by the fact that Vardalos promptly leveraged her success by adapting the megahit into a short-lived sitcom). It was the kind of movie that insists upon being written about in the past tense because not a single person has watched it in the 14 years since it came out. The first problem with My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (other than the fact that it doesnt have a fun subtitle e.g. My Big Fat Greek Wedding The Reaping) is that it assumes that audiences took these eminently forgettable characters home with them. On the one hand it repeats so many of the same jokes that it almost doesnt matter. On the other there are enough callbacks that it feels like Vardalos has presumed an intimate knowledge of the Portokalos family and all of their zany traditions. Theres a fine line between making a movie for everyone and making a movie for no one. A Greek chorus of aunts and uncles who seem to be able to appear whenever its comedically convenient the rabble of Chicago immigrants is still up to all of their old tricks. Toula (Vardalos) a bookish everywoman whom we first met as the put-upon daughter of two oppressively Greek parents is now paying it forward as she raises a daughter of her own. Ah the circle of life. When shes not volunteering at her kids high school Toula can be found chauffeuring her aging father Gus (Michael Constantine) to his various medical appointments and bemoaning her sexless home life with her cosmically bland husband Ian (John Corbett). Gus and his long-suffering wife Maria (Lainie Kazan) are already pressuring Toulas daughter to find a Greek husband. But then an ironic twist It turns out that Gus and Marias marriage license was never signed by a priest (oops) and so technically theyve been living in sin for the last 50 years. Theirs is the ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" of the title or at least it will be if Gus can summon his long-dormant romantic side and prove to Maria that he truly wants to be with her--one of many cast members who are reprising the roles they originated in the first film the 88-year-old Constantine does serious yeomans work as he carries the whole film on his sloped shoulders and on the strength of his puppy-dog eyes. It all leads to a reasonably charming sequence in which three generations of Portokalos women slow-dance with their respective paramours as John Legend(opoulos) croons over the soundtrack. Advertisement Yes even Toulas daughter gets in on the action. Inexplicably named Paris (Elena Kampouris) shes a high-school senior whos struggling to decide whether she should go to college at nearby Northwestern or leave her family for the exotic wilds of New York University. Her dilemma reaffirms that both of the My Big Fat Greek movies are ultimately about compromise about the things that we must lose--or the traditions that we must loosen--in order to make our own peace with this life. Through being a daughter Toula learns that marriage doesnt have to mean the end of romance; through having a daughter she learns that an empty nest doesnt have to mean the end of parenthood. These niceties might mean something if they werent so generic. In fact for a film that promises to explore a very specific community (and then as per the title a specific tradition within that specific community) My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is broader than Donald Trumps international policy. Im sure there are knowing smiles of recognition that are reserved here for people raised in traditional Greek families but its hard to feel like youre missing any of the jokes when every punch line is practically written out on cue cards. Prioritizing access over insight Vardalos writes jokes the same way that the New York Post writes horoscopes and her movie should prove relatable to immigrants their children their grandchildren anyone from a large family anyone who has ever had parents and anyone who has ever known a parent (not even necessarily his or her own). Theres a fine line between making a movie for everyone and making a movie for no one and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 drives a minivan right over it. Top Comment personally I would have gone in a darker direction namely ""My Big Fat Greek Divorce The Grexit""  More... Join In Perhaps thats the point that all American children of immigrant families feel as though theyre alone in their suffering when in fact the idea that we all must endure slightly different shades of embarrassment is part of what holds this country together. And thats a nice thought but Vardalos sands away so many layers of specificity that her characters ultimately arent even people so much as they are fleshy punching bags. That approach ripples through the casting all over again Andrea Martin (the saucy Aunt Voula) is still played by an actress whose Armenian grandparents moved to the U.S. from Turkey but I guess everyone is Greek at the end of the day. The films transparent attempts to offset that imbalance are so clumsy and half-assed that you wish they wouldnt have bothered John Stamos (the artist formerly known on Full House as Jesse Katsopolis) is a spectacular waste of time as a handsome local newscaster whose son is a romantic prospect for Paris. You wish they hadnt bothered trying to update the jokes either. Some business about teaching Gus how to use a computer so he can learn something on Ancestry.com (or its nonunion equivalent) is a C plot that never goes anywhere. At one point Toulas nephew complains that the word spanakopita was autocorrected to spina bifida on his homework. On the bright side the Windex jokes are kept to a minimum. It might seem inevitable that My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is such a shameless cash grab but its hard to argue that the movies existence isnt validated by its focus on the passing from one generation to the next. Here is a movie that encourages you to give it the benefit of the doubt at every possible turn but has no interest in offering anything in return. If you liked the original youll like this one less. If you loathed the original may God be with you. Opa David Ehrlich is a staff writer at Rolling Stone and a film critic for Slate. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Elena Kampouris is Paris the younger generation shown with Alex Wolff as Bennett in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" Photo George Kraychyk AP Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Call it off 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Nia Vardalos has such a warm alert energy thats impossible to hate ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" even as its impossible to like it even a little. In a series of close-ups she is radiant with graciousness and humanity such that the movie is almost like an experiment to answer the question Is it possible for an engaging personality to take a bad movie and smile and glow it into being halfway decent? The answer is no and maybe thats for the best. If it worked here theyd be doing it everywhere until all the smiling would begin to seem a little sick. Yet ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is interesting in one way Its weirdly clueless so that the film ends up saying the opposite of what its trying to say -- unless the secret intent is to demonstrate and emphasize the toxicity of large close families. Then it succeeds resoundingly. It would be a horrible thing to be born into such a family and even worse to marry into it. In the latter case youd only have yourself to blame. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is the sequel to the first installment a sleeper hit from 2002 that was genuinely charming. Written by Nia Vardalos it told the story of Toula (Vardalos) and her large pushy Greek family and what happens when she becomes engaged to non-Greek Ian (John Corbett). Obviously this new film has to contain a wedding too and Vardalos comes up with the worst choice possible -- a wedding between Toulas parents played by Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan. You see theyve been married 50 years but -- oh no -- it turns out their marriage wasnt legal. So they have to remarry which would be the simplest thing imaginable except that with the exception of Toula and her long- long- long-suffering husband (Corbett) everyone in the movie acts like a moronic 8-year-old. So basically we have a movie that could have taken five minutes but is stretched to feature length solely through the stupidity of its characters. The result isnt amusing just irritating. As in the original film Toula is at the center of the film but this time as a servant and enabler. She lives with her husband and daughter in the house next door to her parents and on the same block as her other relatives. She spends her life mediating disputes and running errands -- and fretting that her teenage daughter might leave home when she goes to college. With this setup Vardalos writes herself into a box. She wants to present family as a demanding but ultimately positive and affirming force but she makes Toula into a victim a case of arrested development. Heres a middle-aged woman who is basically still a child who hasnt escaped her parents and who consistently places Mom and Dad over her husband. Her terror that her daughter might leave the nest just emphasizes her own failure to craft an independent identity. Dimly the movie acknowledges that reality but not completely. The movie does suggest that it would be better for her daughter to go away to school rather than stay in Chicago and in several places her husband implies that the awful family is putting a strain on the marriage. But Vardalos cant take the next step to have Toula disengage from her relatives because that would undermine her intent. So she ends up with a strange concoction a movie that refutes itself. Yet even that makes it sound more interesting than it is. In truth ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is an excruciating grind just scene after scene of people creating disturbances over tiny matters fighting over nothing and making Toula clean up after them. Everyone around her takes and takes and pretends to be giving and the crazy thing is that Vardalos herself almost knows it and yet somehow strangely doesnt.

Its a shame because when the original movie hit screens 14 years ago the tale of Toula a 30-year-old shaking off her overbearing-but-sweet Greek family and marrying a non-Greek became one of the most loved indie romcoms. This second serving of the Portokalos family doesnt quite have the same impact. Toula (played by Nia Vardalos who also wrote the film) is now a clingy mom to teenager Paris (Elena Kampouris). Her relationship with husband Ian (John Corbett) has fizzled out. Her dads obsessed with proving hes a descendant of Alexander the Great. Plus to top things off it turns out hes not actually married to wife of 50 years Maria (Lainie Kazan). Time for a big fat wedding If that sounds like a lot for one movie its because it is. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has so many storylines it feels like youre watching an entire season of Modern Family in fast-forward. There are laugh-out-loud moments mainly from Andrea Martin who returns as sassy over-sharing Aunt Voula. On the whole though the film rehashes a lot of the humor of the original Vardaloss script is as full of the same Greek-specific jokes family tussles and references to ""strong women"" as the first. Plus a joke about wedding-night sex - ""My mother told me just pretend to faint and your husband will take it from there"" - is very uncomfortable. Aside from that moment My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is so full of gooey warmth and family values that its easy to forgive its shortcomings. If you loved the first one youll happily sit through this one. Its just not quite as good.

I preferred this film to the original and I rarely ever say that about sequels I would recommend this a great watch with the family on the sofa if you didnt have a chance to catch it in cinemas.

(Photo Credit George Kraychyk) Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday March 23 2016 400 AM Title My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Film Info A Greek family deals with each other and nuptials. With Nia Vardalos John Corbett Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine (134). Director Kirk Jones Rated PG-13 for some suggestive material. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is like baklava. Its light sweet and nutty. But after indulging you might ask yourself ""Did I really need that?"" In 2002 ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was a sleeper hit. A rom-com about a fairy-tale romance and culture clashes the film put Nia Vardalos on the map as a writer (she got an Oscar nod) and actress. A short-lived TV series followed a year later. Whatever shes been up to since Vardalos hasnt been refining the script for this sequel. Its serviceable but a little rough around the edges -- and in need of more laughs. The story picks up nearly two decades after Toula (Vardalos) and hubby Ian (John Corbett) a high school principal tied the knot. Their marriage has been unwittingly back-burnered. Toula is otherwise preoccupied. If shes not focused on her aging eccentric parents Maria and Gus (Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine) shes dealing with kooky Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). Or Toulas helicoptering around 17-year-old daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris). The girl rightly feels suffocated. Her raccoon-lined eyes are a subtle form of rebellion. Eyeliners her defining trait -- in this movie every character gets just one. All in the family The sequel to the charming ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is less so. (Photo Credit George Kraychyk) If youre a fan of the original movie that might be enough. And youll be glad to see so many stars reprising roles plus a couple new faces. John Stamos and Rita Wilson have a cameo as spouses who join the family shenanigans. While searching the family tree Gus realizes he and Maria were never legally married. As plans are made to remedy that on the double everyone -- husbands and wives parents and children -- takes stock of their relationships. Among the lessons learned marriages need tending and distance can make people closer. Not earth-shaking but harmless. Like this sequel.

Now Vardalos is revisiting--and recycling--the movie which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay with a harmless but forgettable sequel. As the title suggests most of the action revolves around nuptials. This time Toulas parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) discover after more than 50 years of not-so-wedded bliss that their marriage certificate is invalid. The entire family rallies to legally bind its matriarch and patriarch while Vardalos stuffs the rest of her screenplay with shallow plotlines from Toulas moody daughter (Elena Kampouris) wanting to go to college far from home to Toula and Ians attempts to revitalize their marriage. Vardalos sticks as close to her original script as possible lifting lines and re-creating entire sequences from the first film. Its not a bad strategy; after all the original is the highest-grossing rom-com domestically of all time. But the winking ethnic jokes werent all that revolutionary in the first film and this time around they feel even more stale. With the original Vardalos and Corbetts easygoing chemistry and the charm of Toulas slightly insane but loving family pushed My Big Fat Greek Wedding to sleeper success. But the 2016 edition feels more like the short-lived ill-received TV spin-off My Big Fat Greek Life overly broad and ultimately unfunny. The result is a tired and unnecessary retread that not even a healthy spritz of Windex can cure.

Do not RSVP. Do not check the registry and send gifts. Nia Vardalos and John Corbett in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Universal Pictures But you should ask onetime celluloid bride Nia Vardalos why it took a whopping 14 years to churn out such an ill-conceived comedy (out March 25). The actress and screenwriter stumbles badly in her attempt to re-create the magic of her surprise 2002 hit. Nia Vardalos Shirtless John Corbett Get to Work on My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Set Photo It remains the highest-grossing rom-com indie of all time by the way as well it should be The story of an introverted self-deprecating single 30-year-old woman trying to achieve autonomy from her close-knit Greek family resonated deeply in the hearts of millions. We fell in love with Toula and the Windex-obsessed Portokalos clan and to this day their timeless and often hilarious antics hold up remarkably well. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 George Kraychyk/Universal Pictures The cast returns in this follow-up all looking like theyve properly aged 14 years (some better than others). Not too much has changed since Toula married non-Greek Ian (John Corbett). Shes back to working in the familys Dancing Zorbas diner in Chicago. The couples daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) -- seen walking to school in the last scene of the original -- is now 17 and ready for college. They still live next door to Toulas parents Gus and Maria (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan). Also in the neighborhood her patronizing older sister goofy younger brother oversharing Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) and multitude of cousins (read Joey Fatone and a bunch of randoms). My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Trailer Brings Laughs as Toula Becomes Her Parents Watch Great. Were all caught up. But now Vardalos actually has to like give them something to do. This is where the film begins to languish. Instead of a simple story she offers up a hodgepodge of lazy and trite episodes. Toula and Ian have difficulty recapturing the spark in their marriage. Gus wants to see if hes a descendant of Alexander the Great. Gus cant work the computer. Paris rebels against her parents and wants to be a loner. (Rebelling = wearing a lot of eyeliner a la Ally Sheedy in The Breakfast Club.) Somebody is gay. Elderly Mana-Yiayia is kooky. Gus and Maria learn they were never legally wed in the old country more than 50 years ago. Cue an excuse to throw another wedding. All the plots are blah sitcom material at best -- and in case you dont remember theres a reason why the CBS spinoff My Big Fat Greek Life lasted all of seven episodes in 2003. Elena Kampouris in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 George Kraychyk/Universal Pictures The underlying problem with nearly all comedy sequels is the lack of freshness. The once-sharp jokes are now recycled and they rarely earn the same laughs. So prepare to get restless when Toula undergoes yet another frumpy-to-glam makeover and Voula describes the mole removed from her backside.And we get it Gus If you give him any word he will prove that it is rooted in Greek origins. Even ""Facebook.""Everything that was once endearing about this bustling family now irritates. A jam-packed backyard roast to welcome the new in-laws is credible; that same entire fam showing up to Paris college fair -- and threatening an admissions offer from Northwestern University -- is just silly. And though Maria whines about settling down too early in her life her poor granddaughter Paris is constantly pressured to find a date and mate. No wonder the teen wants to ditch these people. To Vardalos credit she still has a warm presence. More than a decade after the Wedding theres something emotionally satisfying about her and Corbetts breezy onscreen marriage. We want them to stay together and prove a neurotic Greek and an easygoing Episcopalian vegetarian can live (relatively) happily ever after. But as far as this franchise is concerned its time for a divorce. Cant get enough of Us?

Tuesday March 22 2016 at 1030 a.m. By Bilge Ebiri EXPAND Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The joke was on me when I first saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding back in 2002 I watched the film at a press screening that also happened to be attended by a large group of older female tourists. While I grimaced through the movies obvious gags and not-ready-for-prime-time direction these folks ate it up laughing cheering clapping. I didnt like the film but it was hard for me to feel too bad about something that occasioned such joy. OK maybe it wasnt a good movie I conceded but at least it was a nice one. Nevertheless I left that screening confident that this tiny indie release would be quickly forgotten and relegated to the dustbin of history.Greek Wedding became a runaway hit of course eventually making 240 million and placing in the box office top five alongside the likes of Spider-Man and that years Harry Potter Star Wars and Lord of the Rings entries. Its magic had eluded me then but rewatching it recently I found myself enjoying its awkward unglamorous charm. Back in 02 the ugly-duckling rom-com concept seemed so tired especially as such movies rarely starred someone who wasnt in fact a sylphlike beauty gone undercover. By contrast the unglamorous likable writer-star Nia Vardalos felt like someone you might actually know. I had also failed to catch how the films gently humorous observations about Greek families carried near-universal appeal in a nation of immigrants; with a few subtle shifts the lead characters overbearing boisterous chatty family could have easily been Jewish Italian Arab or Turkish.Film Details My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time94 min. More Info Trailer That same spirit is partly evident in the sequel the imaginatively titled My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 which picks up the same characters some years later. The jokes are mostly the same though a couple have been updated in obvious ways. (""The Greeks invented Facebook. We called it the telephone. "") Toula (Vardalos) and her WASP husband Ian (John Corbett) now have a teenage daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) whos considering attending college outside of Chicago to be free of her smothering family. Its easy to see why. In the opening scene Toulas Windex-toting father Gus (Michael Constantine) gives Paris some familiar advice ""Youre starting to look old. You gotta get married."" When he said this to thirty-year-old Toula at the start of the first film it felt like a bit of old-country quaintness. When he says it to a teenager here it feels kind of creepy.The wedding this time turns out to be Guss own. He discovers that his original marriage certificate to Maria (the great Lainie Kazan) was never signed which means that technically speaking theyre not actually husband and wife. He thinks the situation can be cleared up and their matrimony made official pretty quickly but after years of dutiful companionship Maria wants Gus to make her an honest-to-goodness romantic proposal; apparently his first consisted of the words ""Im going to America. You coming or not?"" Hes too proud and maybe too old to get on bended knee. So she resists.The original carried near-universal appeal in a nation of immigrantsBut then well she doesnt. It is one of the structural facets of these Greek Wedding movies that no narrative challenge ever hangs around for long; obstacles are set up and knocked down within minutes. As Maria and her fellow Greek ladies try to put together a kitschy blow-out wedding a professional planner appears for one montage -- and then quits. Gus has a brother he left behind in Greece who shows up for the ceremony and appears to resent Guss success -- for about thirty seconds. One of Toulas relatives is hiding the fact that hes gay from his family -- and is then told its OK. Its all over in like five minutes. If youre being charitable such looseness adds to the films offhand homespun quality. Really though its a sign of carelessness.Theres little drama here but there is a touching sense of reflection. In the first film Toulas desire to do something more with her life and her attraction to the hunky Ian drove the story. Now we see the way love fades across generations. As Gus and Maria try to remember what romance even felt like Toula and Ian can sense it slowly draining from their own lives. (""Remember you were a girlfriend before you were a mother"" Toula is somberly reminded.) Meanwhile Paris seems to experience her first burst of romance at school. None of these elements are handled with much grace or nuance A convenient prom subplot shows up for Paris at just the right point while Toula and Ian have one abortive date night which is good for a couple of easy laughs.But again its a nice movie. Not a good one or a well-made one or a smart one but a nice one. It relies on our fondness for these characters and performers to paper over its many many rough spots. Thats the sequel formula in general but follow-ups arent usually looking back at their originals across a chasm of fourteen years. Will those who adored the first film remember it or care enough to go along for the ride? It seems iffy. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has some charming moments but bank on this Itll be quickly forgotten and relegated to the dustbin of history. And Im never wrong about such things.My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Directed by Kirk Jones Universal Opens March 25 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Reuniting the entire main cast and much of the crew of its predecessor My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 concerns you guessed it another big fat Greek wedding. While the lengthy period between installments may have diminished some of the enthusiasm of the originals fans this effort should garner decent box-office returns in its counter-programming slot opposite those dueling superheroes Batman and Superman. Taking place ten years from where we left off the sequel finds Toula (Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) knowing what it is to be smothered by well-intentioned (yet overbearing) family trying to use a lighter touch with their 17-year-old daughter Paris (newcomer Elena Kampouris). The high-spirited Paris is dealing with typical teenage concerns including her infatuation with shy classmate Bennett (Alex Wolff) and deciding where to go to college. Her parents are naturally pressing her to stay in Chicago and attend Northwestern but she wary of her mothers endless hovering is seriously eyeing -- horrors -- NYU. The central plot element is the revelation that thanks to a priest having apparently forgotten to sign his name on their marriage certificate Toulas parents Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) are not actually husband and wife. Maria initially laughs it off but becomes enraged when Gus refuses to propose again and kicks him out of their marriage bed. The tension escalates with Gus stubbornly refusing to give in but when he gets sent to the hospital after getting stuck in the bathtub he has a change of heart. And so the wedding preparations begin. A running gag involves Gus desperately trying to prove that hes a direct descendant of his hero Alexander the Greek with much would-be humor derived from his attempting to use a computer for the first time. We also learn that Toula and Ians love life has become rather stale something they try to correct by making out in their car parked in front of their house with predictably disastrous consequences. Considering the fourteen-year gap between installments Vardalos doesnt seem to have put a whole lot of effort into the script as the above summary indicates. On the other hand why should she since the original wasnt exactly a hotbed of originality either. This sequel employs the same crowd-pleasing elements as the original with heavy doses of broad ethnic humor sitcom-style gags (Gus is still obsessed with Windex) and paper-thin characterizations. That it all works to the extent that it does is due to its undeniably sweet depiction of a close-knit extended family whose members truly care for and help each other. Its cinematic wish fulfillment in this era of broken families and far-off relatives who keep in touch via social media. Amazingly the whole gang is back including among others Andrea Martin reprising her hilarious turn as the wisecracking Aunt Voula; Gia Carides and Joey Fantone as Toulas cousins the latter revealing a secret about his personal life; Louis Mandylor as her overprotective brother; and Bess Meisler as the elderly family matriarch who here gets an amusing makeover. Newcomers include Mark Margolis as Gus brother who journeys from Greece to attend the wedding and Rita Wilson (who once again serves as producer along with hubbie Tom Hanks) and John Stamos as a married couple who pop by periodically. All of the performers play their roles to the energetic hilt managing to make them likeable even at their most obnoxious. Even the settings are familiar such as Dancing Zorbas the bustling Greek restaurant owned and run by Toulas parents. Although the story is set in Chicago the film was shot in Toronto continuing that citys enviable record of being able to stand in for just about every North American metropolis. Vardalos and Corbett display the relaxed romantic chemistry that made them so endearing to audiences in the first film (if less so in their second co-starring effort I Hate Valentines Day). And such veterans as Kazan and Constantine (the latter 88 years old God bless him) demonstrate that theyre still pros when it comes to getting laughs. Newcomer director Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee Waking Ned Devine) proves as adept as his predecessor Joel Zwick at hitting the required comic beats and the soundtrack cleverly includes a version of Billy Idols ""White Wedding""... sung in Greek of course.

Making a sequel to one of the biggest sleeper hits of all time is a tall order and scribe-star Nia Vardalos let 14 years pass before revisiting her breakout success with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" Whether or not audiences feel like it was worth the wait will depend heavily on how much theyre up for a family reunion Literally the entire major cast returns in this simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished follow-up. Every bit as sitcom-ish and saccharine as its predecessor but considerably less distinctive ""Wedding"" redux will unquestionably fall short of the originals massive 241 million domestic gross. But the curiosity of a presumably still-loyal fan base should at least allow for a respectable honeymoon period opposite ""Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice"" before this Universal release settles into its natural habitat as cable-TV filler. Critics didnt exactly flip for Vardalos feature length ethnic joke-cum-romantic comedy when it first opened and no one predicted that it would garner phenomenal word-of-mouth B.O. success or multiple award nominations (including an Oscar nom for Vardalos original screenplay and a SAG ensemble nom for the cast). So all the critical carping in the world may not matter a damn where this follow-up is concerned either. Still its just about impossible to imagine lightning striking twice -- especially since Vardalos seems to have used up all her best Greek-specific gags the first time around. Family remains the driving force of the story Toula (Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) are dealing with their perpetually angry 17-year-old daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) who feels like her parents are every bit as overbearing and embarrassing as Toula always found her own mom and dad. Cue Toulas proud Greek immigrant father Gus (Michael Constantine) coughing ""payback"" under his breath at the family restaurant. Paris hopes to go to college as far away from the familys home in Chicago as she can get (although shes also considering Northwestern) and Toulas realization that she may soon lose her baby girl isnt sitting too well even if it means an opportunity to rekindle the romantic spark with Ian thats been all but snuffed out by the passage of time. If the first films arc was essentially ""Toula learns to stop feeling smothered and love her family again"" the second films arc is essentially ""Toula learns to stop smothering and love her family again."" But the title mandates that theres still some kind of wedding in the works and Vardalos concocts a whopper of a justification for that It turns out the marriage license of her parents Gus and Maria (Lainie Kazan) was never signed by a priest before they left Greece for the U.S. meaning theyre not legally married (or something). Gus immediately wants to rectify the problem but Maria seizes the unexpected opportunity to re-evaluate wedded life and consider her options. The threat of Maria abandoning her marriage after 50 years is never very real (especially when like everyone in the family shes unforgiving in her belief that all singletons should settle down) but its what passes for drama in Vardalos cluttered screenplay. Even when Paris takes it upon herself to ask the boy (Alex Wolff) shes crushing on to go the the prom one family member comes out of the closet and Gus long-lost brother (a solid yet underutilized Mark Margolis) arrives for the wedding Vardalos seems pathologically afraid of introducing conflict -- as if the mere suggestion that things might not work out would be too much for her core audience to handle. More problematic is that the well seems to have run dry when it comes to Vardalos examination of Greek-American culture however shallow it was to begin with. She wasnt winning highbrow respect for her indulgence in romantic-comedy cliches and stereotypical first-generation immigrant family behavior the first time around but there was a specificity to the reference points that added a modicum of flavor. This time its Gus who does most of the heavy lifting -- still toting around his beloved Windex and claiming every word invention and person has Greek roots -- but aside from an obsession with using Web-based ancestry archives to prove hes a direct descendant of Alexander the Great theres no fresh twist to the shtick. Assuming the directing reins from Joel Zwick (who made two more features after ""Wedding"" and then returned to his sitcom roots) helmer Kirk Jones gives the film a pedestrian polish that falls more in line with his recent underwhelming output (""Everybodys Fine"" ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"") than his breakout crowdpleaser ""Waking Ned Devine."" And the tech contributions some of which come from returning artisans like production designer Gregory Keen are nothing special. Both Vardalos and Jones know that the magic such as it is comes from the cast and if auds prove willing to give the limp dramatics and wan comedy a pass itll be solely because they enjoy spending time with the characters. Now a clingy mom and burned-out wife back working in a familys restaurant Toula is a less sympathetic figure than she was before and Vardalos feels a bit rusty when it comes to physical and verbal humor. Corbett charming enough the first time out is basically window dressing here while supporting players Joey Fatone Gia Carides and Louis Mandylor all hit the same notes. Andrea Martin remains the most significant scene stealer as feisty Aunt Voula but even with a bit more screen time its emblematic of the pic as a whole that she doesnt get anything as quotable as ""What do you mean he dont eat no meat? Thats OK. I make lamb."" Film Review My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2Reviewed at Arclight Cinemas Hollywood March 17 2016. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 94 MIN.

It was very enjoyable and it was good to catch up with the family again... I smell a number 3 if and When Paris gets married... Reply carlosinator says April 12 2016 at 104 am My 21 yr old daughter and I saw My BFGW2 today and had a blast...loved it and recommend this movie as much as the first what fun. Reply carlosinator says April 12 2016 at 105 am OPA Reply Gail says March 26 2016 at 550 pm I just came from seeing-it is a nice continuation of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. People with nutty families will really appreciate it. It was great to see the next generations reaction to the craziness and closeness of their family. Reply mary says March 23 2016 at 758 pm When it comes to family it is nice to go to a movie when Moms and daughters can enjoy a film that is good and clean for once. We love BFGW1 and are making this opening a family event We cant wait to revisit the cast and the crazy Greek family antics. Hoping sometime later 3 will evolve. Reply Ian Dunbar-Reid says March 26 2016 at 536 am I have read some negative comments from the critics since going to see MBFGW2 this afternoon. I found it to be as wonderful as the first one and even left the cinema with tears in my eyes. Tears of joy. Its not often that happens these days. As a footnote when i came home I got my Lainie Kazan Body and Soul CD out and gave it a whirl. Real late night smoochie stuff. Luv ya Lainie. Reply Ruby Tiara says March 22 2016 at 708 am I hope all of you are wrong and that this is another great movie including the BO  Nia et al are what is lacking in Hollywood...stories that make you feel good no matter how corny they might be. I will be there on opening night. My big fat Italian family cant wait to see 2. Reply JD says March 21 2016 at 1035 pm In another episode of ""The Sequel Nobody Asked For"". Reply Marie says March 22 2016 at 1208 am Yup Reply John says March 21 2016 at 1016 am Nia Vardalos didnt let fourteen years pass before revisiting these characters. She let about fourteen minutes pass and then she embarked on writing and producing the short lived ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" TV series on CBS which crashed and burned back in 2003. Same cast except for John Corbett who was otherwise committed to his own new TV series. This one-note joke of a premise was played out way back then.

They survived the Turks. They survived a militant menagerie of gods and monsters with awful tempers snakes for hair and a taste for mortal flesh. The Greeks will survive ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2."" But it might be touch and go for a while. A sequel to the surprise 2002 hit this new comedy  naturally skips ahead quite a bit. Toula and Ian now have a daughter about to go off to college but Toula has turned into her parents - she cant bear to cut those apron strings just yet. Meanwhile her parents have their own problem - a clerical error that makes their wedding license invalid and is going to require a new ceremony. That is if they can stop squabbling long enough to say I Do. Heres my advice to audiences Say I dont. Star and writer Nia Vardalos is a genuinely sunny person who believes in old-fashioned romantic comedies. That I know is sincere. But her corny writing wraps it all up in pre-tested insincerity. Her movies like a 60s sitcom with the commercials cut out. Everybody is back for more - Lainie Kazan as her bellowing mother Andrea Martin as her TMI aunt John Corbett as the vanilla-on-white-bread Ian. Even 88-year-old Michael Constantine gamely returns as her Windex-worshipping father. Producer Rita Wilson drops by too for no good reason and John Stamos cameos as a hunky local newscaster. If youre Greek-American was it a law you had to be in this movie? Or just a kind of penance? And how the hell did Jennifer Aniston escape? MORE Nia Vardalos downward trend Meanwhile of course theres Vardalos herself whose Toula pours on the tiny adorable smiles like butter on a sheet of phyllo dough. Yeah we get it - shes sweet shes flaky. But wheres the spinach? Shes an empty hunk of spanakopita a bit of old pastry with nothing inside. And when the movie isnt asking us to marvel over what a nice patient person Toula is - well then director Kirk Jones just juices up the bouzouki music or cuts to an equally feeble subplot about Toulas daughter Paris and her college plans. It honestly feels mean to pick on Vardalos. Its like pushing away a particularly persistent puppy She doesnt mean any harm She just wants to be liked And shes got all these jokes about crazy Greeks OK so theyre mostly the same jokes she told in the first movie. And the brief television series ""My Big Fat Greek Life."" And her pretty weak Athenian-isles rom-com ""My Life in Ruins."" But you laughed then didnt you? Or at least politely smiled? So how about another portion? How about we push back from the table and go home? This may be Vardalos all-you-can-eat Greek buffet but you know what? This really is all I can eat. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations alcohol abuse and references to Lainie Kazans sex life. My Big Fat Greek Wedding (PG-13) Universal (94 min.) Directed by Kirk Jones.

I think not. Im pretty sure my wife a big fan of the original wouldnt be so enamored of it by todays feminist standards either. This after all is a movie about a 30-year-old woman -- our heroine Toula played by the films writer Nia Vardalos -- who needs permission from her father to take a college course. She also proceeds to engage in stereotypical behavior that weve mostly come to eschew over the last 40 years of the womens movement She gets contact lenses curls her hair and starts wearing makeup to represent an independent spirit as she goes after dreamy WASP Ian played by John Corbett. This was not a feminist tome. See Video My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 First Trailer Debuts on Today Its sequel ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" seems much more aware of the feminist movement; indeed the rights expectations and inclinations of the films female characters are its central subjects alongside some slightly on-the-nose commentary about marriages getting stale and empty-nest syndrome. To wit Toula is still married to the WASP but is now the hapless mother of a 16-year-old whom shes afraid of losing to the world. Paris (Elena Kampouris ""American Odyssey"") plays the daughter who cant wait to get far away from her mother and her big fat Greek family when she goes away to college. And who can blame her? These people are loving but irritating and are constantly all up in her business. The chafing of family ties provides the humor and the sweetness of ""MBFGW2."" As in the first film the jokes feature the sort of broad family characterizations that travel easily from one culture to another. They even recycle some of the jokes from the original movie patriarch Gus (Michael Constantine) still has a predilection for Windex and still believes that everything and everyone in the world is Greek and that all Greek girls should be committed to Greek boys just as soon as possible. Also Read My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 Adds American Odyssey Star Elena Kampouris (Exclusive) These jokes work mostly because they hearken back to the original film. The new material tends more toward the situational and the physical and winds up being less successful. When Gus gets stuck in the tub -- naked obviously -- and the guys in the family have to manage an extraction with a strategically placed towel its just not that funny. Gus pressures granddaughter Paris to find a Greek boy and go to college close to home which is exactly what he did to Toula in the first movie. This time however he catches some blowback from the women in the family including his beloved but obedient wife Maria (the ineffable Lainie Kazan) -- to whom it turns out hes not actually married. This is a plot point straight out of ""Love American Style"" but it leads to a storyline about women making choices for themselves and being recognized for all they do to make a family a family. The feminism here is nowhere near radical but the plot winds up having a little more girl power than the original. Plus it gives the movie a good reason to have a big fat Greek wedding in it and to have the number 2 in its title. Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"" ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"") directs Vardalos screenplay for ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" and he handles the production values and pacing well enough. Yet the film often has the air of a double-dip (or triple-dip if you count the short-lived TV series) into a potential pot of gold at the end of a Big Fat Greek rainbow. Also Read Liam Neeson to Star in Watergate Thriller Felt From Concussion Director The filmmakers intention to follow in the predecessors footsteps is precisely calculated in every way down to the inclusion of everyone who was in the original movie from the brilliant Andrea Martin to Joey Fatone. (Yes the guy from NSYNC. You probably dont remember him being in the first film and you wont likely remember from this film either.) Then just to make sure theyve covered all the bases they bring in a ringer arguably the best-looking Greek man on the planet John Stamos. Theres no evil in that level of crowd-pleasing so long as the movie isnt awful which ""MBFGW2"" is not. Indeed its sweet just like the original movie. It was faint praise then and it still is.
