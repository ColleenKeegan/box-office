Photo Credit Overture Films advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A lonely boy falls for an even lonelier vampire. Rated R (violence gore language) BOTTOM LINE A very different kind of horror film as heartwarming as it is harrowing. CAST Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Grace Moretz Richard Jenkins LENGTH 155 Though nominally a vampire movie with the requisite blood and gore ""Let Me In"" is actually unclassifiable. You could call it a romance a cautionary tale or a tragedy. Each way youd be correct. Its protagonist is 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of ""The Road"") who is bright and sensitive. We also see him wearing a Halloween mask and taunting a mirror with a knife ""Are you a little girl?"" It turns out Owen is merely wishing for revenge on a school bully (Dylan Minnette) but this first impression remains hard to shake. advertisement | advertise on newsday Living in isolated Los Alamos N.M. in 1983 Owen is what wed now call ""at risk"" with no father and a mentally absent mother (her face is never clearly seen). No wonder hes so touched by even the smallest kindnesses from his new neighbor Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz of ""Kick-Ass""). Abby also 12 - ""more or less"" - arrives with a man who seems to be her father (Richard Jenkins haunted and haunting). He certainly feeds her mostly with plastic jugs of fresh human blood. Meantime Owen and Abby develop the kind of wholly honest relationship that only children are capable of; together the two young actors are heartbreaking. Writer-director Matt Reeves re-creates the eerie mood and mustard-yellow lighting of the 2008 Swedish hit ""Let the Right One In"" (itself based on a novel) though he also hammers away some subtleties and opts for disappointingly cartoonish special effects. Nevertheless ""Let Me In"" is one of the few horror films that will trouble you long after the credits roll.

Overture Films Chloe Moretz stars as Abby in Overture Films ""Let Me In"" (2010) In the century since Bram Stoker wrote ""Dracula"" imitators have coughed up Victorian vampires and disco vampires and soulful small-town vampires. But until the 2008 Swedish hit ""Let the Right One In"" there hadnt been a prepubescent hermaphrodite vampire.Now there are two of them. ""Let Me In"" an English-language remake artfully repackages much of the chilly menace of the original and adds a hot commodity Chloe Moretz 13 an actress poised to take a big bite out of Hollywood.Moretz was the wise little sister in ""(500) Days of Summer"" and the pigtailed vigilante in ""Kick-Ass."" In ""Let Me In"" she proves she could brood like Bella yet reduce Robert Pattinson to roadkill. Moretz plays Abby a mysterious barefoot girl who moves into the same snowy apartment complex as a bullied boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee the young refugee from ""The Road""). Although Abby warns the latchkey kid that they cant be friends or even meet in the daylight they are soon trading Morse-code messages through the wall they share behind which Owen sometimes hears violent arguments.The other voice belongs to an aged man (Richard Jenkins) who ventures out at night in a trash-bag mask to forage for provisions fresh blood for Abby. But after one of the donors reneges (in a bravura scene with a cartwheeling car) Abby has to fend for herself against a police detective (Elias Koteas) and her own gnawing hunger. When Owen lends a trembling hand she returns the favor by helping him disarm some schoolyard thugs. Literally. As a tale of star-crossed companions ""Let Me In"" is like a particularly icky production of ""Romeo and Juliet."" The movie omits a scene from the Swedish film in which Abby shows Owen that shes not exactly a girl; but other than that director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") retains the queasy green-and-gray palette and the shrieking insectoid attack scenes that set it apart from conventional horror flicks.With its mix of true-blood romance and full-moon madness ""Let Me In"" should hasten the twilight of the twerpy pretenders.

Plus The pale Bergmanesque vampires of Let Me In. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 4 2010 ShareThis Chloe Grace Moretz in Let Me In.  (Photo Saeed Adyani/Courtesy of Overture Films) D avid Finchers business saga The Social Network is a Make Your Own Zeitgeist picture. Its protagonist Facebook creator and worlds youngest billionaire Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is either an emotionally dysfunctional monster incapable of maintaining a friendshipmaking his invention of a tool to facilitate friendship too-too ironic and that tool itself deeply suspector the guy you really really wish you were no matter how twisted and reviled he may be. See Also  Is The Social Network Really Scathing?  Sorkin on Mentally Disordered Blog Commenters  Whats Jesse Eisenbergs Value in Hollywood? I find both options reductive and from what Ive read of Zuckerbergs life dubious but the movies lustrous deep-focus frames and headlong pace are difficult to resist. Its an entertainingly cynical small movie. Aaron Sorkins dialogue tumbles out so fast its as if the characters want their brains to keep pace with their processors; they talk like they keyboard like Fincher directs with no time for niceties. The first scene is a tour de force of disconnection. Zuckerberg sits across from his girlfriend Erica (future hornets-nest kicker Rooney Mara) and holds forth at triple-speed on the injustice of being ignored by Harvards elite clubswhich bus in college girls using the come-on Party with the next Fed chairmanwith such bilious urgency that Erica who likens dating him to dating a StairMaster flees. Thats the heart of Sorkin and Finchers Facebook Creation Myth It was all to get back at the girl who dumped him and the Wasps who wouldnt let him join their clubs. Fincher has likened The Social Networks emotional trajectory to Citizen Kanes in that its protagonist becomes simultaneously more successful and more friendless. But Finchers direction is so cool and depersonalizing that the story has no emotional heft. Zuckerbergs Wasp adversaries are cartoon boobs. More than once the camera scrutinizes young women from behind appraising them as the movies horny young voyeurs do. The Trent ReznorAtticus Ross score is in some Eno-airport no-mans-land of its own. Every!thing is disconnected from the get-gotheres no humanity to lose. Eisenberg has been until now a hugely likable actor with an instinct for thinking and fumbling in character. As Zuckerberg hes been whipped into monotony. Fincher directs like a drill sergeantMamet with an overwound metronome. The only actor here allowed to give a fully rounded performance is Justin Timberlake as Napster co-founder Sean Parker whose sleazy hustle turns out to be just what the burgeoning Facebook needs. Fincher does get the details though the ubiquitous energy drinks that seem to fuel the movies hyped-up jittery pacing; the programmers in headphones deep in their antisocial trances writing code to connect us all; the oak-and-crimson Harvard vibe illuminating the ties between arrogant undergraduate high jinks and arrogant alumni high jinks. (Harvard president and Inside Job villain Larry Summers is played with peerless superciliousness by Douglas Urbanski.) What The Social Network isnt about is well the social networki.e. Facebook and what it means for the culture. The real Zuckerberg may have a dismaying unconcern for privacy but from the start he had a vision that Facebook would help create communities in an ever-insular world. The movies final imageZuckerberg friending the woman who dumped him and endlessly refreshing the page to see if she acceptsis presented as pathetic irony. But you could also read it as a sign of hope. In the Facebook world which is now ours a new communication infrastructure exists with no avenues definitively closed. T he poetic Swedish vampire picture (with arterial spray) Let the Right One In has been hauntingly well transplanted to the high desert of Los Alamos New Mexico and renamed Let Me In. The tale of a scrawny 12-year-old outcast (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who drifts into an indelible relationship with a girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) in a cloak who doesnt come out in the day its bathed in a pale orange winter light that gives the barren landscape an unearthly glow. Michael Giacchinos score is full of shivers and plinks ghostly chorales and shuddering strings Its the most suggestive music for a horror film in years. Director Matt Reeves misses only one aspect of the original. The Swedish girl is androgynous adding resonance to the theme of forbidden love whereas Moretz is positively sultry heavy-!lidded hollow-eyed with fashion-model cheekbones. Shes quite a vision of death though. Ingmar Bergman would have followed her anywhere. T he sounds began early at the New York Film Festival screening of Inside Job Titters of incredulity hoots of derision then a sort of audible trembling. Was the audience watching a sci-fi disaster in which pompous fools ignore the approaching onslaught? Noand yes. Inside Job tells the story of the economic collapse of 2008 and its the horror movie of the decade. As he proved in his Iraq-centered No End in Sight policy wonk turned documentarian Charles Ferguson has no peer when it comes to tracking the course of a preventable catastrophe. No Michael Mooreish grandstander he strives for a tone of objectivity; the drama is in whether hell be able to hold his emotions in check. Its impressive how long he goes before the signs of disgust and indignation creep in. 1 2 Next Share this story...

This American remake of the Swedish horror drama Let the Right One In which airlifts the story 5158 miles to Los Alamos New Mexico where lonely bullied only-child Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of The Road) crushes on the new girl in town a frozen-in-time preteen vampire who says shes ""Twelve more or less."" Abby (Chloe Moretz Kick Ass Hit-Girl) needs human blood but she outsources the killing to her companion (Richard Jenkins) who poses as her father but moons over her like an ex-boyfriend. In the original Abbys caretaker was a jealous bungler--Oscar-nominated Jenkins sees his pathetic protectiveness and the tragedy in his character focuses the films themes of desperation and the myopia of puppy love when youre young enough (or undead enough) to feel immortal. Cloverfields Matt Reeves directs and this quiet controlled chiller is 180 degrees away from that mess. Reeves keeps the cameras focus so close that the world past your fingertips is a blur. Adults barely register like Dracula designed by Charles Schultz. What matters is immediate--the film exists in that margin between kid and teen when every day is a drama and every tumble is a catastrophe when the thug in your class is the boogieman and a girl you play Mrs. Pac Man with could be your girlfriend even though you dont yet know what that means. But Let Me In is wise beyond its years even if only the grown-ups in the audience bear witness to pain that the preteen stars cant see. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Before press screenings of Let Me In director Matt Reeves remake of the spectacular 2008 Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In there were plenty of rumblings about the pointlessness of producing an American version so soon after a film that was practically perfect in the first place. The word unnecessary hung in the air. (See 90 years of vampires on the screen.) I backed that sentiment having been wildly passionate about director Tomas Alfredsons film an adaption of John Ajvide Lindqvists novel Let the Right One In. But Let Me In won me over for three reasons. First it is a good film in its own right capturing the storys wistful dark essence if not the spooky art of Alfredsons rendering. Relocated from bleakest Sweden to the wintry American Southwest and reset to the heyday of Ronald Reagan and Boy George it is still the tale of an eerily beautiful 12-year-old vampire now named Abby (the remarkably confident and skilled Chloe Grace Moretz of Kick-Ass fame) who moves into a dreary apartment complex with her keeper of sorts an older man posing as her father (Richard Jenkins wonderfully sad) and there befriends a boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Owen also 12 has his own problems he lives in terrible fear of his classmates bullying at his dreary Los Alamos N.M. middle school. (See TIMEs Kick-Ass review.) Second of the approximately 150 films Ive seen so far this year Id use the term necessary to describe about three of them which makes Reeves decision to take his own swing at the material at least as justifiable as say Jonah Hex. Finally and most important there is the matter of my old friend Tom who would go see a foreign film with subtitles only if he were invited to a Brazilian blockbuster by Gisele Bundchen and she sat in his lap for the entire two hours whispering sweet Portuguese translations in his ear. Never mind that film is a visual medium and that once youve seen and loved a movie you dont remember it in another language; you remember it as you felt it. Some people just dont do subtitles. For them there are remakes. Alfredson opened his film with snow drifting out of the night sky and the image of a pale blond boy stabbing the air with a knife and muttering a series of threats into the darkness. Reeves who earlier had directed Cloverfield opens Let Me In with mayhem. A crime suspect with terrible acid burns on his face is rushed to the hospital in the dark of night. A policeman (Elias Koteas) tries and fails to question him; while his back is turned the suspect tumbles out of a seventh-story window an apparent suicide. At this point we go back in time two weeks to learn what brought us here. The character of the policeman is entirely new perhaps to serve that American liking for having someone on the job investigating even though in vampireland there are no tidy endings no courts in which to eke out justice. His presence and the flashback suggest that Reeves believes he has to get the blood pumping early -- this is America darn it. The mystery and the horror have to be bigger. (See TIMEs top 10 Hollywood remakes.) Although the overall tone of Let Me In is gratifyingly somber and some scenes play out the same almost frame by frame as they do in the original Reeves film does feel more like a horror movie than Let the Right One In did. A vampire explodes when exposed to sunlight and Reeves brings us in close to watch her suffer in bloody agony. Lindqvists original screenplay made her flameout a deliberate choice and Alfredson shot it like a surreal hallucination. This feels crass in comparison. When Abby is forced to hunt for herself rather than drink from the gallon jugs of blood Father helpfully procures she morphs into a CGI creature that looks more buglike than girllike. In vampire form she sounds like Regan from The Exorcist -- a shame since Moretz proves throughout that shes plenty capable as an actress of convincing us that Abby is to be feared (and also loved). But not all of Reeves choices are unsubtle. Owen lives with his loving but distracted-by-drink mother (Cara Buono who plays Don Drapers new girlfriend Faye on Mad Men) and Reeves shoots her at angles that never reveal her whole face. Shes only half there as befitting a mother who can only guess at her childs pain. Let Me In is not as fantastic as Let the Right One In which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material. And for the subtitle-eschewing Toms of the world -- and there are many -- Let Me In is a chance to experience a story about finding courage and making choices in the name of devotion choices which are strange awful and also beautiful. Two outcasts one who lives in the permanent misery of the undead the other in the misery of middle school find comfort in each other. The latter would be escapable in the coming years but Owen like so many adolescents doesnt see it as temporary. For him Abby is the right one to let in although we see the tragedy that awaits him. Id still take Alfredsons version over Reeves but I wouldnt close the door in Let Me Ins face either. See the top 10 screen vampires. See TIMEs fall arts preview.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 01 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Matt Reevess Let Me In is a smart horror film that exploits a deep-seated fear in America subtitle-phobia. The movie is a remake of the acclaimed 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In a delicately creepy tale of adolescent blood-sucking and bonding that earned critical raves but only a modest 2-million in U.S. box-office revenue. Let Me In should earn at least 20 times that just by being in English. The new movie is not a sell-out so much as a culturally modified variation. Reeves a savvy director (responsible for the ingenious shaky-cam horror romp Cloverfield) mildly amps up the dynamics of the original film without dumbing it down. At times he shows an almost plagiaristic devotion to the original film with shot-by-shot scene recreations and the solemn pace and bruise-like palette. But he leaves enough fingerprints on the film to claim it as his own. The setting has changed from a godless Swedish suburb to a God-fearing America in early 1980s Los Alamos N.M. The dynamics have also changed from muted to muted-with-explosive-interludes. Reeves shows his flair as an action director particularly in a jarring point-of-view car crash that forms a centrepiece of the new film part of a new flashback structure tied to a police investigation. The movie begins as a frumpy-looking police detective (Elias Koteas) arrives at a hospital to deal with the case of a strangely injured car-accident victim who the cop believes may be linked to a series of murders. Eventually that search will lead him to a building complex on the edge of town where a 12-year-old boy and girl live in adjacent apartments. Owen (the elfin androgynous Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives with his unbalanced fundamentalist Christian mother whos literally out of the picture (her face is either out-of-focus or obscured in every scene). Ronald Reagan is on the television talking up his Star Wars defence plan and the threat of evil in the world while David Bowie is warbling about dancing under the serious moonlight. Owen is a slightly creepy and lonely kid who spies on neighbours with his telescope or stands in front of the mirror acting out his revenge fantasies against school bullies. One night Owen witnesses a haggard-looking man (Richard Jenkins) and little girl (Chloe Moretz) arriving secretively at the apartment courtyard. Later he hears the man shouting angrily through the apartment wall. Later still Owen meets the girl Abby in the courtyard playground. She looks pale and malnourished and though its winter shes not wearing shoes. Abby describes herself as ""12 more or less"" and tells him she cant be his friend but they meet again on another night and eventually form a bond. As we learn early in the film what initially looks like a relationship of child abuse between Abby and her father turns out to be a parasitic tie between a self-loathing mortal man and an ageless vampire child. When she drinks blood she appears less gaunt and more attractive to Owen. The bond that grows between them tightens - co-dependent tender and pre-sexual. Abby is Owens saviour his potential girlfriend and perhaps his life-long parasite. The kids work beautifully together often without a lot of words between them Smit-McPhee (he played Viggo Mortensens son in The Road) is suitably wide-eyed in wonder or fear while Moretz is an ongoing revelation Is this moody waif really the same girl who played the precocious brat in (500) Days of Summer or the foul-mouthed action heroine Hit Girl in Kick-Ass? Less satisfying are the moments when the film concedes to American horror conventions especially the scuttling vampire effects which pull us out of the haunted world of these lovely damaged creatures into a place that while not of this world feels entirely too familiar.

Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) has a deadly secret in Let Me In. Photo Saeed Adyani Let Me In 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Fans of chilly Scandinavian thrillers might argue on principle against Let Me In an American reworking of the extraordinary Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In (and John Ajvide Lindqvists selfsame novel). In a way theyre right The original is perfect on its own. Theres no real excuse for a remake except perhaps to ditch the subtitles and sell more tickets in the process. But Let Me In is a done deal and Ill let you in on a secret Its verifiably good. No not as good as the Swedish version which had a low-key stripped-bare authenticity that never faltered even in moments of blood-sucking savagery. This one indulges in unnecessary CGI enhancements; it didnt need the fake-o four-legged attack scenes. But its still a striking piece of character-driven horror and it still ranks (despite the effects) among the more understated fright fests to hit the mainstream in recent memory. Written and directed by Cloverfield monster-man Matt Reeves Let Me In moves the action from Sweden to early 1980s New Mexico but it keeps the focus on its lonely pubescent leads Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby a child vampire and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen the little bullied neighbor she befriends. Theirs is the story of any young outcasts who bond over shared pain social ostracism and maybe a round of Ms. Pac-Man -- a vampire herself when you think about it. The true horror in Owens life isnt the ghoul next door but the kids in gym who torture him with wedgies. (To emphasize this horror Michael Giacchinos orchestral score portends doom at school with the same thudding drum figure that signals bloodshed elsewhere.) When Owen meets Abby shes standing barefoot in the snow outside their apartment complex. Thats strange. Also strange her age which she describes as "" 12 more or less."" With half-baked conviction she informs him she cant be his friend. Why? It has to do with that flash-forward at the start of the movie an eerie sequence shot in part through the blurred eyes of a man who doused himself with acid. One minute hes in a hospital room with a drab cop (Elias Koteas). The next hes sprawled out dead beneath his window. This foreshadowing marks the biggest of several changes that distinguish Let Me In from its Swedish counterpart. Reeves always one to toy with perspective cagily hides the mans misshapen face until the scene is revisited later on. By then weve come to know him as the bedraggled human assistant (played by an exquisitely sad Richard Jenkins) who kills and drains victims for Abbys benefit. There are nuances here that were missing from the original and there were nuances in the original that are missing here. Yet Reeves movie is rich with emotion evoking terror and tenderness with equal skill in equal measure. The Roads Smit-McPhee seems to grow wiser and more delicate with age - while Moretz the zingy girl assassin from Kick-Ass has an ethereal quality as Abby that only makes her deadlier.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Before there was the pouty pining of ""Twilight"" pair Bella and Edward on thousands of multiplex screens there was the art-house ache of a forever- young vampire and a bullied tween boy in the Swedish wonder of a vampire flick ""Let the Right One In."" Now comes the American version directed and adapted by Matt Reeves (of the visceral if gimmicky ""Cloverfield"") and co-produced by resurrected Hammer Films Britains legendary purveyor of horror. Its called ""Let Me In."" That demanding title says something about how the gentle poetry of the original gets lost a bit in Reeves translation based on John Ajvide Lindqvists best seller. Granted its easier to gripe about whats lost than celebrate the vital thing that remains The two protagonists remain oh-so sympathetic. As Abby and Owen Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee dig down into their characters existential discomfort. All the other bloodsuckers in pop culture these days have friends family similarly damned rivals. But Abby is an incredibly lonesome soul whose mortal caretaker is on the edge of oblivion when ""Let Me In"" opens. Just as solitary Owen spends his life in bully- avoidance mode dashing home cowering in the locker room. The action has moved from 1980s Sweden to the same period in Los Alamos N.M. On television sets President Ronald Reagan delivers his famous speech about the evils of the Soviet regime and the moral goodness of the U.S. to the National Association of Evangelicals. At 12-year-old Owens modest apartment his divorced mother riffs on sin and prayer. But Reeves doesnt do much with these gestures except to make clear that once Owen learns his new friend and neighbor is a vampire he has to grapple with the grays of reality. Were already ahead of him. Owen himself is a complicated figure. Watch him exact fantasy revenge on his bullies with a knife. Watch him spy a bit too creepily on his apartment-house adults. Richard Jenkins is in fine form as the man who kills for Abby. Although he appears in the credits as ""The Father"" their exact relationship is a mystery initially. Its clear his commitment to kill is an act of love and sacrifice. Reeves has more of a feel for the scary than the tender. A man writhing in an ambulance is an eerie start. Even so some of the special effects are distractingly cheesy. Abbys savage forays her face transformed by thirst and hunger look plain silly. ""let me in."" R for strong bloody horror violence language and a brief sexual situation. 1 hour 55 minutes. Written and directed by Mike Reeves; based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist and the Swedish movie ""Let the Right One In""; photography by Greig Fraser; starring Chloe Grace Moretz Kodi Smit-McPhee Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas.

With Let Me In writer and director Matt Reeves takes a step toward making everyones favorite bloodsuckers scary again. Movie Information Let Me InRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Matt ReevesStarring Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Grace Moretz Richard Jenkins and Elias KoteasRun time 115 minutesMPAA rating R (strong bloody horror violence language a brief sexual situation)Synopsis U.S. remake of Swedish adaptation Let the Right One In stars Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) as the strange girl befriended by her bullied next-door neighbor.More movies from GuideLive.comThis remake of the 2008 Swedish horror thriller Let the Right One In  itself adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvists novel stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen an awkward miserable lad on the cusp of adolescence. He has no friends and his parents are separated. His father is a nonentity in his life and his mother is preoccupied with her disintegrating marriage and equally distant toward her son (something Reeves deftly illustrates by never letting us get a clear look at her). On top of that Owen is constantly tormented by the school bully Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his gang.Enter Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) a girl who moves into the apartment next door to Owens. She is accompanied by someone we at first assume is her father (Richard Jenkins) but the audience quickly discovers he is something both more and less than paternal. Though its never really stated Abby is a vampire at least a century old and the man has been taking care of her for who knows how long slaying hapless victims and bringing their blood back to Abby to quench her thirst.Drawn to a fellow outsider Abby befriends Owen (initially keeping her true nature secret) and the two become something of an item. In an interesting twist its Abbys state of affairs that begins to suffer while a newly emboldened Owen begins to take at least a small degree of control over his own gradually letting out his pent-up rage.Reeves who reinvented the giant-monster-stomps-on- downtown movie two years ago with Cloverfield has streamlined the story cutting a subplot involving Owens hard-drinking neighbors down to the bone and introducing a police detective played by Elias Koteas. Reeves directs with a cold detachment appropriate for the material and the movies wintry setting moved from Sweden to Los Alamos N.M. during the winter of 1983.The movies young leads carry the story. McPhee (last seen opposite Viggo Mortensen in The Road) and Moretz (who shocked audiences earlier this year as the pint-size potty-mouth Hit Girl in Kick-Ass ) ably carry off chilling performances as a pair of near-innocents with matching dark sides - two sides of the same coin. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Let Me In movie review Swedens acclaimed tween vampire tale retold even better |       NJ.com comments Let Me In movie review Swedens acclaimed tween vampire tale retold even better Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 01 2010 at 800 AM updated October 01 2010 at 1148 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/Overture Films Saeed AdyaniKodi Smit-McPhee left and ChloA<< Grace Moretz are members of the solid cast of ""Let Me In."" Owen is not having a happy childhood. His parents have split up. His mother is drinking. He lives in a crummy apartment and the only thing that makes a day at school memorable is when he hasnt been beaten up. Abbys childhood is even worse. She lives in an apartment with a strange man and cardboard taped over the windows. She never goes to school. She doesnt even have shoes. The difference is that Abbys unhappy childhood is also perpetual. Because Abby is an ageless 12-year-old vampire. This odd haunting tale of pubescent puppy love and eternal blood lust was first told two years ago in the Swedish film ""Let the Right One In."" And Ill admit the first thought I had when I heard it was scheduled for an English-language remake was real horror. But heres the shocker ""Let Me In"" gets it right. Yes it moves the story to America but it doesnt change any of the things that made the first film interesting. And it preserves the moments that made it great. One of those qualities is the insight into just how amoral childhood can be. We think of children as being innocent creatures full of mischief perhaps but no real sin. Yet its also true that many children are driven not by conscience but by basic blind desires food shelter safety. So it is not surprising that the bullied little boy and the hungry little vampire girl form a bond. It would be surprising if they didnt. Movie Review Let Me In (R) Overture (115 min.) Directed by Matt Reeves. With Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Grace Moretz. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains graphic gore violence strong language and brief nudity. Stephen Whittys review THREE AND A HALF STARS Director Matt Reeves makes only a few small changes in the tale (chief among them avoiding the once-ambiguous nature of Abbys gender and making Owens mother an even vaguer presence). Both seem like smart decisions. Hes also quite frankly managed to sign better actors. Kodi-Smith McPhee -- last seen suffering as ""The Boy"" in ""The Road"" -- has a spooky quietness as Owen. Chloe Grace Moretz -- already astonishingly self-possessed in ""Kick-Ass"" -- is terrifying as thirsty little Abby and the great Richard Jenkins is one of the few adult presences as a nearly mute Renfield type. Some things dont work so well. Its never clear why this is set in the Reagan era. And the few scenes of Abby scuttling around like a spider are such obvious CGI they take you out of the movie. If you cant do an effect imply it. (In fact youre often better off implying it anyway). These are small flaws. Chillingly adult yet perfectly tuned in to tween angst ""Let Me In"" both comes from a venerable tradition (Hammer home of the classic Christopher Lee films is one of its production companies) and goes beyond modern tropes (no gentle glittering vampires here). It even has a refreshing sense of myth -- the title comes from the obscure old belief that vampires can cross your threshold only if you invite them. Well if you like dank disturbing little horror movies invite ""Let Me In"" into your moviegoing schedule. Just make sure to stuff your pockets with garlic first.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday October 1 2010 400 AM Title Let Me In Thriller about a lonely boy and a vampire. With Chloe Grace Moretz Kodi Smit-McPhee. Director Matt Reeves (155). R Violence gore language. At area theaters.As countless tweens can attest theres nothing scarier than a bully - not even a vampire. Director Matt Reeves (who also made the much rawer ""Cloverfield"") so deeply understands the nature of childhood terror that ""Let Me In"" burns with a white-hot clarity.Reeves take on Tomas Alfredsons acclaimed Swedish mystery ""Let the Right One In"" is less a remake than a translation. That makes his work even harder He has to convince us that we need to hear the same story all over again.Given the challenge his success is remarkable. Though Reeves script and direction are notably faithful to their source he draws out new aspects by adding a slightly warmer perspective to 2008s effectively chilly original.Theres plenty of cold here too. An unusually heavy snowfall blankets New Mexico in 1983 when 12-year-old Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her eerie father (Richard Jenkins) move next door to lonely Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee).Between his parents ugly divorce and the boys who beat him up every afternoon Owens having a tough time. Abbys an outsider too but after centuries as a vampire shes got a bit more perspective. She warns him that they shouldnt be friends; there are simply too many forces - including a nosy policeman (Elias Koteas) and her own blood lust - designed to keep them apart. But alienation proves a powerful bond and they connect in ways that surprise them both.Reeves allows us to share the elation of their love while never shying away from the horror of their reality. He gets the details right from the unyielding steel of a middle-school locker to the heartbreaking distance of a disengaged parent. Even the setting - a generic corner of Ronald Reagans America - is carefully chosen.His actors are equally attuned to the delicate balance Reeves strives to attain Moretz and Smit-McPhee beautifully embody both the deepest pain and small vital joys of childhood. (Candy is Owens savior whenever things get rough.) ""Let Me In"" is not only the years most elegant thriller but its loveliest romance as well.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Let Me In A vampire remake that doesnt bite | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLet Me In A vampire remake that doesnt biteLet Me In the inevitable and more horrifying American remake of an affecting Swedish vampire story makes the case that not all remakes are bad.Abby (Chloe Moretz) and Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) form an unusual bond in Let Me In.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 30 2010 Let Me In (out of 4) Starring Kodi-Smith McPhee Chloe Grace Moretz Elias Koteas and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Matt Reeves. At major theatres. 115 minutes. 14A Serious horror fans were justifiably horrified when news broke of an American remake of Let the Right One In the 2008 Swedish film that set the vampire myth as a mutual rescue for two lonely children. Tomas Alfredsons nuanced original struck such a perfect balance between fear and longing it was downright terrifying to imagine what a ham-fisted Hollywood production might do to it. The crypt hadnt even grown cold Let the Right One In still has a few territories around the globe where it is scheduled to open. And how could any other child actors beat Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson who simply knocked it out of the park as the films non-shiny human and vampire duo? So it is gratifying to report that Let Me In that inevitable and abrupt American remake by Cloverfields Matt Reeves is more than just okay. Its actually strong enough to make the case that not all remakes bite. A lot of this is due to smart casting. Just about the only kids you could imagine filling the lonely boots of Hedebrant and Leandersson are The Roads Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kick-Asss Chloe Grace Moretz. Reeves nabbed them both. As both writer and director working from the original novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist Reeves hasnt strayed far from the original text. Hes changed names relocated from Stockholm to Los Alamos New Mexico and made the story more literal and horrific to suit American tastes. But he hasnt trampled it. Reeves retains the pervasive sense of isolation and the intense longing felt by bullied schoolboy Owen (Smit-McPhee) and his strange new friend Abby (Moretz). Owen and Abby are both outcasts Owen from the school jocks who assault him and the bitterly divorced parents who ignore him; Abby from the world of humans whose blood she must reluctantly drink to survive. Shes aided by a mysterious adult assistant (Richard Jenkins) who kills and drains victims for her with all the emotion of a car mechanic doing a lube job. When Abby moves into Owens grey neighborhood the two are immediately curious about each other. Shes ""12 more or less"" and hes ""12 going on 13."" But her wariness at first trumps his innocence. ""I cant be your friend"" Abby tells Owen. ""Thats just the way it is."" She sounds like shes fighting herself and she is. Soon the two are carefully exploring the limits of a friendship fraught with both wonder and danger. But a dogged policeman (Elias Koteas) has been investigating the towns recent string of murders and hes not encumbered by sentiment. Reeves encourages these fine actors to find their own way in a script thats as bleak as the setting. The story is circa 1983 the era of Ronald Reagans presidency and a televised speech about how ""America is good"" makes ironic commentary on the desperate circumstances of Abby and Owen. Let Me In is that most novel of films a remake that adds to our appreciation of the original even if it doesnt exceed it.

Starring Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Moretz Richard Jenkins Cara Buono Sasha Barrese Elias Koteas Director Matt Reeves Running time 155 Release Opened Oct 1 2010  Editorial Review It loses its fangs in translationBy Michael OSullivanFriday October 1 2010Something is lost in the translation in ""Let Me In"" the English-language adaptation of the acclaimed 2008 Swedish vampire film ""Let the Right One In."" The problem isnt a lack of respect for the original. In some ways writer-director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") is almost too deferential. Set in a snow-covered Los Alamos in the winter of 1983 his film about the friendship between a bullied boy and the vampire girl next door apes the cold blood-drained look of Tomas Alfredsons original occasionally shot for shot. Lines are repeated sometimes word for word from John Ajvide Lindqvists moody screenplay based on his 2004 novel. But the rendition nevertheless feels off key. Not literally of course. Michael Giacchinos score is suitably creepy. And the movie generally satisfies the most basic requirements of the horror genre. Its scary and sticks with you for a while after you leave the theater. The theme too remains intact that the cruelty we inflict on each other is worse than that perpetrated by a bloodsucker. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a 12-year-old loner. Living with his divorced mother (Cara Buono) he strikes up a tentative friendship with Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) a girl who appears to be about his age when she moves into the apartment next door with her weary-looking father (Richard Jenkins). Except that he may or may not be her father. At times Abby -- who wanders through the snow in her bare feet and who gives her age as 12 ""more or less"" -- treats the man more like a servant. And he obliges making midnight runs to the convenience store parking lot to pick up her dinner -- in the form of blood drained from one of the local high-school jocks. Like a kosher butcher hes seen stringing up one of his victims from a tree letting the fresh blood flow from a hole in his neck into a plastic milk jug. Reevess camera shows us everything where the Swedish film merely watched over the fathers shoulder. Owen meanwhile has been getting picked on by a trio of middle-school sadists led by Kenny (Dylan Minnette) himself the target of an older brothers bullying. Abby who has by now befriended Owen after initial understandable standoffishness doesnt like this. You wont either. Like the Swedish film ""Let Me In"" is a setup for a satisfying if grisly revenge fantasy. Its ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with teeth. But ""Let the Right One In"" was about so much more than that. Gone in this American version is a fleeting but suggestive shot in Alfredsons film that revealed the vampire -- called Eli in the original -- to have something other than female genitalia. There was a strange androgyny to Eli that made her relationship with the human boy all the more affecting. In this version it feels more like plain old puppy love an R-rated ""Twilight."" Such squeamishness on Reevess part does not extend to violence. While ""Let the Right One In"" was far from tame everything in ""Let Me In"" feels amped up for Hollywood. The bullies are crueler; their taunts more terrifying. And Abby is fiercer. The couple of scenes in which she attacks people are done in CGI making her look like a spider monkey on crack. Its distracting and throws you right out of any believability the film has otherwise painstakingly constructed. In one scene in which Abby laps up blood from the floor that has dripped from a cut on Owens finger she looks like Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist."" Theres also a constant backdrop of talk about evil that wasnt in the original. Ronald Reagan can be heard talking about it on the TV news. And Owens mother is a holy roller. Also missing? Any sense of regret on Abbys part. Eli for her part did what she did because she had to not because she enjoyed it. Thats what set her apart from the bullies. Such changes arent just unnecessary theyre detrimental. The title of both films refers to a bit of vampire lore You cant let one into your home -- or by extension your heart -- without issuing the invitation out loud. ""Let Me In"" wants to make your flesh crawl and it probably will. But its unlikely to ever get under anyones skin the way ""Let the Right One In"" did.Contains strong gore and violence obscenity brief sensuality and a flash of nudity.

"Let Me In | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; let-me-in ) Let Me In (United States 2010) September 30 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Let Me In is the English-language remake of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. From the beginning there has been controversy associated with the ""Hollywood-ization"" of an edgy ambiguous vampire tale because many die-hard adherents believed that much of what made Let the Right One In would be compromised in order to appeal to a mainstream American audience. There is some validity to this concern and it is borne out in the product that has reached the screen. Putting that aside however Let Me In represents one of the best and most brutal vampire movies to come along in a while and despite presenting a romance of sorts between a human boy and a vampire girl it will not remind many viewers of Twilight. In fact Let Me In is about as far away from Twilight as one can get and thats a good thing. Although the general thrust of the narrative remains similar to that of Let the Right One In there are two major differences both of which are designed to make the film more generally accessible. One of the ambiguities of the original relating to the motivations of the ""father"" character have been clarified in Let Me In. More notable however is the removal of the split-second WTF scene that became one of the most discussed aspects of Let the Right One In. Not only is the shot missing but so are its implications. (If you have seen Let the Right One In you know what Im talking about. If you havent its irrelevant.) The setting is the early 1980s in Los Alamos. The time frame is important since this is before many of todays technological innovations were available no cell phones no DNA testing no omnipresent security cameras capturing every movement. Translating Let the Right One In to 2010 would have required major reworking by writer/director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield). And Los Alamos in the winter bears more than a passing resemblance to Stockholm. In fact if not for the fact that everyone is speaking English one might mistake Let Me In for a foreign film. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an undersized geeky 12-year old who is smart friendless and frequently bullied at school. When Abby (Chloe Moretz) moves into the next-door apartment along with her ""father"" (Richard Jenkins) he is naturally drawn to her. Haggard bare-footed and claiming not to notice the cold she is even more of an oddball than he is. Despite her assertion that they cannot become friends a bond forms. They communicate through the common wall between their apartments using Morse code. She gives him advice about how to handle bullies. He invites her into his home when his mother is not around. What we recognize long before Owen does is that Abby is a vampire whose ""meals"" are provided by the elderly gentleman who shares her apartment. When he is unable to fulfill her needs she goes out on her own. They live in constant fear of being caught and when Abby unwisely chooses a victim from among the other apartment renters she brings an investigating policeman (Elias Koteas) dangerously close. Although fans of Let the Right One In will almost certainly be disappointed by the alterations made to the narrative Let Me In nevertheless stands well above the ""average"" vampire film. Also these are ""old school"" bloodsuckers who burst into flame (instead of sparkling) when exposed to the sun. Taken on its own terms this is a compelling motion picture possessing an uncommon level of sophistication for an American-made horror film. Of course Let the Right One In was more of a coming-of-age drama than straight horror film. The tone of Let Me In is openly romantic but the horror elements are also italicized. In terms of how the principal characters relate to one another this film bears a stronger resemblance to Rob Reiners Flipped than to any of the Twilight movies. One aspect of Let Me In that makes this motion picture unique is the sense of pathos underlying the various relationships. Owen is a loner whose literally faceless mother (Reeves shoots actress Cara Buono in such a manner that the camera never captures her features) is little more than a footnote in his life. He is drawn to Abby because she shows an interest in him and his tentative question of whether they can ""go steady"" is an indication of how desperate he is for any kind of meaningful human interaction. For her part she is torn between Owen and her ""father."" The older man and she are like a long-time wedded couple who have grown apart during the many years they have spent together. There is still affection between them but the love that brought them together has long since burned out. Abbys flirtation with Owen ignites the same fire as a married woman having an affair. The newness and excitement of the relationship is in contrast with the routine disappointment of what she has with her ""father."" For his part the ""father"" sees what is happening and knows he is being replaced. The pain of his situation is evident when Abby refuses his request that she stop seeing ""the boy."" Of course theres no actual sex in the movie but the subtext isnt hard to read. Excellent performances are one of Let Me Ins strengths. Kodi Smit-McPhee who played the son in The Road is credible as a boy trapped by feelings and realizations no one his age should be forced to confront. While romancing Abby he shows the perfect mix of boldness and shyness and the fear he exhibits when confronted by bullies at school is real enough to be haunting. Meanwhile Chloe Moretz although arguably too attractive to play Abby (who was envisioned as more androgynous in Let the Right One In) provides a moving interpretation of a vampire who has accepted her place in the food chain and what it means for those around her. Her life is a constant struggle to survive. Moretz displays genuine affection for Owen; we dont suspect her merely of using him. In a supporting role Richard Jenkins is as good as always lending sympathy and dignity to a difficult role. We dont learn much about his character but a few glances into his eyes and a glimpse of a black-and-white photograph tell us all we need to know. Admittedly the special effects which appear to consist of a combination of CGI and speeded-up live action dont work well. Theyre more cheesy than effective as occasional bursts of laughter in the audience indicated. But visual chicanery is only a minor aspect of what Let Me In has to offer and for the most part it accomplishes what it sets out to do. There are horror elements in evidence - brutal benighted attacks; severed limbs and heads; blood gushing from opened arteries - but those are ultimately overshadowed by the human aspects. One can complain about the differences between Let the Right One In and Let Me In but there is one critical constant both movies are about the introverted outcasts of society and the connections they make with one another. Its important not to overlook that this is a sold accomplished effort.

Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 1 2010 1201 a.m. ET In the course of a preface thats set in the mythic past--seven years ago when Facebook was only a gleam in Mark Zuckerbergs eye--a young woman tells Jesse Eisenbergs Mark that dating him is exhausting ""Its like dating a StairMaster."" Watching ""The Social Network"" is like getting a runners high without a treadmill or sweat. This account of Facebooks founder and of the websites explosive growth quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration and pretty much keeps you there for two hours. Audio Social Network Has Friends Critic Joe Morgenstern gives the movie and cast glowing reviews. David Finchers film is devastating as biography--an unfriending of epic proportions--and dazzling as contemporary cultural history. The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his supersmart and superbly funny screenplay on a contentious book Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires"" so everything thats seen isnt necessarily to be believed. (And it may be accidental that the subject chose the week before the movies release to announce his gift of 100 million to the schools of Newark N.J.) Yet Mr. Eisenbergs performance feels like revealed truth while youre watching it and given the pace of change that the story reflects his character will enter the culture as a consecrated archetype by tomorrow evening at the latest. Watch a clip from ""The Social Network"" a film about Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. On screen the Harvard undergraduate who became the worlds youngest billionaire is the most anti of antiheroes since Travis Bickle or maybe Raymond Babbitt from ""Rain Man."" (The latter comparison pops out of a scene when Mark turns away from a meeting and declares with bizarre detachment ""Its raining out."") This Mark combines a borderline autistic affect with a single-minded focus on a beautifully simple idea and a mouth-brain connection that spits out words--eerily astute words often used in angry phrases--at hyper-hip-hop speed. During his days at Harvard hes as much a stranger to others feelings as he is a Mozart of computer programming so its no coincidence that his seminal addictive and immeasurably profitable concept a network to link friends with other friends ad infinitum starts out as sexual taxonomy--an online scheme called Facemash using college girls faces to rate whos hot and whos not. Those who arent addicts or dont use the site at all--Id call myself a cautious user--may be tempted to see Facebook as a not-so-hot notion fanned into incandescence by narcissistic adolescents with nothing better to do than tell one another who they are in terms of what they like what they buy and where they go. But the script makes a convincing case for Mr. Zuckerbergs awareness from the start that hed be tapping into a deep human need for friendship at a time when physical and spiritual isolation was on the rise. Facebook really was the once-in-a-generation idea the movie keeps saying it was and ""The Social Network"" is fully equal to the challenge of dramatizing the Big Bang that brought the site into being. More Speakeasy The Social Network Review Revue (09/30/10) Justin Timberlake on Why He Doesnt Use Facebook (09/28/10) Social Network Goes to Harvard (09/27/10) For Facebook Movie Damage Control (09/24/10) Zuckerberg Plans 100 Million Donation (09/23/10) That includes plenty of sex drugs and rock n roll--girls getting wasted while their brainiac boyfriends write code. Sean Parker the co-founder of the file-sharing web site Napster must have taken no exception to Justin Timberlakes blithely scandalous portrait of his younger self since he hasnt filed a lawsuit and he must have been delighted--I know I was--by the nimble humor and dancers grace of Mr. Timberlakes portrayal. (Among many passages of scintillating dialogue is a rapid-fire exchange between the affluent Sean who comes on like a slacker collecting unemployment and a bright but skeptical girl ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""You mean youre unemployed."" ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""So whats your latest preneur?"") But the films substance lies mainly in its convoluted tale of vast ambition--an ambition oddly disconnected in Mr. Zuckerbergs case from a desire to make money--spectacular success and bitter betrayal. Not since ""Apollo 13"" has a mainstream motion picture conveyed so much factual as well as dramatic information with such clarity and agility. First Mark moves beyond--or pilfers the intellectual property of--three upperclassmen whod approached him for help on a website they called Harvard Connection. Later the newly-minted young magnate has a painful falling out with Facebooks original business manager Eduardo Saverin hes played with great subtlety and rueful charm by Andrew Garfield wholl be seen as Peter Parker in the next ""Spider-Man."" While the movies prevailing mood is excitation--hardly a moment goes by when someone isnt having a brilliant idea--its dominant mode is litigation thanks to one suit on behalf of those Harvard upperclassmen and another brought by Eduardo. The lawsuits require obligatory scenes of adversaries meeting and arguing in offices but youd never know they were obligatory because they interweave past and present to electrifying effect. Another marvelous office scene involves Lawrence Summers (played by an actor not by himself) who was Harvards president at the time. The director Mr. Fincher makes no distinction between action or exposition between a conference-room confrontation or an English regatta. He stages every moment with fearless energy and a firm touch and turns the rapier wit of Mr. Sorkins script into verbal swordplay while Mr. Eisenberg makes Mark a digital Zorro slashing his way through Silicon Valley. Thats a phenomenal performance by any measure. The intensity of Marks aggressivity is fascinating though you keep waiting for him to reveal some fugitive trace of emotion. And the wait is rewarded when his psyche finally undergoes a subtle change. Its like the just-in-time delivery of a crucial part. ""The Social Network"" is powered by impeccable craftsmanship. Rooney Mara the young actress wholl be playing Lisbeth Salander in Mr. Finchers English-language version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is impressive as Erica the girl in the preface who likens Mark to an exercise machine. Donald Graham Burt did the production design. The elegant cinematography is the work of Jeff Cronenweth (who comes by it naturally; his late father Jordan was one of the best shooters of his time). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the hard-driving music which reflects the nature of Marks mind while the sound design by Ren Klyce is reminiscent of Johnny Greenwoods wonderfully woozy score for ""There Will Be Blood."" Its the sound of ambition untethered. Let Me In ENLARGE Chloe Grace Moretz left as a young vampire and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the neighbor who befriends her in Let Me In. Overture Films Two years ago a Swedish vampire movie called ""Let the Right One In"" was greeted on these shores by glowing reviews. As one of its many admirers I called it remarkably fine and genuinely frightening and reserved special praise for the elegance of Tomas Alfredsons direction and the formal beauty of Hoyte Van Hoytemas cinematography. The film was also greeted by box office revenues reflective of the unfortunate fact that mainstream audience wont turn out for foreign films with subtitles that require reading. Fortunately the English-language version the title of which has reasonably been shortened was written and directed by Matt Reeves whose previous feature was the accomplished sci-fi thriller ""Cloverfield."" His new one works a number of changes on ""Let the Right One In"" though much of it follows the original shot for shot. But this is more than a respectful remake; ""Let Me In"" is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right. Watch a clip from the film ""Let Me In"" starring Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Moretz and Richard Jenkins. The action has been transferred from suburban in Sweden to small-town Los Alamos in 1983; if the New Mexico locale whispers aliens thats no coincidence. As before the standard genders of the vampire genre are reversed. The story centers on a boy whos the victim of schoolyard bullies (his name is Owen and hes played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his androgynous new neighbor whos now called Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz the distinctive heroine of ""Kick-Ass"" which is a credit that warrants both flaunting and living down). Abby needs blood to live but Owen needs a buddy to survive so its a match made in a hell that resembles heaven. (Greig Fraser did the austere cinematography and Michael Giacchino contributed the fine score.) Richard Jenkins plays Abbys unnamed facilitator; his grisly rituals reminded me of Alfred Hitchcocks effort in ""The Torn Curtain"" to show how difficult it can be to kill someone with bare hands. The two young leads are limited vocally--their dialogue scenes sometimes devolve into drone duets--but they make an improbably and magnetically loving couple even if one of the lovers doesnt qualify as human. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Panic Room (2002) Jodie Foster is a newly divorced mother and Kristen Stewart is her young daughter in this ingenious thriller directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by David Koepp. Mother and daughter are first seen in a house-hunting expedition on Manhattans Upper West Side where a real-estate agent showing them through a vast empty brownstone says ""Its a very emotional property."" This proves to be an understatement. One of the brownstones selling points is a panic room a high-tech refuge from disaster or home invasion and whats the point of a panic-room movie if the home isnt promptly invaded? Zombieland (2009) I mentioned ""Zombieland"" a couple of weeks ago in my review of ""Easy A"" since the star of that high school comedy Emma Stone plays the larcenous Wichita in this improbably delicious horror comedy. But the movie really belongs to Jesse Eisenbergs wistful but tenacious neurotic who calls himself Columbus and Woody Harrelsons tight-jawed gun-slinging Tallahassee. (Wichitas kid sister Little Rock is played somewhat tentatively by Abigail Breslin.) Dont expect anything more from the film than entertainment but dont expect less. The director Ruben Fleischer and the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick sustain a high degree of silliness. The Road (2009) All too few people populate this film which was directed by John Hillcoat and adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel. Its concerned mainly with a father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) slogging across a slag-heap American landscape after the planet has suffered an unexplained apocalypse that killed the flora the fauna and most of the spectrum (though the sickly light from a blighted sun does manage to produce one wan rainbow). In a brief but memorable appearance Robert Duvall finds fleeting poetry in an old mans attempt to talk about his own son. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Give an American director coming off a big monster movie the remake rights to a subtle chilling European thriller and you get ""Let Me In."" Matt Reeves shaky-cam hit ""Cloverfield"" featured a giant lizard flattening Manhattan. He doesnt ruin his remake of the masterful Swedish chiller ""Let the Right One In"" but the results are seriously flawed. The original is a film that knows far more about love than do most romances. It is a horror movie not because it concerns a vampire but because the story leaves you horrified and saddened. When Reeves sticks to the original the U.S. version is as cold dark and dangerous as black ice. Sour notes invade the symphony when a yen for hyperbolic makeup effects computer-generated shock effects and gore overtakes him. Instead of exploring uncanny realms of psychological terror usually reserved for Poe or Lovecraft he goes all Freddy Krueger. The film opens with a bang in an ambulance on a snowbound New Mexico road. A writhing acid-burn victim moans and strains against his restraints. Shortly afterward the detective on the case must deal with a bloodier catastrophe in the hospital. The focus then shifts to Owen a lonely middle-school student (Kodi Smit-McPhee who proves that his riveting performance in ""The Road"" was no fluke). Bullied by older boys he wants blood but hes no match for the three thugs who torment him. Enter Abby a mysterious new arrival to Owens apartment complex. They may be kindred spirits. Shes kind of a weirdo loner too given to walking around the frigid courtyard barefoot. Aloof at first she warms to Owen when she sees a scar his persecutors have put on his cheek. When she offers to help he protests ""Youre a girl."" ""Im a lot stronger than you think I am"" she replies. Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl in ""Kick-Ass"") delivers that line with a Mona Lisa smile. Owen is hooked and his attachment grows from awkward puppy love to a connection that is both obsessive and heartbreaking. Observing this development unhappily is a character the credits call The Father though his role in Abbys life is not so simply described. Richard Jenkins plays him as a haunted shell of a man. He is anonymously ordinary the better to run his risky nighttime errands for Abby. His near-slavish devotion suggests that the girl is not as guileless as she seems. His clipped ""Stay away from that boy"" could be a parents advice or a lovers plea. Overture Films Dml - Chloe Grace Moretz is a child vampire in ""Let Me In."" The truth about Abbys nature and her demands on the men in her life emerges slowly against the background of Owens everyday life which magnifies the growing dread. The story has a nightmare logic that survives even Reeves gratuitous shots of Moretz wearing ""Exorcist"" makeup and mirrored contact lenses. But ""Let Me In"" would be better if he had left well enough alone.

Let Me In   1/2 out of fourStars Chloe Grace Moretz Kodi Smit-McPhee Richard Jenkins Elias Koteas Director Matt ReevesDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for strong bloody horror violence language and a brief sexual situationRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Despite being about vampires Let Me In can feel chillingly real. Maybe thats because stars Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee are terrific actors whose young eyes look as if theyve seen more than they should. Maybe director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) simply has a knack for monsters. Or perhaps this is how kids would really react when they discover they cannot die or be sated. Thats the horrific effect of Let Me In another quick and effective remake of a foreign hit that makes adult vampire tales Twilight and True Blood look like childs play. Based on the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In Let Me In doesnt hesitate to borrow heavily from the original including chunks of dialogue set pieces and key props like a Rubiks Cube. And it preserves the story of the gentle bond formed between a 12-year-old outcast Owen (Smit-McPhee) and his neighbor Abby (Moretz) a quiet child who tends to create her solitude by eating the company. Its every bit as bleak as the original. Yet Reeves has made the film more palatable by Americanizing the movie setting his update in late-1980s Los Alamos N.M. Without the buzz of cellphones and pagers Reeves knows these kids represent the last of the untethered era and the silent loneliness nearly chokes the apartment building the kids share. Michael Giacchinos score ratchets the tension. Owen is a bully magnet and the movie quickly establishes a sweet if dysfunctional relationship between the boy and his alcoholic divorced mother (Cara Buono). As in the first film the children meet after a bully pummels Owen while Abby rests in her bathtub tomb. As night falls the two become close. So too are Abby and her father figure a grim Renfro (Richard Jenkins) who is tasked with finding Abby her midnight snacks. It doesnt take long for Owen to figure out Abby who despite her size looks like she could take any of those Twilight punks. The relationship blossoms slowly allowing the children to fill in these murky characters. Much has been made of Hollywoods impatience to get its own version of Let Me In on screen. The timing hasnt diminished the movie just as Martin Scorseses The Departed didnt suffer from following just four years after the 2002 Japanese cop drama Infernal Affairs. And David Fincher is making The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo just two years after the Swedish original. But none carry the delicate ages and subject matter of Let Me In and one has to wonder how long Hollywoods grim experiment with children will last. If Let Me In has a weakness its the films unrelentingly dark tone particularly involving the prepubescent actors. Moretz played a child who cut her adult nemeses with a blade and an NC-17 mouth in Kick-Ass. Smit-McPhee struggled with the end of the world in The Road. Both films tanked. Let Me In is going to lure and please fans of the original; like the first the remake is graphically violent but as tense as good horror gets. Still it may be tough to get new American audiences to watch kids engaged in such horrific stuff no matter how effective the horror.

The boy asks the girl if she will ""go steady."" The girl asks what that means. Her body is turned away so he doesnt see the blood smeared across her mouth.Shes a vampire and has just killed a man.And hes a lonely kid who has finally found someone he can hang out with confide in.Its a heartbreaker of a coming-of-age tale even if theres a string of exsanguinated corpses to be accounted for.Let Me In is a reverential remake of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. It has been directed by Matt Reeves - jettisoning his shaky Cloverfield mini-cams for an exquisitely cinematic and noirish approach. And it is an extraordinarily moving - and yes creepy - piece.Hewing closely to the original which was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a book by John Ajvide Lindqvist Let Me In stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as the boy Owen. He was Viggo Mortensens son in The Road but here he seems to be nobodys Owen lives with his mother in a bleak apartment complex in Los Alamos N.M. but not once do we see her face - the parent is just a body a voice a figure that he occasionally sits with to eat a meal. At school hes bullied and humiliated. At night he stands by his window pivoting his telescope up at the stars down at the neighbors across the way.And then Abby lean and pale and walking barefoot through the snow moves into the adjacent apartment with a man who appears to be her father. She keeps her distance at first but Owen and Abby start talking outside in the dark (of course in the dark; Abby has to hide behind covered windows during daylight). Shes been 12 ""for a long time"" she confesses. He shows her a Rubiks Cube tells her about the creeps taunting him at school. She says he needs to stand up and fight back.Chloe Moretz the precocious profane pipsqueak heroine of Kick-Ass plays Abby with a mournful quietude that becomes all the more disturbing when she goes into predator mode turning (thanks to deft visual effects) into something neither human nor animal but scarily swiftly lethal. But it is her weird hunched-over father (Richard Jenkins) who does most of the killing stalking young men and then draining the blood from their bodies to bring back to the girl.Its a strange relationship to say the least and Owen can hear Abbys and the mans voices as they argue rumbling through his bedroom wall.Let Me In is deeper than the Twilight series and most of the other vampire stuff on screens these days. Reeves - who has transplanted the setting from 1980s Sweden to the Reagan-era 80s and a snowbound swath of the American Southwest - reproduces scenes and even exact shots from the original. But he has captured the painful angsty tween-age soul of the original too.Let Me In is more than just expert mimicry. It honors the spirit of the film it so faithfully exhumes bringing its tale of the undead very much back to life.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> I thought for sure that any Hollywood remake of Tomas Alfredsons artful Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In would be a crass desecration. Well color me blushing. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) proves expert at tracing Alfredsons footsteps creating a mood of chilling terror even while moving the setting from Stockholm to 1980s New Mexico with Reagan raising fears about the Evil Empire. Better yet Reeves plugs in a live wire to play Abby the girl vampire whos been 12 for well a very long time. That would be Chloe Grace Moretz an acting dynamo (see Kick-Ass) whose mesmerizing performance goes deep. Abby fascinates her new neighbor Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of The Road) a boy victimized at school by bullies. He wants to be fearless like Abby whose only parental figure is a guardian played by the great Richard Jenkins. For the sake of newbies to this story Ill say no more except there will be blood and surprising tenderness. Moretz and Smit-McPhee will stay with you especially in a delicate scene where he asks her to be his girl. ""Im not a girl -- Im nothing"" she says. Prepare to be wowed. Its a spellbinder.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Its perfectly fair to ask Why a Hollywood remake of ""Let the Right One In the cult 2008 Swedish film about a bullied boy who makes friends with the vampire girl next door? The answers perfectly simple so that more of you will see it so that money can be made. As a business decision ""Let Me In is a no-brainer and it lands on the shoulders of writer-director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield) to make the movie matter as more than product.Has he succeeded? Its an honorable attempt but theres still no genuine need for this film to exist. I almost wish theyd just sicced the vampire girl on Edward Cullen of ""Twilight and called it ""Let the Right One Win. In its defense ""Let Me In is as cool and controlled as its cinematic source (both movies have their roots in a novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist) and response from early reviewers and in the horror-movie blogosphere has been unexpectedly positive. Yet as someone who has seen ""Let the Right One In and therefore cant un-see it I kept glimpsing the original behind the tracing paper of the new film and wishing I could tear the paper away.If you havent seen ""Let the Right One In this wont be an issue and the storys eerie balance of emotional tenderness and rapacious carnage may hit you full force. I will say that Kodi Smit-McPhee -- he played Viggo Mortensens son in ""The Road -- is excellent as Owen the beleaguered 12-year-old at the heart of ""Let Me In. His mom a Bible-thumping lush (shes played by Cara Buono though we never see her face) his dad out of the picture Owen is a vaguely creepy loner whos tormented by a hulking classmate (Dylan Minnette exquisitely horrid). Owen likes knives a bit too much; left to his own devices hell probably grow up to be a serial killer.A 12-year-old girl named Abby (Chloe Moretz) moves into the apartment next door with a man who appears to be her father (Richard Jenkins); over the course of several nights in the snowy courtyard she and Owen form a bond even as she insists ""we cant be friends. Without much pussyfooting around the film lets us know how ""father goes about procuring Abbys dietary needs and ""Let Me In is at its grim best showing what tedious backbreaking work it can be preparing human beings for slaughter.Moretz made a splash earlier this year as the foul-mouthed Hit Girl in ""Kick-Ass but she knows the subversiveness of this movie is in the writing rather than the playing. She and Smit-McPhee make a touchingly quiet pair of outcasts and Jenkins manages to imply his characters awful backstory through his nuanced stoop. Where the original established the apartment houses community of scruffy losers ""Let Me In cuts them back to a handful and brings on Elias Koteas as a cop trying to solve the slayings -- an example of the remakes conventional thinking.Reeves and cinematographer Greig Fraser turn the wintry wastelands of New Mexico into stark visual poetry yet the rhymes feel forced. The filmmakers have translated the calm Nordic chill of the original film into overly controlled shot language frames by IKEA. When the director tries revving things up as he does in the gruesome swimming pool climax he just gets sloppy. Where the remake most disappoints is in its unconvincing special effects Abby climbing up walls like a cheap computer-generated spider and a hospital nurse bursting into flames in a convincing imitation of a 1980s B horror flick. (The film like the novel and first film is set in the 80s too.)What this well-intended but cautious and contrived Xerox cant help get right is the twinned tragedy at the storys core of an eternally hungry little girl and the boy who must choose between her and humanity. The scene in which Owen does so is the only moment in ""Let Me In that outdoes ""Let the Right One In for emotional horror rather than the easier Hollywood kind. At least Owen and Abby have each other. You on the other hand have Netflix.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet What was once in Swedish is now available in English. For those unfamiliar with the moody cult vampire movie Let The Right One In--many of whom likely refuse to be familiar with it for fear of subtitles--Matt Reeves uncanny remake Let Me In may well be a revelation. Its a faithful adaptation honoring the story nearly to the letter and retaining the slow methodical tone (and bursts of ultra-violence) that sets it apart from Twilight or the shock-filled horror films of the day. And it will surely see more eyes this time around impressing many with its intelligent gratifyingly ambiguous twist on the genre. Yet Let The Right One In still exists. There are prints in circulation the negative is presumably intact and its readily available on DVD albeit with questionable subtitling in early pressings. The Americanized version is a nice parlor trick and will satisfy those who believe fidelity is the principal virtue of a good adaptation but whats the point? Nevertheless a horror movie as singularly offbeat as Let The Right One In doesnt translate easily and Reeves starts with perfect casting. As a lonely picked-on New Mexico middle-schooler Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) is an improvement on his Swedish counterpart disturbed yet accessible and sympathetic. Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) is equally good as his new neighbor an eternally teenage vampire who befriends him and ace character actor Richard Jenkins brings enormous feeling to the role of Moretzs keeper/companion who does much of the dirty work necessary to keep her going. As Smit-McPhee continues to get bullied relentlessly Moretz advises him to fight back hard leading to a series of events that deepen their bond but have serious consequences. Let Me In replicates the Swedish films spare haunted wintry palette and gets the rest of it more or less right but mostly less One fairly silly segment involving cats has been smartly excised but the two key scenes--the climax and the scene that gives the film its title--are significantly less effective. Though its a better facsimile than say The Vanishing or Nightwatch Let Me In doesnt have the thematic justification of other shot-for-shot(ish) American remakes like Funny Games or even Gus Van Sants Psycho which at least counts as some screwy postmodern experiment. Let Me In is a beautiful redundancy. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Freakonomics Next Movie Review The Social Network Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Comments (4) Let Me In Rated R  115 minutes  2010 Cloverfield director Matt Reeves remakes the Swedish horror movie Let the Right One In (2008) about a bullied schoolboy living in a remote sterile housing complex in the 1980s and the little girl next door who turns out to be a vampire. The setting has been changed to Los Alamos New Mexico which was founded in the 1940s as a planned community for the scientists building the atom bomb and Reeves tosses in a few TV clips of President Reagan to reinforce whatever political point he thinks hes making. The language has been changed to English of course which is the only real reason this movie exists; the story development desolate tone and key set pieces are mostly copied from the original movie which in turn was based on a novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.

"Let Me In a shrewd American remake of Swedish vampire thriller - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Let Me In a shrewd American remake of Swedish vampire thrillerLet Me In 3 starsSeptember 30 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticIm a big big fan of "" Let the Right One In"" the chilling 2008 adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvists best-seller about the pale female vampire who is ""12 ... more or less"" and whose budding friendship with a severely bullied boy living in the same apartment complex with minimal parental supervision leads to a gory confrontation with his tormentors. Now we have ""Let Me In"" a shrewd American remake of the Swedish original. The action has been relocated to 1983 Los Alamos N.M. Writer-director Matt Reeves working in a very different key than his previous bombastically scaled but juicy ""Cloverfield"" has done a couple of interesting things with the story structure creating a flashback that catches up on itself around the one-third point. In one instance he has improved on a visual shock effect from the original involving a bed-ridden vampire victim whose hospital stay ends badly. In other instances Reeves approximates shots or a series of shots or entire sequences to fairly good effect and with just enough variation to call the results his own. The Reagan-era setting allows Reeves to put Reagan on TV screens occasionally talking about good and evil while the local police officer ( Elias Koteas plays an unnamed detective) wonders if the rash of bloody killings in the area has something to do with ""satanists."" Young Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is no satanist but the put-upon boy -- a product of a busted marriage -- dreams of exacting violent revenge on the punks at school who bully him psychologically and physically. Its hard to watch these scenes in ""Let Me In"" though of course the harder they are to watch the easier it is for Reeves to generate audience empathy when Owen and his newfound and mysteriously gifted pal Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) start striking back. Abby is a vampire. Her father figure ( Richard Jenkins) must keep her well fed with human blood which means he kills with regularity. Yet clearly he is not happy about it. His life is a small sad one a Renfield life if Renfield were played by Richard Jenkins. And while were at it Can we give it up for Richard Jenkins? He works all the time and never with any visible effort. He is one of the most valuable character actors going these days. The entire cast is strong with Moretz and Smit-McPhee right up to the level of their Swedish counterparts. There are moments in ""Let Me In"" when Reeves goes for the splatter effect in close-up. Many of the grim amazements of the original were photographed from a calm medium shot. Here the techniques more on the nose (as is the musical score by Michael Giacchino a genius when hes on but overstating the melodrama here). I wish I could better judge how well ""Let Me In"" will work for those who havent seen the earlier version. I cant un-see that one. I wish I could. The original was a very good thriller. The new one is simply a good one. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong bloody horror violence language and a brief sexual situation) Cast Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby); Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen); Richard Jenkins (The Father); Elias Koteas (The Policeman); Dylan Minnette (Kenny) Credits Written and directed by Matt Reeves; based on the novel and Swedish film ""Let the Right One In"" by John Ajvide Lindqvist; produced by Donna Gigliotti Alex Brunner Simon Oakes Tobin Armbrust Guy East John Nordling and Carl Molinder.

American director Matt Reeves has decided to follow up his meta-monster movie Cloverfield by heading to John Ajvide Lindqvists ripe source novel for a macabre English-language retooling of the material.He relocates the story to a housing project in New Mexico circa 1983 where David Bowies Lets Dance is heard wafting from open windows. Once again the story concerns the pre-teen winterlight mutual crush between pallid social outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and the feral blood-lusting sad-eyed Abby (Chloe Moretz). And once again both performers are pitch-perfect.Let Me In is a more recognisable horror genre movie though replete with stylised set-pieces scenes of splenetic violence and a lovely milky twilight look.Some members of the horror cognoscenti have not been charmed by this new version but I felt this film trumped the original in a number of ways notably by tapping in to deeper and more obscure emotions concerning the ways in which a child would interpret romantic attraction. It also urges us to question whether the bond between these youngsters is love or something more sinister and domineering. Its also interesting that Reeves - unlike Alfredson - opts to make Abbys victims anonymous so were not invited to sympathise with her just because shes killing unlikeable characters if anything it makes her situation all the more tragic. But perhaps the new films greatest coup is that it refuses to romanticise childhood loneliness framing these troubled tweens as a product of their estrangement rather than cute nonconformists blazing a violent trail.

Let Me In Good Director Matt Reeves. Cast Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Moretz Richard Jenkins. Rating Rated R for strong bloody horror violence language and a brief sexual situation. Vampire movies | Creepy movies American remake does original justice Short answer often. We are so studio executives would have you believe suckers for a happy ending which is why so many foreign films wind up neutered. The 1993 American remake of ""The Vanishing"" is a perfect example. Thus news that ""Cloverfield"" director Matt Reeves was remaking ""Let the Right One In"" a terrific Swedish film about a bullied little boy and the vampire girl who befriends him was met with trepidation. The original is a masterful study of loneliness set in the sterile frigid snow of a suburb of Stockholm that spares nothing in its depiction of the need for blood and belonging. As it turns out the same is true of ""Let Me In"" Reeves remake. With the story now set in the winter of 1983 in Los Alamos N.M. Reeves does not shy from the grittier aspects of the story. This is a really good movie good enough that whether it needed to be made is beside the point. If youve seen the original youll be happy with the results. If you havent then just sit back and enjoy. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives with his mom (Cara Buono) a religious woman who has a drinking problem and whose face we never see in focus emphasizing Owens sense of being on his own. He is small for his age bullied at school sometimes violently. For solace he heads out into the freezing night and hangs around the sad little playground of his depressing apartment complex - again alone. Alone at least until the night a girl and an older man move into the apartment next door. Soon the girl Abby (Chloe Moretz) joins him in the cold dark barefoot impervious to the elements. ""We cant be friends"" she warns but to a boy as alone as Owen such caution is useless. He craves companionship of any kind and in Abby as unusual as she might be - she doesnt know what a Rubiks Cube is - he thinks he might have found some. Im not a girl she tells Owen but thats OK too. What is he? Ignored except when hes mistreated. His needs outweigh his misgivings. Abby has needs as well needs for which her ""father"" (a quiet self-loathing Richard Jenkins) provides. Abby is a vampire. She needs blood and its this mans sorry lot in life to provide it for her. Abby meanwhile encourages Owen to stand up for himself at school with the implication that should he need it she can help him on that front as well. This is a relationship of horribly wounded people willing to look past each others imperfections - thats putting it mildly in Abbys case - for companionship. Smit-McPhee and Moretz do an outstanding job of getting that across in their performances. The title refers to the need of a vampire for someone to invite them in; they cant enter of their own volition. Thus it puts the responsibility on the human in this case Owen. ""Let Me In"" succeeds in portraying a life so solitary that even when he knows whats going on thats a deal Owen is willing to make. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Let Me In (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Let Me In (R) Kids and vampires make a grisly good fit Chloe Moretz as Abby in Let Me In (Overture Films) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald9/29/2010 Editor rating 3 Since most people who go to see Let Me In will not have seen Let the Right One In the 2008 Swedish movie that inspired the remake lets get the comparisons out of the way quickly. The original is drastically superior in two critical signature scenes The swimming-pool sequence and the depiction of what happens to a vampire when he or she enters your house uninvited. The first movie also included a brief but crucial bit of nudity that the Hollywood remake opts to ignore for understandable reasons (theyre much more progressive than us those wacky Europeans). In every other respect though Let Me In is the equal to director Tomas Alfredsons original and even surpasses it in some ways. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) obviously loves and respects the first movie - he replicates its tone atmosphere and cinematography and sometimes reprises scenes shot-for-shot - but he also has his take on John Alvide Lindqvists highly cinematic novel and transplating the story from a Stockholm suburb to 1983 Los Alamos N.M. does more than simply make it relatable to U.S. audiences. The change introduces a subtle subtext about the growing dissatisfaction of Reagan-era America and the dissolution of the large number of nuclear families the Baby Boomers tried and failed to keep together. The resulting dislocation felt by the children of those families turns out to be of huge importance to the plot - the engine that ultimately drives the characters to do rather extreme things. Owen (The Roads Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives in a drab apartment complex with his mother who is overcome by her impending divorce and is barely a presence in her sons life. (Although she appears in several scenes the camera never shows us her face underscoring her perpetual emotional absence. Shes there but shes not there.) Lonely small for his age and bullied at school Owen spies on his neighbors with a telescope (shades of Rear Window that pay off beautifully later) and notices the arrival of new tenants A little girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who walks barefoot in the snow her feet purple and bruised and a man (Richard Jenkins) presumably her father. Soon we discover the man is most certainly not her dad and that the girl Abby is not like most 12-year-olds. ""Just so you know I cant be your friend Abby tells Owen the first time they meet at the complexs playground. And despite their growing relationship - a friendship on the cusp of a young adolescent romance - Abby turns out to be right in the end. She really cant be friends - with anyone ever. Vampires were already ubiquitous before the Twilight mania erupted and now they have become inescapable to the point of exhaustion. But Let Me In yet another tale about the connection between a human being and an ageless bloodsucker doesnt feel trite or cliched. The unusually young age of the protagonists brings a fresh spin to the hoary scenario and the superb performances by the kids (who outdo their Swedish counterparts) ground the story in adult-sized emotions. Moretz in particular so awesome as Hit Girl in Kick Ass proves herself to be a considerable talent giving Abby an old soul a childlike innocence and a menacing demeanor - qualities that blend into a unique and intriguing whole. Although it remains largely faithful to Lindqvists novel Let Me In adds a few new wrinkles (including a hair-raising bungled murder that results in a spectacular car crash with the camera sitting in the back seat). And there are a couple of moments of true unsettling horror including a gruesome one involving Elias Koteas as a detective investigating a series of serial murders. For those who have seen Let the Right One In there is no overcoming the sense of deja vu Let Me In instills If I hadnt seen the original I might have gone ga-ga over Reeves version. But even with the shock of novelty gone the film still draws you into its chilly demonic heart. ""Do you think there is such a thing as evil? a teary Owen asks his father during a telephone call. Let Me In argues thats a question a simple yes or no cant answer. Cast Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Grace Moretz Elias Koteas Richard Jenkins. Director Matt Reeves. Screenwriters Matt Reeves John Alvide Lindqvist. Producer Donna Gigliotti Alex Brunner Simon Oakes. An Overture Films release. Running time 115 minutes.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + When the Swedish horror film ""Let the Right One In"" debuted a couple of years ago it was deservedly hailed as one of the most original vampire tales to come along in a while -- no small feat given the bloodsuckers ubiquity both on the big screen and television.Now its been remade as the American thriller ""Let Me In"" -- but rest assured much of what made the first film so special remains intact.Aside from making a few structural tweaks writer-director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") has stayed extremely faithful in his adaptation right down to chunks of dialogue details like the Rubiks Cube the kids play with and the jungle gym in their courtyard -- even some camera angles. Reeves also smartly recreated the sense of tension that built in the original films stillness and similarly the quiet moments that allowed the two young characters to forge their bond.On the surface both films (based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist) are about a bullied boy and the 12-year-old vampire girl who comes to his rescue. But really theyre about a couple of lonely misfits who are drawn together -- the sweetness in the way they strengthen each other and the sadness of the realization that their friendship cant last -- and Reeves gets that right too.""Let Me In"" is also gory startling and intense as youd expect from any worthwhile vampire story and the score from Michael Giacchino (""Up"") adds to the chilling vibe. Reeves makes the violence more explicit which wasnt terribly necessary -- whats merely implied can be even more frightening -- and the special effects when our hungry young heroine is in full-on attack mode make her movements look jumpy and jerky which detracts from the films otherwise realistic approach.Still the relationship at the films core always works with excellent casting choices in Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen and Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby. Smit-McPhee who played Viggo Mortensens son in ""The Road"" has an innocence about him that makes him a believable underdog; with his wide eyes lanky frame and slightly eerie disposition he resembles a young Billy Bob Thornton. And the engaging Moretz who was such a scene-stealer earlier this year as Hit Girl in ""Kick-Ass"" shows a different side of her talent here. She brings a sense of regret and melancholy to the character whos been 12 ""for a long time"" as she puts it. If its possible ""Let Me In"" actually makes Moretz look less than cute.As in the original the two meet at night (of course) in the center of their shabby snow-covered apartment complex. (The actions been moved to Los Alamos N.M. but it still takes place in the early 80s.) By day Owen gets beaten up by the tough kids at school while his new neighbor Abby slumbers in her makeshift bathtub tomb. When the sun goes down they shyly get to know each other the way any awkward preteens would.Meanwhile Abbys guardian -- played movingly by Richard Jenkins as if he were capable of any other kind of performance -- seeks out sustenance for her but its getting harder to find and with each killing he comes closer to getting caught.A car crash during one such outing thats been added to the remake is harrowing and expertly staged; alas Reeves omitted the Swedish films gnarly cat attack. Still ""Let Me In"" lands beautifully on its own two feet.""Let Me In"" an Overture Films release is rated R for strong bloody violence language and a brief sexual situation.

Here he spies a potential playmate moving in a girl around his age. Watching her shuffle through the snow in bare feet led by her embalmed middle-aged guardian (Richard Jenkins) you might suspect theyre part of a penitent religious cult. You suspect worse soon after when the town experiences a ritual murder with vampire tracks.The setting of Let Me In is Los Alamos New Mexico 1983. The feathery slow-falling snow comes with the materials Scandinavian pedigree Swede John Ajvide Lindqvists novel Let the Right One In filmed by Tomas Alfredson in 2008 was enough of a boutique hit to attract this American remake by Cloverfield director Matt Reeves. Lina Leanderssons mysterious neighbor is replaced by Chloe Moretzs Abby waifish home-school-creepy and even more socially maladjusted than Owen. On the common ground of isolation they thaw to each other. Unknown to Owen if not the viewer is the fact that Abbys trauma has something to do with the killings which her guardian is seen to be involved in which she may be a party to and to which Owen as their courtship deepens will become an accomplice.Reeves adopts the International-style flatness of Alfredsons film a mixture of ""philosophical"" long shots brittle scoring slowed-pulse performances and blankness passing as clarity. In an opening that assigns Elias Koteass cop to investigate the killings its clear this will be a movie with lots of dialogue pitched as if theres a colicky infant sleeping in the next room. Reevess alterations include feeding the plot through Koteass police-procedural and a Significant Effect in which Owens Mom is seen always with her face just out of frame or as an out-of-focus blur. His greatest addition shows off his knack for action-verisimilitude a suspense scene culminating in a sustained one-shot inside a getaway car as it backs over an embankment so perfect and jarringly felt you want to bust out clapping when its done.Lindqvists novel and its permutations are akin to the Twilight franchise in their marriage of ""doomed young lovers"" and vampire tropes. But where Steph Meyer preaches abstinence Let Me In keeps its hungry carnivores well-fed as meek Owen gets a confidence boost from supernatural protection on the way to a grisly Revenge of the Nerds.Americanizing the material Reeves contextualizes the story squarely in Moral Majority country. Ronald Reagans ""Evil Empire"" address plays prominently during Let Me Ins prologue. Owens Moms chintzy Christian decor and grace over silent dinnertimes are presented as further evidence of the all-encompassing lameness of 80s flyover where the only joy is smuggled in on vinyl on the forgotten LPs from Freur and the Greg Kihn Band who Owen and Abby illicitly enjoy.If irreligious Let Me In believes in the sanctity of suffering with close-ups of Smit-McPhee swallowing his shamed tears to the Northwest Boychoir. The child performances are credible likewise the feel for pubescent isolation and vulnerability. But Reevess measured style barely conceals a pandering Young Adult sentimentality as the movie approaches ultimate comeuppance for Owens tormentors--wish fulfillment without the elan of Piranha 3Ds douchebag mass-slaughter facile compared to the irony of Massacre at Central High or the head-on collision of morbid faith and polyester pop in Carrie two movies that anticipated suburban-school killings instead of skating around their consequences.Let Me In is a slow build-up to irreparable action to Owen and Abbys joining paths as a fatal couple. There is no fork in the road for Owen along the way. He is given nothing to leave behind. And there is scant indication that the rest of humanity is anything more than livestock for sensitive souls to feed on. Theres a human tragedy somewhere here--but aggrandized puppy-love romance and stylish revenge fantasy is all that lingers.

Ive heard more than one critic describe writer-director Matt Reeves gloomy gripping Reagan-era vampire yarn ""Let Me In"" as an unnecessary or redundant film but I strongly disagree. First of all many fans of the hipster-culty Swedish hit ""Let the Right One In"" will simply be relieved that this artfully translated American remake doesnt screw up a beloved original. In fact its been made with care and integrity and while it probably wont provoke the same degree of fan loyalty even a modestly scaled English-language film like this one has a potential viewership thats many times larger than any foreign flick.Although the social context of director Tomas Alfredson and screenwriter-novelist John Ajvide Lindqvists ""Let the Right One In"" is never directly discussed and isnt the films subject I still think its crucial. The vampire girl who moves into a downtrodden Stockholm apartment complex in midwinter rescues the preteen protagonist from a dismal home life and a school dominated by bullies but also from a Scandinavian social democracy that seems to be in terminal decline. Reeves film sticks fairly close to the originals plot and characters -- and even sometimes its shots -- but he ingeniously alters the context in order to capture a similar mood.Its the early 80s in suburban New Mexico; ""Lets Dance"" and ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?"" are on the radio and Ronald Reagan is on TV talking about Jesus and evil. Maybe 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) doesnt know it yet but he belongs to the first generation of postwar Americans to face a landscape of lowered expectations. Odd-looking androgynous Abby (Chloe Moretz) who just moved in next door to Owen and his harried pious single mom (Cara Buono) and who seems insensible to cold belongs to quite a different generation. She doesnt know what a Rubiks cube is and has never eaten a Now amp; Later candy. She presumably has no preference between Bowie and Boy George. You Might Also Like Reeves depicts much the same ruthless preadolescent world seen in Alfredsons film a zone where adults have little influence and where gender and sexuality are highly loaded topics. If anything its even clearer in this film that the two central characters are gender-muddled Owen gets called ""little girl"" at school and when he asks Abby to go steady she insists ""Im not a girl. Im nothing."" Richard Jenkins gives a muted performance as Abbys so-called father staying in the background behind Moretz and Smit-McPhee who are well matched as a pair of otherworldly sprites.Not all Reeves innovations are improvements but he doesnt do anything to ruin the movie either. Elias Koteas in an unkempt wild-man do plays a local cop who hones in on Abby and her father after Los Alamos N.M. experiences a wave of bizarre possibly ritualistic murders. Consequently ""Let Me In"" is a bit more of a conventional police procedural and a bit less about the troubling proto-sexual or quasi-sexual relationship between the central duo. But for fans of ""Let the Right One In"" this intriguing remake will prove a welcome surprise and may even shed new light on the characters and situation. For the much larger audience who never found out what the fuss was about ""Let Me In"" offers an imaginative and largely intact retelling of this gory troubling uniquely sweet and uniquely dark vampire tale. ""Let Me In"" will open Oct. 1 in many major cities. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Daily Edition Login to download Let Me In Film Review 228 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS This unsettling effective American remake really gets under the skin as one of the years most powerful thrillers. TWITTER TORONTO -- The hauntingly affecting 2008 Swedish coming-of-age vampire import ""Let the Right One In"" goes the inevitable English-language remake route -- with similarly potent results. Written and directed by Matt Reeves the retitled ""Let Me In"" achieves the rare feat of remaining rigorously reverential to its source material while emerging as a highly accomplished work in its own right. Like the original (based on a bestselling novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist) the story of a tender bond formed between a 12-year-old social outcast and his lonely new next-door neighbor with a dark secret plays like a decidedly less wispy pubescent take on the ""Twilight"" franchise to profoundly disturbing effect. The first production out of the gate for recently resurrected British horror brand Hammer Films ""Let Me In"" should handily bring in new blood while earning the respect of the originals rabid international cult fan base. Reeves whose previous feature effort was the hit 2008 apocalyptic thriller ""Cloverfield"" immediately establishes the uneasy foreboding tone as an ambulance wends its way through some seriously dark stormy and frozen New Mexican terrain (subbing nicely for the originals bleak suburban Stockholm backdrop). After a very brief prologue setting the Reagan-era ""Evil Empire"" climate the time frame retreats somewhat to introduce Owen a slight quiet-spoken 12-year-old bully magnet (sensitively played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and the remote Los Alamos apartment complex where he lives with his divorced alcoholic mother. Owens hopeless pre-teen existence is about to take an unexpected turn with the arrival of Abby (equally impressive Chloe Moretz) who doesnt quite prove to be his contemporary despite her innocent appearance. While he faithfully recreates a number of sequences and shifts the positions of others Reeves also incorporates some new stuff that for the most part heightens rather than diminishes the originals understated intensity. Sure we probably could have lived without the glowing vampire eyes and the religious overtones come on a tad strong but the tweaks are otherwise skillfully employed favoring unique camera p.o.v. over CGI excess. Thats particularly true of a terrifying car crash sequence that takes place entirely from inside the out-of-control vehicle. Key to the remakes ultimate success is the casting of the troubled young leads.Smit-McPhee and Moretz possess the soulful depth and pre-adolescent vulnerability necessary to keep it compellingly real. Also good is Richard Jenkins whose melancholic demeanor is put to good use as Moretzs protector while Elias Koteas makes for a credible moral compass in the added role of a police officer attempting to find a culprit responsible for all those ritual murders. Echoing the prevailing horrific/mournful vibe is Michael Giacchinos masterful score which is simultaneously bone-chilling and achingly poignant.

Fans of ""Let the Right One In"" can relax. ""Cloverfield"" director Matt Reeves hasnt ruined the elegant Swedish vampire story by remaking it. If anything hes made some improvements including the addition of a tense action-horror sequence in the middle of the film. While all that is artful about ""Let Me In"" comes straight from the original the Hollywood version commands respect for not dumbing things down offering classy ""Sixth Sense""-style crossover potential as it lures both genre suckers and fresh blood curious to see how a remake starring ""Kick-Ass "" Hit Girl and that kid from ""The Road"" stacks up. Relocated from an icy burb outside Stockholm to equally chilly Los Alamos N.M. ""Let Me In"" poses an alternative to the overplayed coming-of-age genre offering teenage misfit Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a chance to avoid growing up -- which in contrast to other vampire stories doesnt involve being bitten or becoming a vampire himself. Instead John Ajvide Lindqvists novel -- championed by many as a thinking mans ""Twilight"" -- suggests an arrangement in which a young girl suspended forever at age 12 seeks devoted caretakers who accompany her as she moves from city to city feeding on human blood. The ""Twilight"" connection is further cemented by the fact that for some reason the passionate vampire (played here by Chloe Grace Moretz) refuses to pass on the curse to her lover who grows older with each passing day while remaining comfortably insulated from the adult world in her company. And sex? Thats out of the question given not only the age of the boy involved but also the vampires lack of sex organs (a detail revealed in startling detail in the original but wisely withheld here). When Abby (Moretz) arrives in Los Alamos she is accompanied by a sketchy-looking older gentleman (Richard Jenkins in a role that was once tantalizingly linked to Philip Seymour Hoffman). To the casual observer he might appear to be her father. To auds he reads more like a child molester. In fact he is her devoted yet chaste lover tasked with protecting her secret bringing her blood and tucking her safely into a light-proof bed each morning. But Jenkins character is starting to get sloppy. Maybe he wants to get caught which means it would be time for Abby to let someone else in on her secret -- someone like Owen an outsider whos picked on at school and is just beginning to show a capacity for homicidal rage. Smit-McPhee certainly looks the part -- not of a killer necessarily but of someone picked on and pliable enough to be molded into one. Instead of collecting grim newspaper clippings he lurks in his room and spies on the neighbors. The greatest difference between Reeves film and helmer Tomas Alfredsons original is in the casting. Abbys equivalent in the original had a profound old-soul look about her allowing auds to sense the decades shed been repeating this routine. Moretz (quickly becoming the indie worlds go-to teen actress with precocious roles in ""500 Days of Summer"" and ""Kick-Ass"" landing her work on Martin Scorseses next pic) represents a different more innocent spin on the character. When Abby describes herself as ""12 more or less"" that seems accurate and an old photo taken with another boy who looks her age suggests a series of similar past relationships. These ideas were all presented quite gracefully in the original which departed somewhat from Lindqvists book in which her guardian was presented as a pedophile the young vampire had recruited. Reeves who also wrote the script for ""Let Me In"" seems to favor the more resonant notion of an endless cycle of tortured romance one that takes its toll on Abbys partners by demanding that they become serial killers. Perhaps the difference in titles is significant Whereas the vampire girl finally met her soulmate (""the right one"") in the original here she is caught in a sad endless cycle. Otherwise its the same movie the same strange metal playground the same school bullies the same killer climax at the school pool (only the scene with the cats is missing). The tone feels slightly less self-consciously arty and some subtle touches have been added to make things clearer but overall with everyone from d.p. Greig Fraser to composer Michael Giacchino offering same-but-different contributions ""Let Me In"" is so similar as to leave some wondering ""Why bother?"" Reeves remake seems to exist solely on the assumption that a large subtitle-averse aud somehow wasnt served by Alfredsons original (the R rating seems a bigger obstacle though this new version subtracts only the disconcerting full-frontal shot). Certainly the Swedish film which ranks among the strongest horror entries of the last decade deserved to find a wider base in the U.S. though in a game of ""let the right version win"" back-from-the-grave horror shingle Hammer Films is clearly gambling theyve got the goods.
