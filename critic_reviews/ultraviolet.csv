Another striking modification Wimmers late-21st-century Gloria is in her words ""something less than human""--a diseased vampire in fact who carries a real boy in her nth-generation iBook even though theres a Blood War being waged between humans and her kind in whats left of Shanghai. Because the movies smeared pastel images strongly suggest an untweaked blowup from the Xbox its never clear whether the rail-thin Jovovich actually performed in the film or just consented to full-body digitization. And though terms such as ""dimension-compressing"" and ""vampiral antigens"" are ostensibly meant to clarify things the most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3000 theaters.

Comments Ultraviolet ""My name is Violet"" Milla Jovovich announces in the opening voice-over of this Marvel Comics adaptation ""and I was born into a world you may not understand."" Thats putting it mildly--despite the expository speeches draped over this like birthday bunting the story remains largely incomprehensible. Violet is a vampire (or ""hemophage"") and one of those sexy killing machines so popular of late living in a glassy futuristic world threatened by pestilence. Director Kurt Wimmer has an eye for jackboot chic (Equilibrium) and the images here have been digitally polished so that the characters skin is smoother than porcelain. Its a cool effect--I spent most of this interminable actioner wondering if one could bounce a quarter off Jovovichs bare midriff. PG-13 88 min. By J.R.

In the late 21st century a mutant strain of smart fast and lethal hemophages (quasi-vampires) rebel against dictator Daxus (Nick Chinlund). The germophobic tyrant has discovered a cure for the mutant strain in the form of a cloned and conveniently flat-packed boy Six (Cameron Bright whose role is itself a virtual clone of the one he played in X-Men The Last Stand). As the titular Ultraviolet ex-model turned ass-kicking uber-babe Milla Jovovich changes her outfit and hair colour for each tedious fight scene in one memorably silly confrontation her perfectly coiffed avenger disposes of 700 soldiers brandishing enough weaponry to take over a small African country. Fans of Wimmers cult debut feature Equilibrium claim that this 87-minute studio version is a travesty of his original two-hour rough-cut; the rest of us should be grateful we were spared more of this derivative adolescent tosh.

Posted March 8 2006 -- 1200 AM EST Futuristic vamp Violet (Milla Jovovich) in the early goings of the lo-fi sci-fi thriller Ultraviolet warns someone ""Dont overthink it."" Sage advice for anyone masochistic enough to watch this pile of poorly pixelated vampire poo. Yet its impossible to take Crank your brain to its lowest possible idle and youll still overthink Ultraviolet. Set in a generic crudely rendered futuristic dystopia (the computer imagery is sub-Tron) the story picks up in jabbery voice-over telling how the military while trying to build supersoldiers made a vampire virus instead then launched a genocide to correct its mistake. The Big Bad is one Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund) a germophobe with tea strainers up his nose. Violets a freelance member of the ""Hemophage"" resistance who dispatches legions of faceless evildoers to bloodless badly choreographed deaths changes her hair color at will all but refuses to wear entire shirts and engages in conversations like this ""Hes not dead"" ""What do you mean?"" ""I mean hes alive"" At least shes not overthinking it.

"All-too-familiar action uninspired adventure mark Ultraviolet - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies All-too-familiar action uninspired adventure mark Ultraviolet By Jonathan Perry Globe Correspondent  |  March 4 2006 Violet the central character in Ultraviolet"" is almost as versatile as the actress who portrays her ubiquitous pop culture chameleon Milla Jovovich. Violet is a sword-fighting high-kicking gun-sprouting mutant soldier; Jovovich meanwhile has been a folk-pop singer beauty product hawker and red-carpet fashionista. With the Resident Evil"" films already to her credit she can now unequivocally add action-flick superheroine to her resume.With Kurt Wimmers movie Jovovich joins Kate Beckinsale Charlize Theron Halle Berry Jennifer Garner and Uma Thurman as the latest star to don a really tight leather catsuit and sensible high-heeled boots with which to kick the bad guys faces in. And to avoid the nasty chapped lips that can come with racing ones motorcycle up the side of a skyscraper to elude the helicopters (more bad guys) after her Violet/Milla wears a good amount of lip gloss.Jovovich is bad and not in a good way. She turns in an epically expressionless performance (maybe she thought it was one of her modeling gigs?) but she sure looks great deadpanning lines like Youre all gonna die"" and Come and get it."" Still youd expect more bright pulpy life if not believability out of a comic-book character.But this retread is certainly not all Jovovichs fault. Also to blame are the shopworn story written and directed by Wimmer (writer-director of 2002s Equilibrium"") predictable special effects -- lots of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""-meets-The Matrix"" fight scenes -- generic techno-bombast soundtrack and an airbrushed 80s Heavy Metal"" comics look that veers from soft-focus Miami Vice"" pastels to hypersaturated anime coloring.The plot involves the ostracized ghetto-ized vampire-virus-mutated Hemophages"" (of which Violet is one) who living in a 21st-century world governed by fear of disease decide to strike back at those who would stamp them out. Violet is their only hope for stealing a superweapon from the evil Daxus (the familiar villain-faced Nick Chinlund honing his chops for a future Bond role) whos so coldly lethal that he can kill five soldiers while not spilling a drop from a cup of coffee.Turns out that when Violet opens the case housing the weapon which resembles a white toilet seat inside is a 9-year-old boy submerged in sparkling water -- a dying clone we later learn who goes by the name Six (a very doleful Cameron Bright). Having been forced by the Daxus crew to terminate her own pregnancy years before and not sure whether the lab-rat Six is the secret to the Hemophages salvation or destruction she feels compelled to protect him against would-be assailants.There is the requisite climactic duel in the dark with Daxus which gives Violet a chance to turn her weapon into a sword of fire; plus lots of stomped solar plexuses en route and ultimately a message of fragile hope for all.Reportedly the source of Wimmers inspiration for the can-do woman defending the helpless kid from the baddies was John Cassavetess 1980 film Gloria."" But Jovovich is no Gena Rowlands and judging by the laughably inane stilted dialogue of Ultraviolet"" (Are you mental?"" Daxus queries Violet as shes about to take on a 700-soldier army) Wimmer aint no Cassavetes.Jonathan Perry can be reached at RoughGemsaol.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Ultraviolet | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ultraviolet ) Ultraviolet (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Kudos to Sony for not holding advance screenings of Ultraviolet. This is the kind of crap you want to keep away from critics. Masochist that I am I went to see this on my own dime and regret every cent spent to gain admission to the theater. This is another one of those pointless action superhero movies that unfolds like a video game in which the viewer is unable to participate. On more than one occasion I have written that theres nothing more frustrating than watching someone else play a video game. Now I have found an exception to the rule - watching someone cheat while playing a video game. Because thats what the makers of Ultraviolet do cheat. Uwe Boll would be proud of this movie. Its pretentious and oh-so-serious. The tone of the movie is one of high art but it stinks like a landfill. It doesnt matter that the acting is wooden the storyline is incomprehensible and the action sequences are plodding. All the filmmakers care about is that theres a dash of panache to the proceedings. Its hard to argue that Ultraviolet has a unique look. The live actors appear as computer generated as the backgrounds. Considering the lack of humor and emotion displayed by the performers one might assume that their only participation was to allow their three-dimensional images to be programmed into a computer and reproduced. (A better guess is that they did all their ""acting"" in front of a blue screen then their images were digitally touched up.) To the extent that the plot makes any sense it goes something like this Violet (Milla Jovovich) is a ""Hemophage"" (a woman inflicted with a blood sickness) who has been exiled from a society paranoid about pathogens. Possessing extraordinary agility strength and dexterity with weapons she becomes the best hope her race has for a champion against the military forces of Daxus (Nick Chinlund) who seeks the destruction of the Hemophages. He has recently created a doomsday weapon and Violet is charged with destroying it. The agent of destruction turns out to be a boy who goes by the moniker of Six (Cameron Bright). Unwilling to commit cold-blooded murder Violet is forced to go on the run from her own people as well as Daxus. Her only ally is Garth (William Fichtner) a scientist who loves her. Director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) intends the movie to unfold more like a comic book than a generic computer game. He succeeds in this aim for the films opening credits. After that as we move from one lifeless fight to the next the sameness of the proceedings reminds one of level advancing in video games. Because the PG-13 rating demands bloodless violence the battles are antiseptic and confusing. Violet twirls her sword and a dozen opponents tumble to the ground. On those occasions when the so-called action takes a break we are subjected to inane exposition that explains little but treats us to passages of embarrassingly cheesy dialogue. While Wimmer may be proud of his stylistic approach to directing he should have chosen a pen name for the writing credit. It occurs to me that the lack of lucidity in the story could be the result of extreme cuts to the final print. There are times when events jump forward in a jarring manner. If thats the case maybe the DVD release will contain a directors cut that might make sense. As for the actors... I hesitate to say anything about them because its unclear how much of their performances are attributable to the computer. Id like to say that Jovovich doesnt display much range (except in hair color) but shows admirable physicality but who knows? Even the butt shot might have been generated inside some animators computer. When it comes to comic book-ish science fiction action movies not screened for critics Ultraviolet falls short of mark set by Aeon Flux and that bar is already so low that even a dwarf would have trouble doing the limbo under it.

(AP Photo/Screen Gems/Jay Maidment) In this photo provided by Sreen Gems Milla Jovovich stars as Violet a rogue warrior bent on protecting her new race in ""Ultraviolet."" (AP Photo/Screen Gems/Jay Maidment) Super soldier Milla Jovovich must battle humans and excessive computer animation in Ultraviolet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Ultraviolet Sci-fi. Starring Milla Jovovich Cameron Bright and Nick Chinlund. Directed by Kurt Wimmer. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Ultraviolet"" is a movie so overwhelmingly computer animated that its maybe two light cycles away from qualifying as a ""Tron"" sequel. You can see how action heroine Milla Jovovich might have been attracted to the starring role -- paint one wall green and she could have done most of the acting from her living room. Unfortunately the kinetic visuals that start out looking kind of cool quickly become tedious and ultimately mind numbing. In the end ""Ultraviolet"" is a film to be enjoyed only by science-fiction movie completists and middle school boys with extreme cases of attention deficit disorder. The plotline of ""Ultraviolet"" accomplishes the difficult task of being both complicated and repetitive. Leather-clad Violet (Jovovich wearing Chers haircut from the 1965 ""Baby Dont Go"" tour) is an apparently indestructible soldier in a futuristic battle between humans and her vampire-like race of superpeople called Hemophages. The human bad guys are led by the evil Daxus (Nick Chinlund) who for some unexplained reason has tiny salt shakers shoved up his nostrils for the entire movie. Related Stories Ultraviolet is over the top Violet must defend a mysterious boy named Six from Daxus minions most of whom are dressed like they know how to kick butt then stand like idiots and let themselves get decapitated. Except this is a PG-13 movie so you dont really see any bloody heads roll -- unless its from blurry far-away angles. ""Ultraviolet"" must have cost a lot of money. The amount of special effects in this film makes ""The Fifth Element"" look like ""Grizzly Man"" by comparison. In addition writer and director Kurt Wimmer appears to have gone to the expense of building a time machine so he could go back to 1985 and get a young Wil Wheaton to play Six. (The makers of ""Ultraviolet"" credit an actor named Cameron Bright but judging solely by looks Im sticking to my theory.) Unfortunately Wimmer didnt write much of a script. There are few ""Minority Report""-style surprises in the antiseptic urban landscape where most of the action takes place. In this cliched future there appear to be only three jobs diabolical corporate executive type scientist and armed guard. And while the class system is simple the dialogue isnt -- filled with jibber-jabber about antidotes antigens and living hosts that makes little sense if you dont take notes. The amount of confusion this movie generates falls somewhere between the first and second ""Matrix"" sequel. After a few fun scenes in the first 15 minutes the action also becomes unoriginal. It seems like half the battles consist of five to 50 henchmen surrounding Violet who dispatches them instantly with one swing of her sword or a few bursts of gunfire. (If you ever have to ride the Wil Wheaton time machine to the land of ""Ultraviolet"" armed guard is definitely the worst of the three jobs to have.) The drama ends confusingly with a flaming sword battle that takes place partially in the dark and appears to have equal influences from ""Highlander"" and that annual Yule log that appears every Christmas on KICU. The Yule log was way more entertaining. -- Advisory On top of the films violence and strong language ""Ultraviolet"" may be the worst date movie ever. Between the nonstop action and the lack of a strong male lead your chance of hooking up after taking someone to this movie is slightly less than the chance that ""Ultraviolet"" will win the best picture Oscar in 2007.

""Ultraviolet"" is the CG movie-as-computer game with a difference. While the best games demand replay sci-fi/chopsocky specialist Kurt Wimmers latest isnt likely to lure repeaters except perhaps lonely young guys communing with an athletically trim Milla Jovovich on their bedroom tubes when this goes to vid which will doubtless be soon. Those who feel Sidney Lumets remake of ""Gloria"" was the worst possible retelling of John Cassavetes unusual action meller may reconsider in light of ""Ultraviolet"" which pressbook informs Wimmer spun from a personal love of the film. Jovovichs vengeful Violet is a gal on a rampage who takes an innocent boy under her wing but any resemblance to ""Gloria"" stops there. Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping thats so total -- Sonys top-flight high-def cameras visibly low-budget CG work exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue -that it arrives a nearly lifeless film. After a zippy comic book-inspired title sequence that graphically mimics the dazzling intro of ""Hulk"" Violet warns auds -- all too accurately -- that she was ""born into a world you may not understand."" Infected with a blood virus first developed to build super soldiers she is part of an underground group with enhanced physical powers. Her nemesis is Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund) whose complete command of the hyper-high tech city where the action is set begs the unanswered question Who can the Cardinal be? Violet is ordered by underground leader Nerva (Sebastien Andrieu slumming after Agnes Jaouis ""Look at Me"") to retrieve an encased weapon. After mowing down an army of soldiers in her way Violet discovers that the weapon is actually a child with special attributes named Six (Cameron Bright far less spooky here than he was in ""Birth""). Seeing that everyone is out to get Six -- whose blood may contain a cure to what ails Violet and her ilk -- she protects him while suffering from her own bouts of illness with some help along the way from doc friend Garth (a wasted William Fichtner). Inanely grim pic could have easily been a delicious genre spoof if made by a different writer-director. Wimmers filmmaking exudes geeky literalism and the absorption of many better chopsocky pics but offers nothing new. Fight scenes choreographed by Mike Smith are repetitious using the same ideas and moves over and over while gunplay is ""Matrix""-lite. Jovovich builds her perf out of a series of poses while real thesping is handled by ace character actor Chinlund. Tech work is low quality particularly in effects-heavy sequences that look like rough drafts rather than the finished product. Shanghai locales have inspired clean lensing by Hong Kong vet Arthur Wong Ngok Tai. Klaus Badelts score hammers aud ears into submission.
