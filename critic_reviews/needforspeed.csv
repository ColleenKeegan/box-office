Deal With It. Richard Corliss March 14 2014 SHARE DreamWorks A junk vehicle with a souped-up motor this new Fast amp; Furious clone delivers cool races chases and crashes In the canyon-wide disconnect between what moviegoers see on screen and what they find in real life consider the race-car film genre in the wake -- the literal wake -- of Paul Walker. Co-star of the immensely popular Fast amp; Furious franchise which glamorizes stunt driving Walker died last Nov. 30 when the red Porsche Carrera GT two-seater his pal Roger Rodas was driving crashed into a light pole in Santa Clarita Cal. Police said the car may have been going 100 mph; both the Porsche and its passengers were incinerated. Walkers death interrupted filming of Fast amp; Furious 7 which was due out this summer though shooting is to resume next month. Cant wait till 2015 for a movie about car races chases and crashes? Heres Need for Speed based on the worlds top-selling racing video game. In the first act three guys -- brooding speedster Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) his cute greasemonkey Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) and the rich bad guy Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) -- race identical cars down the highways of Mount Kisco N.Y. When Dino realizes hes about to lose the race he back-ends Petes car which takes flight hits a light pole on a bridge bursts into flames and crashes in the river below. Dinos killer car like Paul Walkers is red. (READ Fast amp; Furious 7 director Justin Lin on the life and death of Paul Walker) And the weird thing is that while watching this scene even a viewer who had the details of Walkers death seared into his brain doesnt think about them. His eyes are transfixed by the choreography and spectacle of the stunt the horrific majesty of the red cars launch and torque its fiery collision with the pole and its fatal descent like winged Icarus into the water. Such is the (possibly toxic) power of a superbly crafted action sequence over the moviegoer. Kinetic immediacy obliterates factual memory and art -- which in todays films so often too often means gorgeous VFX or daredevil stunt work -- transcends life and death. Later in Need for Speed Tobey driving his retooled Ford Mustang cross-country with Brit bird Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots) is pursued by Dinos rifle-toting goons through the Utah Canyonlands and toward the Moab Fault. Fortunately his buddy Benny (Scott Mescudi aka rapper Kid Cudi) who spends most of the movie hijacking one plane or another has accessed a U.S. Army Apache helicopter. Flying above the car Benny drops a long seat belt which Tobey buckles just as the Mustang sails off a cliff and the chopper totes him and Julia to safety. Theyre like Thelma and Louise only with a happy ending. (READ Richard Schickels 1991 cover story on Thelma amp; Louise by subscribing to TIME) Happy middle actually since Tobey is headed to San Francisco for the big super-secret De Leon race masterminded by a manic entrepreneur named Monarch (Michael Keaton) who oversees and narrates the action like Wolfman Jack in American Graffiti. Winding through the forests and coastal highways of Mendocino this is a winner-take-all challenge for six contestants -- including of course Dino -- and eventually dozens of police cars and copters. Dinos thugs have totaled Tobeys Mustang so hes at the wheel of what car? The red one Dino was driving when he sent Pete on his trip to that automobile graveyard in the sky. Like an abandoned vehicle with a complex motor that legendary Mustang retooler Carroll Shelby would be proud of Need for Speed wont win prizes for dramaturgy. The script by George Gatins from a story he contrived with his brother John (who wrote the Denzel Washington drama Flight) is generic revenge motif the poor boy hates the rich kid not only for his myriad evil qualities but because he stole Tobeys girl Anita (Dakota Johnson quite a bit of whom will be seen as the female lead in next years Fifty Shades of Grey film). Tobeys pit crew mirrors the tokenistic ethnic diversity of Fast amp; Furious -- the black guy (Mescudi) the Hispanic guy (Ramon Rodriguez) the Arab guy (Rami Malek) and the cute blond dead Pete (Australias Harrison Gilbertson) -- each with one quirk none with distinctive appeal. (SEE The Need for Speed trailer) Paul known to Breaking Bad fans as the whiny needy half-bright Jesse Pinkman originally auditioned for the Dino role. Short and unprepossessing hes not hero material though by glowering and dropping his voice an octave he can pass for an outlaw adult. Cooper is a better choice for Dino; he mans the wheels of his swank cars with the shifty-eyed intensity of a guy watching porn in his work cubicle. And Poots recalls English actresses of 40 50 years ago -- the enormous eyes of Rita Tushingham the fetching platypus mouth and careless sex appeal of Susan George -- and is nearly plausible as a capable racer. Still its not until the last lap of their 45-hour cross-country journey that Tobey lets the girl drive so he can take a fast nap before the Mendocino finale. It will not surprise you to learn that character complexity is not why people -- do I mean only men? -- go to car movies. Directed by stunt coordinator Scott Waugh in an ambitious step up from his Navy SEALS superhero picture Act of Valor Speed gets souped up with eight to 10 action scenes from a drag race through the streets of Mount Kisco and a police chase through Detroit to the Mendocino gig ending at the Point Arena lighthouse -- a berserk Baedecker tour of the Lower 48. Waugh also showcases fast driving against the traffic the chaining of a cop car to a gas-station pump and a high-speed refueling of the Mustang from the gas nozzle of his crews van driving next to it. Call it rampant assholery or just cool guy stuff. (READ Corlisss review of Act of Valor) Besides filching plot lines from 70s car-crazy films like Vanishing Point Death Race and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry Waugh has the big lug nuts to show a clip from Bullitt the 1968 movie starring the original Steve Queen that provided the blueprint for urban car chases. Yet Waugh backs his nerve with cinematic verve -- as long as you suspend the usual disbelief and dont tot up the damages to the cars and lives of cops and civilians. The stunts like the best ones in the Fast amp; Furious films are often primally thrilling. They work on the most primitive part of the brain in the most sophisticated manner Need for Speed is also going up against its own video game which has sold something like 150 million units over its 20-year span. But video races even with the viewer at the digital wheel cant compete with a movie version of the real thing executed by insane geniuses who put their lives on the line so you can pretend to risk yours. This is cinema reduced or distilled to its purest definition of movies that move. If you want dewy humanity in your entertainment watch Lifetime.

"Need for Speed | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; need-for-speed ) Need for Speed (United States 2014) March 16 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Okay no one anticipated that Need for Speed the motion picture interpretation of the popular (and addictive) series of video games would resemble Shakespeare. There was however a reasonable expectation that some of the adrenaline would transfer over making Need for Speed a slight-but-enjoyable ride (not entirely like one of the Fast and Furious films). What no one could have envisioned however is what has become the reality this movie is a complete bore. Generic car chases typically feel like time wasters and Need for Speed offers little more than a series of them strung together. Are there moments of innovation? Perhaps but theyare few and far between. I canat claim that this movie presented anything I hadnat seen before. Director Scott Waughas intention may have been to elevate my pulse but the only thing at which he succeeded was getting me to check my watch repeatedly. I suppose one could argue that the real headliners are the cars. Certainly the human beings appearing in Need for Speed are photographed less lovingly and developed with less precision than their automotive co-stars. Nevertheless I suspect weare intended to sympathize with the man with the most screen time. That would be Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) a street racer who doesnat seem to give a shit about the people he inconveniences until his protA(c)gA(c) Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) dies in a race. Tobey goes to jail while the dastardly villain behind the incident Dino (Dominic Cooper) worms his way out of trouble with a fake alibi. After doing his time Tobey emerges from behind bars with one goal avenge Pete. That means getting even with Dino. Not by punching him in the face or blowing his brains out but by beating him in an underground race called ""The DeLeon."" To do that he has to travel from New York to San Francisco in 48 hours with an insanely hot British blond (Imogen Poots) riding shotgun. Thereas a bounty on him so all sorts of cars and trucks try to run him off the road. Then upon reaching his destination he must enter The DeLeon and go head-to-head against his rival. In choosing his first major post-Breaking Bad role Aaron Paul has remarked that he was attracted to the alightnessa of the script. Vapidity might be a better word choice. Paulas performance is robotic; the part doesnat demand much and he doesnat provide more than whatas needed. Imogen Poots is delightful but thatas about the only claim that can be made about her. She never evolves beyond the sidekick/love interest stereotype. Michael Keatonas wtf off-kilter portrayal injects some wacky energy into the proceedings but he never interacts with anyone else. Dominic Cooper tries his best to be a weasel but heas not quite despicable enough. Maybe someone in makeup should have given him a mustache to twirl. I will admit to a built-in bias against this movie. I have nothing against the game or racing movies in general but I find it distasteful to glamorize a asporta that results in countless injuries and deaths each year. Street racing isnat a form of youthful exuberance; itas dangerous both to participants and more importantly to innocent people who inadvertently end up in harms way. Need for Speed pays lip service to this with Peteas demise but itas clearly not invested in furthering the message. Thereas a lot of carnage late in the film that the movie justifies by blaming it all on the bad guy. The aconsequencesa are a joke. There are some things that canat be excused by saying aItas just a movie.a If thereas one thing to be claimed in favor of Need for Speed itas that the car stunts are done without the aid of CGI. The refreshingly retro look favored by stunt coordinator-turned-director Waugh gives weight to the chases races and crashes although the editing could have been better. However just as the underwritten and safe screenwriting fails to serve the actors so the generic choreography fails the cars. Need for Speed is the latest in a long line of game-turned-movies where the viewer would be better off staying at home turning on the console and playing with his joystick rather than making a trip to a theater.

"Badness Without Brakes << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Sportstorialist The Legacy of Marquettes Untucked Uniforms  Next Big Bets Facebook Twitter Print Movies Badness Without Brakes The bummer of Aaron Paul in Need for Speed by Alex Pappademas on March 14 2014 We can discuss how well Need for Speed works or doesnt as a car-chase flick a road movie a video-game adaptation and an action-franchise launch. But lets get right to the only question that matters namely ""Even knowing what we know about actors needing to work is it kind of a bummer to see Aaron Pauls considerable gifts put to the service of material like this?"" It brings me no pleasure to report that the answer is Yeah bitch. Paul imbued Breaking Bads Jesse Pinkman with a depth of feeling that surprised even Vince Gilligan whod planned to kill off the character after Season 1. Instead Jesse became the shows conscience and (arguably) the most tragic figure in its desert-bleak moral universe. But five seasons as the second lead on a basic-cable show doesnt exactly pay off like the blue-meth racket no matter how many Emmys you win (Paul has two). So here we are. In Need for Speed a movie based on a largely plotless console racing game whose various iterations have sold more than 140 million copies Paul does what he can with the factory-standard part of Tobey Marshall a mechanic and street racer from small-town Mount Kisco who puts the pedal to the metal for justice after being framed for vehicular manslaughter. But the grave affect and grumbly underacting that made him so moving on television seem a little silly in the context of this film a Hot Wheels track with too few twists. Given a vehicle ""worthy of his talents"" were told early on Tobey could do great things. I guess in that sense this is a personal film. Stuntman turned director Scott Waugh made his feature debut with 2012s Act of Valor a Navy SEAL movie starring a cast of actual Navy SEALs. The films action sequences had a gritty authenticity but as actors the SEALs served the story somewhat less heroically than theyd served our country. Need for Speed suffers from a similar credibility gap. Only the cars feel real. They have weight and presence and (mostly) obey the laws of physics. Theyre the most vivid thing about the movie and on some level the movie seems to know this. Every few minutes some flashy new turbocharged ride whips past us -- Ferraris vintage GTOs Maseratis Lamborghinis even an army of sinister SUVs all given a gel-manicured luster by Shane Hurlbuts hyper-crisp digital photography. Im not much of a car guy but at the screening I attended the young man sitting next to me clearly was. Every time somebody opened a garage door or a hood onscreen he let out a soft Keanu-ish Whoa. The most visually striking cars in the film are a trio of street-illegal Swedish-made Koenigsegg Ageras sculptural projectiles that look like what Luke Skywalker would have tooled around Tatooine in had he been a rich prick. Appropriately in Need for Speed they belong to wealthy creepy ex-NASCAR driver Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper an English actor with the eyebrows of a malevolent Tony Curtis). After Tobey gets the better of Dino in a business deal Dino challenges him to an impromptu race that ends with one of the Ageras in flames and Tobey on his way to jail for two years. By the time hes paroled hes already hatched a plan to take revenge on Dino by defeating him in the De Leon a secret invitation-only road race organized by a wealthy mysterious racing enthusiast known only as ""The Monarch."" The Monarch is played by Michael Keaton channeling both Wolfman Jack and Beetlejuice in scenes that probably took him a day to shoot. Its unclear how he manages to stay mysterious given that hes also the on-camera host of what seems to be a daily online racing chat show that anyone with a laptop seems able to access. Its one of many plot points the movie clearly hopes well be too adrenaline-drunk to rigorously analyze. Its equally unclear why wealthy car collector Bill Ingram (Stevie Ray Dallimore) is so willing to lend Tobey -- an ex-con he barely knows -- the 3 million Mustang that Tobey thinks he can win the Monarchs race with. But Ingram does lend it to him sending his assistant Julia (Imogen Poots) to keep an eye on the car while Toby lead-foots it from upstate New York to California for the race which starts in two days. In the script the Mustang is supposedly based on an unfinished car created for Ford by the late driver/designer Carroll Shelby. (Its actually a souped-up 2014 Stang built for the movie by the good people at Ford and the movie pays them back by including so many beauty shots of the ""hero car"" racing into the sunset that I half-expected to see a message about 0 percent financing flash onscreen.) I suppose just asking Ingram to air-freight the car directly to California would have taken too long; it would also have deprived the movie of its only genuine moments in which this preposterous Dirty Mary Crazy Larry situation brings Julia and Tobey together. The script gives Poots even less to work with than what Paul gets -- Julia morphs as needed from stereotypical one-of-the-boys car nut to stereotypical love-interest-in-jeopardy and back. But she and Paul display real chemistry on the parts of the journey when theyre not dodging state troopers. Theyre the only humans with any charisma on this ride. As Tobeys buddy and lookout pilot Scott ""Kid Cudi"" Mescudi is handed about 18 comic-relief moments too many; someone clearly thought they had a young Will Smith on their hands but this is a conclusion unsupported by the text. The rest of Tobeys Mount Kisco bros are about as dimensional as Manny Moe and Jack. I know I know -- its a car-chase movie so by talking about all these issues Im critiquing the sides instead of the steak. The steak is perfectly prepared. The cars go fast the cars go boom all without the aid of green-screen or other digital cheating. (The credits name more than 150 drivers and stunt people; they deserve higher billing as does hairstylist Frances Mathias because even at 130 mph Pootss hair looks amazing.) The film has one good newish idea about how to stage these sequences Sometimes when the cars flip flop and fly Waugh cuts away to an HD dashboard-POV camera so it feels like were rolling toward our own fiery doom on YouTube. And at least one of the big action set pieces -- an impromptu demolition derby involving light trucks a few cement mixers and eventually an Apache helicopter -- builds and builds in an impressively deranged way as if a 4-year-old in a sandbox has taken over as stunt coordinator. Theres nothing here you havent seen before. At one point Tobey even pulls the old chain-on-the-axle trick that got Richard Dreyfuss into the Pharaohs in American Graffiti. Waugh has dutifully cited the CGI-free chases in 60s and 70s films like The French Connection and Bullitt as key reference points; he even puts the Bullitt chase sequence up on a drive-in screen early in the film. But it wasnt the absence of digital trickery that made those chases so real. San Franciscans love to mock the liberties the Bullitt chase scene takes with geography but it took those liberties to make use of every native obstacle the Bay Area had to offer -- its steepest hills its sharpest curves. The French Connection did the same thing with the crowded streets under the elevated tracks that run through Brooklyn and Queens. These were movies with a sense of place and chases that couldnt have been staged anywhere else whereas in Need for Speed each new locale is just another level to be unlocked and conquered. The car movies that loom largest over this one of course are the six films of the billion-dollar Fast amp; Furious franchise which suddenly seem like a cycle of Ibsen plays compared with this movie. Say what you will about the Fast films philosophical boilerplate concerning the importance of surrogate families and living your life one mile at a time -- at least its an ethos. Theres something almost nihilistic about Need for Speeds tunnel-vision worldview. Its a movie about a guy who avenges a car crash by causing many many other car crashes whose life-and-limb toll were supposed to ignore. The big racing finale involves Tobey Dino and a bunch of other non-factorish drivers with Morning Zoo Crew names like ""Johnny V"" and ""English Paul"" and ""Texas Mike"" and ""The Gooch"" as well as a number of police vehicles and at one point a big yellow school bus full of young children. I wont spoil whether or not this movie pays its debt to the fatalistic car-action films of the 70s by ending with Aaron Paul wasting a bunch of kids while a Leonard Cohen song plays. Suffice it to say that the race eventually presents Tobey with an opportunity to prove himself to be not only the better driver but also the better man. The movies message apart from ""Do not attempt to re-create these maneuvers"" is that Goofus leaves people to die when he runs them off the road during an illegal street race and Gallant does not. But by that point in the scene weve already watched countless other cars turned into John Chamberlain sculptures so that Tobey can have his redemption. Arent there people in those cars too? Who mourns for the Gooch? If Texas Mike rolls his McLaren does he not bleed? Facebook Twitter Print Share Filed Under Movies Aaron Paul Need for Speed Alex Pappademas is a staff writer for Grantland.

TWITTER ""Breaking Bads"" Aaron Paul heads to the big screen as star of Disney/Dreamworks action movie from director Scott Waugh. What you want from a movie called Need for Speed is right there in the title. You want a flick that swiftly moves you from car chase to car chase -- each more impressive in its accelerated virtuosity than the last. You want a simple story upon which you can hang a bit of character development. You want a hero who can gamely stare death in the eye as he pilots 3000 pounds of screaming metal faster than anyone else. You want to feel the wind in your hair and leave the theater with your ears ringing from the deafening roar of Detroit muscle. You will get some of that in Need for Speed DreamWorks and Disneys adaptation of the Electronics Arts series of games. When Aaron Pauls Tobey Marshall is behind the wheel -- and a crew of stuntmen are wreaking some refreshingly non-CG automotive havoc -- director Scott Waughs movie is a blast. Some interest in what Breaking Bads Jesse Pinkman does next along with young men drawn to horsepower could give this a decent enough opening weekend but its not the franchise starter Im sure everyone involved hoped it would be. STORY Aloe Blacc Kid Cudi Skylar Grey Featured on Need for Speed Soundtrack That story such as it is follows Marshall mechanic-savant by day underground racer-savant by night. He runs the top-flight Marshall Motors garage which specializes in squeezing every last ounce of speed from the hot rods that apparently litter the sleepy upstate town of Mt. Kisco NY. He inherited it from his dear old dad who was apparently not fond of paying bills -- and Tobey finds himself deep in debt. Luckily a fella named Dino (Dominic Cooper) -- a local kid who left town to become a professional race car driver and entrepreneur (and stole Tobeys girl on the way out) -- shows up with an offer. Dino is in the possession of an unfinished Ford Mustang that was being designed by legendary car customizer Carroll Shelby. Dino wants Tobey and his crew of grease monkeys to finish the car -- worth at least a cool million at auction -- and will cut the Marshall Motors crew in for a quarter of the sale price. Of course because Dino spends the movie twirling his imaginary mustache you know hes going to screw Tobey over. Said screwing comes during a post-sale race during which Dino runs Tobeys best friend Little Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) off the road to his death -- and Dino frames Tobey for the crime. Two years of prison later Tobey is back and thirsty for revenge. Good thing the plot comes to his rescue There is an underground race called the DeLeon organized by a mysterious internet racing evangelist called Monarch (Michael Keaton). Only a select few drivers are invited to race their million-dollar sports cars and the winner gets the pink slips to the losers rides. Dinos business is failing so hes entering to keep the ship afloat. Tobey wants to watch Dino explode in an expensive ball of fire. All Tobey needs to do is get from New York to the starting line in San Francisco in a little over a day. For that he needs his old Marshall Motors crew Finn (Rami Malek) the expert tuner; Joe (Ramon Rodriguez) who drives the support truck; and Benny (Scott Mescudi better known as hip hop artist Kid Cudi) who flies a Cessna that never runs out of gas and can spot the police from the sky. Together -- along with the firecracker of a British woman Julia (Imogen Poots) who secures for Tobey that same Mustang dream machine he restored -- they Cannonball Run it across the country dodging the occasional cop and street punk after the bounty Dino put on Tobeys head. (Why there was more than one attack on the Mustang in 3000 miles is something else entirely.) VIDEO New Need for Speed Trailer Aaron Paul Hatches a Plan for Payback When the opportunity arises for vehicular mayhem the Need For Speed production delivers it. Cinematographer Shane Hurlbuts camera is always in the perfect place for maximum impact and the cadre of stunt drivers assembled by Waugh whip the assorted sports cars around with expertly choreographed abandon. But you realize about halfway through the story concocted by George amp; John Gatins that theres not a lot under the hood. Paul and Poots dont have the same easy trapped-in-a-car chemistry as Burt Reynolds and Sally Field did in Smokey and the Bandit. The film doesnt have the same mythic heft as The Road Warrior no matter how often Keatons Monarch barks from behind his podcast mic that ""racing is an art...but racing with passion is high art and I think thats Tobey Marshall driving the chariot of the gods."" It doesnt sell Tobey as a preternaturally gifted driver nearly as well as Speed Racer conveyed the brilliance of its titular throttle jockey. And ultimately its not as much sexy-pulpy fun as the Fast and the Furious franchise which leaves Need For Speed in the neon-bikini dust. Aaron Paul is a truly fine actor who is given neither much to do here or any guidance on how to do it. Consequently he spends the entire movie glowering summoning his best Charles Bronson hero voice. (Too bad Will Arnetts Lego-Batman beat him to it.) And Keaton is off in his own movie Hes never on screen with anyone; its just him a bank of monitors a mic and an apparently ravenous hunger for all of the scenery in sight. Every now and again you get a glimpse of the live wire that lit up the 80s but more often you just wonder who thought that much rambling was a good idea. Car movies are always about adolescent indulgence existing in a world without rules where the hero - and the film around him -- can do anything and everything he wants to because he is just that good. He wants the girl? He gets the girl? He wants to ignore every speed limit? Done no matter how much consequence-free destruction is left in his wake. But Need For Speed is a flat sexless movie that seems not to understand why people like to sit in the drivers seat and rev that big engine Because of the transgressive rumble in your nethers.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Broad opaque cornball poetry comes naturally to car movies. The subject matter is pre-packaged with images of escape endurance and death fiery wreckage the end of the road a tachometer arrow inching into the red. Never mind whether lines like ""He loved the impossible""--spoken by one of Need For Speeds gearheads in memory of a dead friend--make any sense. A fast car roaring down the road its driver gritting his teeth at each bend makes for one hell of an image.Theres no shortage of squealing tires and straining engines in Need For Speed. Unlike the later Fast amp; Furious movies which exist in a Road Runner universe where the laws of physics exist only to be broken the movie emphasizes practical stuntwork. Its first and best racing sequence--set at night on the twisty streets of a small town--is a minor triumph of old-school craft constructed without the use of music or the now-standard GoPro crash cams. 1970s camera moves meet new-fangled technology (namely the Canon C500 camera; at times the movie feels like a show reel for its low-light capabilities) resulting in a thrilling sense of movement and space cars hurtling recklessly past oncoming trains and down alleyways in near darkness. With all this the post-conversion to 3-D feels like an unnecessary afterthought.Its no surprise then that director and co-editor Scott Waugh (Act Of Valor) happens to be a veteran stuntman. Need For Speeds dialogue-centric scenes are often clunky and its comic relief is at times embarrassingly unfunny but whenever Waugh shifts his focus to figuring out how to best convey an ingenious practical stunt with the camera the movie comes alive. One single take finds lead Aaron Paul four-wheel drifting a 1.6 million sports car bringing it to a stop within inches of the camera and springing out from the drivers seat before the doors have finished swinging open. Its electrifying to watch especially since the framing and duration of the shot establish that Paul is doing the stunt himself.Need For Speeds drama lies in its stunts not in dialogue. The thin and often ludicrous plot--which involves freshly paroled street racer Tobey (Paul) driving across the country to compete in a secretive high-stakes race and clear his name--hits on every iconic location in American car culture a desert highway the streets of Detroit the Bonneville Salt Flats the up-down hills of San Francisco the California coastline. Though nominally an adaptation of EAs long-running game franchise the movie mostly feels like an excuse to catalogue car-related pop culture. There are scenes in trucker stops clubhouse-like body shops middle-of-nowhere gas stations a drive-in movie theater (showing Bullitt no less) and gleaming luxury showrooms. The late car designer Carroll Shelby plays a role in the plot and Speed--on which Waugh worked--gets referenced in the dialogue. The only things missing are a demolition derby and a scene set in L.A. traffic.At 130 minutes Need For Speed is probably too long for its own good. Despite the simplistic set-up complete with a villain (Dominic Cooper) so evil hes introduced wearing a black turtleneck in warm weather the movie is so crammed with automotive iconography that it requires a Greek chorus-like narrator (Michael Keaton who spends the entire movie spinning around in a swivel chair) to periodically remind the viewer that theres a plot. Two things sustain the movie across its lengthy running time Pauls fine performance--which is a good deal more believable and naturalistic than the material probably deserves--and Waughs direction of its many car chase scenes. Though later sequences lean a little too heavily on contemporary car flick cliches (like the aforementioned GoPros) they are all nonetheless informed by a gee-whiz appreciation for gleaming cars and stunt driving ingenuity. Sometimes--as in the sequence where a fiery sports car tumbles off a bridge in slow motion--Need For Speed manages to capture that ineffable car movie poetry freedom and death commingling in the image of a single airborne wreck.

Need For Speed stalls from the outset Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNeed For Speed stalls from the outset Review Breaking Bads Aaron Paul stars in Need For Speed based on the Electronic Arts video gameBy Tony WongTelevisionFri. March 14 2014Need for SpeedStarring Aaron Paul Dominic Cooper Imogen Poots and Michael Keaton. Directed by Scott Waugh. Opens March 14 at major theatres. 130 mins. PGFor Breaking Bad fans wondering where Aaron Paul would end up after the critically acclaimed television series wrapped -- dont worry. Hes not stretching his thespian talents too far.In Need For Speed Paul is Tobey Marshall a mechanic who races muscle cars. Except he looks like he just walked off the set of Breaking Bad wearing a Jesse Pinkman Fruit of the Loom T-shirt jeans and stubble.Article Continued BelowHe shuffles around stares at the ground and mumbles like Pinkman. And instead of crystal methamphetamine hes cooking up hot laps. But then like much of Pauls career trajectory this is all about speed as the drug of choice. Or the need for it.Aaron Paul stars as Tobey Marshall in Need for Speed.  (Melinda Sue Gordon)  The movie opens promisingly enough with a drive-in scene where Steve McQueens Bullitt is playing.Director and former stuntman Scott Waugh seems to be laying down the law This is a car movie with integrity. It isnt about hopped-up racers as in the gimmicky Fast amp; Furious franchise or cars that suddenly and disconcertingly climb walls like The Transporter. This is a serious show for gear heads. And to top it off hes banned the use of computer graphics -- high irony for a show based on a video game.But seeing Bullitt on the screen is the high point. Expectations taper off swiftly as Need For Speed will undoubtedly crash the hopes of die hard fans of the popular Electronic Arts game.Fans tired of over-digitized Speed Racer car chases were likely hoping that Need For Speed would stay true to its roots. The game was groundbreaking because it was the closest players could get to a real life simulator driving exotic cars on real life tracks such as the Nurburgring or Laguna Seca.But Need For Speed fails spectacularly on so many levels it almost begs you to bring back the hyperactive overacting Nicolas Cage for Drive Angry 2. Almost.Car movies are typically the first reel at the grindhouse multiplex the long washroom break before the zombie apocalypse movie comes on. Everyone understands the plot will be a painfully thin conceit in between the car crashes. Hell we dont expect a plot.The comparisons wouldnt normally be so painful but Ron Howards recently released Rush is already so visceral with characters in the hands of a capable director so much more finely tuned it allows you to dream that car movies can be good. Maybe even great.In this semblance of plot Marshall tangles with an ex-NASCAR driver named Dino Brewster played by Dominic Cooper. A race with Brewster turns disastrous ending up in jail time for Marshall.The story takes up two years later with Marshall bound for revenge and another high stakes underground race using a bevy of exotic super cars.The given of course is that there is plenty of eye candy A Bugatti Veyron a Lamborghini Elemento and various Paganis are used throughout the show. The movie has been reformulated for 3D so the cockpit view can be spectacular at times. And the laudable CGI ban means the thrills are much more authentic. But as any fan of BBCs Top Gear will tell you this kind of machinery can be seen on TV any day of the week. And it can only help when you actually care about the characters.If the people at Disney were hoping for a competitor to the Fast amp; Furious franchise -- and undoubtedly they were -- they have set the bar so low that it has sped well past the point of no return.

"Review Next to Fast amp; Furious Need for Speed stalls out - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Next to Fast amp; Furious Need for Speed stalls out ""Need for Speed"" Melinda Sue Gordon / DreamWorks II Aaron Paul stars in ""Need for Speed."" Aaron Paul stars in ""Need for Speed."" (Melinda Sue Gordon / DreamWorks II) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic The first thing to know about ""Need for Speed"" is this Its no ""Fast amp; Furious.""In trying for the vicarious varoom of the street-racing video game that inspired it and no doubt dreaming of ""Fast"" success ""Speed"" clocks in at a long two-plus hours and falls painfully short. ""Breaking Bads"" excellent thrill-seeker Aaron Paul is put in so many ludicrous situations -- the worst being the googly eyes he has to make behind the wheel every time the engine revs -- most will quickly write off the movie. Though Im betting ""Speed"" gamers are the forgiving sort.Paul Dominic Cooper Imogen Poots and Dakota Johnson star in the film alongside a souped-up 70s Ford Mustang that steals all the beauty shots. Though the Lamborghini Bugatti Koenigsegg McLaren and Saleen fight for their star turns their only real competition is that Ford supposedly a legendary one modified by car racing royalty Carroll Shelby. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | Olsen ""Act of Valor"" director Scott Waugh is the guy in charge of gunning the engines and making sure every possible street-racing scenario is tried. Waugh has a good feel for the cars and action extremes while director of photography Shane Hurlbut acquits himself nicely. But the screenplay written by George Gatins is full of potholes. The bond between gearheads as fundamental to ""Fasts"" appeal as a nitro-injected engine is nonexistent.No one is asking for actual logic in these films. Part of the fun is seeing how far from reality the freewheeling stunts can take it. But a sense of the absurdity of the absurd is most definitely required too.A glimmer of that exists in the half-mad eyes of the Monarch a mysterious street-racing titan played with a growling sarcasm by Michael Keaton. The Monarch seems to have a radio show -- whatever. The onetime driver now spends his days behind a console watching live video of illegal street races giving the play by play to his followers assessing the odds guessing at motivations. He also controls the most coveted underground street racing invite around -- the De Leon. Its unsanctioned dangerous with a big jackpot and only a handful of the best from around the world get a ticket to ride.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013But first there is a deadly street-racing accident that puts Tobey Marshall (Paul) behind bars for a crime he didnt commit. Two years later the muscle car mechanic comes out with the grudge necessary to drive the action that follows. That involves settling old scores restoring his reputation getting a car getting across country getting another car maybe getting the girl. But most of all he must drive baby drive.An issue of class is seeded in the long road divided between the haves and the have-nots which is where you will find the street racing crowd. Tobeys the talented blue-collar driver who stayed in the small town running the family garage with a bunch of his buddies. The best is Benny (Scott Mescudi). A master detailer with a penchant for flying ""borrowed"" aircraft he is responsible for most of the movies comic relief. Orchestrating increasingly incredulous fly-overs as he scouts routes for Tobey Benny provides some of the most exciting action as well.The haughty hated Dino Brewster (Cooper) is the guy who shed the small-town life making a name and big money on the NASCAR circuit. He also got the girl or one of them. Anita (Johnson) used to be sweet on Tobey now shes hanging on Dinos arm. Cooper who generally makes an excellent villain -- see ""Captain America The First Avenger"" and probably the coming ""Captain America Winter Soldier"" as well -- is sorely misused. In ""Speed"" his character is allowed to get away with many bad deeds -- by the authorities and the script -- but theres nary a clue as to the demons driving his dastardly doings.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVA little redemption is brought by Poots. In whatever role she is given the British actress ups the quality level any time shes on screen most recently making Zac Efron and ""That Awkward Moment"" less awkward. In ""Speed"" she plays feisty Julia Maddon who locates and buys very fast cars for her high-end car-broker boss.Shes quickly on Tobeys side even when it seems as if he doesnt want her there. Sparks fly sort of. Their cross-country race to get Tobey and the Mustang into the De Leon is among the movies best moments.The rest of the best is thanks to the daredevil stunts and the drivers who execute them. But ""Need for Speed"" needs a lot more than fast cars and cool crashes to make it a winner.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com-------------------Need for Speed MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of reckless street racing disturbing crash scenes nudity and crude languageRunning time 2 hours 10 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Ridley Scott Gaming Dakota Johnson Dominic Cooper On the Set Movies and TV Dark humor sarcasm and biting comedy punctuate Bad Words Rooney Mara in talks to play Tiger Lily in Peter Pan origin story Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-need-for-speed-review-20140314,0,4641272.story#axzz2vt42Kmh0",200,needforspeed11,needforspeed,latimes

AP AP AP AP AP AP AP AP Need for Speed   Director Scott Waugh Cast Aaron Paul Dominic Cooper Scott Mescudi Rated PG-13 (sequences of reckless street racing disturbing crash scenes nudity and crude language) Running time 130 min. By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 458pm on Thursday Mar. 13 2014 Thursday Mar. 13 2014 Thursday Mar. 13 2014 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram With the soul of a Maserati trapped in the body of a Ford Pinto Need for Speed grinds its gears when it should be roaring down the road.Adapted from the 20-year-old Electronic Arts video game franchise of the same name (where players race all manner of exotic vehicles in fairly realistic fashion) the high-octane film cribs liberally from its cinematic predecessors -- the seminal car chase thriller Bullitt is cited explicitly early and often -- but in failing to beef up its digital origins adds up to little more than exhaust fumes. Aaron Paul stars as mechanic and racing whiz Tobey Marshall in Pauls first major post- Breaking Bad role. Tobey has a knack for milking the most out of cars and racer Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) wants him to help restore a mythical Shelby Mustang. Aided by his rag-tag team including Benny (Scott Mescudi) Finn (Rami Malek) and Joe (Ramon Rodriguez) Tobey and Dino strike a deal with a wealthy buyer to sell the car which leads to a fateful afternoon spent racing high-end automobiles. The ensuing tragedy lands Tobey in prison for two years framed for a crime he didnt commit. Once freed Tobey immediately sets his sights on revenge and speeds cross-country with a sexy blonde in tow (Imogen Poots) to tangle with Dino who wastes little time putting a bounty on his former partners head.Watching over all of this is the Monarch (Michael Keaton) -- a talk radio host of sorts offering commentary on the drivers skills and the rich benefactor of a legendary race known as the DeLeon which Tobey is desperate to enter and win claiming a prize cache of top-of-the-line cars.If it all sounds like chaos thats effectively how Need for Speed unfolds. Director Scott Waugh working from a screenplay by George Gatins makes the odd choice to fuse elements from the games (the first-person point of view while racing; Monarchs absurdly omniscient broadcast capabilities) with a conventional narrative and the end result is disjointed. Its like trying to watch a movie and play a video game at the same time while being satisfied by neither.Whatever pathos the filmmakers hoped Tobeys story of betrayal and revenge would contain is wasted by a series of gorgeously filmed but totally empty set pieces focused more on the gleaming growling cars than those inside them. That said Waugh embraced an analog aesthetic and the film is blessedly free of CGI-enhanced sequences grounding Need for Speed in a world where metal shreds tires go flying and explosions seem genuine rather than painted in.As in other films of this ""stripe (""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise) the humans are secondary to the machines although none of the roles is written with any particular nuance. Aaron Paul does here what he did for seven seasons on Breaking Bad -- toggle between seething and sobbing while throwing in some murderous stares for good measure -- making him seem very one-note. The rest of the cast -- Cooper Poots Mescudi and Malek -- hardly registers although Poots gamely tries to inject some life into her thankless role as co-pilot and love interest. Cooper in particular seems embarrassed by whats coming out of his mouth and hardly seems interested by the time the climax rolls around. Keaton however has a ball as Monarch riffing on the cars and their drivers and generally embracing the role of weirdo billionaire.If anyone on Need for Speed had looked under the hood the under-powered screenplay wouldve been evident. But rather than fine-tune the narrative engine the filmmakers hit the gas with not much more in the tank than sumptuously photographed car porn robbing what could have been a high-toned B-movie of any punch. Put it this way Moviegoers could have been enjoyed a thrilling emotionally charged ride but instead they were sold a lifeless lemon.)

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 904 a.m. EDT March 14 2014Aaron Paul stars as the pedal-friendly protagonist of ""Need for Speed.""(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon DreamWorks II)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 our of fourStars Aaron Paul Dominic Cooper Harrison Gilbertson Imogen Poots Michael KeatonRated PG-13; 2 hours 10 minutes; opens Friday nationwideWith dozens of crashes injuries and possible deaths caused by the street racers in Need for Speed what stands out most is the storys callous disregard for human life.The film version of a hugely successful video game Need for Speed (1/2 our of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) is ostensibly meant to be light entertainment. If light is synonymous with preposterous frenetic and noisy it qualifies.Mindless fare however is one thing and irresponsibility is quite another. Most troubling is the films glorification of street racing and its failure to address the collateral damage that comes in the wake of these high-octane contests.Legions of innocent drivers are plowed into and forced off the road as the characters zoom around barreling against traffic on suburban highways. When viewers find themselves musing about the fate of faceless drivers its proof positive that the main characters are hardly worthy of interest.STORY Aaron Paul loves Speed but remains fond of methMORE Paul picks Speed for his first big filmREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersTaken purely as an action movie the racing is a drag. The story is particularly stuck in idle during a cross-country trek.Tobey (Aaron Paul) is a mechanic who builds muscle cars and sometimes races them. His best buddy Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) dies in a fiery crash while they are testing the mettle of sleek European sports cars racing against arrogant former NASCAR driver Dino (Dominic Cooper). Dino hightails it from the scene and frames Tobey who is convicted of manslaughter.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Need for Speed Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad plays a street car racer out for revenge. VPCThe first thing Tobey does when he comes out of the slammer is jump behind the wheel of another souped-up car courtesy of British car broker Julia (Imogen Poots.) Hes not the brightest tool in the shed but Tobeys determined to race against Dino and expose him for his part in Petes death. Julia joins Tobey for a harrowing two-day ride across America en route to a secret street race.An internet racing aficionado known as Monarch (Michael Keaton) organizes the race and provides rambling play-by-play patter. Mostly however his dialogue is as laughable as the inane plot.While the racers are chased by police Monarch spouts commentary such as ""Racers should race. Cops should eat doughnuts.""The doughnut-devouring cop stereotype is as stale as it gets but more disturbing is how many patrol cars crash and burn in pursuit of the dangerous street racers.Tobey is a one-track-minded devotee hell-bent on avenging his friends death and ensuring that justice prevails. But racing illegally seems a strange way to enforce truth justice and the American way.Need for Speed seeks to start its own series a la The Fast and the Furious. Even the style of the title in the opening credits resembles that of Fast amp; Furious.But Need for Speed sputters as a franchise-starter. Judged simply as an action movie it fails to rise above the pack. The plot feels endlessly forced and even the brightest stars cant rescue it.Aaron Paul was brilliant in the TV series Breaking Bad but why he chose to star in this misguided vehicle is baffling. Not the right choice for the smoldering silent Tobey Paul alternates between puppy-dog eagerness and growling his lines. Glowering is the go-to expression on most of the racers faces. Scenes of guys staring intently at the road dont exactly make for riveting viewing.Video games rarely translate into good movies and this film is no exception. Sound and fury are in abundance in Need for Speed but substance lags. 45 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1iGzsf2",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/13/need-for-speed-review/5808233/,200,needforspeed13,needforspeed,usatoday

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Slender Man Trial Why Trying These Girls as Adults Is... Need for Speed By Peter Travers March 13 2014 More News 61 Reasons to Love 2014 All Stories >> What to say about a racing movie thats stuck in idle as drama? For starters dont race to see it. Need for Speed is based on a racing video-game franchise that has sold 150 million copies. It stars Aaron Paul (Jesse on the immortal Breaking Bad). Paul is a good actor with two Emmys to prove it but hes not a screen-filling star presence in the muscle-bound mold of Vin Diesel (The Fast and the Furious). This stings because theres nothing to distract you from a plot so tired there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it. More News 61 Reasons to Love 2014 All Stories >> To illustrate Paul plays Tobey Marshall a street racer just out of prison for a crime - all together now - he did not commit. He blames his rival Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper doing slime personified) for leaving the scene of a racing accident and making Tobey take the rap. Now Tobey wants to beat Dino at his own game by winning the De Leon the Oscar of street-racing contests. With the help of Brew sters pert Brit partner Julia (a slumming Imogen Poots) Tobey breaks parole to race from New York to San Francisco in just two days. At that point director Scott Waugh finally starts the movies engines. Too bad the impressive muscle cars and stunt drivers cant move as fast as the tongue of Michael Keaton who does Beetlejuice on speed as a racing DJ. Keaton is entertaining. The movie itself is not.

Try adapting the race-car video game Need for Speed. Tolstoys 1225-page behemoth has nothing on the Electronic Arts franchises irreconcilably complicated 20-year 20-installment history Sometimes cars are subject to physics; sometimes they arent. Sometimes theyre invulnerable; sometimes they break. Maybe youre in London; maybe the fictional Olympic City. You could have free will to roam; you could be stuck on a track. You could be a car or a human an outlaw or a cop. With so many alternate realities to please its no wonder Scott Waughs moronic flick has multiple personalities -- its the Sybil of street racing with a script that doesnt feel so much typed as button-mashed. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Inspired by the first The Fast and the Furious film itself half video game 2003s Need for Speed Underground introduced the concept of plot to the series. (Sort of. Wikipedia sums it up as ""Time passes races are won."") Now as though modern culture is just an ouroboros made by a Gran Torino doing wheelies the 4 billion-selling video game wants to become its own movie a cash-bleeding act of hubris akin to a rock star launching his own restaurant chain.Like porn another art form where characters are blank audience surrogates the video game version of Need for Speed emphasized action over individuality. The hero was called simply the Player. Now Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) steps into the void. Hes at least given a name Tobey Marshall but not much else.Film Details Need for Speed RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time130 min. More Info Trailer Tobey is silent stoic and boring as hell. Id rather watch Matthew McConaughey steer an Austin pedicab than grok Tobey careening around a mountain bend.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Tobey hails from Mount Kisco N.Y. a motor-mad hamlet where he and his broke buddies (Kid Cudi Rami Malek Ramon Rodriguez) rebuild cars at a struggling garage so decked out in Americana that you expect a waitress to roller-skate out with milkshakes.At night the entire town heads to the drive-in to watch Steve McQueens Bullitt before powering up some CIA-level spy gear for dangerous drag races through the apocalypse-empty streets.During race one they almost kill a homeless man. Whatevs bro.During race two a daytime dare against black leather-clad baddie Dino (Dominic Cooper) Tobey drives the wrong way on a highway causes several bystander wrecks and watches his friends car flip 12 times tumble over a bridge and burst into flames.Dino denies he was there. (None of the 70 drivers they almost ran off the road can remember a red sports car?) Tobey is imprisoned for manslaughter. Good.Not to be a killjoy but if filmmakers are going to embed pixel mayhem in the photo-real world then theyre inviting us to ask if this shit is sociopathic. Especially when you use real cars real wrecks and layer this nonsense with a dramatic weepy score that sounds like a drama about a dog with cancer.Regardless were meant to root for Tobey to avenge his sidekicks death by doing even more of what got him killed. Everyone acts as though theyve been huffing diesel fumes. Tobeys friends wear red to the kids funeral get engaged to his killer wander naked though office buildings and steal Apache helicopters.And dont get me started on Tobey fleeing parole for a cross-country drive where he recklessly picks fights with the police or on the fact that none of the cops has heard of road spikes or that at Tobeys finish-line destination -- a big race in California -- the grand prize is the other contestants cars which all get destroyed on the track.Two Emmys aside its tough to be Aaron Paul. So far hes proven himself talented at playing one specific character an antic man-child who bleeds his soul on the screen. Hes trying to prove his range which in the Era of Gosling means frowning crinkling his eyebrows and glaring over his shoulder. Occasionally he pants. For bonus points hes the only guy in the movie who doesnt punctuate a sentence with his signature line ""bitch."" But hes so action hero-blank that its like Paul is smudging an eraser over Jesse Pinkman when he should write something new over him in bold Sharpie.The bigger waste is ingenue Imogen Poots as the Babe Who Likes Cars. Shes daffy and charming in a part thats further beneath her than skid marks on pavement. In her first scene she schools Tobey on the horsepower of a rebuilt 2.7 million Mustang then buys it yet still spends the rest of the film being treated like a useless bimbo. When she insists on joining Tobey on his adventure because hes borrowing her bosss car he tries to scare her off by nearly getting into a dozen accidents before she even clicks her seat belt. I guess girls have cooties.At least Need for Speed is the rare case where the press notes tell the truth. Allow me to quote ""When EA first began thinking about the possibility of bringing their iconic video game to the big screen they decided to take a proactive approach and not wait for the right script.""Perhaps Tolstoy could have helped. Surveying the wreckage of Tobey and Dinos drag-race feud hed already have a title War in Pieces.NEED FOR SPEED | Directed by Scott Waugh | Written by George Gatins and John Gatins | Walt Disney Studios | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Grade C- Can Aaron Paul be as dynamic a big-screen star as he was a cult figure on AMCs ""Breaking Bad?"" Not if he acts the way he does as an underground street-racing champ named Tobey Marshall in ""Need for Speed."" He glares at the bad guy Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) and lowers and roughens his voice to gravel - maybe even to the dirt bed under the gravel. He slowly deliberately says things like ""You ... never ... went ... back."" When stage stars jump to the screen they scale down their performances. TV stars need to amp them up - but not as much as Paul does here. He does create the broad outline of an old-time action hero but he fails to fill it in. Not that you should pin ""Need for Speeds"" failure on Paul. George Gatins who co-wrote the story with his brother John spun his script off a video game constructing a mythology in which renegade car crews share the ethos of the U.S. military - leave no man behind. Dino became a NASCAR star while Tobey stayed home in Mt. Kisco N.Y. to run his dads financially shaky auto shop. But Dino is a creep - a brutal greedy egomaniac who flaunts his attachment to Tobeys ex-girlfriend (Dakota Johnson soon to be seen in ""50 Shades of Grey""). Dinos cardinal sin comes when he hits the bumper of Tobeys protege in an impromptu race setting off a blazing death spiral - and he doesnt go back. He high-tails it from the crash scene hides his car and denies he was there. His vices and Tobeys virtues would carry more weight were it not for the films moral vacuity. Tobey and his friends callously endanger citizens who get in their way or law enforcers who do their best to stop them. In a Mt. Kisco street race Tobey nearly kills a homeless man and upsets the poor guys shopping cart. To Tobey and company its a joke. Three bigger jokes the movies atmosphere story and direction. Mt. Kisco a Westchester bedroom community becomes as filmed in Macon Ga. a bastion of blue-collar values. The filmmakers must know this is ridiculous ""The Monarch"" (Michael Keaton) a mysterious billionaire ex-driver and racecar freak repeatedly proclaims Tobey a working-class hero as if saying it enough will make us believe it. The Monarch beats that message into the ground on the webcast he uses to promote his prestigious illegal annual race ""the De Leon."" After doing hard time for the automotive sprint that resulted in his proteges death Tobey is determined to break parole and win the De Leon. He wants to drive the legendary unfinished Shelby Mustang he and his crew completed on assignment right before the fatal disaster. In exchange for his dream car Tobey is forced to take a comely British car consultant (Imogen Poots) along for the ride. Shes sassy but shes also sensitive and sweet; she realizes the race is part of Tobeys plan to exact justice from Dino for his dead friend. Dino gets the message - and puts up a bounty for anyone who can prevent Tobey from reaching California or making it to the starting line. You can see why the film stretches out to 130 minutes. It contains 45 minutes of setup then a cross-country race before the climactic - make that anticlimactic - race. Director Scott Waugh never fills us in on Tobeys tactics so wed know what to root for each step of the way. Waugh does have skill at staging isolated stunts. He keeps his actors in the drivers and pilots seats (one of Tobeys men tracks him from the air) which puts us behind the car wheels and airplane yokes and tillers too. The films best moment comes from a maniac move called ""a two-lane grasshopper."" ""Kangaroo"" might better suggest the way Tobeys Mustang leaps over a busy Detroit highway. Cars like that vivacious Mustang or the sleek scary Swedish Koenigsegg boast more personality than most of the actors. The crews camaraderie feels forced despite fresh vital performers like Rami Malek (""Short Term 12""). Poots steals the screen from all these guys with her eccentric spunk even in a throwaway female sidekick role. And then theres Keaton who appears to be in the middle of a mini-renaissance. With a manic zest undiminished from his ""Beetlejuice"" days Keaton creates the one human character who really does exude an innate ""need for speed.""

"Need for Speed movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Need for Speed  1/2 Video Aaron Paul plays cool more like serial killer"" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Need for Speed."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Need for Speed."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In the race between interesting long-ish screen noses belonging to good young actors its simply too close to call between Dominic Cooper and Imogen Poots.Both English performers and their noses appear in the exuberantly stupid time-killer (and if logic were applied pedestrian-killer) ""Need for Speed."" It is based on the Electronic Arts gaming franchise begun in 1994 back when dinosaurs ruled the Earth and gas was quite a bit cheaper. This was when video games banking on vehicular homicide werent yet realistic enough to erase the experiential boundary between animation and live-action escapism. The point of the movie of course is to make the mayhem as fakey-realistic as possible and that paradox guides a fairly entertaining series of stunts from East Coast to West. When the actors are in cars the movies fun. When they get out to argue or seethe its uh-oh time. Happily director Scott Waugh comes out of the stunt world himself and theres a refreshing emphasis on actual theoretically dangerous stunt driving over digital absurdities.Tobeys our hero the brooding garage mechanic and street racer played by Aaron Paul of ""Breaking Bad."" Framed for manslaughter he broods his way out of prison a couple of years later hellbent on revenge on the smooth-talking antagonist played by Cooper. Their score must be settled by way of an illegal road race sponsored by the mysterioso exposition-shoveler played by Michael Keaton. To participate Pauls character tears across the country on a tight deadline accompanied by Poots high-end car dealer while avoiding the bounty hunters out to prevent his safe arrival. Paul has talent though the actors idea of simmering intensity in the context of ""Need for Speed"" comes off more like ""serial killer in the making."" Cooper by contrast seems to be having some fun playing a dashing dastardly sexy beast. At its occasional best the thrills in the film recall the delirious fun of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise. Hanging out at his small-town drive-in early in the picture Tobey and the gang enact their little drama of romantic jealousy and street rivalry while on the screen behind them Steve McQueen hits the gas in the chase scene from ""Bullitt.""

A street racer (Aaron Paul) who was framed by a business associate joins a cross-country race with revenge in mind while his ex-partner places a massive bounty on his head. (Photo/Video DreamWorks) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com March 13 2014 140 p.m. ET ""Need For Speed"" is nothing if not racy. During the whole middle section of this goony vroomfest the hero accompanied by a mostly appalled heroine races coast-to-coast in 45 hours to qualify for an outlaw street race through Big Sur and northward into the redwood forest. The movies first race street-illegal in the dead of night sends muscle cars through the streets of Mount Kisco N.Y. in what looks like a failed attempt at mass suicide. In a subsequent race gleeful drivers thread supercars against traffic at superspeed in broad daylight on the wrong side of Westchester Countys heavily traveled I-684. The action sequences are spectacular and staged with a minimum of digital fakery. But do not attempt to see this film derived loosely from the videogame of the same name unless youre prepared for wobbly writing lead-footed direction and acting that must have been boosted by nitrous-oxide injectors plus a starring performance that could have used a boost and didnt get one. The dull psyche at the center of the frenzy is provided by Aaron Paul. Hes the same Aaron Paul who performed brilliantly as Jesse Pinkman in ""Breaking Bad"" but here as the blue-collar racing prodigy Tobey Marshall he has been left to his own devices by the director Scott Waugh a former stuntman with a demonstrably stunted gift for directing actors. The closest Tobey comes to revealing deep feeling is a lower lip that quivers at high frequency. Similarly youd never know that Dominic Cooper who plays the rich and villainous Dino with lurid malice is an actor of uncommon skill. Michael Keaton opts for shrieking insanity as Monarch the organizer of the climactic race in California. Yet Rami Malek and Scott Mescudi manage to distinguish themselves as members of Tobeys support team--the latter as a pilot with a penchant for purloining helicopters. And Imogen Poots seems to have brought her own delightful beautifully polished portrayal to the role of Julia Maddon a spirited young Brit who knows more about driving fast cars than she lets on. ENLARGE An action sequence in Need for Speed DreamWorks II Tobey for his part knows less about virtue than he lets on. In the muddled morality of George Gatinss script hes supposed to be an innocent who does a two-year prison term for the fiery death of a young driver Little Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) when the guilty party was Dino. Yet it was Tobey who set the poor kid up for disaster. After promising Little Petes sister that hed protect him Tobey allowed Pete idiotically to race a supercar that was more car than he could possibly handle. ""Need For Speed"" rides roughshod over morality. Were encouraged to laugh when a street racer in Mount Kisco destroys a homeless mans marketbasket and almost kills him. In California police cars pursuing the outlaw racers are demolished one after another in horrific crashes and spinouts that could only be fatal. We dont get to see dead cops though because its all in a spirit of bad fun. Watch a scene from the Oscar-nominated animated film ""Ernest amp; Celestine"" in which Ernest a down-on-his luck bear meets Celestine a young mouse. (Photo/Video GKids) Ernest amp; Celestine This years Oscar for best animated feature was bestowed of course on ""Frozen"" a Disney production that deserved it. ""Ernest amp; Celestine"" from France and Belgium won only a nomination but this tale of forbidden friendship between a bear and a mouse is so winning that audiences will cherish it as the classic its sure to become. Ernest an endearing bear is a street musician who lacks the vocation for begging. Celestine is an adorable mouse and I use that adjective advisedly; she is worthy of adoration. Specifically she is an orphan with the soul of an artist whos been forced to serve an internship at a dental school. In French lore the tooth fairy is a mouse so teeth are crucial to this story which is set in a bilevel world where the bears live on the surface and the mice live in elaborate underground cities. But ""Ernest amp; Celestine"" is about more than dentition. Its a tale of love overcoming violent prejudice (bears and mice arent supposed to be together); of artistry charged with intelligence (Celestine thinks rings around sweetly lumbering Ernest) and of artistry triumphant. (In a beautiful sequence thats clearly a tribute to ""Fantasia"" Ernests violin and Celestines paintbrush combine to portray winter giving way to spring.) The movie advances the art of animation without seeming to try. (Benjamin Renner Vincent Patar and Stephane Aubier share director credit.) In keeping with the source material a series of beloved childrens books by the Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent the watercolor style and pale hues hark back to an earlier and much more innocent day. Yet the drawings move with precision and grace that would maximize the enchantment of the most stringent minimalist. ""Ernest amp; Celestine"" is being released in two versions French and dubbed English. The dubbed version features the voices of Forest Whitaker Mackenzie Foy Lauren Bacall Paul Giamatti and William H. Macy; Id bet that its very good. I saw the film in subtitled French and the voices are just sensational Lambert Wilson as Ernest Pauline Brunner as Celestine and Anne-Marie Loop as La Grise the headmistress of Celestines orphanage who warns of the Big Bad Bear in bedtime stories of epic scariness. ""Only in fairy tales can bears be friends with mice"" she declaims with a fervor befitting a star of the Comedie Francaise. All but one of her little mice believe her. Watch a clip from the film ""Le Week-End."" A British couple return to Paris many years after their honeymoon there in an attempt to rejuvenate their marriage. Starring Lindsay Duncan Jim Broadbent and Jeff Goldblum. (Photo/Video Music Box Films) Le Week-End The main--and for my money only--attraction in ""Le Week-End"" which was directed by Roger Michell is the marvelous Scottish actress Lindsay Duncan. She is witty fiercely intelligent and intensely sexy in the role of Meg a woman stuck in a failing marriage. All of these attributes would be impressive in any such role; theyre fairly startling in the case of Meg whos in her mid-60s. Jim Broadbent plays Megs husband Nick. Mr. Broadbents a superb actor too but Nick whom were supposed to see as lovable though terribly difficult is more of a bore than anything else and as written by Hanif Kureishi a heavier burden than even Mr. Broadbents buoyant spirit can sustain. The weekend of the title is one the couple spends in Paris revisiting for the first time in decades the city where theyd gone for their honeymoon. A lot has changed in their marriage over those years and not for the better. Forced to retire from his academic post and feeling himself a failure Nick has become remote and obviously depressed; his impulse is to visit Montparnasse Cemetery where Sartre and Samuel Beckett are buried. Meg still a vibrant dreamer and a sexual animal has so little tolerance for her husbands anxieties and fears that shes come to the point of wanting out. ENLARGE Lindsay Duncan left and Jim Broadbent in Le Week-End Music Box Films On the page the problems that bedevil this once-loving couple may have looked intriguingly intricate--passive aggression in full flower--and appealingly poignant. On screen however theres little spontaneity and a surfeit of speeches that play like a shopping list of grievances with timeouts taken periodically for clumsy lectures. ""Youve contrived to chuck away your numerous talents"" Meg tells Nick in the cemetery. All sorts of talent has been chucked away here by the directors heavy touch and the scripts naked contrivance. Watch a clip from the film ""Bad Words."" A spelling bee loser sets out to exact revenge by finding a loophole and attempting to win as an adult. Starring Jason Bateman Kathryn Hahn and Allison Janney. (Photo/Video Focus Features) Bad Words Youve got to hand it to Jason Bateman for going all the way in playing the misanthropic hero of ""Bad Words"" a comedy which marks his debut as a feature director. But misanthropic barely describes Guy Trilby a 40-year-old grade-school dropout who decides to compete in a national spelling bee thanks to a loophole in the rules then lays waste to his eighth-grade rivals. For precursors of Guys perversity one would have to go back to W.C. Fields who made antic art out of his characters abhorrence of children. This guy is downright vile a self-created pariah and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time while he makes a mockery of such fair targets as obsessive-compulsive kids and relentlessly ambitious parents. (And spells brainbusting words with unflappable elan.) Eventually though the fun turns ugly and the motive for Guys behavior proves to be both implausible and banal. ENLARGE Rohan Chand left and Jason Bateman in Bad Words. Focus Features Mr. Batemans co-star Kathryn Hahn plays not without self-comment a sex-starved reporter named Jenny Widgeon. As a correspondent for an online newspaper that has the rights to Guys story Jenny has a perverse yen for Guy. Philip Baker Hall is Dr. Bowman the pompous fool who runs the spelling-bee organization. Allison Janney is Bowmans administrator Dr. Deagan; shes determined to extirpate Guy from the ranks of the competitors at all cost. The best part of the erratic script by Andrew Dodge is a friendship that emerges between the overage interloper and Chaitanya Chopra a 10-year-old Indian-American contestant played pipingly but charmingly by Rohan Chand. After resisting the kid at first Guy warms up to him calls him Slumdog gets him drunk teaches him a small dictionary of curse words and pays a buxom prostitute named Marzipan to commence however gingerly his sexual education. W.C. Fields would have been proud. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE 28 Weeks Later (2007) Imogen Poots was just into her teens when she played extremely well the older sister of a boy played by Mackintosh Muggleton; the young actors names were attention-getters in their own right. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directed this spirited sequel to ""28 Days Later"" Danny Boyles sensational zombie flick that was written by Alex Garland. The sequel written by the director with Rowan Joffe Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne begins six months after the original events when London is supposedly free of zombies and the virus that creates them. As you might suspect it isnt. ENLARGE Juno (2007) Jason Bateman is Mark Loring a hip and casually charming composer of music for commercials in a wonderful comedy that Jason Reitman directed from an original script by Diablo Cody. Ellen Page is brilliant as Juno MacGuff a precocious 16-year-old who finding herself pregnant decides against an abortion in favor of finding an ideal childless couple who will give her baby a good home. Mark is so hip and charming that Juno sees him as a perfect father. Jennifer Garner is Marks wife Vanessa Loring an earnest and caring woman but a fearfully anxious one. ENLARGE Topsy-Turvy (1999) Jim Broadbent is William S. Gilbert the librettist of Gilbert and Sullivan. Allan Corduner is the composer Arthur Sullivan. Mr. Broadbent is magnificent in an uncommonly complex role. This Gilbert is a good-hearted genius but hes incapable of self-acceptance let alone joy. At what ought to be his hour of triumph after ""The Mikado"" has opened to acclaim he can only say to his wife Kitty (Lesley Manvlle) ""Theres something inherently disappointing about success."" Theres something thrilling about Mike Leighs movie which is as smart as it is beautiful and miraculously entertaining.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 13 2014 1200 PM Title ""Need for Speed"" Film Info Keep yer foot hard on the gas pedal son (never mind them brakes). Director Scott Waugh (202). PG-13 Violence language nudity. Area theaters. The action drama ""Need for Speed"" is like a great-looking roadster with a junky engine. This movie is so dumb for most of its running time you walk away wishing there was less plot and pointless posing and more of the fuel-injected coolness that brought you to the multiplex in the first place. Tobey (Aaron Paul of ""Breaking Bad"") is an auto mechanic and drag-racing phenom in Mount Kisco N.Y. Hes struggling to keep his repair shop going and get over a decade-long rivalry with Dino (Dominic Cooper) a local guy who made good on the racing circuit. Dino is a hotshot; Tobey is a hothead but a good bud to his pals. When one pal dies in a race Tobey is in Tobey winds up in jail for two years. After hes out he gets back behind the wheel in order to beat Dino in a San Francisco race hosted by a mysterious car nut called the Monarch (Michael Keaton doing a bad impression of young Michael Keaton). The hitch Tobey needs a car. But theres a solution Sexy British auto exec Julia (Imogen Poots) lets Tobey drive the jazzed-up Mustang he built for her company -- but only if she can accompany him on the cross-country cruise to California you know to protect her investment. En route they bump up against cops nasty competitors and even the Grand Canyon but they make it in time for a showdown with Dino. To ""Need for Speeds"" credit it relies on good stunt work not computer-generated effects. The plot of his videogame-derived film is a pastiche of Springsteen songs; 1970s road-trip flicks like ""Smokey and the Bandit"" ""The Gauntlet"" and ""The Gumball Rally""; and 50s juvenile delinquent culture (theres a scene at a drive-in complete with visual nods to the drag race in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and check out those names -- Dino Tobey Benny Little Pete). That works for a short while as a send-up of the genre. It soon wears thin. Paul growls and poses to the best of his ability. The beguiling Poots -- always a pleasure -- works her English accent and curlicue smile and manages to be more than eye candy. As for the guys in Tobeys support team they preen for attention. Theres a dude flying a Cessna watching for traffic snarls as two guys run backup driving a truck that can refuel Tobeys Mustang. Cell phones and dashboard Internet access have replaced CB radios but the Bandit and Snowman called -- and they want their banter back. Yet there is one classic thing ""Need for Speed"" does well that deserves a shout-out which is the use of actual cars and effects instead of CGI. Wild shots of cars flipping around careening off each other and even being airlifted by a chopper over the Colorado River make this more than just a ""Fast amp; Furious"" ripoff. Lots of stuntpeople put their lives at risk here for entertainment and their work is undeniably terrific. If only the rest of the film had taken as many chances -- or been as good.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Tobey (Aaron Paul) is an auto mechanic and racecar driver seeking vengeance against a rival in ""Need for Speed"" a movie based on a video game franchise. (Melinda Sue Gordon/AP) By Jen Chaney March 13 2014 Follow chaneyj ""Need for Speed"" is a piece of auto-collision pornography that weighs down its car-flip-and-massive-fireball money shots with a preposterous plot involving vehicular manslaughter vengeance a road trip thats basically one long police chase and an illegal drag race orchestrated by Michael Keaton. Yes thats one way to describe it. ""Need for Speed"" is also a video game adapted to a bloated motion picture thats designed to sell more video games; an excessively long commercial for the Ford Mustang; a blatant bid to kick-start another lucrative franchise in the same rubber-burning spirit as the ""Fast amp; Furious"" series; absolute proof that Aaron Paul this films star should think more carefully about his post-""Breaking Bad"" career choices. Paul the Emmy Award-winning portrayer of ""Yo"" master Jesse Pinkman plays Tobey Marshall skilled racer and mechanic from Mount Kisco N.Y. which within the context of this film functions as the live-action equivalent of Radiator Springs in Pixars ""Cars."" Its a small quaint blue-collar town with lots of vintage vehicles equipped to handle a night of intense drag racing. An encounter on one such night with Tobeys arch rival former professional racer and still professional dirtbag Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) leads to a dangerous game of sports-car chicken that ends in a terrible accident. As a result Tobey serves two years in jail for a crime he didnt commit. Once released he becomes hellbent on snagging an invitation to the De Leon an elite underground battle for speed supremacy organized by a wealthy racing enthusiast known as the Monarch (Keaton). There the embittered Tobey hopes to again face Dino and settle their lingering score. If that sounds like a lot of story to cover it is especially considering that Tobey also has to sort out romantic issues with two love interests -- Anita (Dakota Johnson) an ex whos now involved with Dino and Julia (Imogen Poots) a British car broker who becomes Tobeys wingwoman during his cross-country journey to the De Leon -- as well as interact with the auto-body-shop buddies who save him from peril in increasingly unbelievable ways. Of course most people wont come to ""Need for Speed"" in search of a compelling narrative. Theyll come to fawn over shiny Mustangs Lamborghinis and GTA Spanos and to gasp when those gorgeous works of vehicular art dodge oncoming traffic pirouette in midair and smash violently into police cars engaged in hot pursuit. On those metrics ""Need for Speed"" satisfies at times but even the more jaw-dropping camera angles and shocking smash-ups start to feel redundant after director Scott Waugh revisits them for the third or fourth time. On the acting front its obvious why Paul got cast as the lead He possesses a certain charismatic intensity as well as a seductively low voice that sounds like a high-performance engine perpetually revving. But with a script that forces him to utter lines such as ""Well settle this behind the wheel"" this is hardly the part that will establish him as a viable leading man. Even Keaton normally the ideal choice to play an unhinged wild-card type has a hard time fitting into this mess of a movie. As the mysterious reclusive Monarch his role consists entirely of monologues filled with race-day exposition and zero genuine fun. And that right there is ""Need for Speeds"" most crucial flaw It wants its audience to feel the thrill that comes from slamming on the gas pedal with reckless abandon. But most moviegoers will feel like theyre chugging along eager to finally pump the brakes on this overheated uninspired attempt at a cinematic rush. Chaney is a freelance writer.  1/2 PG-13.

Comments click to enlarge Need for Speed Video Rated PG-13  124 minutes  2014 Though based on a series of video games this big-budget racing picture feels closer in spirit to 1950s comic books and Walter Hills early directorial efforts; the action is clearly delineated the neon colors bright as can be the characters deliberately archetypal. Unfortunately theres not much of a sensibility beneath the pleasant surfaces; the movie is easy to enjoy but just as easy to forget. A sensitive and expressive performer Aaron Paul (of the AMC series Breaking Bad) is an awkward fit for the Clint Eastwood-like hero a stoic amateur racer out to avenge the malicious pro driver who framed him for manslaughter. Rami Malek (The Master) Ramon Rodriguez (The Wire) and Scott Mescudi (better known as rapper Kid Cudi) appear more comfortable onscreen as Pauls crew of merry gearheads and Michael Keaton is fun in a bit part.

Photo Credit AP / Dreamworks advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An auto mechanic wrongly convicted of murder must clear his name by entering a race. Adapted from the Electronic Arts video game. Rated R (action violence) BOTTOM LINE Plenty of Mustangs on display but the Hyundai characters and Prius pacing make this movie a low-octane drag. Even car nuts may get bored. CAST Aaron Paul Imogen Poots Dominic Cooper LENGTH 210 ""I can smell love vengeance and motor oil swirling together"" Its an inspired line from ""Need for Speed"" delivered by Michael Keaton as The Monarch a mysterious Godlike figure who communicates with the auto world only by Internet. His one-line plot summary slightly tinged with mockery may be the funniest moment in this otherwise leaden car flick. In a movie where the action characters and dialogue are thoroughly low-octane Keaton is the only one firing on all cylinders. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Thats too bad because hes rarely on screen. The hero were stuck with is Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul minus the intensity he brought to AMCs ""Breaking Bad"") an auto mechanic from Mount Kisco. His complicated backstory -- a wrongful conviction and a blood feud with rich-kid racer Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) -- causes the movie to idle for nearly 30 minutes until shifting into gear with the introduction of sassy British car maven Julia (Imogen Poots). She and Tobey must drive a priceless Mustang to California where Tobey hopes to clear his name at The Monarchs invite-only race The De Leon. Even for a low-aiming youth movie adapted from a storyless video game (John and George Gatins are the writers) this is a remarkably dopey plot. Director Scott Waugh (""Act of Valor"") doesnt even bother hiding it. The physics-ignorant stunts many involving aircraft are too improbable to work as fantasies or even as gags and Tobey and his crew (played by Rami Malek Ramon Rodriguez and actor-musician Scott ""Kid Cudi"" Mescudi) frequently cross the line from daring to dunderheaded. You might forgive them clipping the occasional bicyclist and plowing into oncoming traffic but playing dodge-em with a bus full of schoolchildren is another matter. ""Need for Speed"" is filled with tributes to -- and ripoffs of -- vintage car flicks A drive-in theater plays ""Bullitt"" a cop car loses its back axle a la ""American Grafitti"" and Keatons character is an update of Cleavon Littles jive-talking radio DJ from the 1971 cult classic ""Vanishing Point."" Keaton riffing faster than a souped-up Agera (""Christmas came early wing nuts"") is clearly having a great time. That makes one of us.

Then -- and Im serious about this -- just turn them on every time anyone in the movie opens their mouth. You dont want to hear the dialogue but you do want to hear the incredible sound designA -- the supercars that rumble grumble screech and scream as they careen down highways and spin around corners. Based on the popular video games this is a movie with breathtakingly visceral racing scenes and they are matched by a breathtakingly breathtakingly terrible script. Breaking Bads Aaron Paul plays Tobey Marshall a talented all-American racer and auto-shop owner whose modest background has prevented him from hitting the big time on the illegal racing circuit; if he wants to ""fly with the eagles"" were told early on hes ""gonna need a bigger set of wings."" Tobeys rival in both cars and women Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper)A did make it big and of course hes the kind of swarthy fellow who thinks nothing of committing murder to get his way. So Dino causes the death of a close friend of Tobeys during a drag race and frames Tobey for the incident. (He can do that because hes all-powerful and there were no witnesses even though they were racing down busy streets in broad da...aah I digress.) Youd think that seeing his best friend burnt to a crisp in a comically fiery car crash would make Tobey think twice about racing again (or at least haunt him in some way) but no. After spending two years in prison Tobey gets out and immediately decides to challenge Dino at an illegal high-stakes drag race known as DeLeon run by a mysterious full-of-it radio personality known as Monarch (Michael Keaton who must have stipulated in his contract that he would never have to leave his chair). But before he can join the race -- or even find out its specific location -- Tobey has to Cannonball Run it across the country driving to California from New York in 45 hours. For his ride hes got a mythical car a Ford Mustang that the legendary designer Carroll Shelby was working on when he died. For his companion hes got the beautiful Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots) a game quirky car nerd who works with the guy who technically owns the Mustang. Together they speed nonstop re-fuel while driving and cause automotive chaos in major American cities. Need for Speed gets some of the cooler details of this world right The Cessnas in the air looking out for clear lanes and cops the high-tech nature of modern illegal street racing etc. Director Scott Waugh who came up through the stunt world thrives on that kind of authenticity. His previous film 2012s Act of Valor was a glorified but effective Navy SEAL recruitment video sporting action scenes starring real soldiers using real live ammunition. And you need not read promo copy to know that Need for Speeds stunts are largely real and not computer-generated. The cars have weight and presence; when they zoom down a road or fly off a hill you can tell youre not looking at pixels but at real metal rubber asphalt and dirt. However that attention to realism backfires when it comes to the inane plot and idiotic dialogue. Example When we first meet Julia she faux-naively asks our heroes if a 900 horsepower car is fast. When just two lines later she predictably unleashes her impressive automotive knowledge the men are thunderstruck. Its supposed to be a gotcha moment for our heroes a gentle poke at their sense of macho entitlement. ""Why? Is it because Im a woman?"" she asks them pointedly. But you want to scream ""No its because you just asked if 900 horsepower was fast lady"" Little amateur mistakes like these add up. It might have all held together with a charismatic lead but Paul a talented actor who played well off Bryan Cranstons alpha-male presence in Breaking Bad cant seem to make Tobey the least bit interesting. Hes not a likable character to begin with -- his hubristic fixation on racing is never questioned only indulged and applauded -- but he doesnt have the outlaw whiff of an antihero either. Hes a bland blond blue-eyed ball of nothing here and that makes it hard to care what happens to him or to anybody else. But racing movies are supposed to be stupid right? Theyre supposed to not make any sense and make you chuckle at their silliness. True and Need for Speed has an idea of the kind of stupid movie it wants to be. But stupidity and incompetence are two very different things and this movie isnt smart enough to be as stupid as it wants. Say what you will about the Fast amp; Furious films but they fully embrace their cartoonish CGI ethos The cars feel like feathers and the stories like fairy tales; its a whole ecosystem of artificiality. Need for Speed by contrast gives us some of the most striking racing scenes ever committed to film while making us yearn for the nuance and characterization of a video game. It whipsaws us between the impressively real and the hopelessly fake.

Photo Melinda Sue Gordon/DreamWorks II/AP MOVIE REVIEW Need for Speed Running time 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity action violence reckless driving nudity). At the Empire the Magic Johnson the Kips Bay others. He ignores red lights. He busts through speed limits. He recklessly endangers schoolchildren for the most foolish reasons. Yeah Bill de Blasio will probably be first on line to see ""Need for Speed."" Young men and fast cars are automatically stupid together but even if you set your intelligence level at ""off"" -- and you should -- youll get a hangover from this cocktail of 200-proof stupid clinking with moron ice cubes and with an idiot cherry on top. Aaron Paul so good in ""Breaking Bad"" and so not-good here plays a Mount Kisco NY mechanic with a history of bad blood with Dino (Dominic Cooper) a local boy-turned-rich car dealer who offers his ex-rival a shot at refurbishing a rare Mustang that in tip-top condition will sell for 2.7 million with a quarter of that going to Tobey (Paul) and his crew. After selling the car via a blond British car broker (Imogen Poots) the pair dont even celebrate the fortune they both just made. Instead they bet it all on a reckless car race that could easily get someone killed (and do) and/or destroy some priceless Koenigsegg hot rods (and do) and/or get one or more of them thrown in jail (and do). Why risk everything? Tobey doesnt seem particularly crazy (hes framed as reflective and soulful by gobs of milky somber ""Friday Night Lights""-style music). Things are pretty good. The girl Dino stole from him he forgets for the whole rest of the movie (except for a two-minute scene) and hes just saved his business. He isnt desperate hence not a desperado. Aaron Paul (left) and Dominic Cooper (right) face off in ""Need for Speed.""Photo Melinda Sue Gordon/DreamWorks II/AP More like a dumberado After a prison stretch he seeks vengeance against Dino via an illegal road rally in California that he doesnt have a car to race in. No problem He just calls the blond broker Julia. Two seconds later she pulls up in that 2.7 million Mustang. Which he now has permission to drive and damage as much as he wants because who wouldnt give a loser ex-con the keys to the most valuable car on the planet on a vague promise that he might share some prize money if he wins? Forgetting that a car that needs to be in pristine shape probably shouldnt be driven 3000 miles Tobey takes Julia and starts tearing cross-country with traffic guidance from a flying-ace buddy (Scott Mescudi) who has one of those rare Army jobs where they let you take any aircraft you want and fly wherever you want with it no questions asked. Also the friend borrows a TV stations traffic helicopter without anyone seeming to notice while Tobey keeps starting pointless car chases that risk his precious vehicle and endanger countless others. He does things like the ""grasshopper"" move (speed up a hill youve never seen before and hope that it will somehow result in you vaulting all pursuers) and the ""hot fuel"" move (getting refueled by a truck while slashing down the highway). If things get hairy he simply chains the roof to a helicopter and gets flown over a canyon. The last time I tried that I spilled my coffee but maybe I was doing it wrong. Slammed feverishly together in the editing room by director Scott Waugh who makes ""Cannonball Run"" look like a meticulously accurate documentary the film stakes everything on the inane and repetitive car chases which work only in a world in which everything arranges itself to suit the next stunt. At the illegal California road rally where the top prize is all the other cars (except they all get totalled in the effort) we learn that ""cop cars top out at about 130."" Whew our heroes are in the clear Because roadblocks havent been invented yet.

But if the conventional hierarchy...2014-03-28Walt Disney Pictures Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr BREAKING SAD Need for Speed leaves us longing for the days of Jessie and Breaking Bad (Melinda Sue Gordon) C Need for Speed Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Dominic Cooper Rami Malek Aaron Paul; Director Scott Waugh; Release Date Wide 03/14/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 131; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted March 28 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Anytime a movie is compared to a videogame you can be sure theres at least the ghost of a sneer on the speakers lips. But if the conventional hierarchy of pop cultural snobbery is so clear-cut -- books gt; movies gt; videogames -- then why do efforts to adapt games into movies always pale in comparison with their source material? The latest property to get a big-screen makeover is Need for Speed a moderately popular racing series that the powers that be have tried to turn into a turbo-boosted stunt-car extravaganza of the same make and model as the Fast amp; Furious franchise. Aaron Paul still fresh-ish off Breaking Bad plays a young drag racer who must make it across the country in 45 hours to attend a secret no-rules circuit and avenge the death of his friend. While the movie is flashy and might give some adrenaline junkies a fix theres almost nothing under the hood. The story is tired the dialogues an assemblage of cliches and even the action sequences which lack the pop and imagination of other recent revved-up joyrides like Fast amp; Furious 6 feel as if theyre from another era. Beneath all that chrome plating this vehicle is a well-used car. Need for Speed is just another pileup in Hollywoods long accident report of taking games from the couch to the theater seat. In fact the studios have stalled out from the very beginning. The earliest example 1993s Super Mario Bros. attempted to horn in on Nintendos success casting the improbable pair of Bob Hoskins as the iconic Italian plumber Mario and John Leguizamo as his brother Luigi thrown together to battle Dennis Hoppers malicious were-lizard King Koopa. The film reached Howard the Duck levels of not-getting-it and the result was a cross-generational embarrassment similar to having your grandmother struggle to master Twitter. Since then there have been bombs (Doom) and hits (Lara Croft Tomb Raider) but none of them have been what you would call good movies. And no videogame adaptation has ever reached Fresh status on Rotten Tomatoes. Of course this wont stop Hollywood from trying. Videogame sales reached 15.4 billion last year in the U.S. alone and its doubtful that studios will walk away from a pot that big anytime soon especially as both industries rely ever more heavily on megablockbuster franchises. But lest you think its game over from the start not all cross-pollination has been bad. Wreck-It Ralph and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World took videogame aesthetics and iconography and spun them into the DNA strands of their narratives. Thats a much smarter way to go. So lets give up adapting videogames often-weak story elements while failing to provide the one thing they offer the ability to play. Maybe then we wont have movies like Need for Speed where you look down at your hands and miss holding the controller.

"Review Need for Speed 2 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Need for Speed 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Mar 12 2014 1014 AM Youre Aaron Paul fresh off wrapping up your stint in ""Breaking Bad"" one of the greatest television shows of all time for which you won a couple of Emmys. What do you do for an encore? ""Need for Speed"" apparently a brain-dead car-chase movie based on the hugely popular video game that has a lot more horsepower than IQ. Hey its a living and the checks cash the same. But dang. Paul plays Tobey Marshall a gifted driver down on his luck. Hes stuck in the small town in which he grew up. The garage he has inherited from his recently departed father is about to go under. But out of the blue Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) a former rival who has gone on to much bigger and more-lucrative things (and stolen Tobeys girlfriend) shows up and offers Tobey and his crew a big cut if they can finish building a custom Shelby Mustang and sell it. This happens but there are questions about the cars top speed and whos the better driver Tobey or Dino. An illegal race ensues a friend is killed and the wrongly accused Tobey goes to prison while the rich evil Dino skates away free. Several years later Tobey gets out and immediately gets involved in another illegal race this one far more lucrative but one that requires driving from New York to San Francisco in 44 hours and breaking parole. In a roundabout way it might also clear his name. Whatever. In movies like this a little extra prison time is on the level of a flat tire on the scale of inconvenience. Despite the long buildup and the overstuffed plot which makes the movie weigh in at a ridiculous two hours and 10 minutes all of this is really just filler between the admittedly spectacular driving sequences that director Scott Waugh nails. Oh and they plop Imogen Poots as Julia Maddon in the passenger seat for the most part (though she does have one memorable trip behind the wheel). Tobey doesnt want her there at first but she is the woman who brokered the original deal for the Shelby and her boss is footing the bill so he cant really say no (thats the car they take). Moon faces and goo-goo eyes ensue. Waugh places cameras in the cars which makes for some pretty amazing stunts. If youre a gear head youll appreciate the impressive display of rare and valuable autos. If youre a Michael Keaton fan you also might enjoy his insane rants as Monarch the rich eccentric who puts the annual underground race together. So maybe youre asking why it wouldnt be easy for the cops to shut down such a race. Or why despite every law-enforcement agency in the nation clued in to Tobey and Julias cross-country jaunt they have so few run-ins with police officers until the end. Or why with the dozens of people Tobey and Dino imperiled during the first illegal race there were no witnesses. But fretting over these details in George Gatins screenplay would be to miss the point. The title is everything in this movie. (Well that and the mileage Paul gets out of being such a better actor than anyone else involved here with the exception of Keaton.) If you like watching people drive really nice cars really fast ""Need for Speed"" scratches that particular itch. But expect nothing more because everything else about it is just running on empty.

He looks visibly uncomfortable playing street car racer Tobey Marshall who foolishly does business with leather-clad rival Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper with an American accent and channelling the cast of Grease). After a spell in prison Tobey emerges with revenge on his mind and accepts a challenge to drive a multi-million-dollar Ford Mustang to San Francisco. There he will compete in a furrowed-browed race with the USs best drivers. Mercifully the plot requires a love interest chatty Brit Julia (Imogen Poots) to come along for the ride. Julia works for the cars owner and is protecting his interests or something equally spurious. Flirty-eyed Poots could create chemistry with a plank of wood and manages to wring a few laughs out of the script. And so after a creaky cliched start Need for Speed picks up a bit. The script is still as corny as hell but the chase scenes are pretty spectacular whether Tobey is just showing off trying to scare his passenger or shake off the bad guys. Audiences purely interested in the cars wont be disappointed - frankly theyre sexier than the cast. But anyone looking for a story or a performance as impressive as Jesse from Breaking Bad will be. And no Aaron lowering your voice like Vin Diesel doesnt make you an action hero.

To say that ""Need for Speed"" is one of the better movies derived from a videogame source may not sound like much of an endorsement given the competition (""Street Fighter"" ""Tekken"" ""Super Mario Bros."") but its an apt description of this mash note to the American muscle car in which high-flying stuntwork routinely trumps plot plausibility or particularly memorable characters. The ""Fast and Furious"" franchise has nothing much to worry about but as long as the engines are humming and the gears are grinding -- which is most of the time -- ""Need"" is modest diverting fun that should have at least a couple of good box office laps in it before ""Divergent"" and ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" muscle it off the track. Because the ""Need for Speed"" games of which there have been 20 different installments since 1994 dont really offer much in the way of narrative director Scott Waugh (""Act of Valor"") and sibling screenwriters George and John Gatins are pretty much starting from scratch here. They have in turn created even more of a self-conscious 1950s hot-rod/greaser throwback than the ""Fast"" movies themselves plunking us down in the kind of pastoral small-town America (Georgia doubling for Mt. Kisco N.Y.) where people talk of ""the big city"" as if it can only be reached by arduous overland journey and where ruddy-cheeked youths gather on summer nights at the local drive-in theater (where ""Bullitt"" is either enjoying a reissue or has simply been playing continuously for the past 45 years). One half expects James Dean and Sal Mineo to enter at any moment but instead we get Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) a youth stock-car prodigy who now runs a local custom auto shop and his best bud Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) whos also called ""Little Pete"" and whose sensitive childlike demeanor tells us from the start that hes doomed to meet an untimely end. Tobey by contrast is built Ford-tough and Paul plays the part with the flinty tightly wound charisma of a small man who makes up in moxie what he lacks in stature. Theres something of the young James Cagney in him and hes by far the best thing ""Need for Speed"" has going for it. In a mildly refreshing change-up from the American action-movie norm Paul is surrounded by an ensemble of similarly small-to-medium-sized gearheads who collectively might equal one Vin Diesel or the Rock. They include the wiry bug-eyed Rami Malek (as a mechanic who gives his cubicle-dwelling day job an exuberant kiss-off) and hip-hop star Scott Mescudi as a wise-cracking Army Reserve pilot who improbably pops up in a variety of civilian and military aircraft throughout the movie lending the racers eagle-eyed air support whenever they seem to require it. (File his performance under ""a little goes a long way."") With his slick pompadour and cocksure strut Dominic Cooper is nearly a caricature of wanton privilege as Dino Brewster the hometown boy turned NASCAR pro newly back in town with Petes sister Anita (Dakota Johnson) who happens to be Tobeys former high-school flame on his arm. Dino has come into possession of the prototype 50th-anniversary Ford Mustang that legendary designer Carroll Shelby was working on at the time of his death in 2012. He has a British buyer on the line for a cool 3 million and he proposes to hire Tobey and company to finish building the car in exchange for a cut of the sale. But Dino has a few dirtier tricks up his sleeve too. After the Mustang is built and the sale is done he challenges Tobey and Pete to a winner-takes-all road race in three identical street-illegal Swedish Koenigsegg supercars. Resembling sleeker more aerodynamic Batmobiles the Koenigseggs look like trouble and prove to be just that for Pete in what is certainly one of the most spectacular aerial car flips ever captured on film. The vicarious thrill-making of that scene and others that show drivers racing in excess of 100 miles per hour through crowded city streets cant help but hit a slightly queasy note arriving barely three months after the death of Paul Walker. Then again its hard to shake the feeling that ""Need for Speed"" is a movie Walker himself would have very much enjoyed. Framed by Dino for Petes death Tobey does his time and emerges two years later with revenge on his mind. At which point ""Need for Speed"" evolves into a kind of latter-day ""Cannonball Run"" or ""Gumball Rally"" with Tobey hightailing it from New York to San Francisco to compete against Dino in the Super Bowl of illegal street racing the De Leon. His car of choice the custom Mustang whose owner agrees to lend it on the condition that his associate Julia (Imogen Poots) travels with it. The tart spunky Poots has some fun playing a woman for whom the sound of grinding gears is close to a mating call but make no mistake The true romance here is that of man and machine as Tobey races against the clock the cops and (in one of the movies dumber plot twists) some high-octane bounty hunters dispatched by Dino. A veteran stunt performer and coordinator Waugh isnt as distinctive an image maker as longtime ""Fast and Furious"" helmer Justin Lin (or Ron Howard in ""Rush"") but he certainly knows his way around a stunt sequence and as in ""Act of Valor"" draws heavily on practical special effects with a minimum of CGI. That includes the Mustangs gravity-defying 160-foot leap across multiple lanes of downtown Detroit traffic -- a stunt so dazzling it help to compensate for some of the movies even more death-defying leaps in logic such as why one would detour through Detroit en route from New York to California in the first place. The rest of the time Waugh and stunt coordinator Lance Gilbert and d.p. Shane Hurlbut keep the screen busy with lots of fancy driving shot from a battery of dizzying but never disorienting angles (two additional d.p.s David B. Nowell and Michael Kelem are credited with the frequent aerial images). When we finally get to San Francisco the De Leon almost feels like an anticlimax -- unsurprising given that were already well past the 90-minute running time Roger Corman deemed ideal for such fare. But there is an oasis of private amusement waiting in the form of Michael Keaton as the Monarch mythic impresario of the De Leon who beams his rhythmic color commentary over the Internet from an undisclosed locale working himself into flurries of manic intensity as he goes. Its a tailor-made role for the sly inventive and chronically underrated Keaton and he does much to guide ""Need for Speed"" ably across the finish line.

So I wont say that ""Need for Speed"" is an immoral movie. But its a bad one. And yes a reckless one. Its a film with barely a brain in its head yet it does have one jumbled thought -- that stealing cars (and helicopters) speeding wildly destroying property causing crashes and injuring lots of people (including pursuing police officers) is just like awesome man Our heroes dont have sex or drink or smoke of course -- this is after all a Disney movie. But still -- this is a Disney movie. And that family-friendly studio thinks in the wake of Paul Walkers death and Justin Biebers not-quite-latest idiocy that glorifying illegal street racing is acceptable entertainment? But as Wilde might say the movies truly unforgivable sin is that its boring -- a two-hour demolition derby of screeching tires auto erotica and a plot and characters that never get out of first gear. The story - set in some mythological version of Mt. Kisco N.Y. -- features Aaron Paul as a phenomenally gifted mechanic who (with the aid of a friend flying a Cessna and some vague surveillance equipment) shuts down the whole town at night for illegal races. That stunt gets him a job rebuilding a 3 million car. But then he bets his fee on another race a race that ends with someones death and Paul unfairly getting blamed and sent to jail for manslaughter. Two years later though hes out and looking for revenge -- which he intends to get by getting into that 3 million car again driving cross country in two days and entering and winning the daddy-of-all illegal street races run by some mad recluse called the Monarch. So tell me - does that about fill up your tank with crazy or you need me to top if off for you? The simplistic script makes even the worst of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies look like ""House of Cards."" People insult each other or fall in love or suddenly take off all their clothes (comically of course) for no reason whatsoever. There are plotholes here you could drive a semi through. Sideways. As our hero Paul doesnt appear dangerously intense so much as just dangerous -- with his fixed wired wide-eyed stare he looks like he belongs back in ""Breaking Bad."" And as the Monarch Michael Keaton rants and raves online like somebody left over from ""Vanishing Point"" a movie I kept wishing I was watching. Instead though I was watching this cross-country pileup with Imogen Poots stuck playing the girl (or ""the tart"" as Keatons charmless character keeps referring to her) dozens of anonymous casualties and Paul hitting the gas like he just remembered where to find some meth. There are some terrific car crashes here but outside of insurance adjusters Im not sure who this movie is for. If youre a fan of the video game -- well wouldnt you rather stay home and play it instead of watching this director foul it up? And if you like exotic cars you can see them at the New York Auto Show next month. You can even sit in a few and maybe go home with some free posters. This movie offers nothing but noise and silliness. And possibly -- if it has the effect on its target teen audience I think its going to -- a very dangerous ride home afterward for everybody. Ratings note The film contains brief nudity strong language and violence. Need For Speed (PG-13) Disney (130 min.) Directed by Scott Waugh. With Aaron Paul Imogen Poots Michael Keaton.

Certain lines of dialogue characterizations even camera angles that might be fitting for one actor will be thoroughly ridiculous for another. The many many problems of ""Need for Speed"" cant be blamed on the miscasting of Aaron Paul in the lead role -- and in fact theres not an actor out there who could have saved the thing -- but Pauls presence in the film certainly isnt helping. A memorable and eccentric presence on ""Breaking Bad"" Paul feels awkward and uncomfortable here his round baby face doesnt loan itself to the intensity that director Scott Waugh (""Act of Valor"") is clearly desperate to achieve and perhaps it might have occurred to someone that an actor best known for playing a manic motormouth might not have been the best choice for a character whos supposed to be haunted and brooding. See video Aaron Paul Breaks Bad in Need for Speed Trailer In this idiotic adaptation of the popular video game Paul stars as Tobey Marshall a talented driver currently trying to keep the doors open on his late pops garage a body shop so generically vintage that it looks like a feature of the ""Cars"" section of Disneyland. Tobeys having a hard time paying the mortgage despite the fact that he and his ethnically-diverse crew have both a slew of vintage racers and any number of high-tech tracking devices (including no kidding an airplane) used to monitor their local drag races. When the dastardly Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) comes back to town after having raced at Indy offering big money to Tobey and his guys to create a one-of-a-kind Ford Mustang Tobey takes the gig. (The movie goes from a handshake to a completed car without a montage or even a wipe in between. If only the 130-minute ""Need for Speed"" had always stuck to such economical storytelling.) When Tobey shows up Dino by getting the Mustang up to 190 mph Dino challenges Tobey to a street race that winds up costing Tobeys pal (and Dinos girlfriends brother) Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) his life. Its in this first deadly drag race that ""Need for Speed"" makes us appreciate the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise that it is trying so hard to emulate; in the ""Fast"" movies there may be some close calls but we dont find ourselves actively concerned about the well-being of any nearby pedestrians. All the drivers in ""Need for Speed"" -- heroes and villains alike -- are total jerks on the road oblivious to the welfare of homeless people bicyclists commuters even school buses either ignoring or even in some cases chuckling over the destruction they leave in their wake. Its hard to root for such patently irresponsible creeps. Also read Need for Speeds Harrison Gilbertson to Star in YA Adaptation Fallen (Exclusive) Anyway Dino frames Tobey for Petes death Tobey goes to jail for two years and when he gets out he swears revenge which involves racing Dino in a big annual illegal race where the winner gets to take home all of his opponents high-priced cars. (It doesnt seem like that great of a prize since apparently all the vehicles wind up either wrecked or impounded by the cops by the time its over but hey whatever.) Entering the race involves Tobey getting the crew back together driving cross-country and unconvincingly falling in love with car expert Julia (Imogen Poots) and attracting the attention of eccentric rich race organizer Monarch (Michael Keaton who apparently pocketed a big check for sitting in a room and giving us a third-rate impersonation of Cleavon Little in ""Vanishing Point""). Car fetishists will undoubtedly enjoy the many loving shots of some of the worlds most expensive automobiles but theyre about the only demographic thats going to come away from ""Need for Speed"" satisfied. The racing scenes are uninspired screenwriter George Gatins dialogue is flat and the performances are forgettable. Waughs only innovation is to strap a Go-Pro camera onto cars that are flipping over -- but after the first two or three of these loop-de-loop POV shots the effect loses its charm. Also read Fast amp; Furious 7 Producers Considering Scrapping Production Starting Over in Wake of Paul Walkers Death (Exclusive) Based on his star-making TV work Paul has a career ahead of him as an actor but this role represents a complete miscalculation of his talents and the kind of films he should be pursuing. Also spinning her wheels here is Imogen Poots a talented comic performer who deserves better than movies like this and ""That Awkward Moment."" ""Fast and the Furious"" fans have one more year to wait before Jason Statham tears up the streets of Tokyo looking for Vin Diesel but ""Need for Speed"" fails as a place-keeper -- or for that matter as a possible usurper -- of that other better franchise.
