So the news of a Hollywood version arriving within just three years has elicited an array of reflexive reactions ""Really?"" ""Too soon."" ""But the original wasnt even in a foreign language"" Still the remake throws into the mix inspired choices for cast and crew. It very literally puts the ""black"" into this black comedy by recasting the central WASP family as an African-American one. Additionally directing duties here curiously fall on Neil LaBute the acerbic chronicler of modern moral malaise who brought us ""In the Company of Men."" Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence play rival siblings who reunite for their fathers funeral. Self-absorbed Ryan (Lawrence) has left home and gone on to become a successful novelist leaving aspiring writer Aaron (Rock) behind to care for their parents. Funeral proceedings come to a screeching halt when an attendee hallucinating on acid insists that the coffin is moving on its own. Soon after a mysterious mourner reveals himself to be the deceaseds illicit lover. Armed with salacious photos he blackmails the brothers for a share of the estate. Dean Craig scribe of the original receives sole writing credit for the remake. In fact the two films seem to have begun with the same script with the new cast liberally incorporating unmistakably American improv comedy and ad-libbing. Perhaps LaBute a playwright-turned-filmmaker is simply treating the project as the restaging of a theater piece with a different cast. And as a nod to the original Morristown native Peter Dinklage reprises his role as the patriarchs lover. While it isnt a shot-for-shot replica certainly no one can accuse Hollywood of dumbing things down here. The star-studded cast -- in addition to Lawrence and Rock Danny Glover Zoe Saldana Tracy Morgan and Luke Wilson all appear -- actually turns out to be a disadvantage. Youd expect the collision of Rocks and Lawrences outrageous personalities to spark comic fireworks but they are in fact cast in the films more serious roles and exhibit great deference to Craigs dialogue. Sidelining his comedic assets to play the straight man for a change Rock is ineffective in the lead. He doesnt have the dramatic chops of Matthew Macfadyen from the original and that becomes painfully apparent as he delivers the climactic eulogy. James Marsden who plays the drug-addled attendee unexpectedly steals one scene after another from some of todays best comedians. Thanks to him theres no shortage of laughs. Death at a Funeral (R) Screen Gems (90 min.) Directed by Neil LaBute. With Chris Rock Martin Lawrence Tracy Morgan Danny Glover Zoe Saldana Luke Wilson and Peter Dinklage. Martin Tsais rating Two stars Rating note The film contains strong language drug content and some sexual humor.

Well solid situation-comedy scenarios are obviously at a premium so Craig Deans fairly traditional farce gets an LA redo with Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence replacing Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Graves as warring siblings enduring their fathers chaotic funeral. Hence the humour takes an uptight social situation and unleashes serial indignities upon it - from mislabelled acid tablets naked people splattering bowel movements and even a mystery guest in the compact form of Peter Dinklage (the only actor in both versions). Some of this is crude much of it predictable but it is a crowd-pleaser since director Neil LaButes performers willingly play it that bit broader while an expanded budget brings a somewhat less poky feel. Although it still only just gets away with sundry homophobic and size-ist gags theres a tad more zing than the original though if you caught that already be warned this is a scene-for-scene retread.

I believe the member of the cast that stloe the show was the guy that unknowingly ingested the acid. His facial expressions were quite priceless.

My point of view from this Sydney living room - let me tell you this is one horribly feeble film. Laugh? If you find Benny Hill On the Buses and Dads Army a scream then youll love it. But not for me. Lame predictable embarrassing - more torture in 90 minutes than I experienced even with Russian Ark my previous low water mark.

Only see if you want to witness first-hand the depths to which a (mostly good) cast can plummet and come out all looking terrible except possibly Daisy Donovan who is about the only decent thing in this wretched movie.

As single financially comfortable baby-craving Tribeca pet-store owner Zoe Lopez muddles through the dismal big-screen debut of both writer Kate Angelo and director Alan Poul who burden her with an absolute void (Alex OLoughlin) as a love interest an SNL castoff (Michaela Watkins) as a second banana and a disabled Boston terrier. The same day she receives intrauterine insemination from Dr. Harris (Robert Klein who later provides some weird gallows gyn-humor) Zoe meets Stan (OLoughlin) an organic-cheese monger. Throughout their courtship crises are incoherently manufactured involving Stans struggle to pass an econ test at CUNY Zoes eligibility in the Single Mothers and Proud Group (which confusingly seems to include dyke couples making predatory lez eyes at the newcomer) and our heroines final-act lesson on learning to trust. Though fans have long given up hope that Karen Sisco will ever be reborn why does Lopez post-motherhood now seem intent on reinventing herself as a screen presence even blander than Kate Hudson? (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION James Ivory and cast make every scene flutter with feeling in this adaptation of Peter Camerons 2002 novel written for the screen by Ivorys collaborator of 50 years Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Omar (Omar Metwally) an American Phd student shows up unannounced at a secluded Uruguayan country estate to petition the household of novelist and suicide Jules Gund for permission to write the great mans biography the completion of which would guarantee a professorship (a fate worse than death its implied). Omar must impress Gunds stranded 28-year-old mistress Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg) his shunned 40-something wife Caroline (Laura Linney) -- loathe to publicize their menage -- and his elder brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins with Hiroyuki Sanada his longtime companion). These are Merchant-Ivory cosmopolitans people who quote Persian poets before dulcet landscapes. But even life among this aristocracy of the sensitive is not without complexities with everyone trapped in their age-appropriate life-crises. Arden and Omars flirtation is interrupted when his girlfriend (Alexandra Maria Lara) arrives; dashing weak Omar less self-willed than the average heroine of a 19th century marriage novel hereafter recedes behind the women. Best is Linney conquering scenes as the acrid and touching Caroline her regal bitterness a shield against nostalgia dressed Park Avenue-posh to drink alone. (Nick Pinkerton) (Playhouse Royal Town Center)DEATH AT A FUNERAL It doesnt take much to improve the first Death at a Funeral the flat Frank Oz-directed Britcom of 2007; a few tossed-off references to Jet and sickle-cell anemia will do it. Though the plot of Dean Craigs original script remains almost entirely intact (he receives the sole writers credit) the tweaks by star-producer Chris Rock -- who replaces the pallid ninnies of London with a mostly African-American extended clan gathered in Pasadena to say good-bye to a deceased patriarch -- yield some particularly sharp specifics. Rock plays elder son Aaron whose successful-writer younger brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) has made his riches off books titled Mamas Secret Black Hurt and Rhondas Tiny Box. Eulogizing Dad before learning about his life on the ""waaaaay down-low"" (Peter Dinklage reprises his role as the extorting secret boyfriend) Aaron refers to his fathers ""love of Golden Girls especially when it went into syndication."" But Rocks interventions cant compensate for excessive fealty to dumb gags involving watery poop and designer hallucinogens. Some cast members bring welcome controlled mania Tracy Morgan as a hypochondriacal friend of the family further hones his logorrheic outbursts. Others like Luke Wilson as a scorned suitor of Zoe Saldana are such null presences that they should have been in the original. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide)GO  FIVE EASY PIECES Jack Nicholson -- hair thinning 33 a Hollywood scenester who by 1970 had seemingly missed his shot at being a star--became just that as Bobby Dupea a Bakersfield oil-rig hand who spends free nights fooling around on his hash-house waitress girlfriend (Karen Black). Happier bowling a strike than playing Chopin Bobbys a stalled Salinger-esque prodigy who can do both. Family matters bring him back to the boyhood home on an island in Washington state where the walls -- a gallery of so-serious WASPs brooding in black-and-white -- show the family pretensions hes disappointed. Equally uncomfortable in Buck Owens denim and Bergman turtleneck Bobby relaxes his sneer for the ""cracker assholes"" hes been slumming with only to lash out at ""pompous celibates"" like the caricatured intellectuals his brother hosts (at least the crackers can have an honest good time). It was Easy Riders success that greenlit Five Easy Pieces -- but director Bob Rafelson and screenwriter Carole Eastmans film is totally human trading Riders counterculture mythopoetics for a study in the charisma of disdain (which Nicholson personifies) and how rebellion and loutishness are often indistinguishable (ditto) never excusing the pain Bobby causes. Set against the stillness of cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs luminous landscapes now restored for the films 40th anniversary its a great work of the Discover America Seventies.

Sep. 13 600pm HANDMADE NATION Sometimes its easy to forget that film culture does not exist in its own vacuum and in fact many of the issues facing filmmakers and filmgoers -- how to make things and get them out to the world how to find products beyond whats mass-marketed -- also exist in other realms. Though its excessive cheerleading is a major flaw Faythe Levines quietly uplifting Handmade Nation functions as an inspirational snapshot of current craft culture a series of scenes from a scene more than a definitive document. Knitting printmaking bookbinding jewelry clothes rug making decorative items -- anything that can be made by hand and sold by plucky retailers seems to fall under the aegis of this DIY offshoot. At one point someone calls crafting a ""movement of young women;"" though the only men around seem to be boyfriends and husbands the way in which these activities connect to ideas in modern feminism are left unexamined. The historical aspects of indie-minded crafting too both in the origins of the contemporary practice and its deeper roots are not deeply explored. Rather Levine hops from expected hip hot spots such as Portland Olympia Austin Brooklyn and Los Angeles to less likely places like Atlanta Providence Houston and Milwaukee. Unlike the art-scene doc Beautiful Losers -- which shares a bill with the Los Angeles run of Handmade Nation -- there isnt a single focal point on which to hang a narrative and so the film ends up being a patchwork of loosely stitched-together vignettes rather than a singular story. (Mark Olsen) (Downtown Indie)IN MY SLEEP Marcus (Philip Winchester) is a parasomniac It looks like hes awake but hes sleepwalking a convenient excuse for say sleeping with your best friends wife. And lo and behold when she turns up dead its hard for Marcus to maintain his friendship with said friend Justin (Tim Draxl). Sure he didnt mean to kill anyone but waking up with a bloody knife in your hand would make anyone suspect the worst. The biggest problem with Allen Wolfs thriller is that there are so few characters its immediately clear whats going on; theres simply no one to suspect besides the obvious. A slightly bigger problem is that the movies risible. To kill time while Marcus figures out how that knife got in his hand theres a Freudian subplot about the origins of Marcus sleep disorder with a repressed memory flashback that makes Hitchcocks Spellbound look like a paragon of convincing psychology plus dream sequences straight out of Glen or Glenda. Its very much an L.A. movie complete with an endless parade of heavily made-up club girls and two protagonists who work as masseuses; Wolfs camera is so enamored of their chiseled shirtless bodies that the whole thing becomes unintentionally homoerotic. It may be worth seeing just for the sight of Lacey Chabert -- ex-Party of Five kid as neighbor Becky -- attempting to interpret Marcus dreams based on what she once learned in night school. (Vadim Rizov) (Sunset 5)GO  KENNY CHESNEY SUMMER IN 3D Its as true of mega-platinum pop stars as it is of wild animals If you really want to understand their ways you must study them in their natural habitat. With that in mind Kenny Chesney Summer in 3D offers invaluable insight into the titular country sensations massive commercial appeal. Filmed in stereoscopic 3-D during Chesneys 2009 American stadium tour Kenny Chesney was overseen by 3ality Digital the same company responsible for 2008s U2 3D and both documentaries make superb use of that extra dimension to emphasize the sheer enormity and spectacle of arena shows. (After years of watching action-movie crowd scenes populated by CGI pixels its downright revelatory to experience Kenny Chesneys real live swaying throngs of humanity.) Recurring feel-good voice-over musings from the now-42-year-old artiste slow the proceedings but thankfully director Joe Thomas mostly lets his protagonist stick to his strengths which are running around a gigantic stage connecting intimately with 70000 fans and singing his hopelessly hokey country-meets-pop-meets-Jimmy Buffett populist anthems. The knock on Chesneys music has been its total lack of subtlety or nuance. Unapologetically dopey and undeniably ingratiating the supersized Kenny Chesney Summer in 3D makes a surprisingly convincing argument for big dumb likability. (Tim Grierson) (Citywide)THE LOSERS Writer Andy Diggle dedicated his snappy DC comic books ""The Losers"" to 80s screenwriting superstar Shane Black creator of the Lethal Weapon series. But in adapting ""The Losers"" for film director Sylvain White and screenwriters James Vanderbilt and Peter Berg strain to achieve the pleasurable mix of cheap laughs and expensive action that Lethal Weapon pulled off so effortlessly with the help of its stellar cast. (In a remarkable example of an actor finding his ideal role Gary Busey played LWs haywire half-cocked villain.) What theyve produced instead is a busy unsatisfying comic thriller poorly acted by a grab bag of new faces and franchise-movie refugees and set to a hard-rock sound track. The Losers opens with its eponymous team of Special Forces ops staking out a drug lords South American compound preparing for attack. The inconveniently timed arrival of a busload of children provides both an opportunity for our heroes to show their nobility and a herd of adorable sacrificial lambs to set the movies plot shuddering ahead. One smoldering teddy bear later the Losers are presumed dead -- and loaded for revenge on the shadowy figure who tried to take them out. Who is that shadowy figure? Why its Max played by Jason Patric about whom it must be said Hes no Gary Busey. While that is a great comfort Im sure to Patrics neighbors its little help to the movie which is filled with stock characters including Zoe Saldanas Aisha a sexpot in red leather pants. (Dan Kois) (Citywide) NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT PERSIAN CATS The great boundary-crosser of Iranian cinema Bahman Ghobadi purposefully steps over the line with No One Knows About Persian Cats -- a quasi-documentary highly-unofficial panorama of Teherans tenacious underground music scene and a movie that has accrued additional urgency since its first public screening at Cannes last May. Ghobadis co-writer journalist Roxana Saberi was freed from Evin prison on the eve of Persian Catss premiere; his assistant director Mehdi Pourmusa is confined there arrested last month along with filmmaker Jafar Panahi. The movies protagonists indie rockers Negar Shaghaghi and Ashkan Koshanejad have since left Iran as has Ghobadi. Shaghaghi and Koshanejad play themselves as recently imprisoned performers speeding around Teheran on the back of a motorbike in a frantic attempt to secure travel documents and recruit a rhythm section for a gig in London. The movie tours what Ghobadi calls a ""hidden world of rebel musicians"" as well as bootleg DVD and fake passport hustlers with visits to assorted crash pads and basement music clubs. Persian Cats is likable but undistinguished filmmaking and the performers are a mixed bag of metal bands traditional ensembles rap artists and buskers. None seem nearly as political as the former Czechoslovakias legendary Plastic People of the Universe; the closest thing here to a rock amp; roll manifesto is the acid trance assertion offered in English that ""dreaming is my reality."" Of course given that everything the movie shows -- including two women singing a folk song -- is illegal bravado is a given. (J. Hoberman) (Landmark Playhouse Sunset 5 Town Center)GO  OCEANS An almost miraculously photographed showcase of some of the seven seas least seen and most incredible specimens Disneys Oceans (a follow-up to last years Earth) lets its subjects speak for themselves. Timed to coincide with Earth Day the films preservationist agenda is mostly implicit in its wonder at these strangest of natures people The blanket octopus mantis shrimp and a host of protoplasmic jellyfish and bargelike whales turn their crazy-colored eyes and corrugated bellies to the camera and the message is received. The script is not quite as eloquent Not even Pierce Brosnans hushed intonation can redeem space-filling non sequiturs like ""Merely knowing these creatures exist isnt enough to tell the stories of their lives."" Taking us from the reefs of Australia and South Africas shark-infested coves to Alaskas orca feeding grounds Oceans is a jaw-dropper as a visual travelogue -- even its anthropomorphic indulgences (an ocean floor is turned into a rough neighborhood complete with trespassers and shy weirdos) are winning. Though there is a brief foray into pollution and destructive fishing Oceans ends with hope Humans cant be all bad -- after all we made high-definition cameras and learned to breathe underwater not to kill but to get closer to our fellow creatures. (Michelle Orange) (Citywide)PAPER MAN An artist-in-crisis piece run through a drab but quirk-conscious indie processor Paper Man is everything a film like Lost in Translation fought not to be. Even its moments of dark mirth and the few grace notes between its stars wind up falsified by writer/directors Kieran and Michele Mulroneys played-out tricks and plainly sentimental overtures. Deposited during the off-season at his Sag Harbor home by his surgeon wife (Lisa Kudrow) failing writer Richard (Jeff Daniels) is tasked with finishing that stubborn second novel. Joining him is a nay-saying superhero named Captain Excellent (Ryan Reynolds) an imaginary friend who is more crutch than muse. ""Have a productive week"" is Kudrows deadly refrain Richard is in the throes of a terrifying block and will conjure a jinx if theres not one handy. Enter Abby (Emma Stone) a local teen who accepts Richards bogus offer of a babysitting gig; bonding soup making and rejuvenative storytelling sessions ensue. Stone is radiantly endearing as the smart kid stuck in a shit town with shit dudes; trailed by her own personal Duckie (Kieran Culkin) she makes a host of narrative contrivances feel more natural than they should. The exorcism of Captain Excellent and reckoning of Richards marriage are even more uninspired by comparison.

Martin Lawrence left and Chris Rock in Death at a Funeral. Death at a Funeral Remake gets it dead wrong Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 16 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Death at a Funeral Directed by Neil LaBute Written by Dean Craig Starring Chris Rock Martin Lawrence Peter Dinklage Classification 14A A short three years ago Death at a Funeral was born as a spotty British farce opened to a round of thoroughly mixed reviews and soon passed on to that dusty DVD shelf in the sky where spotty movies go to expire. So why this unseemly haste to resurrect something that had definitely earned its repose? Two words Chris Rock. Seems hes not just an actor now but a producer too with enough clout to convince others that it would be a dandy idea to remake a middling black comedy with a mainly black cast. Alas its easier to admire the symmetry than the result Middling gets downgraded to muddling. Of course on such slippery slopes reputations are made. Damned if the original isnt looking like a comparative gem. The setting used to be England thus allowing the funereal farce to bubble up from a bedrock of stiff upper lips and classic reserve. Most British actors are awfully good at underplaying the overwritten - where others would mug they demitasse. But were in L.A. on this go-round and with Rock joined by the likes of Martin Lawrence and Tracy Morgan muggers abound. American comics especially black American comics have a multitude of strengths but reserve aint one of them. Here the dial starts out pointing at ""riotous"" and the farce has nothing to build on making it tough to find the funny in the frenzy. So the script keeps the plot intact but then wreaks havoc with the tone. Like the opening scene. Once again a polished hearse pulls up to a stately home and the white-gloved attendants solemnly heft the casket into the front parlour where the grieving son opens the lid to discover that its a ... wrong delivery. However this time the son is Chris Rock who cant resist stepping out of bereaved character to punch the sight-gag with a shouted ad-lib ""Hey its not Burger King. You cant just mess up my order."" Funerals are a great mine of dark comedy but only when theres darkness to violate - this one begins light and bright. It looks like a wake but feels like a wedding. Consequently when the mourners assemble along with the outrageous shtick we never get to enjoy that delicious sense of heresy of snickering through a sacred ritual. Nope someones dead yet no one appears to care - theyre way too busy trying to be hilarious to waste time being sad. And the strain shows. Good grief but making merry can be hard. From there the narrative nuttiness is recycled without much change. Its got the same pair of bickering brothers (Rock and Lawrence); the same mislabeled bottle of little white pills dispensing not Valium but really trippy acid that prompts straitlaced relatives to strip naked and shake their booty on rooftops; the same crotchety uncle with the loose tongue and looser bowels the latter guaranteed to put the toilet in the humour; the same strange little man (Peter Dinklage again) with the surprising little secret; and at the climax the same weeping and gnashing emanating from the one place in any funeral that should be a repository of deathly quiet. So much sameness yet so fewer laughs although apparently untroubled by the disparity director Neil LaBute seems pretty much content to let this soul train drive itself. As for the differences I dont recall any of the original Brits busting a move in the dining room and bellowing ""The catfish nuggets are to die for"" but perhaps memory fails me. If so my failure has plenty of company here. Still lets not speak ill of the departed and instead just depart - certainly nothing becomes Death at a Funeral like the leaving of it.

Starring Chris Rock Zoe Saldana James Marsden Tracy Morgan Luke Wilson Martin Lawerence Danny Glover Director Neil LaBute Running time 133 Release Opened Apr 16 2010  Editorial Review Review Death at a FuneralBy Ann HornadayFriday April 16 2010Danny Glover hurls his own vulgar verbal ordnance in ""Death at a Funeral"" Neil LaButes adaptation of the 2007 British comedy. Glover plays Uncle Russell a cantankerous old coot in a wheelchair who swears a blue streak and has nary a kind word for anybody at the funeral of his brother Edward. A close cousin of the swearing-kid shtick the swearing-old-man shtick here is played strictly for cheap lazy laughs. But its entirely in keeping with the original movie whose antic -- if creaky -- idea of humor included an errant corpse wincingly graphic bathroom humor sophomoric references to homosexuality and a man tripping on LSD while traipsing naked on a rooftop.In the current version of ""Death at a Funeral"" that dosed character is played by James Marsden who as he did in ""Enchanted"" and ""Hairspray"" threatens to steal the whole show in a cheekily funny physical performance. He rounds out an appealing cast that includes Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence as the competitive sons of the deceased Zoe Saldana as Marsdens characters fiancee and Tracy Morgan as the family friend who comes in for the films most punishing sight gag (or more accurately sight-and-smell gag involving the aforementioned hideous bathroom humor).Fans of the broad slapstick and ludicrous farce that propelled the original ""Death at a Funeral"" will be well served by the remake although its a mystery why LaBute -- a brilliant playwright with a bold acidly satiric voice-- would be compelled to direct someone elses script (both were written by Dean Craig). Hes clearly a man who thinks in words not images as the films undistinguished sepulchral visual sense attests.Still if for the most part ""Death at a Funeral"" is as tame as the tasteful parlor where most of its action takes place it manages to explode one taboo in casting mostly black actors in roles originally played by whites. (Rock who produced ""Death at a Funeral"" did the same thing with ""I Think I Love My Wife"" a remake of the 1972 French movie ""Chloe in the Afternoon."") Its a simple but important evolution for a medium in which for too long race-neutral stories have been cast only in one color. Black may not be the new white but ""Death at a Funeral"" offers modest hope for a new normal that happens to look a lot more like life.Contains profanity and drug content.

Possibly setting a speed record for a remake ""Death at a Funeral"" takes a sporadically funny little-seen (at least here) 2007 British slapstick comedy and faithfully restages it with a B-list American cast. Both versions were written by Britains Dean Craig with the original helmed by American Frank Oz. Craig has basically changed only the dialogue for the California-set remake efficiently if impersonally directed by playwright-director Neil LaBute with an ensemble headed by a relatively restrained Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence. Rock plays Aaron who is supervising the funeral of his father at the home he shares with his mother (Loretta Devine) and his frustrated wife (Regina Hall). Aaron is seething over all the attention given to his younger brother Ryan (Lawrence) a best-selling author who is visiting from New York City. Especially after Ryan informs Aaron he cant pay for half the funeral. But it turns out thats the least of Aarons problems. His cousin (Zoe Saldana) has accidentally given her fiance (James Marsden) a hallucinogen and before long hes knocked over the coffin spilling the dearly departed on the living room floor. The appearance of the cousins ex (Luke Wilson whose career seems to be winding down faster than a fake Rolex) at the festivities makes the drug-addled fiance so jealous that hes soon perched naked on the roof. Meanwhile inside a height-challenged gay man (Peter Dinklage the only holdover from the original cast) is trying to blackmail Aaron and his brother. He wants 300000 or hell show Mom an incriminating picture of him with the dead man. A preview audience the other night laughed every time Lawrence (who is chasing a jail-bait friend of the family) did a double-take at the photo and joined Rock in an increasingly cringe-worthy series of gay-panic jokes (Columbus Short as Saldanas brother gets the worst of these). But the audience was really roaring when Aarons clueless friend (Tracy Morgan) had a messy accident while placing a crotchety wheelchair-bound uncle (Danny Glover) on a toilet a bit too slowly. Two other veterans in the cast Keith David and Ron Glass are more successful at holding onto their dignity. Its because of a superior cast that this version of ""Death at a Funeral"" is the rare comedy remake thats funnier than the original however slightly. Personally though Im not sure it was worth the effort.

"Death at a Funeral | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; death-at-a-funeral_2058 ) Death at a Funeral (United States 2010) April 15 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Death at a Funeral addresses the question of whether a British comedy featuring a bunch of white guys can translate into an American setting with a group of (primarily) black characters. Since the answer is ""yes"" this says something about the flexibility of the premise and the universality of the jokes. When gauging the appeal of the humor its fair to remark that theres something for everyone. The comedy runs the gamut from low-brow to high-brow from physical to intellectual from gross-out bathroom hijinks to the differences between a minister and a priest. The biggest laughs however come from the bawdiest moments arguing that Death at a Funeral has its roots more in Benny Hill than in Noel Coward. The existence of this version of Death at a Funeral is a curiosity since it doesnt fit into a typical category. Remakes usually come in two flavors an ""old"" (pre-1990) film being updated for a young audience or a recent foreign-language offering translated into English. Death at a Funeral however is a remake of a 2007 British film. The original was not only in English but was directed by an American (Frank Oz) and it hasnt so much been re-imagined as it has been re-situated. This is essentially the same movie as its precursor only with different actors playing the parts and slight tweaks to the dialogue. The major jokes are all the same as are the plot points. The writer Brit Dean Craig handled both scripts. When Oz helmed the 2007 incarnation he came to the project with a reputation for exceptional comedic timing - an asset because he was working with a cast better-known for drama than for comedy. Things are a little different here. Neil LaBute has built a resume of darker pictures; even his comedies rarely garner big laughs because of the bleak nature of the material. (His best work remains his debut the scathing In the Company of Men.) Although Death at a Funeral has a grim edge LaButes naturally glum tendencies are somewhat counterbalanced by the casting of several recognizable funny men including Chris Rock Martin Lawrence and Tracy Morgan. If Death at a Funeral 2010 succeeds where Death at a Funeral 2007 did not it will be because of casting and marketing. The earlier film was a mainstream comedy offered primarily to art-house audiences - not the right demographic for some of the extreme scenes. This one is being sold to those who frequent Tyler Perry movies which although limiting seems like a smart approach considering how successful Perrys films are at the box office. Death at a Funeral transpires expectedly at a funeral. The deceased is the father of Californian Aaron (Chris Rock) and his successful brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) who has flown in from New York. The single womanizing Ryan is the familys luminary while the strait-laced Aaron is castigated by his mother (Loretta Devine) for failing to have a child - a situation Aarons wife Michelle (Regina Hall) is trying to rectify. Things dont start out well on the day of the funeral - the coffin contains the wrong body. Once that has been sorted out the guests start arriving. They include Aarons cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) who has arrived with her fiancA(c) Oscar (James Marsden). Oscar is not himself however having accidentally taken a hallucinogenic drug before embarking upon the trip. Mismatched buddies Norman (Tracy Morgan) and Derek (Luke Wilson) are there as well. The former is obsessing over a skin rash while the latter carries a torch for Elaine. They arrive in the company of crotchety old Uncle Russell (Danny Glover) who is never at a loss for a profane or inappropriate comment. And who is the dwarf (Peter Dinklage reprising the part he played in the earlier incarnation) hanging out near the coffin? The characters with the highest amusement value are the same as those in the British incarnation the whacked-out Oscar the high-strung Norman the foul-mouthed Uncle Russell and the little person. This provides Tracy Morgan with an opportunity to outshine his veteran compatriots Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence. Although both have their moments necessity restrains them. Rock in particular is low-key since hes essentially playing a straight man. Meanwhile although Marsden is effective as the acid-ingesting Oscar his ""naked man on the roof"" sequences are impeded by the occasionally awkward editing required by the actors decision to use a body double (not an issue with Alan Tudyk who did his own nudity in the original.) Despite being relocated and re-cast Death at a Funeral remains a funny motion picture. Those few who saw the original probably have no reason to experience the Americanized version since it offers little thats new (with the possible exception of Danny Glovers Lethal Weapon allusion ""Im getting too old for this shit"") and some of the spontaneous and surprising jokes dont work as well on a repeat viewing. For everyone else however Death at a Funeral does what a good comedy is supposed to do generate laughter. The humor gradient is lopsided - the second half which builds comedic momentum is significantly funnier than the first half which is mostly set-up. Still any such unevenness aside the overall impression is one of enjoyability.

Death At A Funeral Born-again Brit comedy more fun in America | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDeath At A Funeral Born-again Brit comedy more fun in AmericaA remake of Death at a Funeral would seem to be the ultimate act of flogging a dead hearse.Martin Lawrence left Tracy Morgan and Chris Rock surround Peter Dinklage who crosses the pond to reprise his role in Death at a Funeral.  (Phil Bray)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 15 2010 (out of 4)A remake of Death at a Funeral would seem to be the ultimate act of flogging a dead hearse. Wonder of wonders this revived Death doesnt just stagger it sprints. Its a textbook example of how humour is all in the telling.The 2007 British original by Frank Oz has barely begun to molder in its DVD crypt and it wasnt all that hilarious to begin with -- and neither are funerals need it be said. Screenwriter Dean Craigs comedy of manners was a zombie march of jokes about naughty sex reckless drug-taking and incontinent bowels. Hopes werent high for the Hollywood version despite the presence of the occasionally brilliant Neil LaBute at the helm. Craig once again is credited with the script but he worked his photocopier more than his word processor. Article Continued BelowPlot tweaks are minimal (alas the toilet jokes remain) and one key actor is the same Peter Dinklage reprises the role of a surprise guest at a family funeral who reveals plot-altering details about the dearly departed. The changes are mostly cultural a shift from the English countryside to California and the use of mostly African-American comedians who are led by Chris Rock at his most restrained and acerbic. There is method to the Pond-hopping madness. LaBute wisely cast comic actors rather than actors attempting to be comic. Timing and delivery are paramount in comedy all the more so when the material is as daft as this. Rock is Aaron eldest son of a Pasadena family that has just lost its patriarch. If its not enough to be mourning his dad Aaron also has to cope with a incompetent mortician an ovulating spouse (Regina Hall) an hysterical mother (Loretta Devine) and a showboating younger brother (Martin Lawrence). His bro Ryan is the biggest thorn in his side Ryan is a celebrity author while Aaron can barely pen the eulogy nobody really wants him to deliver. A crew of cut-ups help put the fun in this funeral. Danny Glover gamely takes the role of the incontinent uncle in the wheelchair a man of foul temper and fouler bathroom habits. Tracy Morgan once again plays the moron this time as the hypochondriac cousin unhappily charged with minding the bad uncle. Zoe Saldana is the straight woman niece to the deceased demonstrating her talents outside the sci-fi of Avatar and Star Trek. On the vanilla side of the comedy ledger theres James Marsden as a guest who accidentally trips on acid (hes the movies welcome scene-stealer) a gone-to-seed Luke Wilson as an obnoxious ex-boyfriend and the aforementioned Dinklage once again nimbly playing the role of the highly unwanted attendee. In the British production a similar parade of actors gave the movie the feel of badly staged drawing-room farce with movements as stiff as those of the casket occupant. LaButes American take busts out giving the comics room to improvise and providing some life to the proceedings. Its fun to watch Rock in a role originally given to an uptight Brit while Glover normally the serious man in his movies gets to fly his freak flag for a change. Lawrence hits the sweet spot as an aging playboy whose isnt as cool as he thinks he is. The two versions of Death at a Funeral offer film students and cultural scientists an opportunity to closely compare British and American humor. The former is more cerebral and reactive the latter more physical and in-your-face. In this case though only one is really funny and its the one where they dont serve tea along with the sympathy.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday April 15 2010 326 PM Title Death at a Funeral You must really love a movie if you decide to remake it just three years after its release. But unless you also intend to improve upon the first attempt whats the point?When Chris Rock saw Frank Ozs 2007 British farce ""Death at a Funeral"" he knew he wanted to redo it with a primarily African-American cast. Unfortunately his plan doesnt seem to have gone much further than that.On the plus side the new version boasts an outstanding collection of comic actors including Rock (who also produced) Martin Lawrence and Tracy Morgan. So its especially disappointing that nobody including director Neil LaBute seems to know what to do with them.Rock plays Aaron an upstanding guy determined to keep his fathers funeral from falling apart. This means appeasing a houseful of needy relatives including his melodramatic mother (Loretta Devine) baby-obsessed wife (Regina Hall) and playboy brother (Lawrence).Meanwhile his fathers lover (Peter Dinklage) wants hush money; his cousin (Zoe Saldana) is dodging an infatuated ex (Luke Wilson) while caring for her mistakenly drugged fiance (James Marsden); and his uncle (Danny Glover) has what might delicately be termed a gastric disorder.It all adds up to a very frantic day but despite the return of original screenwriter Dean Craig not a consistently funny one. In fairness there are moments of outright hilarity mostly from a going-for-broke Marsden. And several supporting cast members step up nicely including Columbus Short as a troublemaking cousin.But why doesnt Morgan get to let loose? Where are Lawrences slow burns? And surely Rock even stuck playing the straight man can still make us laugh?When it becomes apparent these things wont happen the movie starts feeling like a lost opportunity.Meanwhile rather than fusing his cast into a cohesive unit LaBute seems overwhelmed by so much talent shooting individual scenes as if they were separate sketches to be tacked together.This isnt Rocks first remake of a foreign title; in 2007 he restyled Eric Rohmers sophisticated ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" into the clunky ""I Think I Love My Wife."" Perhaps he should just re-introduce the initial films to an American audience and then get to work on some original projects instead.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence headline as the deceaseds respectively dutiful and prodigal sons a would-be writer and his successful-novelist sibling.The all-star mourners include widow Loretta Devine curmudgeonly brother Danny Glover loopy nephew Tracy Morgan gorgeous niece Zoe Saldana and James Marsden as her manic beau. Much of the films humor comes from the fact that she gives him a pill labeled Valium that turns out to be a hallucinogen cooked up by her pharmacist brother.Peter Dinklage reprises his role as the patriarchs special friend who shares the deceaseds secret with his startled sons. Look carefully at the dead mans study and the secret is not so much of a surprise.Before Death the most mystifying of multiplex paradoxes was that Chris Rock the funniest man in America is not major box-office but Chris Tucker a minor talent with a motormouth is.Yet when you see Rock uptight and cerebral opposite Lawrence loose and physical you begin to see why. On stage as a stand-up comic Rock prowls the stage like a lion about to squeeze laughs from his prey. On screen here the rubber-limbed comic looks constrained as though cast in concrete.Still with that comically hoarse delivery Rock furnishes Deaths funniest one-liners. He lets his costars deliver the slapstick goods.Wild-eyed Morgan with his manic patter and zonked-out Marsden as the hallucinating beau wring every possible laugh from this door-slamming coffin-dropping secret-spilling acid-tripping farce briskly directed by LaBute. The square-jawed Marsden best known as the prince in Enchanted is increasingly hilarious as the tripper capable of expressing delight horror melancholy and transcendence in the same nanosecond.Verdict? Mixed. Loved the slapstick winced at the toilet humor and mourned that the female performers were given so little to do. Funeral is funnier the second time around.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickey phillynews.com. Read her blog at www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl.

Photo Phil Bray Screen Gems Movie review Death at a Funeral 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Death at a Funeral Comedy. Directed by Neil LaBute. With Chris Rock Martin Lawrence Tracy Morgan James Marsden Zoe Saldana Peter Dinklage Danny Glover. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You can get away with almost anything in a farce except failing to be funny and thats what kills ""Death at a Funeral."" It isnt the crudity or broadness of the humor that does it in but a simple lack of comic chops in the writing. Consider that one of the main running gags is that a character has unknowingly ingested a powerful hallucinogen and spends most of the movie mugging making stupid comments and standing naked on the roof of a house where a funeral is taking place. The movies MO is taking an unfunny joke - like its big scatological gross-out scene - and beating it to death. One guy whacked out on drugs isnt enough so the movie offers a second a gay blackmailer whos played for laughs. ""Death at a Funeral"" is a remake of a 2007 British movie of the same title a black comedy about shenanigans erupting at the funeral of a family patriarch. This version directed by Neil LaBute of all people is relocated to Southern California and given a racially mixed cast. An oddball assortment of family and friends gathers for the funeral at the home of the deceased mans eldest son played by Chris Rock in a somewhat subdued version of his crabby persona. The plot is simple The funeral keeps getting delayed by outrageous incidents. Involved in those incidents are Martin Lawrence as the Rock characters brother Tracy Morgan as a hapless nitwit Danny Glover as the dead mans splenetic brother Luke Wilson as a family friend and Peter Dinklage (who played the same role in the original film) as a most unwelcome guest. James Marsden plays the naked guy tripping on acid and I bet hell rue the day he accepted the role. There are wife and girlfriend roles for Regina Hall and Zoe Saldana. Theres a lot of talent here but not much to show for it. Detailing the story is useless - the whole idea is to lance the solemnity of funerals with lots of comic mayhem but the humor is rote lurching from nasty to sitcommy. Toward the end things take a jarringly sentimental turn when Rock delivers a eulogy but then the film reverts to dumb-gag mode. I think I forgot to mention that theres also jailbait humor. LaBute a specialist in edgy material has done some interesting work (""In the Company of Men"" ""Nurse Betty""). But he hit a low point with his 2006 ""The Wicker Man"" remake and certainly hasnt redeemed himself here. Advisory Language drug content and sexual humor.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDeath at a Funeral  (out of four) StarsChris Rock Martin Lawrence Zoe Saldana James MarsdenDirector Neil LaButeDistributor Screen GemsRating R for language drug content and sexual humorRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY No matter how many remakes Hollywood shoves down our throats it doesnt make reheated fare any more palatable. Death at a Funeral is the latest American rehash of a story set in a foreign country in this case an insipid redux of a 2007 British film. The original a lively farce in the land of stiff upper lips about a family that gathers to honor a patriarch endures outrageous events and exposes awkward secrets made a scant 8 million during its American run. The new film starring Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence and set in Los Angeles will likely make more on its opening day. Rock plays Aaron a responsible son whose fathers funeral is held at their family home. His skirt-chasing novelist brother Ryan (Lawrence) has flown in from New York for the service which is interrupted by all manner of wacky chaos. MORE James Marsden tunes in turns on for Death TRAILER See if Death agrees with you Aarons cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) is engaged to the affable Oscar (James Marsden) but Elaines father (Ron Glass) does not approve. In the original Alan Tudyks chemically induced silliness as the fiance was hilarious. Marsden is also funny in this role adding inventive touches and making the character his own. Still the original is the better of the two films. It showed droll restraint where the remake goes overboard. Loony surprises that seemed bizarrely amusing in the arch British setting dont feel as nutty in L.A. Rock is likably humorous and has some chemistry with Lawrence who is low-key in his bespectacled role. But theres none of the distinctive biting presence that theyve brought to other roles. In fact many in the cast seem as if theyre simply going through the motions. Peter Dinklage the only actor in both versions reprises his role as a mysterious stranger but he seemed to enjoy it more the first time around. Some parts seem downright miscast. Luke Wilson is dully unconvincing as Derek a former suitor of Elaines and Danny Glover is too youthful for the part of a crotchety old uncle. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that playwright/filmmaker Neil LaBute chose to direct. Known for edgy films like the offbeat dark comedy Nurse Betty (2000) this slapstick and toothless business is hardly his forte. The only death at this funeral was that of a good movie.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A well-made farce is like a catapult. It has to gather up a payload of respectable characters and fling them headlong into bedlam. ""Death at a Funeral"" has a handful of uproarious bits but overall it functions like the Acme Corp. catapult employed by Wile E. Coyote dropping a boulder on top of the cast. This is the first comedy from Neil LaBute an acclaimed director of drama and he doesnt seem to have the hang of it. Adapted from the 2007 English comedy of the same name ""Death"" features Chris Rock as Aaron the son handling all the arrangements for his fathers funeral. Hes resentful that his brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) a successful novelist wont split the expenses even though he flew first-class from New York to Los Angeles for the occasion. Mom flagrantly favors Ryan while casting a cold eye on Aarons wife Michelle whose failure to produce grandchildren she sees as sheer obstinacy. Since Michelles biological clock is about to strike midnight she wants hubby to get cracking even as the mourners arrive. Among them are cousin Elaine and her boyfriend Oscar (Zoe Saldana and James Marsden making a lovely couple). Hes not eager for another encounter with her cantankerous dad so she slips him a Valium. The pill is actually a designer hallucinogen cooked up by her pharmacologist brother Jeff (Columbus Short) and Oscar is soon cackling and prancing like a goony bird. Also arriving are Elaines annoying old flame Derek (Luke Wilson) who is sure he can argue her back into loving him. With his buddy Norman (Tracy Morgan) hes been assigned to transport ornery Uncle Russell (Danny Glover) from the rest home. Normans full-blown germ phobia and the wheelchair-bound retirees incontinence set the pair on a scatological collision course. Add to the mix dear departed Dads very close friend Frank (Peter Dinklage reprising his role from the original film) who has a stash of scandalous photos hes willing to sell for 30000. The story plods then drifts a bit then plods some more. The problem is that the characters suffer from an unfortunate lack of personality. Rocks Aaron is envious and has a beard. Saldanas Elaine is pretty and has gumption. Morgans Norman is a hypochondriac and a jabber-jaw. Thats all. Admittedly some funny things happen to them but the film would be stronger if the players had distinctive traits that drove them toward aptly absurd situations. The actor who fares best surprisingly is Marsden who is distancing himself nicely from the superhero/pretty-boy roles that casting directors want to box him into. Hes shown impressive comic chops in ""Sex Drive"" and ""Enchanted"" and hes wonderfully off-kilter as the drug-addled Oscar talking to garden statues and winding toilet paper around his head. He acts as if hes receiving radio transmissions nobody else can hear. Its a shame the rest of the cast couldnt get on the same crazy wavelength.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When it was announced that Neil LaBute of all people was going to make an American version of Frank Ozs British farce Death At A Funeral only three years after its release folks wondered how LaBute would update the film for contemporary audiences. Would moviegoers in the Obama era be able to relate to a relic of George W. Bushs second term? Sure enough producer-star Chris Rock delivers a lot of soon-to-be-dated pop-culture references (that Amy Winehouse quip will undoubtedly zing for generations) but for the most part LaBute simply ratchets up the volume and raunch. Like Ozs original on Red Bull Death At A Funeral centers on a patriarchs funeral where dark secrets are uncovered and long-simmering resentments come to a boil among his colorful relatives. Frustrated writer Rock bitterly resents the fame money and irresponsible lifestyle of his flashy older brother Martin Lawrence. Family friend Luke Wilson tries to win back ex-girlfriend Zoe Saldana from her fiance James Marsden who has accidentally taken a powerful hallucinogen. Meanwhile Peter Dinklage (reprising his role from the original) threatens to derail the proceedings by revealing his secret gay past with the newly deceased. Rock acquits himself nicely as the responsible brother and resident straight man but everyone else in the cast has apparently been advised to mug shamelessly and yell their lines as loudly as possible especially Tracy Morgan and Loretta Devine as the dead mans grandchildren-craving widow. Death At A Funeral has two primary tones broad and Tracy Morgan-covered-in-Danny Glovers-crap super-loud. Ozs original prominently featured Dinklage bursting out of a coffin and a hallucinogen-addled man running amok in his birthday suit but it was blessed with the Ernst Lubitsch touch compared to LaButes ham-fisted Comic View take on the material. Glover sacrifices his dignity as a hateful profane diarrhea-prone old crank; though he may profess otherwise hes exactly the right age for this sassy-old-man shit. Marsden introduces a welcome note of daft innocence as a tripping space cadet who treats the world like a fascinating new toy but all the pandering and flailing slapstick seldom leads to laughs. Hopefully the inevitable 2013 Hispanic remake of Death At A Funeral will fix all the tonal issues and restore the series to the modest amusement of the original.

""Death at a Funeral"" is a strained mirthless remake of a comedy that wasnt terribly funny to begin with. More or less transferring Frank Ozs same-titled 2007 British farce to a middle-class African-American household with little appreciable gain in laughs this work-for-hire from once-provocative helmer Neil LaBute should have little trouble outpacing its predecessor which dug up about 9 million Stateside. Cast names including Chris Rock Tracy Morgan and Martin Lawrence will lend the pallid Screen Gems item some crossover potential. Not three years in the grave Ozs original played on the tension between stiff-upper-lip British reserve and the ghastly shenanigans that erupted -- quite literally in the case of one elderly characters bowels -- at that most solemn of family occasions a funeral. But this slavishly faithful update again written by Dean Craig (who seems to have exhumed his original script and added a few jokes about Louis Armstrong and R. Kelly) fails to tap into anything culturally specific or uniquely funny in its Pasadena setting or its theoretically looser livelier black cast. And because the characters are so flat we couldnt care less about the blows to their sense of propriety. Proceeding from the notion that outrageous situations and dilemmas presented with minimal flair preparation or timing will yield automatic hilarity ""Death at a Funeral"" kicks off with the delivery of the wrong corpse (cut to face of dead Asian in coffin) at the funeral in question. Its the first of many setbacks for poor Aaron (Rock) whos struggling to compose his fathers eulogy and also has to deal with an emotional mother (Loretta Devine) an ovulating wife (Regina Hall) and an annoying younger brother (Lawrence) who has the successful writing career Aarons always dreamed of. Rounding out the roster of insensitive/neurotic/foul-mouthed funeral attendees are Aarons cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) frantically trying to hide the fact that her fiance Oscar (James Marsden) has ingested some powerful hallucinogens; hapless family friend Norman (Morgan) who gets stuck wheeling around crotchety Uncle Russell (Danny Glover); and weirdest of all a diminutive man in a leather jacket (an amusing Peter Dinklage who played the same role in the Brit version) who comes forward to disclose an alarming secret -- thats not much of a secret thanks to the films trailer and Pamp;A -- about the deceased. Spinning into laboriously plotted chaos (with much busy cross-cutting by editor Tracey Wadmore-Smith) pic seems predicated on the idea that stale gags will somehow improve with repetition. Thus Devines weeping widow must take every opportunity no matter how inappropriate to mention her daughter-in-laws barren condition; nincompoop Norman must inform every guest of his unpleasant skin condition; and doped-up Oscar must get higher and higher until he winds up naked on the roof. While LaButes previous pic for Screen Gems ""Lakeview Terrace"" managed to infuse a thriller template with some of his trademark barbed misanthropy ""Death at a Funeral"" may be the most anonymous commercial product yet to bear the directors signature. (Given how central race relations were to ""Terrace"" its odd that he couldnt mine any fresh comic tension from a movie in which the three white characters played by Marsden Dinklage and Luke Wilson are the minority.) The hollowness of the sentimental life-affirming ending is just about the only thing to suggest LaButes presence behind the camera. Rock one of 11 producers on the project undercuts his comedic strengths by casting himself as the Henry Fonda-like straight man.
