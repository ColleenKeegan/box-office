"Gravity - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Gravity Posted by Christy Lemire on October 5 2013 68 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong language. Running time 91 minutes. Four stars out of four. Believe the hype ""Gravity"" is as jaw-droppingly spectacular as youve heard -- magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone. This is not hyperbole This is the best film Ive seen so far this year. I seriously have no idea how Alfonso Cuaron made this movie. I mean I have some idea and it involves many many talented people in front of many many computers. But the fact that we genuinely feel like were watching George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in space -- floating tumbling hurtling clinging to each other for life -- is just a mind-bogglingly impressive thing. We forget that these are A-list stars and become totally immersed in their characters struggle to survive. My good friend Justin Chang at Variety put it best when he said ""See it in 3D on the biggest screen you can find."" If theres an IMAX theater near you get there. If there isnt an IMAX theater hop in your car and drive to one. I saw it in plain-old 3-D and was blown away -- I cant even imagine how much more mesmerizing it would have been in IMAX. ""Gravity"" does everything right in ways that are both big and small. Its beautiful and horrifying detailed yet enormous specific yet universally relatable. Yes its about how space can be a wondrous and unforgiving place but its also about earthly human truths love and loss perseverance and redemption. Youre sure to find yourself reacting viscerally in some way perhaps in many ways. I was surprised to find myself on the verge on tears nearly the whole time so moved was I by the awesomeness of the images then by the intimate dreamlike way in which these two characters reveal themselves to each other and ultimately by the sheer force of will in the face of impossible peril. But ""Gravity"" is primarily an incredibly intense experience 90 minutes of tight jaw crossed legs and clenched fists. The story itself which director Cuaron wrote with his son Jonas may strike you as formulaic at first but it will startle you again and again. It begins with a bravura single take that seems to go on forever A speck in the distance set against an infinite blackness grows closer and closer until its clear that were looking at actual people 600 km above Earth working on the Hubble Telescope. (The sound design by the way is sublime; its also a nice touch that Ed Harris star of ""Apollo 13"" and ""The Right Stuff"" provides the voice of Mission Control.) Bullocks Dr. Ryan Stone is an accomplished medical engineer making her first shuttle mission. She is all business -- focusing hard on doing everything right understandably nervous in this foreign and complex scenario. Bullock does so much in this film simply through breathing voice modulation and subtle facial expressions; long before things get gnarly we have a great feeling for who she is. On the other end of the spectrum is Clooneys Matt Kowalski a veteran astronaut making his final mission. ""Matt its been a privilege"" his longtime colleagues tell him. This means something terrible surely will befall him. Kowalski glides around the telescope with a jet-pack strapped to his back glibly joking with Mission Control playing country songs telling tall tales. ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" he kids as usual. Clooney is doing Danny Ocean in space his rich voice oozing charisma and a wry worldliness. But his cool confidence becomes crucial once this seemingly routine operation turns ugly -- which it does in a hurry. Debris from a neighboring space station is flying toward them forcing them to abort the mission and climb back into the shuttle. But the crew members dont all make it in time leaving Stone and Kowalski floating in the darkness once a storm of metal and mass arrives. Cuarons use of 3-D is particularly strong in these massive action sequences -- its flinch-inducing -- but he also finds the delicacy in the technology in quieter moments. Suddenly all these two have is each other; tethered together cut off from Earth running out of time and oxygen they search for a way back home and hope to avoid the next wave of debris. ""Gravity"" often feels the a dazzlingly high-tech play on film with two expert actors playing off each other brilliantly. And just when it seems as if things couldnt possibly get any worse ... they do. I wouldnt dream of telling you where ""Gravity"" goes from here as it evolves and reveals its characters resourcefulness and resolve. I will say this is the performance of Bullocks career as she rises to the challenge of conveying a history and an arc in the smallest of ways and the tightest of circumstances. Like the film as a whole its a breathtaking thing to behold.

Nicely done I enjoyed the affirmation Reply November 3 2013  by  John     Worst movie I have seen in a long time. I should have been paid to see this movie. I read all these great reviews the real truth with real people opinions will be read on Redbox. I give it 1/2 star. Reply November 9 2013  by  Jon     All I can say is that I truly feel sad for you that you were not able to appreciate this film on the level that so many of us have. I can assure you that the reviews are real and that some movies just dont strike the same chord with everyone. That being said just because you didnt enjoy it doesnt mean everyone is ""lying"" about their experience. Reply March 6 2014  by  Alan J. Oliver     Because the majority think it is a great movie does not mean it is. By what criterion is it judged?..Lets ask for starters whats important 1. A Good Story / 2. Good Actors / 3. Credibility / 4 Technically / 5 Music. Well there really was not much of a story really - George Clooney was lightweight who gave up his life as though he was going down to the pub for a drink. The story was not credible it you think about it...damaged space spaces stations the chances of Sandra getting back to Earth was fantasy and doubtful.. Finally Technically it was first class and it was that that clearly carried the audiences. In my book it does not rate as a movie worth 97%. I suggest you all go and see The Return of Martin Guerre (French) Now that is worth 97% because it has so many ingredients which make it a super film. Reply March 18 2014  by  aristofan     nice. August 1 2014  by  llamas     My criteria for a good film are 1) Interesting layered characters (these characters were bland) 2) a well-written and creative script (this script was AWFUL) and 3) a thought-provoking story (bland generic story in Gravity). I guess the kinds of people who loved this movie are captivated by suspense and good graphics both of which this movie had but neither of which is enough to make me interested in a movie. August 1 2014  by  llamas     Yup I agree. The script was horrendously cheesy and cliche the entire story was lucky coincidence after ""no way thats impossible"". Far too unbelievable and unrealistic and while Bullock did a good job I found her character pretty generic. The only thing I enjoyed about the film was the footage/CG which got old after about 15 minutes. Reply October 5 2013  by  Jim Stone     I couldnt have said ANY of that any better than you have here I got the spectacular opportunity to see it last night and I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through It was intense mesmerizing spectacular imaginative and a great change of pace from all the other cookie cutter movies out as of late I cant wait to see it again... Only next time will be at an imax. Reply October 5 2013  by  Russell Dee     Amazing movie The best movie of the year by far. This movie is so good that it would have been the best movie of the year in almost any past year. I think that technically especially the visuals its as groundbreaking as any movie the past 50 years except Avatar. This movie is spectacular. A few of the concepts seemed far-fetched but ultimately it is a science fiction movie. I saw it at a Cinetopia that was just built last year. This theater is as up-to-date as possible and it has all the bells and whistles. It has the largest screens in the entire Pacific Northwest. The screens are larger than IMAX screens in the local area. The sound at this theater is as good as it gets. I saw it in 3d. I paid 17 to see it last night. Im thinking about going to see it again today at the same theater. To those of you who dont have an IMAX nearby I think you should drive to one because this movie belongs on a giant screen in 3d with impeccable sound. You would not believe what a spectacle this movie is at the new Cinetopia where I saw it. Below is a link to the theater where I saw it at and if you live within 50 miles of Vancouver Washington you really should consider seeing it at this theater because I have and I assure you that there is no way a regular theater could do justice to this movie. Even IMAX wont display the movie as well as this new Cinetopia does and I live blocks away from this splendid theater. http//www.cinetopia.com/location/vancmall.htm Reply October 5 2013  by  Russell Dee     When I say that this movie would have been the best movie of the year in almost every past year I sincerely mean that I truly believe that this movie as I saw it at the new Cinetopia where I saw it would be the best movie of the year in at least 40 of the past 50 years. This movie is really something special. And its nice to see Americas sweetheart Sandra Bullock finally get a great role. I really think that most of the movies shes starred in in the past were too shallow so its really great to see her get to star in one of the great movies of the past decades. Reply October 5 2013  by  MIchael     Christy Wow What a beautifully written review. Your words are my feelings exactly. The emotions I felt while watching ""Gravity"" were amazing. A truly emotional wild ride. So proud of Sandra Bullock. She amazed me. I truly hope ""Gravity"" wins many Oscars this year and not just technical awards. How about breaking through the glass ceiling and awarding a Sci-Fi film Best Picture. Best Director. Best Actress and Best Score. Then give it all those technical awards to boot. Reply October 21 2013  by  Randy smith     YES YES AND YES Reply October 6 2013  by  Ben     And the soundtrack perfectly compliments the visuals. Reply October 6 2013  by  Douglas Roy     Ill keep this short and sweet. I agree with all the deserved accolades both here and on other media outlets. Be forewarned If youre one affected by dizzying visuals or swirling images that may be disorienting be ready to take a grip on those armrests. Along with the superb acting and technical achievement the accompanying soundtrack underscores the dramatic tension and resolve. Reply October 6 2013  by  aaron     What are you all on? This movie was awful. It was completely ridiculous American Hollywood shlock. The dialogue was dreadful the action utterly implausible the paper-thin quasi-philosophy trite at best zero emotional engagement - its just expensive crap. Children of Men is a masterpiece but he just completely sold his soul to make cah. Reply October 6 2013  by  MIchael     I think you need to see it again. Your cynism amazes. Reply October 13 2013  by  Janelle Seavey     Thank God; I was only a few swooning commenters in when I got to yours Aaron. I saw it last night. I then stayed awake the rest of the night pondering the flatline that was tracing across my inner-movie appreciation monitor screen. Granted I consider myself a purist in many mediums; you know old-fashioned-all-human being-naturally-produced-CG-free stuff. Yes this puts me in the bitter old curmudgeon camp..except it isnt what I am. I thrill at the chance to feel raw anxiety at the hands of a movies content to live vicariously if only for a couple hours through the characters and their trials and tribulations. This movie left me living vicariously through George Clooneys soon-to-be disengaged tether carabiner....only in this situation Id live that moment much sooner than it actually happened. Oh no doubt the Oscars will probably be shown in 3-D hosted a by space-suited actor/actress (the only way Franco should probably ever host again actually). At various places throughout the celebrity packed audience several random articles such as bolts space tools astronaut helmets and gloves will be suspended from the ceiling on fishing line to simulate and therefore stimulate that curious fascination that the movie going public seems to crave. Frankly the amazing Viewmaster toy (remember those fellow curmudgeons?) of my childhood fulfilled any intoxication-by-CG cravings I still carry in my various intracranial lobes. For those who found this to be a much different experience than I did I give you all due respect. As for myself I fully expect at least two new Oscar winning categories; Best Original Screen Writing Using The Fewest Actual Words ""Dr. Ryan Stone ""Pant Pant Gasp"" and Best Spacewalk Through A Movie To A Paycheck George Clooney as Matt Kowalski I know I know haters gonna hate....so glad not to disappoint you on that note Reply March 20 2014  by  Donna Ketterer     Really Janelle? Your comment was as long as the movie Reply October 14 2013  by  Edwin     I couldnt agree with you more. I didnt find anything special about Gravity. George Clooney did a good job in his part which was short lived. This movie was another ""Cast Away"" but in space and much much worse Reply February 10 2014  by  bbita     Thanks for bringing up the name Cast Away here too. I was just thinking how much resemblance this movie has to Cast Away and I must say I loved Cast Away and I really liked Gravity too. Both of these movies are deep making us think why we go through life and all its hardships. Is it really worth the try if you have to be hit with waves after waves of hardships. Maybe if you read the book You Were Born For A Reason with it Buddhist perspective on the meaning of life you can enjoy these movies unlike before. Reply October 19 2013  by  amicrazy?     Aaron you are right on. It was AWFUL I never once cared about anybody because there was no character development. This whole gushing review thing reminds me of the ""Emperors New Clothes."" Reply March 6 2014  by  Alan J. Oliver     I agree with you...and wish l had thought of the analogy...sums it up perfectly. The Emperors New Clothes nice one. Reply October 20 2013  by  Sam     I totally agree Both my husband and I could not figure out why everyone loves this movie. Never once did I think Bullock or Clooney were anyone other than themselves. Reply October 24 2013  by  jd     Sorry that you missed the ""point"". As a mother thar lost a child from an unexpected accident....I totally get it. Hope you never have to understand what was ""really"" happening Reply November 9 2013  by  Jon     You seriously have to be trolling joking or on crack. This movie was every bit what is being said about it and Im sad that you coukdnt experience it in the same way. Reply December 19 2013  by  John Staggs     Yeah I think Aaron that the same people who enjoyed this movie are the same people who dont have a sense of taste for excellent movies... I hated it all the way throughout the movie that I was angry when I left. My friend had to calm me down. Reply March 6 2014  by  Alan J. Oliver     I totally agree with you how have people got so carried away...wanting Oscars...it a bit worrying. It was at the best average...an exercise in technical achievement... Reply March 18 2014  by  aristofan     youre right. Cant believe how empty this film is. Apart from those technical enhanced images Reply October 6 2013  by  jrsamu     Film completely lives up to the review. Still shaking my head over the effects and Bullock. Never really felt the hype of Kubricks 2001 but did not miss out on Gravity. Really hope it does not spiral into an industry transition to effects that ignores story and characters. It definitely sets the new standard for incorporating the three. Hopefully the custodians of the next star wars trilogy are paying attention. Reply Pingback Gravity Sets Box Office Record October 6 2013  by  Teresa     I thought the movie was incredible. I had read a few of the reviews beforehand and was expecting a dynamite movie and wasnt disappointed. Just one thing I was sitting waiting for the movie to start and saw a family come in with children and I wondered based on what I read if this movie would be as good for children as I was sure it would be for adults. I forgot about that thought when the movie started. After the movie I heard some children around the age of 12 say it was the worst movie they had ever seen. I wonder if anyone else had heard comments like this from children. Reply October 7 2013  by  Naturallawyer     My 14 year old niece hated the movie. I thought it was stunning and moving but she found it boring. Perhaps our children are no longer easily impressed what with all their personal gadgets... Reply February 5 2014  by  Matt     I think everyone should have to take a Film As Art class either in college high school what have you once in their lives. Im a Communication graduate working in Broadcast and my Film As Art class my freshman year of college was the most rewarding class Ive ever taken. Ive never been able to look at movies the same way since and am grateful every time I see a movie for what that class and instructor taught me. If youre a child watching this movie youre not going to appreciate the nuanced acting and camera techniques. Youre just going to want to see animated giraffes falling off cliffs or explosions and constant excitement. People can knock this movie if they want. Thats why America is great everyone is entitled to their own opinion; and not everyone is going to agree on any one thing. But my take away from this movie was it was spectacular and I need to see it in IMAX. Reply Pingback Gravity Sets Box Office Record - Gullpress October 6 2013  by  dave     Love the review and the movie Take note as mentioned above my adult daughter became sick with ""motion sickness"" as she watched and had to close here eyes through much of the movie She didnt like it at all isolated case I suppose. Im definitely going to see ""Gravity"" again tomorrow but this time in IMAX-3D Reply October 6 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Hey you guys thanks so much for all the great thoughtful feedback. As for the age question A childhood friend brought his 11-year-old son who said ""Gravity"" made him incredibly sad and he hated it. For what its worth ... Reply October 6 2013  by  Lee S     I was an 11-year-old kid when I first saw ""2001"" in almost-overwhelming 70 millimeter...and ""Gravity"" is the only film since them to make me feel that I was in space with the movies characters. It manages to be slick and raw at the same time. Cuaron knows how to place you inside the action as he did with ""Children of Men"" and he gets good performances from actors. I wouldnt have missed this movie and am glad it lived up to my expectations. Reply October 6 2013  by  S Peterson     I took my 10-year old daughter to see it today and she loved it. There were a few frightening things but she was truly mesmerized. I definitely recommend seeing it in an IMAX 3d theater. Reply October 6 2013  by  Brian     A small point but I think this is the first film I have seen (other than 2001) that understood there is no sound in the vacuum of space. Silence as huge destruction occurs just behind a character hearing the sound of automated tools only through the reverberation that would occur inside a space suit are just a few examples. The coolest was when they repressurize inside a capsule with a warning bell going off. It starts off silent but as the atmosphere is pressurized the warning bell gradually becomes audible. This small bit of physics which most filmmakers choose to ignore did a lot to heighten the realism. Reply October 6 2013  by  S Peterson     Wow Thank you for that insight. I never thought about that realistic element while I was watching it. I think the visual and emotional journey is so rich that I didnt even take notice. Reply February 16 2014  by  Byron     No Brian. 2001 A Space Odyssey had sequences in outer space with no sound. Gravity is by no means the first movie. Reply October 7 2013  by  JP     Speechless. Christy you nailed it. As did they. Ive dreamed of being in space since I could walk. This movie confirmed everything I thought it would be like and more. Indistinguishable from the IMAX on-orbit films. And I still want to go. Sandra Bullock has shown that she can do a rare thing - act with nearly no others on screen and convince us of who her character is. Reply October 9 2013  by  jrsamu     Have heard that SB was not in the top five choices (at least) of actors favored/approached for this role. For that reason alone I really hopes she takes home some iron in March. Reply October 9 2013  by  Byron Gordon     Sorry Christy. But I could not disagree with you more about Gravity. The ""hype"" is exactly what is not justified. And you only contribute to it by coming to the conclusion that this is best movie youve seen to date in 2013. Youre not being critical and if youre looking for a great film about drama in outer space then go re-rent or dust off your old copy of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Now theres a space drama thats not a Hollywood piece of contrived film making like Gravity. By the way Christy in case you didnt know there is no sound in space. But I guess the filmmakers forget that because there was a continuous soundtrack in Gravity that made a complete farce out of the idea that space is empty of sound. My review http//bgordonconsulting.com/gravity-movie-review-2001-space-odyssey/ Reply October 16 2013  by  David OBrien     Byron I disagree with your assessment of ""Gravity"" but I read your review and you certainly make some interesting points. Personally I loved the film but I appreciate dissenting viewpoints such as yours and am grateful for your input. I must say though I have two issues with your comment on this blog and your review in general 1.) Your comments about movie critics particularly Christy come across as somewhat condescending not to mention inaccurate. How is Christy ""not being critical"" by praising a film she genuinely thought was excellent? A critics job is to review a product and provide his or her honest opinion. It appears you are confusing the terms ""criticism"" and ""negative criticism"" - they are not one and the same. You spend a substantial amount of time praising ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (in my opinion the greatest film ever made) - but would you read Roger Eberts ""Great Movies"" essay on the film and tell him he wasnt ""being critical"" because he considers it a masterpiece? 2.) Your criticism of the films soundtrack is a little confusing. You are correct of course that there is no sound in space in the sense that were one to expose ones naked ear to the vacuum of space you would not ""hear"" anything at all (except perhaps the sound of oxygen being sucked out of your brain as you slowly asphyxiated to death but thats beside the point). As far as I could tell ""Gravity"" was pretty accurate on this point. The only sounds I recall hearing were from interiors (inside the characters spacesuits the space stations/spacecraft etc.). But again you seem to be conflating two different terms here - ""soundtrack"" and ""musical score."" You clearly find the films musical score distracting and unnecessary which is your right as a viewer but you seem to be suggesting that the lack of audible sound in space means that the film should have no musical score. Just to be clear here - the sound of satellite debris crashing into a spacecraft is a SOUND EFFECT. The sound of an orchestra playing music designed to accompany the onscreen action is a MUSICAL SCORE. Maybe Im misreading your comments but its as if youre implying that when the score swells up were supposed to believe that a real-life orchestra is actually floating out there in space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney plucking away at their instruments. Im sure this isnt what you meant but it kind of reads that way. Maybe on the soundtrack/score issue youre just suggesting that a film which takes place in space and purports to be scientifically accurate in regards to the lack of sound in space should not have any musical score at all. In which case youll have to go back to your beloved ""2001"" and edit out all instances of ""The Blue Danube"" and ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" wont you?? Reply October 16 2013  by  Lance     Fantastic. This has been the best thing Ive read online in quite a while. I read it in my mind with a very sarcastic ""wiggly finger"" tone. Pure genius. Reply May 30 2015  by  Byron     David All I can tell you is that when you advertise a movie about space saying there is no sound in space you expect not to watch a film with no ""sound"" in space. As far as Im concerned the film failed. I never once felt like I was in outer space other than the camera work which at times made me feel nauseous. As far as sound or soundtrack or musical score yes it was obvious when in 2001 there was a musical score being played. But as far as sound in space there was none. As far as Im concerned Gravity did feature sound in space and I just felt it was artificially inserted by the filmmaker. As far as Christys review of Gravity she ""hyped"" just like so many other critics who fell in love with the movie and were unable to remain objective about where this film fell short. And this film did fall short. Well have to agree to disagree. Reply October 9 2013  by  Snob     A bunch of fancy CGI with no real substance; typical big budget dross. I didnt even care if Sandra Bullocks character died or not because theres no character development. George Clooneys unflinching charm isnt appropriate in what is supposed to be a doomed situation. The dialog (when it happened) was contrived. It was a huge disappointment mediocre at best. Reply October 12 2013  by  Tina Fernandes     Aaron Byron and Snob.... I completely agree with you... utter waste of time.... I am truly amazed with the 3D effects but definitely not the movie Only worth watching if you like 3Deffects n the star cast Nuthin else impacts the mind other than these 2 things. Seems more like a one n a half hr advertisement for promoting 3D effects and for promoting Imax theatres..would make more sense if it were a based-on-true-life event... or even a documentary.

Reply October 18 2013  by  Dorth     HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Reply October 21 2013  by  Randy smith     Anybody that wasnt utterly taken back and strapped into their seat and feeling like the 4th astraunot in GRAVITY. Obviously did not see the same film as I did This movie is groundbreaking and utterly spectacular I can even use the word ""MASTERPIECE"" when talking about this film I found myselft completly immersed in the beauty and aw of what was before my eyes I was on board for the ride from the first opening frame This film propels the audience emediatetly into the situation at hand without all the typical back on earth back story action that usually takes place in scifi films We are emediatetly floating in space and within minutes feel like we are fighting for our own lives along with Sandra bullock and George clooney. Both who do a spectacular job. Sandra especially carrying most of this film gives a performance of a life time. I left the theater emotionally drained and weeping The combination of groundbreaking technical effects stunning camera work and Oscar winning acting left me in aw of what I had just witnessed and experienced Reply October 21 2013  by  dave     This movie was a huge waste of time. Listening to Sandra breathing heavy huffing and puffing for 45 Minutes was too much for me to handle. Reply October 22 2013  by  jose     I still cant believe what i just saw... such purity of intention (more than a movie its an allegory) such perfection in the execution (save for some minor details that could have been cut off). The only thing i can say is that i just witnessed a is true masterpiece. Reply October 26 2013  by  Chris     My wife and I went to see the movie on the basis of a very positive review in the New York Times. On balance we were quite disappointed. Certainly the 3-D effects are superb and mostly realistic with the exception of the very large amount of space junk flying by. (Junk from an explosion would dissipate very rapidly in the vastness of space.) What was most disappointing was the overall feeling of coldness and emptiness in the movie. Certainly thats true of space in a physical sense but in the movie this was also true in an emotional sense. The human story line seemed perfunctory almost obligatory. Unconvincing. Reply October 26 2013  by  Mike     Are you a paid shill for Warner Brothers? I dont the hype. The characters were never developed enough to be anything more than Bullock and Clooney playing themselves. The main crux of the movie where Clooney is separated from Bullock was a complete ignorance of physics. Both of them were stopped by the cordage wrapped around her leg there was no gravity pulling Clooney putting tension on her Bullock could simply have pulled Clooney oh so gently toward herself and he would of simply floated toward her. Reply October 28 2013  by  Pete     As a ""space geek"" and sci-fi nerd I love movies about space (Star Trek Star Wars Firefly etc.) but more for the drama of humans dealing with extraordinary technology alien cultures or extreme environments. What a treasure to find a film that respects the true physics of space while still delivering an amazing human story. With any movie there is a necessary amount of ""suspension of disbelief"" since it is a work of fiction and the circumstances are ginned up for dramatic effect. In the case of Gravity the scenario is one that could be happening in my own time in my own sky. The characters are not aliens or future-humans but people from my own time. The action though unlikely represents possibilities and the film treats the action with respect to the physics involved. The cinematography and art direction is breathtaking. The subtlety of the performances were top rate as well. I was swept along for the ride not distracted at all by any of the items cited by others. I understand the viewing and enjoyment of movies is a very subjective affair. I was not sure Sandra Bullock was the best choice for this role but she had me from the beginning. I loved every minute of this film and will see it again on as big a screen as I can find. Reply November 1 2013  by  Stephen Torres     Thank you for the great review of this fantastic movie Saw it last night and this movie will be stuck in my mind forever. I did not read your review before I attended a showing and as I read your review today I found myself reliving the movie...it is hard for me to say if that was due to your talent as a reviewer or that the fact that the movie itself had indelibly etched scenes and memories and emotions in my mind. I cannot think about this movie without finding myself shaking and going through the same emotions I did while watching it. This movie is certainly worthy of every accolade that has been given it. Reply November 17 2013  by  Arizona Jack     Im really curious about this comment ""not enough character development."" What exactly are you looking for? Hamlets soliloquy? Their thoughts on the relevance of existentialism in a post-modern age? This movie is about pure survival in the void of space. We get just enough background to understand and care about the characters. Any more exposition would take the focus off the survival theme. Ive seen the movie twice now. Once in 2D on a huge screen and once in 3D on a smaller screen. Between the two I strongly recommend the larger screen experience. I dont feel 3D added anything more. I currently own a 32 inch tube TV which has served me well enough. But when I buy the DVD of Gravity I may just have to spurge and buy a 60 inch flat screen. Theres no other way to do it justice. What a brilliant movie Reply February 4 2014  by  anakbochek     I watched the movie with an expectation that its going to be a boring. But I was dead wrong the movie had me deep into the character. It forced me to wonder how are you going to get back to earth? Are you going die in space? Can you get in the Soyuz? Wow its the first time that I felt so lonely watching a movie. Finally while watching I asked myself how on earth you make weightlessness so real. I even thought that they put the cameramen in space to shoot the view of the earth because its so real. IMHO its the best space movie that Id ever watched. Reply February 10 2014  by  bita asakura     This movie is all about survival. If you have never felt your life threatened and never pondered your moment of dying perhaps this movie can be difficult for you to appreciate. But instead of taking for granted all the effort that went into making it I suggest you think of the possibility that ""I dont really know what death is."" Life and death are inseparable and this movie teaches us that to think about life is also to think about death. To understand life is to understand death. But only the brave and the mature can get here. So let us be grateful for all the work into this movie that makes us think more deeply about life by not being preoccupied with the repetitive cycle of everyday mundane life. Thank you for the creation of this movie. I appreciate the deeper message behind it all. I wish we could meet with the writers/producers. Reply May 30 2015  by  Byron     You want to see a more captivating film about survival? Go watch 120 hours. Now theres a movie without great fanfare and it is superbly acted and directed. Forget Gravity. Its a space movie for gravity masturbators. Reply Pingback Gravity Movie Review [WATCH VIDEO] | Movie News Guide March 6 2014  by  michelle     Bita I love your comment and you are so right This is such a powerful and profound film in every way. It is a stunning visual masterpiece and is also eye opening in its morals and how important it is to let go of ego and just live in the moment. Ryan Stone goes from hyper-ventilating in absolute panic in the beginning to laughing out loud with joy and acceptance by the end Death is just an illusion it is actually transformation. When we die we go back into the creative force. I love the image of Ryan Stone floating like a fetus in the womb cradled in the very fabric of space itself. The movie is deeply spiritual without being religious. It is a very bitter-sweet tale as well exploring both the beauty and the dread of space exploration. Gravity was the most engaging awe inspiring and intimate space film I have ever seen. It gave me a very deep appreciation for this wondrous and beautiful world that we live on. As an astronaut I do not think I would ever get sick of looking down at our planet I am so happy Gravity won 7 Oscars it deserved every single one. Every frame of this film was a visual stunner with the most realistic and mind-boggling effects ever created. The story of survival was universal and timeless. It has been a long time since I have experienced a film that affected me as deeply as Gravity. It is a cinematic masterpiece on every level Reply April 5 2014  by  Tom May     In the movie universe of space movies Gravity instantaneously moved into my Top 5 of all time. Among my top 5 Ive never been able to put that particular list in order because Ive like them all for different reasons and the fluidity of my interest keeps them constantly changing. Bullock and Clooney are so perfect for their roles. Clooney the relaxed easygoing experienced senior astronaut while Bullock playing the role of novice rookie sometimes negative perfectionist who exudes natural ability while experiencing the angst of wanting to succeed surrounded by an emotional debris field of normal human fears in the face of new experiences. Amazing that such a huge chunk of the movie could involve randomly floating space debris both inside and outside the spaceship. For me the most improbable scene in a sea of improbable scenes is that her return craft could land her close enough to actually swim to an island teeming with life. Still arent all space movies in the end improbable. Even knowing in my heart that she was going to survive I sat tensed on the edge of my seat. The chemistry between Bullock and Clooney is real and the tightly wound tension reflected in her face and voice give credence to the movie. I was entertained and left knowing that if I were at 64 offered a chance to go into space I would do it without a moments hesitation. Reply April 7 2015  by  Mark     Jon I just saw Gravity for the first time on HBO. This movie was absolutely horrible. You must live a pretty shity life if you found that shit at all watchable. Do us all a favor and never review movies. Your not very good at it. Reply July 21 2015  by  Patrick     I think people who saw the movie in the theater seems to like more than people that see it on their tv or computer. With that being said I saw it on my computer and I thought although the affects might be good I couldnt get over the script. I thought it was good not great.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Oct 4 2013 Culture Is Gravity the smallest big movie in recent memory? Or the biggest small movie? One can make the case for either but regardless director Alfonso Cuarons latest film--his first since the remarkable Children of Men in 2006--is a fascinating experiment in hybrid filmmaking an awesome display of cutting-edge special effects deployed in the service of a compact character drama.The movie opens with a shot that plays like a deep-space variation on Sherif Alis iconic entrance in Lawrence of Arabia in place of the shimmering sands of Al Madinah we have a supernal slice of blue-white Planet Earth; in place of the speck gliding above it that expands into a camel we have one that instead gradually reveals itself to be a space shuttle; and there clinging to its back as it approaches not Omar Sharif but Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.Related Story Rush A Great Hollywood Entertainment Bullock and Clooney play respectively Dr. Ryan Stone a medical engineer and rookie astronaut and Matt Kowalski a yarn-spinning space veteran on his final mission. The two have undertaken a routine spacewalk to tinker with the Hubble Telescope--along with a colleague who ahem will not figure prominently in the remainder of the film--but they are soon interrupted. The detonation of a Russian satellite hundreds of miles away has led to a chain reaction of collisions and a massive debris field is now hurtling toward the shuttle. It is this host of inadvertent projectiles rather than ""gravity"" in the most direct sense that serves as the primary antagonist of Cuarons film though one can see how he found the latter to be a more elegant title than Flying Space Junk.The opening sequence (like many that follow) is a stunning display of pure cinema. Unable to disengage from the cargo bays arm Ryan pinwheels helplessly around the shuttle as the tsunami of orbital flotsam twirls it on its axis like the S.S. Poseidon on speed. That is until shes freed from the arm and hurled out into the silent void itself. As they say out of the frying pan...I wont reveal the details of what follows and shame on anyone who does. Suffice it to say that Ryan and Matt try with intermittent success to find their way to safety--the shuttle a neighboring space station any port in a storm--and from there back to Earth. The journey home moreover is not merely physical but spiritual as well.I would love to be able to convey the visual spectacularity of Cuarons film but I fear it might be described more easily in mathematical equations (featuring vectors force acceleration and so on) than in customary prose. Unfolding as a series of terrifying object lessons in Newtonian physics the movie lends new meaning to the phrase ""spatial geometry."" The cinematography by usual Cuaron collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki alternates between the harrowing and the sublime with vertiginous sequences that settle unexpectedly into intimate closeups. Gravity is the genuinely rare film--the last to my mind was Titanic--featuring special effects that are at once so novel so technologically ahead-of-the-curve and so essential to the underlying narrative. As George Clooney has noted accurately if perhaps immodestly Gravity is ""an argument for 3D."" It is a movie that demands to be seen in the theater and on the largest screen available.Early in the film when Matt asks Ryan what she likes best about their space walk she replies ""the silence."" The Cuarons would have been wise to supply a bit more of it. Yet for all its visual extravagance Gravity is also in significant ways one of the smallest Hollywood films of the year. Its cast essentially consists of just two actors (plus in a nice touch Ed Harris as the voice of Mission Control) and its running time at 90 minutes seems almost too succinct to be true. (Take that Peter Jackson) The story too is propelled by the simplest and most universal of human motivations the quest for survival in an uncaring cosmos.Bullock contributes arguably the best work of her career in the film and while Clooney may coast a little on his limitless charm it seems oddly apt for him to do so Coasting is after all a principal reality of life in space. If there is a disappointment to be found in Gravity--and alas there is--it is with the screenplay which Cuaron co-wrote with his son Jonas. In contrast to the movies magisterial visuals the writing is often pinched and conventional an overwrought unnecessary backstory; a clumsily executed hinge in the plot; dialogue that bristles with hoary cliche. These narrative missteps are all the more disappointing because they would have been so easy to correct Gravity is not a film that needed to shine in conversation merely one that should have avoided moments clunky enough to wrest us from our immersion to remind us that yes we really are in a movie theater rather than 600000 feet above Earth. Early in the film when Matt asks Ryan what she likes best about their space walk she replies ""the silence."" The Cuarons would have been wise to supply a bit more of it.Frustrating as this flaw may be however it is one that is easy to forgive in light of the genuine wonders the film provides. Gravity may get some of the small things wrong but it gets the big ones dazzlingly unforgettably right.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

By David Denby George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as astronauts in Alfonso Cuarons new movie.   Credit Illustration by Matthew Taylor In Alfonso Cuarons frightening and beautiful space thriller ""Gravity"" the musical score by Steven Price builds to brain-assaulting volume only to break suddenly into silence. The quiet registers on our emotions with greater violence than the ferocious din. In this movie silence is not only the sound of chilly outer space; its the stillness of death whose easeful allure beckons from the opening sequence to the last. ""Gravity"" is not a film of ideas like Kubricks techno-mystical ""2001"" but its an overwhelming physical experience--a challenge to the senses that engages every kind of dread. Theres strong pleasure in it too; the movie is an adventure story in which each clumsy movement of mass and bodies startles. At the beginning of the film an experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is working outside the shuttle Explorer with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a nervous medical engineer who has never been in space before. Word comes from Houston (Ed Harris is the voice) that the Russians have demolished an obsolete satellite which is sending fragments shards every kind of metallic schmutz flying through the belt in which the shuttle orbits some three hundred and seventy miles above Earth. The debris hits the spacecraft with vicious force sending Kowalski and Stone spinning. Kowalski recovers propelling himself this way and that with the little thruster jets built into his spacesuit but Stone is adrift tumbling over and over--shes weightless cut off from communication with Houston breathing too fast and using up her oxygen. Horror films are nearly always driven by the fear of an unknown thing out there in the woods or on the other side of the door. The ghost sooner or later materializes. What if the ghost were nothingness? Kowalski rescues Stone from oblivion calms her down and sets out goals get to the International Space Station climb into a capsule go back to Earth. The veteran asks the beginner about her life and tries to get her to fasten on to something that would make her eager to return home. Stone replies that she lost a daughter and then lost herself. The screenplay was written by Cuaron and his son Jonas and they have shaped Stones floating dilemma as a metaphor for a life thats in permanent suspension. The movie is told from her point of view. The beautiful Earth its rivers gleaming in the sunlight is a long way away but were meant to think she hasnt been on solid ground in years. Apart from a few moments--she strips down to her skivvies and floats upside down; she lands in a capsule and considers ending it right there--Bullocks presence is just a face inside a space helmet. Both she and Clooney have to do their performing almost entirely with their voices. Yet whats familiar in the temperaments of these two actors comes through and that little bit of movie-star reassurance calms us down and allows us to enjoy the movie. Clooney is flippant and needling but precise and persistent when he needs to be. Bullock is scared angry that shes scared and funny about it. Theyre a great team. For Cuaron its been a long and perplexing journey from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (2001) the sexiest above-ground movie in recent years to the fantastical ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) and the brilliant and disturbing dystopian nightmare ""The Children of Men"" (2006). It would be hard to find a common preoccupation or style in all this. Cuaron may be a post-auteurist auteur a great director who reinvents himself with every film. In this movie the tempo goes from dreamy drifting slowness with Earth glowing in the darkness to the terror of events happening with overwhelming speed. At one point Stone hangs on to a long steel pole that swings around wildly like a fairground ride sprung loose from its moorings. The audience itself is hanging at the end of that pole trying to understand whats going on; we fight for breath just as Stone does. Cuaron and his team (the cinematographer is Emmanuel Lubezki) created the movie with a combination of C.G.I. and computer animation and a variety of new lighting and photography techniques. ""Gravity"" looks nothing like science-fiction fantasy. Just as Ang Lee used C.G.I. in ""Life of Pi"" to make a boy and a tiger stranded together in a boat seem plausible Cuaron uses digital technology to make the action as real-seeming as possible. One thing you can say for big-budget movies they allow the tech crew to invent what it needs to create a certain look. The movies become a kind of lab experiment. This one produced a wild ride that may not be equalled for a long time. ""Enough Said"" Nicole Holofceners shrewd new comedy never makes the audience explode with laughter but shes not after hilarity. The writer-director of ""Friends with Money"" (2006) and ""Please Give"" (2010) has a wonderful ear for blunders for jokes that wrong-foot the listener for kindnesses that dont quite reach the person they are intended to reach. Holofcener has become a perceptive chronicler of the sentimental side of upper-middle-class life. She ignores the larger world and devotes herself to such things as friendship marriage and divorce the bonds of love and irritation between mothers and daughters. After a sojourn in New York (her native city) for ""Please Give"" she has returned to Los Angeles (where she lives) with its sunshine; its casual social life in which people just drop in and exchange confidences; and its characters such as a local highbrow poet played by Catherine Keener who lives in a house that looks like an overplanted garden and dresses in loose-fitting shepherdess-chic garments. The poet Marianne is the satisfied client of a masseuse Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who zips around the city with a portable massage table in her little blue car. Eva has a discomforting intimacy with her clients but what she needs is real intimacy. Divorced about fifty with an adored daughter about to go off to college Eva starts a love affair with a divorced man Albert (James Gandolfini) also about fifty whose adored daughter is also heading for school. The first stages of the affair go well enough but there is a problem. Unbeknownst to Eva Albert was married to Marianne. Eva working on Marianne as a client and then talking with her as a friend listens sympathetically as the poet endlessly bad-mouths her ex. By the time Eva realizes that Marianne is describing Albert shes too embarrassed to say anything. She doesnt want to end the relationship with Marianne; shes flattered to be the confidante of a writer who knows Joni Mitchell. And shes not by nature critical enough to realize that Marianne is a friendless narcissist with a nasty tongue. The basic plot might have turned up on a network sitcom (some of the harping on body parts is Seinfeldian) but Holofcener doesnt do slapstick. For her ordinary encounters are awkward enough without people falling over sofas or smacking their foreheads. The scenes of Eva and Alberts early days together are classic vignettes of observation. They are both scared and like any new couple spend a lot of time matching tastes and throwing each other curves. They each have a penchant for put-ons and mock insults. They compare feet. They even examine each others molars an activity usually confined to buying a horse. And they weave their daughters in and out of their meetings. The movie encompasses the middle-aged parents trial--the bewilderment of pride and anguish as children leave home. Holofcener gives Tracey Fairaway who plays Evas needy daughter and Eve Hewson Alberts prickly judgmental offspring (she has more than a bit of Marianne in her) enough space to create genuine characters. Its a movie that approaches novelistic richness. Like many smart sensitive people Eva is scared to be straightforward about what she wants. Shes even a little sheepish as if she were afraid she would be punished for being assertive. For Julia Louis-Dreyfus who is so tough in a lot of her TV work Evas tentativeness is something new; shes good at the stop-and-go approach to the character--nervous smile rapid wisecracks--though I wish she would cease chewing on her mouth after every line as if she were doing the punishing herself. Evas divorce hasnt been too painful; Alberts has left him wounded and defensive. Gandolfini has the difficult task of playing a proud man who knows that hes unattractive to women--at least at first. Holofcener and her crew dont try to make him look better he has his Jersey-Falstaffian belly and a bulbous nose with a red tip and he wears a bushy beard. His massive body is much discussed by the women and the role could have brought out a masochistic streak in a lesser actor. But in one of his final roles Gandolfini without bullying his way through scenes or hiding Alberts need for love makes his character a man who knows that dignity is something you must hold on to in life if any relationship is going to work at all.

At area theaters in 2-D and IMAX 3-D. Nerve-racking sentimental and thrilling ""Gravity"" honors terra firma even as it reaches for the stars with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Anchored by an impressive melding of animation computer-generated visual effects live-action wire work and more ""Gravity"" is a remarkable achievement of the sort weve perhaps grown ho-hum about. But this is not your typical digital-effects extravaganza. Its tale of space calamity is more science-nonfiction than sci-fi. See it in 3-D not because ""dropped"" tools float toward you (they do) but because director Alfonso Cuaron cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual-effects ace Tim Webber have created a visceral world worth entering. Zero gravity or microgravity has never looked so fluid. Space has seldom seemed quite so human and strange. ""Gravity"" begins with a fairly routine repair job on the Hubble telescope and plenty of office chatter between Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) mission commander Lt. Matt Kowalski (Clooney) and Phaldut Shariff (Paul Sharma). A newbie experiencing a zero-gravity hangover Stone is trying to fix a scanner. Kowalski is nattering on to Houston telling the kind of yarns best recounted at roadside bars. A country-western song twangs in space. Its playful stuff the familiar unfolding amid the staggering. But space ""Gravity"" reminds us is hardly routine -- and getting less so. Its crowded up there In addition to the international space station theres the shuttle Explorer as well as Russian and Chinese spacecraft. When debris from a satellite changes trajectory disaster hurtles like shrapnel. Soon Kowalski and Stone are fighting to survive and get home. As the situation grows dire Kowalski mixes small talk with the sort of buck-up authority one would crave in a tight spot. If the lieutenant sounds a lot like the guy weve come to know as George Clooney thats OK. It works its calming charm. But Bullock gives less a star turn here than a stretched-to-the-point-of-surrender performance. While theres something around her eyes of the girl we first met on a careening bus in ""Speed"" theres a tempered maturity and focused depth to this deeply existential turn. ""Gravity"" uses a mix of shots to convey the boundlessness of space and cramped quarters of spaceships but none is as persuasive as the first-person camerawork that captures Stones physical predicament. She spins bumps into equipment loses her markers. Its a finely detailed film. Andy Nicholsons production design honors the always surprising clunkiness of real spaceships with their docking ports and airlocks control panels and how-to manuals. There are moments in which Cuaron and his co-writer and son Jonas get corny -- boldly so. A doubter says a prayer. A tear floats. A wish is fulfilled if momentarily. And the action in this fleet film tempts ""Perils of Pauline"" comparisons. Yet the movies bells and whistles and its brilliantly lubed movie-making machinery wouldnt mean much if the story of being lost in space -- and found -- didnt exert its powerful melancholy tug on us.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 4 2013 Save for later Saved Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) do some in-orbit repair work in Gravity. Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of There has rarely been a more entrancingly eerie opening scene than the one that graces ""Gravity"" the new space epic starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as NASA astronauts who suddenly find themselves unmoored 370 miles above Earth.The first image is a long shot of Earth as a space shuttle eventually makes its way into the frame ending up in a close shot. Alfonso Cuaron filming in 3-D captures in a single unbroken take the immensity and deafening soundlessness of space the slow sweep of orbital motion the power of blackness. Its a tour de force sequence to rank alongside anything in ""2001"" a film this one clearly references.But ""2001"" was ultimately a messianic movie about intergalactic imponderables. ""Gravity"" is far less pretentious which is both good and bad. Its nice for a change to see a space movie that isnt all hyped up about God and Man and Whats Out There. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The accident that sets ""Gravity"" in motion is much more mundane. Shards of metal debris from an exploding Russian satellite collide with the Explorer shuttle whose astronauts have been sent up to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. The only survivors are Bullocks Ryan Stone the medical engineer and Clooneys Matt Kowalsky a veteran shuttle commander on the final run of his career. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Cuaron and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki keep the audience in weightless suspension right along with the astronauts. For most of us ""Gravity"" is the closest we will ever get to the real deal. Cuaron is more than a technologist; he has a genuinely poetic feeling for the ways in which motion carries through space.I only wish the films screenplay co-written by Alfonso Cuaron and Jonas Cuaron were not so weightless. Granted its tough to come up with anything for these characters to say that given the immensity of the universe wont sound clunky. Still Matt who looks like Buzz Lightyear and never met a wisecrack he didnt like is a bit much. Perhaps the point is that even the vastness of space is a yawn for people who spend their lives floating through it. If so thats pretty depressing.Ryan is given a back story about the loss of her daughter that feels soap-opera-ish in the extreme. Isnt it enough that she is running out of oxygen and desperately trying to make her way to the International Space Station in time? Cuaron underestimates our empathy for her predicament. This disconnect between the grandeur of the visuals and the ordinariness of the dialogue is a common problem with science-fiction films. Actually very little in ""Gravity"" can technically be called ""fiction"" notwithstanding the fact that as several scientists have already pointed out the Hubble and the space station operate in entirely different orbits.I almost wish Cuaron had cast nonactors or unknown actors in the lead roles. Its jarring having movie stars work up their Hollywood histrionics against such a glorious backdrop. None of these arguments should dissuade you from seeing ""Gravity"" if only because whats good about it is so much better than whats bad. Visually if not imaginatively it sends you soaring. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong language.)

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 03 2013 1244PM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 04 2013 609PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alfonso Cuaron Written by Alfonso Cuaron Jonas Cuaron Starring Sandra Bullock George Clooney Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA/U.K. Language English ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" says astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) clowning around with Mission Control back on Earth in Alfonso Cuarons new film Gravity. The home planet blue green and brown looms massively beneath the space shuttle outside of which Matt and medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are tethered doing a patch-up on the Hubble telescope. Video Video Director Alfonso Cuaron on challenging Gravity shoot The voice of Mission Control (in a nod to another space-disaster movie Apollo 13) belongs to Ed Harris who reports that dangerous debris is quickly heading their way the result of the Russians deliberately destroying one of their satellites. The worst comes to pass - the ship is shelled with debris and irreparably damaged. The astronauts are tossed into space in their spacesuits with oxygen running out miles above the surface of the Earth. Its terrifying but you also want to clap The entire 13-minute sequence is a single beautifully designed shot.Time to say their prayers? Not quite. Kowalski sees a Russian space station in the distance the first of a chain of slim chances of returning to Earth.Gravity is the first movie in seven years from Cuaron since his dystopic film Children of Men. Shot in 3-D with fully immersive realistic purpose you should see Gravity that way preferably in Imax sitting in the middle near the back of the theatre for the complete intensity of the experience. That way you will be suspended virtually stranded in space with the astronauts.Theres little dialogue in Gravity but the tension is expertly manipulated between scenes of utter quiet and sudden violence moments of claustrophobia and vertigo with long stretches of silence on the soundtrack.Gravity is part of something bigger that is going on in movies right now. Many of the films being released this fall that lead the Oscar lists are survival stories. All in a way are descendants of Daniel Defoes 18th-century novel Robinson Crusoe. Kidnapping and bondage in Twelve Years a Slave; piracy and abduction in the upcoming Tom Hanks movie Captain Phillips; and a shipwreck in the Robert Redford drama All Is Lost.These films are an alternative to the artifice of the CGI global-franchise movies with their complicated mythologies and overload of special effects. Theres something conceptually pure about a drama that pits one individual against a hostile environment that recognizes there are few experiences more immediate than a body in trouble. With Gravity Cuaron uses cutting-edge technology from robotic cameras to expert CGI to create not a fantasy but tangible experience.The story itself and the movie stars are the most conventional elements here. Clooney in a distinctly supporting role offers a variation on his glib smart-aleck charmer which the screenplay uses cunningly; in some ways hes just a more talkative version of Wilson the volleyball to Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The real show is Bullock in her best career performance with the least attitudinizing the least dialogue. The screenplays one false note is to provide her with a tragic backstory with the implication that no normal woman would want such a risky career but its a small offence. Bullock leaves no doubt about her qualifications and intelligent focus in a solo performance thats a series of reactions to catastrophically changing circumstances - as much choreography as acting.As survival stories go disappearing into the void is about as lost as you can get but Cuarons crowd-pleasing minimalist blockbuster wastes no time with philosophical or religious speculation about what it means in the words of David Bowie to be ""strung out on heavens high hitting an all-time low."" Yet Gravity a weightless ballet and a cold-sweat nightmare intimates mystery and profundity with that mixture of beauty and terror that the Romantics called the sublime.

Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock play astronauts marooned in space in Gravity a visual marvel of a movie from director Alfonso Cuaron. Warner Bros. Gravity Director Alfonso Cuaron Genre Drama Sci Fi Running Time 90 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong language. With Sandra Bullock George Clooney (Recommended) Doctoral theses will be penned on the breath-catchingly realistic gorgeously choreographed entirely mesmerizing opening that director Alfonso Cuaron has conjured for Gravity -- both how the scene was managed and how it works on a viewers psyche. Ill leave the technical stuff to grad students; for now lets just call the shot immersive in a way that cinema rarely manages to be. For more than 13 minutes without a cut or edit -- yes I know this was digitally managed not done in a single go -- Cuaron sends his camera swooping in graceful arcs around an orbiting repair crew. Theyre astronauts working on the Hubble Space Telescope high above the Earth their shuttle idled nearby disaster imminent though they wont know that until its upon them. We first see the crew and their spacecraft as a tiny dot on the edge of a majestic screen-filling planet their isolation and sheer cosmic puniness their most salient feature. The camera floats toward them or perhaps they toward it as we hear them chattering faintly in staticky NASA-speak. Soon were close enough to discern whos who -- George Clooneys veteran space walker cracking wise as he sails above around and past Sandra Bullocks newbie whos struggling gamely with circuits wiring bolts (one floats straight out into the auditorium) and a queasy stomach. i Bullocks mission scientist is a dubiously confident space traveler even before shes sent reeling toward the abyss by debris from an orbital mishap. Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Bullocks mission scientist is a dubiously confident space traveler even before shes sent reeling toward the abyss by debris from an orbital mishap. Warner Bros. And as we take in the dazzling star-backed blue-and-white planet and register the physics of space-walking -- how much force is required to move from one Hubble strut to another what happens when an electronic panel floats free and out of reach -- Mission Control chimes in occasionally (the voice is Apollo 13s Ed Harris mischievously enough) with words of encouragement. And then with alarm. A Russian satellite has exploded sending shards of potentially lethal space debris their way -- debris that becomes visible in the background -- remember there still has not been a single ""edit"" -- just before it rips into the Hubble and the shuttle and all those struts and panels sending them and the astronauts and all of us reeling. Bullock whose anxiety about being outside an enclosed capsule is evident even when shes moored to the equipment shes repairing is sent spinning free head-over-heels into inky blackness. The camera joins her in her point of view -- the stars are streaks now -- and we can see her breath coming so rapidly it fogs her vision. Her disorientation is our disorientation even as Clooney tries to get her to focus and tell him her position so he can try to find her. Now what I dont know about how the brain processes visual information fills volumes but Im going to guess that 13 minutes with nary a cut or visual cue to remind you that youre in a movie theater allows you to ... well not forget that fact exactly but perhaps subliminally to at least discount it. Weve all become familiar enough with conventional film grammar that we barely register shifts from one point of view to another or from medium shot to close-up even though thats not how we experience the real world. Weve learned to ignore and absorb these visual cues because theyre such useful storytelling tools. Until some ambitious doctoral candidate establishes this definitively itll just have to be a wild guess on my part but Im going to posit that the absence of those cues affects the experience of viewing Gravity. Real life is a continuous shot after all not unlike the one Cuaron has immersed us in for 13 minutes. And if theres nothing signaling to your brain that youre not really with the folks youve been listening to and gliding near well -- the suggestion that you are actually floating in orbit yourself has got to be at least a little more persuasive than usual. Enough so anyway that you may find yourself dodging whats presumably digital debris as it flies at your head quite as if it were the real thing. I can only acknowledge that I did just that while watching the film in 3-D IMAX from a row close enough that the image filled my peripheral vision. And that everyone around me seemed to be doing the same thing. It would be nice now that Ive dispatched with that astounding opening if there were a way to similarly dodge some of the scripts less felicitous notions. Cuaron and his son Jonas have felt the need not just to come up with ways to keep the characters talking -- theres even a mildly sneery reference to NPR at one point -- but to brush in backstory and motivation quite as if the peril of being isolated in space with a limited supply of oxygen werent sufficient rationale for the characters actions. Ive no doubt the filmmakers have good reasons for this -- that were meant to see Bullock curled in a fetal position as signaling a moment of rebirth that spiritual questions might reasonably occur to someone working through grief while surrounded by the cosmic infinity of space. But frankly none of that made me feel half as awestruck as did the mastery of form and the brilliance of execution that it seems to me is really what Gravity is about.

"Gravity (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Gravity (PG-13) Alfonso Cuarons groundbreaking sci-fi epic is the thrill-ride movie of the year. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/3/2013 Editor rating 3.5 Gravity is a celebration of the primal pleasure of movies It shows you things youve never seen before transports you out of the theater and out of your head tricks you into believing whats happening on the screen is happening to you. The film which took director Alfonso Cuaron five years to make is as big of a technological breakthrough as Avatar. But Gravity is closer in spirit to Titanic a giant-sized spectacle that came to hinge on two people floating on a piece of wood clinging for their lives. In Gravity two astronauts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) end up floating in outer space clinging to each other for their lives. Clooney is the experienced veteran whos constantly joking with NASA ground control (voiced by Ed Harris in a clever homage to Apollo 13) and spouting playful banter (""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission.""). Bullock is the scientist on her first mission into space tasked to conduct repairs on the Hubble telescope. Shes nervous inexperienced awestruck. ""What do you like about being up here?"" Clooney asks her via radio. ""The silence"" she replies. ""I could get used to it."" Although the movies trailers used sound effects Gravity adheres to the laws of science rendering outer space as a silent void. Cuaron relies heavily on music like Stanley Kubrick did in 2001 A Space Odyssey. But the original score by Steven Price isnt just a complement to the films jaw-dropping visuals. The music is a critical element in the film piping in not only from the screen but also from behind and around you helping to bewilder and dislocate you when hurtling debris destroys the telescope in a vast soundless explosion. Your eyes take a moment to process whats happening because the usual sonic cues arent there to guide you. The effect is shocking and terrifying the first of the movies many triumphs of pure craftsmanship.. Gravity which Cuaron wrote with his son Jonas never lets up after that initial catastrophe. The tension is relentless. Bullock is sent flying through space her oxygen supply running low. Clooney is still able to navigate with his jet pack but hes running out of fuel. The debris that caused the first accident is still orbiting the planet circling around to wreak more havoc when you least expect it like the shark from Jaws. Although Gravity is an unabashed entertainment the movie also becomes an existential rumination on the human instinct to survive. Bullock has no one waiting for her back on Earth She has devoted herself entirely to her work in order to stave off a crippling depression. And now with no conceivable hope for rescue -- communication with ground control is gone -- there is a great temptation to just float away into a quiet death. But there is also terror Our innate fear of death is the strongest motivator of all. Survival is not going to be easy though. In an era when movies even good ones often overstay their welcome Gravity defies the bloat that has seeped into everything from comic-book movies to Judd Apatow comedies. The film runs a tight and harrowing 90 minutes unfolding in something close to real time. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who has shot almost all of Cuarons pictures does magical things with his camera which floats weightlessly through the movie like its characters sometimes pushing through the astronauts glass helmets to give us a close-up of their eyes then turning around to show us exactly what they are seeing all without any visible cuts. Much of Gravity is told via impossibly long uninterrupted shots but Cuaron uses the editing technique to draw us closer into the drama the way he did during the startling car chase in Children of Men. You will believe this movie was shot in outer space. For all its visual wonders -- and this is a picture that deserves to be seen in 3D on as big of a screen as possible -- Gravity might have just been a spectacular ride a disposable wow-did-you-see-that? entertainment. Bullock is the films secret weapon anchoring this enormous film with a sadness and vulnerability shes never played before (shes as resourceful as Sigourney Weavers Ripley but not nearly as intrepid). Bullocks trademark persona her natural peppy charisma is of no use here The role forces the actress out of her comfort zone and the result is a revelation. The movie is as much about her inner space as it is about outer space and Bullock exceeds all expectations. Gravity dazzles and thrills like no other movie in recent memory but it also moves you too. And as you leave the theater your feet planted firmly on the ground you will be so thankful for gravity that most underappreciated of all natural forces. Never again will you take it for granted.

It strives to bring cinemas past especially the rip-roaring edge-of-the-seat thrillers Hollywood used to make into its technological weightless oxygen-free future. Its a film made in 3-D that very nearly justifies that overused overhyped and largely unnecessary cinematic process and a film made almost entirely with computer graphics - in many scenes the only non-CGI elements are Bullock and Clooneys faces - that is intimate absorbing and fueled by human emotion.I look forward to seeing this gripping and spectacular movie again and even more to the discussions well get to have after more of you have seen it. But I have to admit - you knew there was a ""but"" coming right? - that on first viewing ""Gravity"" feels like slightly less than the sum of its magnificent parts. Cuaron the inordinately talented Mexican director who hasnt made a full-length feature since his science-fiction masterwork ""Children of Men"" seven years ago is going for the devils candy here the magical combination of artistic credibility cutting-edge craftsmanship and commercial success. Riveted as I was by the saga of Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and debonair veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) adrift in orbit after their craft is destroyed by runaway space junk I also became increasingly aware of the intense calculation at work in ""Gravity."" The entire movie is a Rube Goldberg machine of disaster a roller coaster ride of cascading calamity that becomes hilariously overstated by the time we reach the ludicrous concluding sequence. (Which I want to discuss more but wont.)You may well ask what the Sam Hill Im complaining about. Cuaron has made no secret of his goal which was to summon up the visual and metaphysical tradition of space-travel classics like Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and Andrei Tarkovskys ""Solaris"" while translating it into an idiom that a 21st-century mass audience can understand. If the results feel something like an eye-popping 3-D video game where we hurtle along in space next to Kowalski and Stone in search of a way to survive against astronomical odds I dont think many viewers will complain. Please slow this movie down We wanted something more contemplative No not even I think that is likely or desirable.I suppose the title of ""Gravity"" -- which was written by Cuaron with his son Jonas - has a witty or ironic resonance. As Cuaron ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and their enormous visual-effects team capture in eerie convincing fashion Stone and Kowalski are beyond gravity in the ordinary sense of that word. Exhilarating stunning and sometimes panic-inducing this films visual framing is unlike anything ever accomplished in the movies before. Up down right and left no longer have meaning for these two human beings lost at the outer edge of Earth orbit. (Those with motion-sickness issues may need to take appropriate medication.) At the same time the gravity of that big beautiful blue orb below and/or above them is both their only hope and their biggest threat. It keeps them from drifting away into absolute nothingness and it ultimately promises to pull them in and burn them to cinders. You Might Also Like Of course the two astronauts will likely be dead for other reasons long before that happens. Few if any outer-space movies have captured the immense emptiness of the void the way ""Gravity"" does or the absolute silence. In ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" shootouts spaceships explode with prodigious bangs but when the tide of lethal space debris arrives in ""Gravity"" it does so without a sound which turns out to be far more terrifying. We only get the briefest of explanations from Mission Control in Houston (the voice is Ed Harris surely a nod to both ""Apollo 13"" and ""The Right Stuff"") The Russians tried to shoot down one of their own satellites with a missile but the whole thing has gone horribly sideways scouring orbital space with deadly scrubbing bubbles and bringing down the globes communications networks. Yeah this is a movie about the apocalypse or at least a mini-apocalypse with only two characters. After the man-made asteroid belt comes through Houston falls silent and Stone and Kowalski find themselves alone in their spacesuits with limited oxygen no food or water no one to talk to and no obvious way to get home.Character development really isnt the point here - theyre lost in space - but both Clooney and Bullock play to type. Kowalski is chatty flirtatious immensely calm and competent and untroubled by the prospect of imminent death. I enjoyed him a lot; sometimes Clooneys at his best when he appears not to be working hard. Stone is a medical specialist on her first space mission a brittle and businesslike loner (with a boys name as Kowalski points out) haunted by a personal tragedy she will have to get past rather too formulaically if she wants to get back to Earth in one piece. To talk about their relationship any further would be bordering on spoiler territory so lets just say that both actors give compact and resourceful performances doing their utmost to lend a human heart to a film thats mostly about amazing images and tremendous forward (and/or downward) momentum. To have any hope of survival Stone and Kowalski must find a way to get from their disabled shuttlecraft to the International Space Station - and then onward to another spacecraft after that. As a real-life astronaut has pointed out although much of the films portrayal of spaceflight is exacting this isnt a remotely possible scenario. I didnt know that going into the movie and Im not entirely sure I care. That knowledge does however augment my sense that Cuaron is desperately searching for an escape hatch throughout the tremendously exciting first hour of ""Gravity"" - a secular equivalent to the spiritual or supernatural dimension found in Kubricks and Tarkovskys great space movies. While the tension never lets up for a second how you respond to the boundary-fudging and wildly improbable ending of ""Gravity"" - meaning both how it makes you feel and how you interpret it - will determine whether you think the movie is a genuine pop masterpiece or a canny artifice. Maybe theres no difference. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Grade A Action movies and thrillers used to be called ""edge of your seat"" but this engulfing space adventure changes all the rules. It pushes you to the back of your seat. Thats partly because its visceral force sends out shock waves - I visualized them like the concentric semicircles that would portray explosive power in old comic books. You sit back as far as you can go mostly because you want to give yourself as wide a view as possible of a 3D screen alive with imagery. You hope to discern the first tremors of each new catastrophe. Chances are the movie will take you by surprise every time. The director Alfonso Cuaron does such a dazzling job of filling each moment with dramatic spectacle and beauty that you dont know where to look first. And his performers Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are so emotionally magnetic that they take turns pulling you inside their space suits and under their skin. You register calamity when they do; you feel so close to them its as if theyre fighting for your survival too. The tag line for ""Alien"" was ""In space no one can hear you scream."" That goes for ""Gravity"" too which does far more with the contrasts between headset chatter and utter silence. Bullock plays Ryan Stone a medical engineer on a mission to service the Hubble telescope and George Clooney plays Matt Kowalski the mission commander with the ultra-right stuff. Stone Kowalski and a third astronaut Shariff (Paul Sharma) are engaged in repairs outside their vehicle - well Kowalski is mostly just trying to set a record for a space walk - when debris from a Russian missile hitting a Russian satellite starts hurtling their way. What ensues is like a gargantuan survivalist game of Chutes and Ladders crossed with Beat the Clock and played for mortal stakes amid a storm of space flotsam and jetsam. Soon Stone and Kowalski lose communication with Houston. They must struggle to survive with the only tools they have left the jetpack in Kowalskis space suit and their wits. Their immediate goal which needs to be achieved before the jagged ring of wreckage makes its second orbit is to reach the International Space Station and find a module that can speed them home. But a string of cataclysms will send them well beyond the ISS. The phrase ""a woman alone"" used to mean a woman without a romantic partner or a family. For much of this movie Stone is separated from everyone and anything. To her even Mother Earth can look as cold and distant as an unreachable parent. The title is deceptive - audiences might presume its ironic because the film takes place almost entirely in space. But the film is true to ""microgravity"" - the force that exists when its characters go into free fall. And if theres no zero gravity in the film there is weightlessness and zero resistance. Whenever Stone enters an evacuated shuttle she finds everything not locked down adrift in a perpetual float - from helmets and pencils to a Marvin the Martian figurine. She must learn that when she operates a fire extinguisher it will act on her like a rocket thruster unless she anchors herself first. This crash course in space physics connects to the films emphasis on emotional gravity - on Kowalskis constancy and centeredness and Stones growth from cluelessness to confidence. Clooney has never been more effortlessly polished more totally possessed of a postmodern machismo than he is here. Even before disaster strikes he unrolls an endless string of jokes and patter. He goads Houston Mission Control (Ed Harris) about having a ""bad feeling about this mission"" - something he says about all his missions -- before recounting his partying escapades back on terra firma. He isnt merely a cutup and a flirt. He exalts in the array of eye-popping sights in the stars above and the Earth below. Even if you find his charm as written glib you soon recognize that its salutary. Kowalskis spiel operates like a lifeline for Stone who needs to ignite her survival instinct. Bullock has turned into one of our most original stars. She can be a powerhouse as in ""The Blind Side"" but she also has the rare ability to make the audience feel what a character wants to feel and doesnt or needs to feel and cant as in ""Murder By Numbers"" (2004). She draws on that gift for evoking stunted and nascent emotions in ""Gravity."" Director Cuaron who also wrote the script with his son Jonas gives Stone a tragic back-story that erupts into prominence under pressure. Bullocks absolute ownership of her character - her ability to start from a baseline of out-of-this-world stress then streak it with melancholy and self-deprecating comedy - makes revelations that could have been trite transcendent. Bullocks physical commitment to her role is so all-out its almost prehensile. No performance in movie history has done more to dramatize the act of breathing. It helps you recognize when shes in danger of terminal panic. If any one-word title would fit this film better than ""Gravity"" its ""Vertigo."" Thats partly because Cuaron makes exciting use of 3D. He employs it gleefully and organically. He brings you into a more fluid relationship with his actors and ushers in new concepts of film space and outer space. The most gifted directors from the silent days to Spielberg have distinguished the film frame from the stage proscenium. In ""Gravity"" Cuaron dissolves the frame itself. He employs 3D as well as robot and digital technology to turn the area between the screen and your seat into a force field and to make the visual depth of his scenes extend as Buzz Lightyear would say ""to infinity ... and beyond"" The results will make you leap in fear and jump for joy.

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Sandra Bullock George Clooney Ed HarrisRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideGravity is the kind of enthralling all-encompassing giddy cinematic experience that surfaces once in a blue moon.At a key moment in this eloquent space thriller (    out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) Sandra Bullock playing a medical engineer on her first space mission faces impending peril with a complicated blend of resignation and enthusiasm ""Itll be one hell of a ride.""Its also an astute assessment of a spectacular movie that balances action and suspense with contemplation and emotion.The telling of this simple tale of survival required cutting-edge technology but we dont notice the bells and whistles Theyre on hand to immerse us in an unforgettable personal story.VIDEO Gravity is Bullocks best decision STORY Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron is very happyREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersVeteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Bullock) are on a mission to install a new scanning system on the Hubble telescope. Shes serious and focused. Hes blithe and entertains Houstons Mission Control with jokes and well-worn stories. Then an alarm sounds.A cloud of space debris collides with their spacecraft. Suddenly Stone and Kowalski are lost in space. Tethered together they bob and swoopDirector Alfonso Cuaron has crafted a bracing masterpiece that blends visual panache top-notch acting deft writing and taut pacing.Bullock is an adept and soulful action hero who brings remarkable humanity to an arduous role. Clooney also is convincing projecting warmth and ease in an understated performance. He becomes a mentor to Stone guiding her through her darkest hours.As conceived by Cuaron -- who directed Children of Menand Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban-- and his son Jonas the spare dialogue is deeply evocative.No film since 2001 A Space Odyssey in 1968has captured such a vivid reality outside Earths gravitational pull. And no film has so artfully interwoven 3-D technology.Every detail seems meticulously researched from distant shots of a glimmering Earth to sounds heard only from inside spacesuits. Computer-generated imagery animation and live action are seamlessly blended. The camera rotates in long continuous shots including a wondrous 13-minute opener. Camera angles heighten the vastness at one moment and claustrophobic containment the next.A masterful storyteller Cuaron explores isolation physical and emotional. Early on when Kowalski asks Stone what she likes best about space she responds ""The silence.""Its a statement that will come to haunt her.Gravity is an extraordinary force to be reckoned with a majestic innovative heart-pounding spectacle imbued with poetry and profundity. 342 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1fMsDewFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Facebook Twitter Print Gravitys Rainbow Alfonso Cuarons near-perfect moviegoing experience by Wesley Morris on October 22 2013 Movies are the only popular art form in which the content determines not only whether well experience a film but how well partake in that experience. Will we see it in a theater or at home or on a portable device? A terms been coined (""platform agnostic"") that implies that going to the movies was once tantamount to going to church and that now divinity can happen on a phone. There are filmmakers aware of this shift in moviegoing culture who think its no good for their sense of artistry. Alfonso Cuaron is that sort of filmmaker. His movies come infrequently enough for those who love them to anticipate a new one with zealous enthusiasm. And Cuaron being a director of enormous commercial gifts seems to feel compelled to deliver a religious experience. His last movie Children of Men was released in a time before the iPhone. It was visionary political science fiction and Cuarons expanding mastery exceeded your ability to take it all in. He drowned you in his skill. What I remember about the movies war-zone climax is trying to duck for cover and wipe away tears at the same time. It was a religious experience that almost killed me. In the seven years since Cuaron has clearly been considering how much bigger he could go how to instill an appropriate sense of only-in-theaters awe. In order to achieve it he had to leave the planet. Gravity trades the scriptural Armageddon of Cuarons previous film for astronautical peril. Its an uneven exchange. The new movie is visually bigger yet less thematically grand. Its the tale of an American space mission gone wrong. NASA has dispatched a crew to perform space station upgrades. The repairwoman is an engineer named Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Despite six months of training and a week in space shes so nervous and nauseated that she cant even appreciate the corny comedy of an unflappable lieutenant named Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who bores mission control (the voice of Ed Harris) with silly old stories. This is her first spacewalk and his last. The relatively easy assignment takes a disastrous turn after a storm of Russian satellite debris comes flying at them. None of the pieces looks terribly dangerous in itself but apparently theyre traveling with enough force to destroy the shuttle and leave Ryan spinning off into space attached to part of a crane that detached from the rest of the ship. Its a harrowingly beautiful image. So too is the debris created by the speeding junk. The shards and scraps of white do a shimmering frozen-confetti dance. The gracefulness of both the calm and ensuing chaos of this opening passage is something to see. Ryan and Matt remain ribboned to each other struggling to control their momentum and coordinate their movement. They hit parts of the ship. They crash into each other. Its like watching an invisible baby use a yo-yo. Cuarons challenge is to give you a movie that makes sense only if it can overwhelm your senses. I couldnt watch it on a smartphone because Id need both hands to grip my armrest. That first sequence was done in a single shot. Emmanuel Lubezki is the cinematographer. He also shot Children of Men whose finale includes a three-and-a-half-minute single take. That one stopped the show. This one starts it. Gravitys is longer smoother and so much more involved that you almost fail to notice the achievement which Im sure is what Lubezki would (modestly) say is his goal. The movie is in such a constant state of whirring whooshing orbit that you cant remember to stop to breathe and wonder how Cuaron and his crew of technicians pulled this off. As a technical filmmaker Cuaron is at his best on the go. This was especially true of his art-world rethinking of Great Expectations the road scenes in Y Tu Mama Tambien and all of The Prisoner of Azkaban the only of the Harry Potter films to strike the exact balance of J.K. Rowlings storybook enchantment and real-world paranoia. Gravity never stops moving (theres often some object hovering in the camera frame) but when things slow down youre free to wish the human action were as emotionally stirring as the material chaos is thrilling. In conducting the action noiselessly he adheres to the science of this scenario. But neither Ryan nor Matt can resist speaking bromidically. The score by Steven Price mistakes bombast for wonder. Cuaron has given Ryan an unhappy backstory. Its meant to keep us connected to her but we dont need it and neither really does she. The sheer will to survive the accident should be enough to keep her fighting with Matts guidance to find her way back to Earth. Her confidence is Cuarons. But if his movies are in some way about the pros and cons of faith (in sex love magic friendship mankind) this new movie offers a new property guilt. Cuaron wrote Gravity with his son Jonas. And its as much of a story a child wishes his parent would read to him at bedtime as it is a story a parent wants to tell about himself. Like the Rowling books it too has the deceptive simplicity of something youd read a young person before bed. Its priorities are narrower. The universe is as big as two people though mostly one since Clooneys character keeps coming and going. The movie puts infinity on the head of a pin (it runs just over an hour and a half). The thematic minimalism deserves maximal projection. It is being released in 3-D. You want to see it in the most state-of-the-art movie theater you can find. Otherwise all the fantastic visual effects and sound and camera work are for nothing. And yet the disappointment of Gravity is that its innovations feel entirely formal. But thats a disappointment it took two viewings to feel. The movie isnt perfect. But it provides a perfect moviegoing experience and thats almost as good. The second time I went I watched a lot of the faces in the audience and they looked just as I imagine mine did the first night I saw it Whoa. Its the kind of good pop moviemaking Cuaron has done even better before. These last two movies have clearly been thinking about Stanley Kubrick. Children of Men is the film that complements one Kubrick A Clockwork Orange and exceeds another Full Metal Jacket. There are shots of Bullock in her helmet spinning fetally that evoke 2001 A Space Odyssey. But the film eventually feels like James Camerons Aliens right down to Bullocks haircut and skivvies. Cameron is among the directors Cuaron thanks in the closing credits and hes as good a commercial director as Cuaron is. This however is minor Cuaron. Its his The Abyss a movie that was famously doomed by the publics expectations. Its one of the best Hollywood movies about marriage but no one wanted that from the director of The Terminator. With a really good artist who works as infrequently as Cuaron does your expectations are sky-high. So is your inability to contain yourself. Not only do you not want the experience to end you grow frantic. You hate to feel it slipping through your fingers. You try to scoop it up again and hold on but it keeps falling away. You want more from this movie Kubricks cosmic grandiosity Camerons gusto Cuarons own self-topping boundary breaking. But Cuaron doesnt leave us with nothing. Theres the poignancy of his poetic literalism. The film gives us two very good stars in outer space. Clooney comes closer to Buzz Lightyear than you thought a living human could. His character is so coolly square that hes discontinuing himself. Bullock meanwhile is at the apogee of her Bullockness. A great deal of your enjoyment of this movie hinges on your enjoyment of the never-ending battle between her pluck and self-doubt between will and cant. She doesnt have Clooneys easy confidence (no one does). The one time Bullock tapped into it America flocked to bear witness and Hollywood gave her an Oscar. The last shot of this movie gives you a big blast of that Bullock. Regardless of where you stand on her charisma in this movie however its inarguable that Cuaron knows what he has done by situating her and Clooney among the stars. They almost dont need to go back to Earth. Theyre already home.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A rookie astronaut and a seasoned vet are stranded in space. Rated PG-13 (intense action and brief gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE Mesmerizing special effects white-knuckle action and visual artistry make this movie an absolute stunner. Thin characters though are the price paid for all the dazzle. CAST Sandra Bullock George Clooney LENGTH 131 Caution ""Gravity"" a deep-space thriller from Alfonso Cuaron may induce vertigo wobbly knees and shortness of breath. Its a rare combination of jaw-dropping special effects and visual artistry and it also works as slam-bang entertainment with just two actors and a swift running time of 90 minutes. If this technological marvel had a slightly stronger human heartbeat it would be a genuine masterpiece. That heart belongs primarily to Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone a jittery NASA rookie helping upgrade the Hubble telescope on the Shuttle Explorer. Her only co-star is George Clooney nicely cast as Mission Commander Matt Kowalski a combination father figure and guardian angel who calms her nerves with his creamy voice. They banter pleasantly with Houston (Ed Harris never seen) but the jocularity stops after a missile strike shatters a distant Russian satellite. Suddenly a shower of fast-traveling debris sends Stone and Kowalski spinning into infinity. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Its worth pausing to note that this entire opening sequence unfolds in one continuous 13-minute shot. Its a seamless dreamlike journey through the majestic Explorer its spectacular destruction the sight of Stone whirling helplessly and -- and -- a stomach-churning view from inside her breath-fogged helmet. ""Gravity"" is filled with such impressive visuals. Cuaron (""Children of Men"") who directed and co-wrote with his son Jonas makes innovative use of sound as well. Some of the films massive explosions make little if any noise and are more terrifying for it. The trickery though impressive can be distracting as when Stones tears become spheres that wobble toward the camera. ""Gravity"" also can feel overly mechanical a series of bodies and objects boomeranging in space. Cuaron tries to flesh out the story by giving Stone a tragic backstory; it helps though Bullock never finds the depth in her thin character. Cuaron also adds philosophical heft by borrowing heavy themes of birth and evolution from Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" That results in some beautiful but overly forceful visuals including a womblike pod with an umbilical oxygen cord. Ultimately ""Gravity"" works wonderfully as pure thrilling sensation. Feeling however is a different matter. 130 MoviesGravity trailer PLOT A rookie astronaut and a seasoned vet are stranded in space. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (intense action and brief gruesome imagery) CAST Sandra Bullock George Clooney LENGTH 131 BOTTOM LINE Mesmerizing special effects white-knuckle action and visual artistry make this movie an absolute stunner. Thin characters though are the price paid for all the dazzle. -- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff OUTER SPACE IN AN INNER SPACE Its one thing to make a science fiction film. Its another to feel like youre living in one. ""You would go to Shepperton Studio . . . and it looked like a weird giant science experiment -- because at the end of the stage you would see this cube 9 feet by 9 feet an empty cube in which all the walls inside were LED lights"" says Alfonso Cuaron director of the lost-in-space thriller ""Gravity."" ""And the cube was elevated 6 feet high and there was a long track leading up to the cube with one robot like the robots that they use for car manufacturing carrying a camera . . . that would go in and out of the cube all the time."" To create the effect that actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are floating in orbit around Earth nest- and bicycle-seat-like rigs -- as well as rigs designed and manipulated by ""War Horses"" puppeteers -- were deployed. While the actors were in their rigging computer-generated animation sequences were projected in that cube or onto it. Movies26 movies we cant stop watching ""And in both wings of the stage it was just rows and rows and rows and rows of geeks on computers"" says Cuaron.

When were lucky the experience picks us up and puts us down somewhere new.Thats Gravity an existential action movie that unashamedly embraces the sensation of awe. You remember awe vaguely perhaps. Its a rare commodity in the age of seen-it-all. Onscreen space once conjured cosmic wonder but its been a while Star Wars or maybe 2001 A Space Odyssey. Gravity a 90-minute blast of eye-popping glory with only two central characters (played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) feels like that kind of quantum leap.Ive seen it twice now and both times I had the same feeling of displacement when the lights came up and the same questions Where have I been the last hour and a half? What just happened?Short answer Two astronauts a charming veteran approaching retirement (Clooney) and a doctor with a streak of melancholy (Bullock) get separated and drift toward thin hopes for survival after a barrage of debris destroys the satellite theyre repairing. Simple enough right? Gravity is one of those movies that reinforce the futility of the question ""Whats it about?"" and remind us that films arent made on paper.Director Alfonso Cuaron and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki made dark dystopian magic in 2006s Children of Men. Here their canvas is the cosmos conjured in a series of long lyrical shots that emphasize the infinite space of the great beyond. Earth glistens at the bottom of the screen like a lost multihued artifact. Sometimes it fills most of the frame. The 3-D creates the effect for which it was invented but seldom reaches immense depth of field and texture and a sense of technology as more than a mere bauble or excuse to tack on a few more bucks to the ticket price.Has any movie made space feel so big and lonely? Again 2001 comes to mind. Like Kubricks odyssey Gravity uses space to shoot for spiritual ends. Sometimes it strains to hammer home symbols of religious iconography. More often the minimalist story written by Cuaron and his son Jonas works hand-in-hand with the majestic sights to make us consider the will to live. Gravity is very much a film about belief in something bigger than we are -- for instance the power of the movies.Bullock carries the load to the extent that any human being does and she mixes in rich shadings of humanity and occasional humor with wavering faith and steely resolve. But the real stars of Gravity are behind the scenes. Composer Steven Price deserves as much credit as anyone for Gravitys spell. Alien reminded us that in space no one can hear you scream; here Price orchestrates a throbbing series of low-end synthesizer movements that move in and out of the action like a character.I could tell when Gravity was manipulating me pulling my emotions this way and that arranging a sequence of tasks for its heroine to execute. Great. Manipulate away. This is movie magic of the highest order a passionately prepared feast of sound and vision.GRAVITYA Directed by Alfonso Cuaron.

"Review Gravity has powerful pull thanks to Sandra Bullock 3-D - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Gravity has powerful pull thanks to Sandra Bullock 3-D Review Gravity Kenneth Turan reviews Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Gravity"" is out of this world. Words can do little to convey the visual astonishment this space opera creates. It is a film whose impact must be experienced in 3-D on a theatrical screen to be fully understood.Though the strong work of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney -- the only two actors who appear on camera -- is essential to what the film accomplishes the great lure of ""Gravity"" is the way director Alfonso Cuaron cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual effects supervisor Tim Webber have collaborated to make us feel were stranded in outer space ourselves no questions asked. From its very first image of the shuttle Explorer and some of its astronauts floating close to 400 miles high with a mammoth planet Earth huge behind them ""Gravity"" revels in its ability to create images that convey the beauty enormity and terror that being so so far out there implies.PHOTOS Sandra Bullock Career in pictures Not only does that first image knock us out but Cuaron and company up the ante by spinning it out into a bravura sequence that lasts for 13 minutes without a cut. The director has done long scenes before -- a seven-minute segment in ""Children of Men"" is especially memorable -- but hes never pulled one off with all the built-in barriers of working in a facsimile of outer space.Those barriers were so steep that Cuaron one of the most accomplished directors around (everything from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" to ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"") ended up spending nearly five years on the project.Once the ""Gravity"" team realized that the only way to achieve the painstaking photorealism the project demanded was to seamlessly combine live action computer animation and CGI new systems had to be invented and new ways of using existing equipment explored. Even computer-controlled factory robots usually employed on automobile assembly lines were repurposed for cinematic uses.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013 The new technology also made possible what Lubezki calls ""elastic shots"" which go seamlessly from an exterior wide view to a subjective point of view from inside a space helmet. When you add in the exceptional way 3-D technology is used to bring reality to an unreal situation the result is a level of verisimilitude unprecedented for a story like this.Because the films pair of protagonists spend a big chunk of their time buried in space suits with the limited facial visibility that implies it was critical to have actors with the kind of instantly identifiable star personas that Bullock and Clooney enjoy to keep us involved in the personal dramatics of the story.This is especially necessary because its also clear that ""Gravitys"" ""lost in space eager for Earth"" scenario is on one level an unapologetic B picture exercise where whatever can go wrong most certainly will.But while the core story of ""Gravity"" is pure genre down to the workmanlike nature of chunks of its dialogue it makes the most of that situation by having a formidable narrative drive a plot smartly worked out to the smallest most persuasive detail and an intense immersive score and sound design by composer Steven Price.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubAs a result ""Gravity"" puts you completely on edge starting with type on the screen that explains that way out there ""there is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life in space is impossible.""Having established its location as a bad place for something bad to happen the films screenwriters (Cuaron and his son Jonas) spend time with two of the astronauts floating around the shuttle Matt Kowalski (Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock).As written and performed Mission Commander Kowalski is for better or worse a cocky type as much as a character. Hes the garrulous ""that reminds me of a story"" space veteran who is introduced having fun maneuvering around space with a new toy a portable jet pack.""Youre the genius"" he says to Mission Specialist Stone. ""I drive the bus.""If Kowalski couldnt be more at ease brainy scientist Stone is the opposite. Shes the nervous greenhorn trying to survive her first time in space and working hard doing the futuristic version of replacing a dead battery as Mission Control (a heard but unseen Ed Harris) kibitzes the situation.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsSuddenly very suddenly everything falls apart. An unexpected amount of debris is headed toward the shuttle faster than a speeding bullet and before you can say ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" Stone is floating untethered in outer space all communication cut off alone alone alone. And that is only the beginning.One of the things that makes ""Gravity"" stand out is that its visuals of interior space are as striking as what it shows us of outer space. One particular sequence of Stone gliding with weightless ease through spaceship corridors is remarkable for its seeming effortlessness. In fact the amount of work necessary to achieve that effect -- including the invention of a 12-wire pulley system attached to Bullock and controlled by some of the puppeteers who worked on the theatrical version of ""War Horse"" -- almost defies description.No one has more screen time in ""Gravity"" than Bullock and no one makes better use of it. Her bleak working conditions in this effects-heavy film demanded physical dexterity and the ability to withstand long periods of isolation but through it all her gift for connecting with an audience so essential for this kind of film never fails her. Director James Cameron is one of the small number of people thanked at the end of ""Gravity"" and this couldnt be more appropriate. His groundbreaking ""Avatar"" opened the book on the modern artistic use of 3-D and this film is the next chapter -- the most accomplished persuasive use of that technology weve seen from then until now.Gravity MPAA rating PG-13 for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Sandra Bullock Movies George Clooney Reviews War Horse (movie) Avatar (movie) Scenes from Gravity Review Gravity has powerful pull thanks to Sandra Bullock 3-D Sandra Bullock Career in pictures Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-gravity-movie-review-20131004,0,488680.story?track=rss",200,gravity16,gravity,latimes

When Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a medical engineer on her first space mission and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) a NASA veteran float alongside their shuttle the Explorer and suddenly find themselves ricocheting around in a storm of debris theyre transformed into human pinballs. If it werent for the fact there is no sound in space the caroming nauts would be ringing bells and buzzers as their suited-up bodies hit this fuselage and that solar panel. Bing bong bang. Shhhh. But for those of us who have not yet been in orbit around Earth or spent years immersed in Newtonian algorithms Gravity - which opens with one of the most masterly continuous shots in cinema history - feels absolutely authentic. A wildly suspenseful zero-g tale of survival 350 miles beyond the ozone layer Alfonso Cuarons space saga is emotionally jolting - and physically jolting too. I cant think of another movie in recent years where Ive felt so wholly invested in the struggles of the protagonists - popcorn-spilling armrest-gripping white-knuckling commitment to the characters and their life-and-death scenarios. More than four years in the making Gravity breaks new ground in its seamless mix of CG and live action the technological innovations required to pull this epic stunt off. But its a testimony to the writing (the filmmakers son Jonas Cuaron collaborated on the screenplay) and to the note-perfect performances of Bullock and Clooney that you never find yourself thinking ""How did they do that?"" The reality is a given. Its the human story that matters - how are Ryan and Kowalski going to get themselves out of this fix? (And what kind of a name is that for a woman anyway he wonders.) In a tradition of space movies that goes back more than 100 years from A Trip to the Moon to Star Wars to 2001 A Space Odyssey the Cuarons Gravity shows no signs of artifice blue screens green screens or puppet strings. When the astronauts do their slo-mo cartwheels tethered (for a time) to the ship or to each other backdropped by the cloud-streaked blue-green orb called Earth its simply breathtaking. We could be watching a space walk on YouTube (if the great Emmanuel Lubezki were the cinematographer that is). Bullock who spends a good deal of Gravity in a spacesuit her face behind a domed helmet visor - caught in reflection in both senses - projects a palpable sense of adrenalized dread. If her Ryan is going to make it through this ordeal she needs to summon all her skills training (not that much of it in a shuttle simulator) and clarity of mind. ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" Clooneys Kowalski cracks early on in Gravity before things really do turn bad - so bad that communication between the orbiting NASA crew and Mission Control is lost. And if Clooney sounds (and looks) like Buzz Lightyear here and there thats OK - a movie this gut-wrenching needs a bit of comic relief. Gravity is a classic tale of ordinary people driven to extraordinary things in their effort to survive. But theres a spiritual element too Watching the Earth turning and glinting in the sun framed by endless deep blue-black puts all us specks of humanity in context. Death is everything but it is also nothing. The world will keep on turning. Gravity is like a perfect pop song (and remindful of a few great ones like David Bowies ""Space Oddity"" - ""here I am floating round my tin can""). The film catches you in all sorts of ways. It is quick smart economical thrilling. And when its over - yes what goes up must come down - it leaves you wanting more. To which I can only suggest you see it again.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 433pm on Thursday Oct. 03 2013 Thursday Oct. 03 2013 Friday Oct. 04 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Theres a scene that comes early in Gravity Alfonso Cuarons stunning tale of survival that will absolutely take your breath away.Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a nervous medical engineer making her first space-shuttle flight and her far more experienced co-pilot Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are assaulted by a storm of space debris the detritus of a destroyed Russian satellite that leaves them marooned and facing their own mortality. Its an amazing sequence that not only shows a cunning use of technology but makes the case that Gravity is one of the few films that demands to be seen in 3-D IMAX.Yet Gravity also has an emotional and spiritual depth that like 127 Hours another film about man versus isolation transcends what might at first seem a gimmicky plot device. The film evokes the grandeur of the cosmos from the opening shots of Stone and Kowalski outside their craft set against the vast backdrop of the universe and a beautiful blue Earth. Shes making repairs while he (and a third astronaut that we only see from a distance) is bouncing around like a first-grader at recess.But things take a turn for the serious when that debris field slams into them ultimately leaving Stone alone to perhaps drift to her demise. Thats when Gravity becomes tense and suspenseful.While Bullock became a household name by starring in more lightweight material she holds her own here as someone coming to grips with her fate. Simultaneously shes extremely relatable; its very easy to identify with her as the newcomer who suddenly finds herself in way over head.Of course Gravity isnt the first movie to plumb the horror of dying slowly alone. The likes of Open Water Frozen and Buried have toyed with the idea of having only panic and prayers for company to varying effect but few pack the punch that this film does.Directed by Mexican director Cuaron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Y Tu Mama Tambien Children of Men) and co-written with his son Jonas Gravity evokes a sense of spirituality without being too heavy-handed or obvious. With help from cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ( The Tree of Life) its also a technical marvel utilizing 80 million worth of the latest cinematic technologies to actually propel the story forward not merely to dazzle and distract. That they do it within the confines of a concise tightly written 90-minute story arc makes it all the more remarkable.Like last years Life of Pi another beautifully rendered tale about facing the elements alone no doubt there will be debates as the credits roll about how the Cuarons resolve their story. Some will be dissatisfied; others will think its pitch-perfect and of a piece with everything thats come before.But there should be no argument about the achievement that the Cuarons -- and Bullock -- have created.

Whats new in Alfonso Cuarons 3-D space adventure is the nature of the motion. Its as if the movie medium had been set free to dance in a bedazzling zero-gravity dream sequence. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern explains why although motion pictures have been with us since the middle of the 19th century in one form or another theres never been one like ""Gravity."" (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures) Like many dreams of seizing intensity this one is both deliriously beautiful and charged with primal fear--not just fear of falling but of hurtling up spinning out breaking loose from our planets embrace. Two astronauts George Clooneys Matt Kowalski and Sandra Bullocks Ryan Stone are adrift in space after disaster strikes during a shuttle mission to the Hubble Telescope. Tethered to each other at first they tumble wildly out of control then try to regain their equilibrium conserve their oxygen and in a cosmic nowhere find the wherewithal to survive. Hes a veteran pilot with a gift of cheery gab that may have helped him ward off unwanted feelings in the past. Shes a novice a medical engineer with not much astronaut training and she feels everything from horror through dread and grief to resolve rebirth and elation. We feel awe from the start. The film opens with a 12-minute sequence of seamless action in which Matt Ryan the giant telescope and the shuttle that brought them there float serenely above a vast floating Earth until all hell suddenly breaks loose in the form of space debris. Newtonian laws of motion still apply in the maelstrom that ensues; the lawbreaker is the camera. It moves as no movie camera has done before--so fluidly that its loops and glides transgress boundaries and film conventions. At one point it closes in on Ryan then penetrates her helmet without pausing at the visor to study the stark terror on her face. As befits a superb movie Ryan is a marvelous heroine. She has suffered an anguishing personal loss that resonates powerfully in her desperate present; until this galvanizing assignment shed only been going through the motions of her everyday life on Earth. She must have been an overachiever to reach a position of eminence in her profession but her undertraining as an astronaut leaves her in a state of utter panic when chaos engulfs not only her shuttle but a whole tier of orbiting space stations and communication satellites in the extraterrestrial neighborhood. (""Half of North America just lost their Facebook"" Matt says wryly when all the circuits go dead.) Watch a clip from the film ""Gravity."" A medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut (George Clooney) work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) If Ryan is to survive she must augment everything shes recently learned with all the courage at her command. Before that though this wounded woman must replenish her will to live; that process is visualized through a silent exquisitely grave moment in which Ryan becomes her own star child. (The filmmakers youll be glad to know hold out the slim prospect of her making it back to Earth through a deliciously unlikely set of circumstances. She isnt quite doomed to exit the solar system as Voyager 1 did last year.) Until now a Sandra Bullock film often turned on spunk or rue. The rue was a result of the loneliness that afflicted many of her characters and became a vital ingredient of her hugely successful comedies. (My first column for the Journal in 1995 reviewed her in ""While You Were Sleeping"" and noted the scripts unlikely effort ""to convince us that this lovely young woman this vivid life spirit with a lyrical smile cant make friends cant get a date."") The spunk found its finest expression in Jan de Bonts ""Speed"" an action classic that worked as well as it did largely because Ms. Bullocks Annie was so smart and endearing as well as terrified at finding herself behind the wheel of a bomb-laden bus. Two decades after ""Speed"" Ms. Bullock has found the perfect receptacle for her humor and intelligence Ryans courage is matched by her intellect. She still does her trademarked rue particularly at the outset when the novice astronaut can barely keep her lunch down during her first spacewalk. And shes still movie-star youthful maybe more so than ever since her characters energy is so tightly tied to physical action. (One of the movies myriad achievements is portraying Ryans strength and athletic beauty without making her a sexual object.) Best of all though Ms. Bullock has replaced the spunk of her ardent youth with a complex womans depth of spirit. Its the best performance of her career. Mr. Clooney is movie-star charismatic even in a subordinate role a feat that he manages almost entirely with his voice since hes encased in spacewalk wardrobe from start to finish. His character isnt there for complexity. Matts wisecracks his corny stories his swashbuckling expertise and ultimately his gallantry are all canny components of the movies broad appeal. The script by the director Mr. Cuaron and his son Jonas Cuaron is as shrewd as it is inventive. Matt gets a few lines and deeds of heart-stopping grace. ""You should see the sun on the Ganges"" he tells Ryan from a receding position in the void thereby evoking in eight words the wonder of life on Earth. Mainly though hes very funny a carefree cowboy on the high frontier and his humor serves as welcome relief in a tale of barely endurable suspense--one thats told with startling compression in the course of 90 minutes. Objections have been raised in scientific quarters to the depiction of the international space station as being in proximity to the Hubble Space Telescope; theyre actually in different orbits. This isnt nitpicking since that proximity figures importantly in the plot but it isnt a cardinal sin against science either; no one would mistake this movie for a planetarium lecture. Watching the tale unfold youre truly awe-struck but you cant help wondering from time to time how they did it. (Though the movie is loud dont bother bringing earplugs. The sound design is hypnotic most of all when Ryan struggles in tight spaces and essential to the experience.) ""Gravity"" is the culmination of a yearslong collaboration between a visionary filmmaker and a team of artists and technicians who had to invent elaborate new tools in the service of that vision. Chief among them are the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (he devised a radically new LED lighting system that came to be called The Sarcophagus); the production designer Andy Nicholson; the visual effects supervisor Tim Webber and the editor in conjunction with Mr. Cuaron Mark Sanger. The 3-D photography is effective sometimes stunningly so but never calls undue attention to itself. What youre watching at any given moment is likely to be partly or wholly animated. Long may flesh-and-blood actors thrive but in the new world of tech-heavy productions theyre only one of many elements in the FX mix. ""Gravity"" floats on the shoulders of the Pixar giants--especially ""The Incredibles"" which showed that computer animation could do almost anything live action can do and ""WALL-E"" with its mysteriously somber opening sequence (and with its comic use of a fire extinguisher which is put to very different use in ""Gravity""). The greatest artistic debt of course is owed to Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" which dared to use silence serenity and space--screen space as well as space space--as never before. Long before ""Gravity"" went into production it was choreographed to the nth degree. Yet theres a sense of everything happening spontaneously of surreal freedom plus a fearful randomness that unleashes those debris storms. The newness is more than a function of the motion. Weve never seen such striking images of the structures our species has built in space. When were inside them objects float willy-nilly with tiny lives of their own. (How odd that one of Sandra Bullocks films was called ""Hope Floats."") A movie has never brought us this close to tasting oxygen. (Or feeling mud.) And the randomness can be poetic. In the midst of that long and frightening radio silence Ryan hears a staticky voice in an Earth language not her own accompanied by laughter and a babys cries. Hope floats indeed. In the immediate future ""Gravity"" is certain to find appreciative audiences all over the world; it speaks the language of big-screen action with surpassing eloquence and comes to a climax as thrilling as any movie lover could wish for. No one can predict what impact it will have on the movies future but consider what the film already represents--the conjunction within the studio system of a singular cinema artist and a full array of Hollywoods most advanced filmmaking tools. Its remarkable when you stop to think about it that Mr. Cuaron ever got the gig. Hes no stranger to technology having directed ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Children of Men"" but hes not James Cameron with a long history of technical virtuosity and hugely profitable action adventures. More remarkable still he has been able to translate his vision into a film that shows the world and the filmmaking world what wondrous new things big studio films can do. All too often in the recent past Hollywoods most magical tools have fallen into the hands of sorcerers apprentices who perpetrate the same old succession of explosions car crashes and fireballs. ""Gravity"" was made by a sorcerer. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE A Trip to the Moon (1902) The worlds first sci-fi fantasy by Georges Melies is still a source of astonishment and inspiration. In his 2011 ""Hugo"" Martin Scorsese re-created not only the making of the film but the place it was made the worlds first movie studio built by Melies near Paris in 1896. The travelers dont need all the bother of a rocket; theyre enclosed in a capsule and shot from a giant cannon. The Flicker Alley boxed set isnt cheap but its certainly comprehensive a beautiful Blu-ray restoration of the hand-colored original plus a plethora of scholarly materials. ENLARGE Royal Wedding (1951) Fred Astaire defies gravity by dancing on the walls and ceiling and in the context of ""Gravity"" reminds us how far special effects have come. The way he did it is well known by now a textbook case of imagination and ingenuity overcoming limited resources. With the camera bolted down a specially constructed room rotated around it while Astaire tap-danced blithely on its shifting planes. The movie itself is fairly leaden even though it was directed by Stanley Donen from a script by Alan Jay Lerner who wrote the songs with Burton Lane. ENLARGE Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) Alfonso Cuarons raunchy Spanish-language road movie set in Mexico gave Gael Garcia Bernal his breakout role. Hes 17-year-old Julio a libidinous exponent of working-class decadence. Julios traveling companions are Tenoch ( Diego Luna) a rich kid from a family that hobnobs with the nations president and the somewhat older Luisa ( Maribel Verdu) a beautiful creature of mercurial moods and variable maturity who is married not happily to one of Tenochs cousins. This peerless film locates its characters buried feelings puts their hedonism in historical context speaks of Mexicos tragic past and glimpses its chancy but hopeful future.

Yet thats one of the qualities that sets ""Gravity"" apart as a stratospheric achievement. Not just a futuristic drama its also a universally human drama about the need for hope in desperate situations. A riveting tale of two American astronauts cast adrift the film is a spectacle of brilliantly orchestrated action set-pieces and relentless narrative drive. It contains some of the most impressive feats of technical virtuosity ever committed to film. Yet its real power is in its urgency the pull of the storys anxiety and almost unreachable hope. Directed with a sure hand and a masterful eye by Alfonso Cuaron (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Children of Men"") ""Gravity"" is not about wowing us with special effects but touching our souls. Still the effects are key to the films power conveying its themes of loss and rebirth through imagery rather than dialogue. The uninterrupted stunningly choreographed quarter-hour opening shot is already the stuff of legend. The camera floats gracefully through space tracking our heroes rookie astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and veteran mission commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) as they repair the Hubble telescope 370 miles above Earth. The look is amazing yet familiar like a NASA documentary. The talk is easygoing. Kowalski keeps up a lighthearted line of quips and conversation to help soothe Stones nerves. An urgent advisory from Houston commands them to abort An exploded Russian satellite is sending a barrage of shrapnel their way. The lethal bombardment hits ferociously ripping the space station to smithereens and sending Stone spinning into the void. As her figure recedes the image sums up the disorienting beauty of space and its cold terrifying indifference to human life. Emmanuel Lubezkis crystalline camerawork suggests a hyper-real nightmare. GRAVITY  out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong language. Unfolding in real time ""Gravity"" follows the pair as they search for a ride home. Bullocks character must also search for a reason to live. In the films few cheesy decisions she is scarred by an old personal catastrophe that undermines her survival instinct. Wouldnt the psychological fitness tests astronauts undergo have picked up on that? And isnt it a thudding cliche that everything goes to hell on commander Kowalskis final mission? Thats the beginning and end of my nitpicking. Bullocks great strength as an actress is her underdog vulnerability and she is ideal in the role of a woman numbed by grief drawing on resources she didnt know she had. Clooney remaining chipper under dire pressure contributes a performance of warmhearted chivalry. His generosity as a performer mirrors Kowalskis selfless concern for Stone. Cuaron uses hard science and film technique to create haunting audiovisual details. His use of sound and withholding of it in silent airless space churns feelings of primal dread. The glancingly observed flotsam drifting through the space stations -- a cuff link a dental retainer -- are eerie reminders of human vanity. When Stone temporarily air-supplied strips off her bulky suit and rests her body curls into the fetal position complete with umbilical-like cables nearby like the Starchild in ""2001."" The harrowing triumphant final sequence is a breakneck race through states of being that reflect the evolution of life on Earth. It delivers us into a wide-eyed state of untold possibilities reminding us that no matter how far weve explored the heavens the human journey has just begun.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday October 3 2013 Follow AnnHornaday On its face ""Gravity"" -- a 3-D science-fiction action adventure about two astronauts at sea in a vast nightscape -- sounds like just another disposable popcorn spectacle an eye-popping refreshingly escapist palate cleanser before the heavy stuff yet to come on a groaning board of an awards season. And it is. But when an artist of the caliber of Alfonso Cuaron is at the helm ""Gravity"" not only delivers on its promise of a wildly entertaining space adventure but also becomes a groundbreaking addition to a genre already defined for the ages by the likes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Like Stanley Kubrick before him Cuaron is a master of the cinematic medium as both pop and high art; there are few filmmakers with his instinctive facility for long bravura camera movements breathtaking scope and taut storytelling (despite its ambition and sprawling canvas this expertly edited film clocks in at a crisp hour and a half). Thanks to Cuarons prodigious gifts ""Gravity"" succeeds simultaneously as a simple classic shipwreck narrative (albeit at zero-gravity) and as an utterly breathtaking restoration of size and occasion to the movies themselves. From its very first shot ""Gravity"" pins viewers back in their seats very rarely letting themselves regain their balance. The film opens on two NASA space travelers mission specialist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) as they work outside their space shuttle Stone trying to manage motion sickness on her first trip Kowalski having fun with his nifty new jet pack and clowning around with Houston hundreds of miles below. (Theres a wonderful old-school 3-D moment when Clooney reaches a giant hand into the audience to grab a stray bolt.) Its not too much of a spoiler to relate that soon enough the laughing stops -- after one of the most terrifying inspiring and masterfully composed visual sequences to be seen on screen this year. What ensues is one characters desperate attempt to survive as the oxygen runs out an anguished scramble through a vast unforgiving pristinely silent universe that Cuaron his longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and their effects team capture with precision elegance and an amazingly expressive sense of existential dread. Using an ingenious combination of live action computer-generated imagery cutting-edge lighting techniques and 3-D Cuaron puts viewers into the tumbling floating frighteningly un-rooted world of ""Gravity"" where Bullock and Clooney convincingly move with both balletic grace and puffy moon-man awkwardness. As he did in the 2006 masterpiece ""Children of Men"" Cuaron rigorously obeys the rules of spatial logic an absolute necessity in a frame where theres literally no up or down. With viewers in such assured hands they can safely immerse themselves in the story which as written by Cuaron and his son Jonas mimics countless plots that have gone before in which a plucky lone soul defies the odds to live another day (or not). Consonant with that tradition there are moments of ""Gravity"" that could be unforgivably hokey were it not for the utter persuasiveness with which the filmmakers and actors deliver them. Bullock does a particularly impressive job of marshaling whats become her hallmark combination of grit warmth and humor to invest a sense of gratifying ordinariness to a woman forced into extraordinary circumstances. Just when viewers think Stones plight couldnt be more cosmically overwhelming Bullock delivers the films best line -- ""I hate space"" -- with everyday whiny annoyance. One could debate whether ""Gravity"" really needed a sentimental back story to make its protagonist relatable but even that nod to Hollywood-101 storytelling and cliched ""hell of a ride"" one-liners cant detract from the sensory amazement and sheer grandeur of what Cuaron has accomplished. With sound image and perhaps most chillingly silence he leads the audience wherever he wants us to go -- snaking through a blown-out space station encased within the womb of an abandoned Russian capsule untethered and at large in a frigid indifferent starfield -- with complete authority astonishing verisimilitude and unsettling emotional depth. It goes without saying that ""Gravity"" must be seen in theaters to be appreciated; the prospect of watching this movie on anything less than a 40-foot screen is tantamount to listening to Beethoven through a tin can and a string. And this is that rare case when 3-D is essential. But in creating such a technical and artistic tour de force Cuaron has not only brought back a sense of special-ness to the cinema but also restored monumentality to its stars making it a point to film Clooney and Bullock so that they loom as imposingly as the planets along with which theyre helplessly spinning. Those larger-than-life proportions are never more pronounced than in the films final scene of almost primal rebirth. ""Gravity"" evokes ""ahs"" ""aws"" and finally simple awe. At the risk of sounding unforgivably hokey its one hell of a ride.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong profanity. 91 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Pictures shows Sandra Bullock in a scene from ""Gravity."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture Like astronauts some directors reach for the stars. In the apocalyptic ""Children of Men"" Alfonso Cuaron staged a lengthy action sequence as one continuous shot. He repeats the trick in the opening scene of his long-awaited follow-up ""Gravity"" then he adds another degree of difficulty building a drama around two characters floating in weightless space.In the balletic opening space-walking crewman Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) helps medical researcher Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock poignant inside a space suit) install a device on the Hubble Space Telescope. The waltz between the charming Kowalski and the self-protective Stone establishes an alternate set of spatial parameters for this 3-D film just as the curving surface of the earth below them re-frames the familiar landscape as a lone anchor in a limitless void.A heightened perspective on our place in the cosmos is the great feat of ""Gravity"" which soon devolves into a disaster flick albeit a bravura one. The Houston-based mission controller with whom the astronauts are conversing (voice of Ed Harris) informs them that space debris from a destroyed Soviet satellite is hurtling toward them and soon the lifelines -- to earth to each other and to the shuttle -- are severed. Stone is an engineer not an experienced astronaut and her physical reliance on Kowalskis jet pack has psychological and gender-role implications that Cuaron wisely simmers without overcooking. Stone has a backstory in which her personal loneliness echoes the emptiness of space and her struggle to reach a Chinese space station headed for earth embodies the big question of whether life is worth living. This isnt a philosophical treatise like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but as in Stanley Kubricks masterpiece the special effects are seamless and the sets reflect their human inhabitants. The floating objects inside the various damaged capsules include religious icons and family photos and Stones voice -- whether radioed to Kowalski or spoken to herself -- is a recurring reminder of the life force. Meanwhile in lieu of human or alien villains Cuaron vivifies inanimate threats such as a ball of fire and a fusillade of space junk.Even as it looks to the heavens ""Gravity"" is bound to earth where the beauty is in the details.

"Gravity with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Alfonso Cuarons Gravity Gives Outer Space Back Its Beauty Terror and Wonder Alfonso Cuarons Gravity Gives Outer Space Back Its Beauty Terror and Wonder Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 3 2013 330 PM Gravity It gives outer space back its beauty terror and wonder. By Dana Stevens Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in Alfonso Cuarons Gravity. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures After youve seen Gravity come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Alfonso Cuarons innovative science-fiction thriller Gravity gets one thing so whompingly right it makes it easy to forgive the few things it gets wrong (most of which wont fully register in your consciousness until youre well out of the theater so overwhelming is this movies visual and aural spectacle). Gravitys great gift to the viewer is that it gives outer space back its beauty terror and wonder. In the past few decades--the age of the blockbuster--the awe-inspiring black chasm in which our tiny blue world floats has become little more than a dull featureless causeway for the planet-to-planet transit of giant alien reptiles and Norse gods bearing hammers. The idea that space itself is fascinating frightening and worthy of our full cinematic attention--well you might have to go as far back as Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey to find a movie that makes that case as well as Gravity. Advertisement This is not to say that Gravity is a masterpiece Unlike Cuarons extraordinary Children of Men it doesnt quite pull off its ambitious effort to combine formal inventiveness heart-pounding action and intimate human storytelling. But it succeeds thrillingly at the first two of those categories and only misses the mark on the last because it tries a little too hard--which is certainly a welcome respite from the countless sci-fi thrillers that privilege the human story not at all. At any rate you have to see Gravity. Not just in the sense that its a good movie you ought to go to but in the sense that what sets it apart from your run-of-the-mill space opera has to be experienced via the eyes. The opening scene takes Cuarons signature shot--a virtuosic long take in which the action is carefully choreographed so that the camera is always where it needs to be--to the next level. Using extensive CGI (in many scenes the actors faces behind their visors are the only unanimated elements) Cuaron and his longtime cinematographer the wizardly Emmanuel Lubezki have created a screen space thats not only 3-D but convincingly polarity-free with no solid sense of whats up or down background or foreground. The camera in this first shot doesnt seem to be whirling through space as much as the universe seems to be revolving around us with whatever object we need to see--an orbiting spacecraft a characters face in close-up a dropped tool spinning into the void--floating into view just when we need to see it. By the end of that nearly 20-minute-long shot weve ascertained that the spacecraft in question is a shuttle docked near the Hubble telescope where engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) has been sent on her first-ever space mission. Her co-worker the laid-back veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney)--whos buzzing around her in circles in a jetpack as she replaces a part on the telescopes exterior--enjoys giving her a hard time about her constant nausea and discomfort. Weve also learned via mission control (voice of the ur-screen astronaut Ed Harris) that the destruction of a Russian satellite has created a dangerous cloud of jagged debris thats due to whiz past at any second. As the two spacewalking astronauts scramble for safety Ryans tether is severed and she spins out alone into space--imagine that impossibly lonely shot in 2001 in which an untethered astronaut drifts out into the void but from the astronauts point of view. How do you go about surviving by your wits when youre nothing but an object with mass in space subject to the cruel and inexorable rules of the law of physics referenced in the title? I wont tell you a thing about how Bullocks character goes about solving that problem because Gravity starts in early with the rug-pulling twists and keeps them coming straight up to the end. But I think its safe to disclose that this is an unusually paced action movie Despite its trim 93-minute running time theres room for both contemplative beauty and chilling suspense (a structure enabled in part by that whirling space debris which orbits the Earth at a set speed allowing big action scenes to alternate with periods of eerie inactivity and silence). I wish a little more of that silence had found its way into the screenplay (by Cuaron and his son Jonas a young filmmaker working with his father for the first time). Clooney and Bullocks exchanges in the early scenes have a disarming screwball charm--hes an unflappable if fatalistic optimist shes an uptight loner with a tendency to give up too soon--but as their situation grows more grave and the movies tone more serious the dialogue hits its thematic points--Loneliness Courage The Need to Connect-- a trifle too hard. Bullocks character is given a back story that verges on the emotionally manipulative and some late scenes where that story is referenced felt cooked up for the purpose of lending profundity to her struggle to survive this ordeal and get back to Earth. But Gravity was never in need of a profundity loan. The films recurring image of our distant revolving planet the light of its familiar human settlements visible from space already told us everything about what it would mean to a stranded astronaut to find her way home.

Pictures By Peter Travers October 3 2013 More News Gravity Is a Movie to Get Lost In Gravity Is a Space Masterpiece Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview Sandra Bullock Shooting Gravity Was Frustrating Painful All Stories >> Sandra Bullock in the performance of a lifetime spends most of this wondrous wallop of a movie lost in space alone where no one can hear her scream. And because director Alfonso Cuaron a master of pure cinema puts us right up there with her in glorious 3D you breathe like she does feel like she does and panic like she does until after 90 minutes of gulping gasping suspense you start seeing with blinders off. Like she does. More News Gravity Is a Movie to Get Lost In Gravity Is a Space Masterpiece Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview Sandra Bullock Shooting Gravity Was Frustrating Painful All Stories >> A great movie is hard to define. So let Gravity do it for you. With enthralling detail it offers thrills humor dazzle disaster poetic vision and mythic reach. Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey set the bar for philosophical exploration of an unknowable universe by gazing outward. With deceptive simplicity Gravity looks inward at something closer at hand but just as profound the intricacies of the human heart. Bullock plays Ryan Stone a NASA engineer on her virgin voyage into space. Her mission is to help repair the Hubble telescope. This rookie looks ready to puke inside her helmet. Her guide is Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) a charm-boy astronaut whos seen it all and has a joke for all hes seen. Clooney takes a small role and runs with it his Buzz Lightyear banter working to defuse tension. ""Youre the genius up here"" he sasses. ""I only drive the bus."" The buoyancy of these early scenes cutting through the eerie silence of deep space is in marked contrast to the horror that develops when a Russian satellite destructs and sends debris hurtling toward the shuttle. That leaves Bullock and Clooney to defy gravity and death nearly 400 miles above the looming Earth. Dont let anyone spoil what happens next. Just know that Cuaron the gifted cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual-effects wizard Tim Webber are trailblazers whose imaginations accept no limits. The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas occasionally drifts into dangerous emo territory but the films images speak with heart-rending eloquence. Cuarons artistry is evident in films as diverse as Y Tu Mama Tambien Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (the third and best of the Potter series) and the indisputably brilliant Children of Men. The Mexican-born Cuaron is a true visionary. In tandem with the Bullock tour de force - she blends ferocity and feeling into a triumphant award-caliber portrait of grace under pressure - he turns Gravity into a thing of transcendent beauty and terror.

Image 8 of 8 Gravity review powerful images - and drama 1 / 8 Back to Gallery To talk about ""Gravity"" is to talk about the visuals. Yet to talk about those visuals - and the ways in which ""Gravity"" represents cinemas most advanced and intelligent use of the 3-D process - is to talk about more than how the movie looks. As conceived by director Alfonso Cuaron the visuals dont exist in isolation and theyre not intended to make viewers stand off to the side and say ""Wow great special effects."" They are inseparable from the movies emotion and meaning. So ""Gravity"" induces a double effect. We watch and are continually struck by the movies beauty and visual grace while at the same time we pretty much believe what were seeing. Indeed its actually possible to watch ""Gravity"" without it ever occurring to you that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock arent really in space. The illusion is so complete that you may forget to be impressed. In a long opening shot you see a man-made contraption hanging in the blackness. There is a white dot next to it while in voice-over you hear Clooney as an astronaut bantering with mission control. The combination is stark - a vast nothingness contrasted with everything Clooneys voice has come to mean in terms of humor sanity and equanimity. That contrast is with us every second in ""Gravity"" the human soul versus the void. Is one bigger than the other? Does one matter in the face of the other? ... And then the dot moves closer and we see that its Clooney maneuvering through space with a jetpack. In other films outer space has seemed romantic but ""Gravity"" makes you feel what an awesome and terrible thing it is. There is no sound in space because there is nothing to carry sound. At one point Bullock is sent spinning into the void and she keeps on spinning because theres nothing to stop her nothing to kick against. That everything that lives and everything that has ever lived should hang suspended in the midst of such emptiness is a realization so daunting and profound that it can turn an atheist into a religious person and a religious person into an atheist. Such spiritually inspiring and destabilizing realities form the undercurrent of ""Gravity."" In terms of story its a disaster film beginning on just another average day on the job. Lt. Kowalski (Clooney) is floating around telling stories and trying to break the space-walk record while Mission Specialist Stone (Bullock) is running scientific experiments. Word comes in that a shower of debris is heading their way and from there ""Gravity"" piles on a series of calamities. But these are calamities taking place in space so they have a unique quality Things happen in slow motion and there are no other people there to witness it - and no mountains and no trees and no anything. The visual splendor of ""Gravity"" is more than a matter of execution; its also one of imagination. We see pearls moving toward us shaking and forming into spheres - only to realize these are human tears in a weightless environment. In another moment a partial upside-down vision of Earth is reflected in the glass of Clooneys helmet. Such images are more than graceful. They impart grace. If ever a movie demanded the casting of movie stars its ""Gravity"" because the audience requires vivid examples of humanity and - as the lead actors are covered up in spacesuits most of the time - we need to feel we know these people. To compensate for what he cant express with his face and body Clooney amps up his personality and puts everything into his voice and to marvelous effect. Yet will people realize the skill and strenuousness behind this seeming effortlessness? I imagine many will think its just Clooney being himself and not acting at all. As for Bullock its a role that requires displays of warmth relief grief regret and stark shrieking terror and she is up for every moment of it. She plays a woman trying to make her way back to planet Earth not just literally but within her spirit and she brings to it her familiar and eccentric humanity and a raw and almost painful vulnerability. See ""Gravity"" in theaters because on television something will be lost. Alfonso Cuaron has made a rare film whose mood soul and profundity are bound up with its images. To see such images diminished would be to see a lesser film perhaps even a pointless one. Gravity Drama. Starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (PG-13. 90 minutes.)

"Gravity movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Gravity a breathtaking space adventure  1/2 Video Gravity will be talked about for weeks Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tasha Robinson of The Dissolve discuss the ""experience"" of seeing ""Gravity."" (Posted on October 3 2013) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tasha Robinson of The Dissolve discuss the ""experience"" of seeing ""Gravity."" (Posted on October 3 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Gravity"" defies itself. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney play astronauts -- a newbie scientist and a veteran cowboy -- who dodge space debris and the usual narrative expectations while coping with a highly compressed series of crises 372 miles above the Earths surface. Its a nerve-wracking visual experience of unusual and paradoxical delicacy. And if your stomach can take it its truly something to see.Director and co-writer Alfonso Cuaron who wrote the script with his son Jonas has delivered unto big screens (the best way to go with this one for sure) an hour and a half of breathtaking oxygen-depleted cinema as accomplished and crafty in its illusions as Georges Melies ""A Trip to the Moon"" was 111 years ago. Im not sure its a game-changer whatever that means in the roiling film industry of the moment. The movie hasnt much on its mind; some of the writing is pretty clunky; and theres a rather cheap aspect to the female protagonists tragic secret. But ""Gravity"" is the first movie in a long time Ive been eager to see again and quickly just to re-experience the size and flow of its images and appreciate the howd-they-do-that? of it all.The movie begins with a killer 13-minute single take building on Cuarons most elegant sustained camera movement in his previous feature the undervalued ""Children of Men"" (2006). Bullock and Clooney are medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski respectively and essentially theyre starring in a two-character off-Broadway play in space with an 80 million scenic budget. The film interweaves an array of digital effects with intricately choreographed live action paying close attention to both human interplay and human/camera relationships.Stone and Kowalski along with their colleagues are wrapping up a space shuttle mission involving an add-on to the Hubble telescope. A few minutes into the picture disaster strikes in the form of flying satellite debris scattered by an explosion.The rest of ""Gravity"" finds Stones and Kowalskis oxygen levels heading toward the red zone while their communications with NASA mission control are lost. (Ed Harris who apparently never left NASA after ""Apollo 13"" is heard as the voice of mission control.) Stones attempts to reach the nearby international space station then a Chinese space station as she scrambles as fast as slow-motion gravitational circumstances allow occupy much of the rest of the story.Bullocks character is burdened by a grievous loss intended as the emotional underpinning of ""Gravity."" The movie conspires to put Stone through various degrees of physical and psychological hell. Its the slickest-ever serial installment of ""The Perils of Pauline"" with a more capable female protagonist. You never can tell with these things but Im very curious to find out how a global audience will respond to Cuarons stripped-down exposition-lite storyline. Whats remarkable about the film has nothing to do with anything anyone actually says out loud. The characters represent coping mechanism strategies Clooneys nattering veteran contrasting sharply (and somewhat self-consciously) with Bullocks determined if queasy first-timer.Whats remarkable about ""Gravity"" is all the silence coupled with the clarity and detail of the images of space walks and space panic and the view from up there. One second were seeing the Earth through Stones astonished eyes from inside her helmet; the next the camera appears to have drifted outside that helmet and were regarding her from a new angle. Then something comes drifting (or whizzing) into view from miles away.Much of ""Gravity"" has been photographed or assembled to appear to be happening in real time in a single take. Cuaron loves a flowing sequence but as co-editor of the picture hes also a wizard at knowing precisely when to cut for emphasis. The film reminds us of two things. One the pleasure of being in the company of a first-rate director who knows how to move a camera around. Two the pleasure of seeing a popcorn picture showcasing a genuine leap forward in cinematic and digital technology. The 3-D was added in postproduction but its a valuable add-on indeed.Clooney could scarcely be more relaxed and ingratiating in a role originally earmarked for Robert Downey Jr.; the characters banter may not be daisy-fresh but Clooney finesses it like a pro. Bullock remains front center and in a coolly controlled sweat throughout ""Gravity.""She and Clooney shot much of their footage in a 9-by-9-foot cube in costume calibrating their movements and dialogue rhythms to effects-based footage Cuaron shot with the films inspired cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki a longtime Cuaron collaborator. Actors usually are required to hit their marks but the rigorous spatial and timing specifics of the ""Gravity"" shoot daunted Downey who bailed and made way for Clooney.To say this sort of assignment requires a highly technical acting approach is to understate things. Yet one of the reasons audiences like both Clooney and Bullock has nothing to do with their technical facility and everything to do with their grace under fictional pressure.Way back in ""Speed"" there was Bullock getting truthful laughs out of the dumbest thriller premise ever.

"Gravity keeps us gloriously lost in space review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGravity keeps us gloriously lost in space reviewIn Gravity Alfonso Cuarons spectacular 3D space adventure the miraculous is immediate and enveloping for those who open their eyes -- and minds. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 3 2013GravityStarring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. Opens Oct. 4 at major theatres. 93 minutes. PGIn Gravity Alfonso Cuarons spectacular 3D space thriller the miraculous is immediate and enveloping for those who open their eyes -- and minds. High above the Earth slowly revealed in widescreen splendor by Emmanuel Lubezkis intoxicating camerawork two spacewalking shuttle astronauts defy a vacuum and also expectations.Article Continued BelowMission Commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) a NASA veteran making his last astral voyage is overwhelmed by the view of the blue planet below. Hes seen it many times but still cant get enough of it.His colleague Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) an engineer on her first shuttle mission is too engrossed in her work to appreciate the scenery. Shes struggling to install a replacement part on the Hubble Telescope and also to hold down lunch -- zero gravity doesnt agree with her.Routine chatter out of Mission Control suddenly changes to an urgent warning demanding common focus. A Russian satellite mishap has caused a chain-reaction of orbiting destruction knocking out communications links as it sends a wide swath of razor-sharp debris towards the NASA shuttle and nearby International Space Station.As crisis turns to calamity for the astronauts their slender link to Earth will become increasingly fraught as they struggle to hold back the eternal chill and silence that surrounds them.Not since 2001 A Space Odyssey has a film so vividly and realistically transmitted the feeling of being lost in the cosmos. Together Cuaron (Children of Men Y Tu Mama Tambien) and his longtime collaborator Lubezki (who also works with Terrence Malick) make stellar use of advanced filmmaking technology. They capture the deepest blues of Earth and the midnight hues of space powerfully affecting the senses with a 3D experience that is far above the norm. Make every effort to see Gravity on an IMAX screen for maximum impact.The film also connects on a purely emotional level with Clooney and Bullock realistically depicting the plight of stranded astronauts facing dwindling oxygen and rescue prospects. The ear occasionally lets the eye down but only a little. The dialogue co-scripted by Cuaron with his son Jonas yields to dull stereotypes and head-slapping idiocies.Clooneys Kowalski is a wisecracking flyboy halfway between Buck Rogers and Buzz Lightyear; Bullocks fretful Stone combines past-trauma seriousness with rookie recklessness -- would any astronaut outside of a cartoon go ""Eeny meeny miny moe"" while blindly punching control buttons?A second viewing of Gravity prompts the kinder thought that the dopey dialogue is intended as much-needed levity just like the laugh we get when a Marvin the Martian doll floats by in one scene. The tension is almost unbearable for most of the film and some comic relief is welcome and necessary.But you could watch Gravity with the sound off which is a thought that initially occurred to Cuaron. Beyond sheer entertainment value -- and theres plenty of that -- the films deeper meaning is profound appreciation of just how tiny we are in the vastness of the universe and how connected we are to the Earths embrace.Cuaron is out to inspire us and make us believe in miracles. He handsomely succeeds with a story grounded in hard reality and wrapped in heady contemplation of the infinite.Gravity isnt sci-fi; its a sky high.Read more about George ClooneyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Gravity | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gravity ) Gravity (United States/United Kingdom 2013) October 03 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Wow. If ever there was a case to be made for 3-D as a valuable cinematic tool Alfonso Cuaron has made it. Put alongside Avatar and Hugo (with honorable mentions going to Prometheus and Life of Pi) Gravity shows the power of 3-D when applied effectively and with vision. The immersive quality is undeniable and in some ways indefinable. Cuarons stated goal with Gravity is to put the viewer in space with the characters and he accomplishes this. The film will lose something if viewed in conventional 2-D and it will lose more when shrunk for home viewing. This is a review and a rating for Gravity on a big screen in 3-D. Thats the way Cuaron wants it to be seen. Thats how he envisioned it developed it and filmed it. Hollywood has so badly overused and abused 3-D turning it into a gimmicky cash cow that its almost shocking to acknowledge what it can add to the theatrical experience when employed by a director who knows what hes doing. Gravity isnt just a movie; its almost transformative and the visceral element is enhanced by the 3-D. Cuarons camera speaks more loudly than his screenplay. He opens Gravity with a 20-minute ""unbroken"" shot (following in the footsteps of something similar in Children of Men) that follows the two characters astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) on a spacewalk as they complete improvements to the Hubble Telescope. The camera dips and dives and moves in close to give a sense of what its like to be in orbit. Earth is a big beautiful globe gleaming in the background. The accident when it occurs is shocking and brutal. As an untethered Ryan somersaults through space the camera moves into her helmet and provides a first person point-of-view of her confusion. (Note those sensitive to motion sickness may have a problem with this scene.) Throughout the entire production Cuaron successfully strives to marry intimacy with the vastness of space. The 3-D is never excessive or superfluous. Its perfectly pitched for each scene. The narrative is a fairly straightforward exploration of the difficulties faced by a woman alone fighting for survival. Although Clooney and Bullock make a nice pair they are soon separated and the movie stays with Bullock as she battles seemingly impossible odds. Stranded in space with her only obvious means of escape smashed she must confront new challenges and dangers - a fire oxygen depletion a lack of fuel a storm of satellite debris - with only the simplest of goals going home. She can see it but reaching it alive is a herculean task. The level of tension is high. After a playful relaxed first fifteen minutes the movie never lets up (except during a brief interlude) and although only 1 1/2 hours in length the intensity is draining. (Thats a good thing.) Ryan goes from bad situations to worse ones; its almost as if Cuaron delights in using her to illustrate the relentless nature of Murphys Law. In terms of getting the basics of space survival right Gravity deserves a place alongside Apollo 13. While that film is fact-based and this one is fictional the details here are sufficiently precise to generate an undeniable sense of verisimilitude. Gravity is true science fiction not watered-down or transformed into space opera or fantasy. Sandra Bullocks contribution could easily be overlooked when one considers how much CGI is employed to craft the films final look. Her performance here however is easily the best of her career outstripping her overrated Oscar-winning role in The Blind Side. She runs the gamut of emotions from relief to despair and in many scenes must convey her internal state without dialogue and with the camera so close that the only thing we see is her face. Physically the role is demanding requiring her to be in peak physical condition. Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away she has no one to play off for a majority of the film but unlike Hanks her character is under a potential death sentence. Its impossible to conceive of her not getting a Best Actress nomination for this part. George Clooney is given co-billing with Bullock primarily because hes a legitimate movie star with proven box office draw. Those expecting to get a lot of Clooney will be disappointed as hes essentially out of the film before the half-hour mark. He and Bullock are the only actors to appear on-screen. Ed Harris provides the voice of Mission Control (a likely nod to his part in Apollo 13 - ""failure is not an option""). With apologies to Clooney Bullocks real co-star is the setting. Created entirely on computers its a wondrous thing to behold. Its not sleek and distant like what we see in Star Trek or Star Wars. It gives us the fragment of a sense of what it must be like to be in space surrounded by silence floating in a near vacuum seeing everything with a clarity that cant be found anywhere on Earth. The planets many flaws fall away and it is no longer defined by national boundaries but by land and sea. The simplicity of the setup reminded me a little of Moon the underrated Duncan Jones film starring Sam Rockwell. It has the same sort of mindset even though this is more action-oriented and has a noticeably larger budget. Both films however deal with the concept of isolation in space. Its a powerful psychological underpinning and Gravity like Moon explores it effectively. In this case we have the added benefit of state-of-the-art special effects and superior acting supplementing a well-defined narrative. Throw in some of the best 3-D ever and Gravity becomes the complete package. See it in a theater. If you wait for home viewing it will still be worthwhile but the impact wont be as strong.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Gravity Recommended Video Rated PG-13  90 minutes  2013 Jonathan Rosenbaum once wrote that F.W. Murnaus Faust ""integrates its dazzling special effects so seamlessly that theyre indistinguishable from the films narrative poetry and above all metaphysics."" The same could be said of this awesome sci-fi spectacle by Alfonso Cuaron which took several years to make but still feels spontaneous in its action and character development. An astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) are stranded in outer space after an accident separates them from their spacecraft. Cuaron uses 3-D to render the enormity of outer space terrifyingly palpable--when the characters recede they really seem to be falling into a void. As they struggle to define their humanity in the face of death that void assumes a philosophical dimension making the movie that rarest of breeds the intellectual blockbuster.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 03 2013 at 534 AM updated October 03 2013 at 129 PM comments Director Alfonso Cuaron loves challenges and contrasts. He did a gorgeously dreamy adaptation of the Victorian-era classic ""A Little Princess"" and followed that up with a modern updating of ""Great Expectations."" He made the dirty-flirty ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" went family-fare with one of the best of the Potters ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and then delivered the dystopian epic ""Children of Men."" So whats next? So how about a two-character movie set completely in weightless outer space? Shot in 3D and exhibited in IMAX? With the story occurring mostly in minute-by-minute real time? And -- oh wait -- starting off with a single tracking shot lasting a quarter of an hour or so? Yeah that sounds like fun. But what makes it truly exciting is that ""Gravity"" isnt just a director trying to one-up himself (even though he does). Its a filmmaker at the height of his powers using state-of-the-art special effects in a way that serves the story rather than simply substituting for it. Every once in a great while theres a sci-fi film -- ""2001"" ""Avatar"" ""Inception"" -- that breaks a new barrier of the imagination. Add ""Gravity"" to that small select list. Of course in some ways ""Gravity"" isnt so much sci-fi as sci-drama working from a set of circumstances as plausible as those in ""Cast Away."" Thousands of miles above the earth a space walk goes wrong. Veteran astronaut George Clooney -- and science specialist Sandra Bullock -- are literally cut adrift and sent spinning into the void. Can they get back to their damaged ship before their precious oxygen runs out? Fix it and find a way home? Like Clooney -- whose charms are turned way up here as a cocky space cowboy -- Cuaron is playful at first. Theres that breathtaking opening shot for one as the camera keeps moving objects keep circling and we feel weightless even sitting there in our plastic multiplex recliners. But then the disasters start to mount. And mount. Good as Clooney is though Bullock is really the star; she spends much of her time on screen alone and a great deal of that with only her eyes showing through her helmet. Yet as a civilian-turned-reluctant-astronaut she is immediately relatable especially in her lowest moments. We are on her side from the start. In Cuarons hands too. A keen visualist hes one of those rare directors who has a genuine feel for sets and the spaceships here are detailed and immediately humorously specific. In her travels for example Bullock passes through her American craft a damaged Russian ship and abandoned Chinese one. In the first a Marvin the Martian figurine floats by; in the second its a chess piece. In the third a lone ping-pong paddle revolves weightlessly. There are other bits of welcome humor some no more than winks; when we do get transmissions from Mission Control its the voice of Ed Harris once the determined center of ""Apollo 13"" and of course John Glenn Americas favorite spaceman in ""The Right Stuff."" Throughout Cuaron deliberately keeps the story small simple and human; Clooney and Bullock arent trying to shoot down an Earth-destroying meteor but just save their own skins. Sometimes its a little too simple or a bit too deliberately Hollywood (on a scale of 1-to-10 Clooney sometimes pushes his devil-may-care charms awfully close to 11). But those are small flaws in a big entertainment. Right from the start Cuaron aims for the moon -- and hits it. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and disturbing images. Gravity (PG-13) Warner Bros. (90 min.) Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. With Sandra Bullock George Clooney.

Share Tweet Of the countless thrillers set in the terrifying vacuum of outer space how many actually maroon their characters outside in the vast unforgiving darkness where the greatest threat to their lives arent dog fights or hostile extraterrestrials but simply drifting off into nothingness? Gravity Alfonso Cuarons first film in seven years does just that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock play astronauts stranded in zero-g after their ride is wrecked by the debris from exploded satellites. Low on oxygen and cut off in their communications with NASA the two float in the general direction of shelter struggling to keep their grip on each other and not go careening into the cold silent void. Lighting their way during this treacherous journey is the majestic glow of planet Earth always in sight taunting them with its seeming proximity. Thats a terrifically elemental premise for a movie one that Cuaron--the virtuoso who directed Children Of Men and the third best Harry Potter movie--treats as an excuse to indulge in some truly spectacular eye candy. Gravity is a remarkable technical accomplishment the kind of boundary-pushing F/X showcase that James Cameron seems to exclusively specialize in these days. Cuarons famously epic tracking shots realized as always by the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki move here on all axes. The first of them a 17-minute single take in which the camera captures a small spacecraft drifting into view and then plunges in close to observe its crew at work is one of the great feats of modern special effects. More than any other CGI event movie in recent memory this one immerses its audience in the reality of its world seducing viewers into believing theyre seeing real corporeal bodies--with heft and dimension--caught in the orbit of celestial ones. If nothing else Gravity makes the case for throwing immense resources at true visionaries; the blockbuster craftsman as adventurer Cuaron expertly blends the epic with the intimate. For every stunning 3-D setpiece involving a dangerous hailstorm of metallic debris theres a moment of small tenderness like Clooney framing Bullock in a mirror on his wrist as they bob their way toward salvation. So what keeps the movie for all its ooh-and-ahh grandeur just out of reach of greatness? The script penned by the director and his son is the chief culprit Cuarons camera may seem weightless as it floats through the digital cosmos but his clunky dialogue weighs Gravity down a bit. Were the film as all-action little-talk as Kubricks 2001--a milestone impossible not to think of when watching ships and humans dance balletically through space--one could take it as a pure sensory experience. But Cuaron obliterates the dreadful quiet with lots of stilted banter between his stars forcing a simple existential survival story to double as a parable about overcoming trauma. Much of that burden lies on Bullocks shoulders While Clooney gets by on charisma flashing pearly whites through the glass of a space helmet his co-star is slightly ill equipped to carry what is essentially a twofer. Cuaron saddles her character with a pained backstory meant to lend the events a psychological bent. All it really does is give the characters too much to gab about. (When Bullock tells Clooney that she could ""get used to"" the absence of audio its hard not to wish shed clam up and let the audience be engulfed by that great hush.) Seen on a traditional movie screen Gravity looks like a near triumph compromised just slightly by the tidiness of its dramatic trajectory. Stretch the film across a bigger canvas however and those flaws become tiny specks dwarfed by the enormity of Cuarons aesthetic achievement. Put more simply To see the movie on anything smaller than an IMAX screen is to not see it at all. Pony up to the extra cost and prepare to be wowed. Pure wonder is worth splurging on.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Gravity Share Comment With ""Gravity"" its as if director Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" ""Children of Men"") racked his brains to come up with a peril so extreme its nearly existential -- a lone astronaut free-floating tiny and untethered in the vastness of outer space. And then he put Americas Sweetheart in the spacesuit. Every so often George Clooney zips by on a sputtering rocket pack but ""Gravity"" is primarily Sandra Bullocks show in front of the camera and Cuarons show behind it.

Credit Warner Bros. Pictures In theaters Thursday Oct. 3 4 stars (out of 4 stars) This isnt just a film. This is a wondrous heart-stopping experience. And it must be said upfront This experience needs to be taken in on the biggest IMAX-iest screen possible. Youll think you were just shot into space. Actually you wont have a chance to think at all. The epic 13-minute opening act alone unspools without a single merciful cut. PHOTOS Sandra Bullocks red carpet PDA The ominous words appear first ""At 600 km above Earth. . . there is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life on space is impossible."" With Earth glowing in the background and the sun about to rise a crew of astronauts floats into focus. Two of them an easygoing veteran on his last mission (George Clooney perfectly cast) and a methodical rookie engineer (Sandra Bullock more on her below) banter while doing rote mechanical work. They will soon survive a sudden and terrifying disaster. Is the pulse starting to race yet? Good. Because those 13 minutes arent up yet. PHOTOS Sandra Bullocks life with Louis Its Bullock who must ultimately persevere under the extreme circumstances and figure out how in the world to get home. And what a nerve-racking thrill it is to watch her undertake the endeavor especially when she makes a few critical mistakes along the way. Masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) this taut 3-D sci-fi marvel dazzles on a visual level along the lines of Avatar and 2001 A Space Odyssey and frightens to the core a la the original Alien. Indeed in space no one can hear you scream . . .  so when Bullock helplessly spirals through the atmosphere and counts down her diminishing oxygen level you can only gasp for air along with her. PHOTOS George Clooneys ex-girlfriends Yet amid all the how-did-they-do-that effects Bullock is a quietly powerful presence. Playing someone who heads to space to escape her tragic problems back home in Illinois the actress conveys both blind fear and inner strength -- even in her cumbersome space suit. Consider her knockout performance one of the films innumerable wows.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday October 1 2013 545 PM If our exploration of space emerged from imagination science and the spark of inspiration the extraordinary ""Gravity"" uses those same tools to craft a movie that might correctly be called a thrill ride with a brain. Director Alfonso Cuarons (""Children of Men"") propulsive adventure drama presents a cosmos thats as relentless as any horror flicks hockey-masked killer a philosophical undercurrent as bright as a comet and the most essential 3-D since ""Avatar."" Miss this one at your peril. Hundreds of miles above the Earth -- the beautiful blue globe serves as both a backdrop and a beacon -- Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a scientist on her first spacewalk installs a scanning system on the Hubble telescope. Flying near her with a jetpack is her mission commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). This is his final assignment and hes mellow as things seem to be routine. Then suddenly theyre not. A violent debris storm from a destroyed satellite hits Stone and Kowalski detaching them from their shuttle killing other crew members and shutting down all contact with NASA. The astronauts hurtle through the emptiness then try to propel themselves to the damaged International Space Station. They hope to use an ISS escape pod to return home. But nothing is that easy. Thats where any plot talk has to stop since part of the infinite pleasures of ""Gravity"" are the intense calamities that keep coming. The dialogue may be ""movie-movie""-ish -- reminiscent of a certain style -- but Clooney charms us and Bullock enthralls us. They use a rocket-fueled pace (the jam-packed film is barely an hour and a half long) to establish Stone and Kowalski before breathtaking disaster strikes 10 minutes in. That setup is part of a hypnotic 17-minute uninterrupted take. Cuaron masterfully heightens eases and ratchets up the tension again in waves and he and his co-writer (and son) Jonas make sure everything connects. Stone and Kowalski may be untethered but their trajectory and goals are always clear. The stunning special effects are beyond compare. There are plenty of poetic moments including an astronaut floating fetal-like in a pod; teardrops that float solid in the air and a haunting lullaby drifting in from Earth. After the first debris strike we briefly can see Stone only by the lights on her helmet as she blends in with the stars around her. The movies spirit however is far from nebulous. We hear of a past sadness that still hurts yet ""Gravity"" is a celebration of humankinds ability to pull itself up from nothingness and fight the unnerving fragility of us all. Stone and Kowalskis only hope for survival is an evolved intellect and though this mind-blowing film gazes up in awe its feet are firmly planted on the ground. George Clooney is high above Earth in Gravity. Sandra Bullock at the controls in Alfonso Cuarons film Sandra Bullock is afloat in Gravity.

Science fiction flicks about NASA pioneers lost in outer space are a dime a dozen. But cool special effects applause-milking technical bravura and advance film-festival raves make Gravity more highly anticipated than usual. For the most part it lives up to the hoopla. Its a thrill ride in an amusement park for kids and eggheads alike. Think Epcot with a touch of the Coney Island Cyclone. The ride takes just a beat or two more than an hour and a half and you get your moneys worth. But forget about words tossed around by critics with hyperthyroid gush like ""brilliant"" ""visionary"" and ""groundbreaking."" It is none of those things. Gravity is nothing more than a classy work of 3-D entertainment and since everything moves in slow motion not a very lively one at that. The setting is an American space station floating around the planets like a ball of cotton. No oxygen. No sound. No one can hear you scream. The view is great and the silence is relaxing. But terror awaits. When astronaut George Clooney transmits the message ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" you better believe him. Suddenly the shuttle is assaulted by flying debris from a Russian spy satellite traveling faster than a high-speed Internet connection and the U.S. mission is totally aborted. State-of-the-art scientific equipment worth billions of dollars is destroyed. Communications in Houston face a blackout. Worst of all the entire crew is tragically killed except for two astronauts--the veteran mission commander (Mr. Clooney) and a lady research scientist with only the most basic skills (Sandra Bullock)--who are left stranded together in the cosmos trying to get back to Mother Earth. Initially antagonistic the wisecracking chauvinist flirt who hums pop tunes from inside his space helmet and the no-nonsense lady pragmatist who finds him unbearably annoying must learn to depend on each other for shared knowledge trust and moral support. Only one will survive. Three guesses which one--and the first two dont count. So there you have it--the entire plot of a formulaic disaster movie with two stars who communicate from space suits that cover everything but their faces. They only have one scene together as the Bullock-Clooney team and it takes place in a dream sequence. Still they manage an uncanny rapport through words. The action is restricted to clinging to the sides of a spaceship and the dialogue consists largely of stuff like ""Prepare airlock for arrival"" ""Report your status--give me a reading"" and ""Explorer do you copy?"" Gravity nevertheless keeps you hooked. This is not a movie about acting but the co-stars are in fine form. Ms. Bullocks usual unruffled demeanor is perfectly suited for the doctor she plays here and Mr. Clooney exudes his usual mischievous charm even stuffed into a cushioned space suit that looks like an oversize oven mitt. Mexicos Alfonso Cuaron who directed both Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and gruesome futuristic thriller Children of Men uses his vast experience with nail-biting 3-D effects to create sequences that are scary and delightful at the same time. The long opening section where the junk hits the space station is first-rate and the wafting weightless shots of bodies in space really convey the feeling of what it must be like drifting in the cosmos. When Mr. Clooney reaches out to catch a floating lug nut you cower in fear that hes going to grab you by the throat. Its the humor that makes this movie rock not a lot of pretentious gumbo about the mysteries of outer space or the philosophical pandering Stanley Kubrick was famous for. The critics who compare it to 2001 A Space Odyssey are delusional. Accept Gravity as pure popcorn-munching show business fun and nothing else and you wont go away disappointed. Leave logic at the concession stand. After Mr. Clooney cuts himself loose to save his partner in a gesture so noble you dont know if its heroic or insane what began as a two-hander in Flash Gordon costumes turns into a one-woman monologue and Ms. Bullock is left alone to spend the rest of the movie talking to herself locating a Chinese spaceship with controls that might get her home (how would she know since the voices and instructions are all in Mandarin?) climbing through explosions and fires inside the space craft manually expanding her dwindling oxygen supply and reaching mission control in a foreign vessel with nobody to instruct her in English. For a medical engineer on her very first shuttle mission shes just the kind of gal you want playing around with your broken telescope. The preposterous miracles she performs in the script written by Mr. Cuaron and his son Jonas are not even peripherally believable but Gravity is as Bullock says ""one helluva ride.""

RELATED NEWS Interview Alfonso Cuaron Five essential films Alfonso Cuaron 10 best space movies ever made By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Oct 2 2013 1048 AM ""Gravity"" is an amazing movie for a variety of reasons not the least of which is how Alfonso Cuaron tells what seems like a familiar type of story in a way weve never seen. There is practically no reason to put characters in space in a movie if youre not going to put them in dire trouble and Cuaron who co-wrote the film with his son Jonas in addition to directing it does just that. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a medical engineer and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) a veteran astronaut on his last mission -- again with the familiar setups -- are in the middle of a space walk as the film begins. Its an incredible 13-minute sequence that establishes both where we are (in the middle of the most realistic-looking space ever filmed) and who we are watching. She is serious-minded and a little nervous trying to repair some sort of gizmo crucial to continuing funding for her research. He is content to float around making sure shes OK cracking wise with Mission Control (Ed Harris who played John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff"" and the flight director in ""Apollo 13"" provides the voice of authority). Kowalski is going to enjoy his final flight. Then comes word a Soviet satellite has been blown up. The debris is heading their way at 55000 mph. A race to get back to their shuttle proves unsuccessful which is just as well The floating debris destroyed it killing everyone onboard. So now we are down to brass tacks two people in space with a finite amount of oxygen with no communication with Earth. Kowalski instructs Stone to continue talking to Houston because its possible the ground crew can hear them even if they cant hear the ground crew. Its essential to the story that this happens but its also oddly poignant kind of like telling someone to keep talking to a friend in a coma in case they can hear what youre saying. This also carries of course a hint of desperation. Its quite the predicament. Yet at no point does Cuarons film seem implausible. The solutions they seek are at once sound and difficult if not impossible. Kowalskis gruff charm and experience play well off Stones growing panic. A portion of her backstory may strike some as too much but its clear Cuaron wants Stone to attempt to save more than her skin. He wants to involve her soul too. Clooney is his reliable self once again playing the guy youd like to have a beer with even if its miles above the Earth. (Hed figure out a way.) Bullock however is outstanding. Yes she is an Oscar-winning actress but here Cuaron challenges her (and she challenges herself) like never before. Shes afraid literally out of her element. But shes also smart and tough and Bullock expresses this at all times even when shes stuck inside a space suit. Part of me wants to know how Cuaron (""City of Men"") filmed the movie. Part of me wants it to remain a magical secret. His use of special effects and 3-D is stunning. Its never boastful never a gimmick (even with the occasional floating nut bolt or bobblehead). Instead it puts us into space alongside Stone and Kowalski allowing us to see both how wondrous a place it is and how dangerous and terrifying. ""Gravity"" is full of layered dimensions in more than one sense of the word. It is a remarkable achievement. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(See it in IMAX 3-D; lets not be coy about the appeal here.) Earth dwells blue airy and massive on the bottom edge of the frame while shuttles and satellites pirouette with Kubrickian grace. Suddenly debris rains destruction on everything; then its all wailing alarms emergency checklists and the frantic tugging of safety cords. Thats Gravity for you. Almost as an afterthought two of the movies most likable actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney try to supply a little heart the former as a driven loner the latter as a yukster. Frankly you wont notice a word they say. Cuaron a magician who brought personality to the Harry Potter series is after pure near-experimental spectacle. Youll wonder how he got his humans to seem weightless in every shot (a triumph of computerized animation superimposition and other crazy techniques) not about the dramatic weight they bring to the scenario--close to nil.

"Review Gravitya remarkable space odyssey - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Gravitya remarkable space odysseyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 09/30/2013 030000 PM PDTUpdated 10/02/2013 054003 PM PDT A life adrift in sorrow. A terrifying accident in space. A risk-taking director a crack special effects team and an Oscar-winning actress.All these elements come brilliantly together on screen for a harmonic convergence in ""Gravity."" Featuring only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and outfitted with an astonishing array of live action computer effects and CGI the stunning film easily ranks as one of 2013s best. Even those with an aversion to sci-fi will get sucked into the existential pulse-pounder. The 3-D space odyssey chronicles a devastating mishap in space and the valiant efforts of two astronauts -- she a serious medical engineer on her first mission he a joking veteran ready to retire -- as they do everything in their limited powers to stay alive. That pretty much sums up the plot -- a satellite goes ka-boom in space the fallout debris nails a shuttle and two survivors get tethered together while oxygen dwindles and the possibility of latching onto a lifeline grows as likely as catching a falling star.The scenario while certainly gripping doesnt exactly shout out something inspired or bold. Weve seen many characters get stuck in space before. Nor does the setup seem substantial enough to be stretched out for 90-plus minutes.Wrong on both counts.In the inventive hands of director Alfonso Cuaron -- who shares cowriting duties with his son Jonas -- the dog-eared lost-in-space premise takes one giant leap for filmmaking. Cuaron isnt interested in cranking out yet another digital-effects extravaganza that mostly just engages the senses. Anyone whos seen his films -- ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" ""Children of Men"" and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- realizes the man entertains and makes us ponder the big picture.He is in top form here astonishing us by conveying how frightening isolating and altogether incredible life in zero gravity would be. But while you can easily enjoy ""Gravity"" just for its stunning visuals you will be even more impressed if you dig deeper into its metaphysical metaphorical narrative. Stirring scenes of artistic daring and depth -- Bullock curling up in a near embryonic ball a tear floating in the weightless air for example -- dont slide off. They stay with you long after youve left the theater.Cuaron isnt the only one responsible for pulling this off. The cinematography production design sound and special-effects crews deserve high praise as does the two-person cast. As Dr. Ryan Stone Bullock surpasses her flashier Oscar-winning performance in ""The Blind Side."" In ""Gravity"" she -- with the guidance of a taut script -- reveals insights into what it must be like to wander around in a zero-gravity existence. Bullock and Clooney also an Oscar winner make easygoing on-screen partners. While his role is smaller and not much of a stretch for the charmer hes absolutely perfect for it.Like its casting nearly everything about ""Gravity"" feels right from its appropriate but compact running time to its satisfying conclusion. That it explores weighty earthbound themes -- grief rebirth and renewal -- while giving us a spectacular thriller makes it all that more meaningful and powerful.Maybe in the end what ""Gravity"" is telling us is that theres another final frontier we ought to be exploring -- our own souls. This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Sandra Bullock in a scene from ""Gravity."" Bullock says making the lost-in-space movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron was her best life decision ever. (AP Photo/Warner Bros.

Pictures/AP Photo Movie Review Gravity 4 Stars. Wow. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense peril disturbing images profanity). Opens Thursday night at the Lincoln Square IMAX the Chelsea the Battery Park City others. MORE FROM Lou Lumenick Lights Out is a freaky mother-daughter ghost story Bryan Cranston and drugs -- together again in The Infiltrator Captain Fantastic is one of the years best movies A gorgeous starlet an ugly death - and a White House scandal Spielbergs BFG does Dahl right Art and commerce miraculously intersect in Alfonso Cuarons ""Gravity a visually enthralling popcorn movie with two big stars (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) that will rivet vast crowds for every moment of its 90-minute running time with not a second wasted. Compared by some to ""2001 A Space Odyssey Cuarons relatively intimate space epic is equally groundbreaking in the spectacular way it depicts space. But this film which owes a debt to top-drawer fact-based space dramas such as ""The Right Stuff and ""Apollo 13 is no cerebral contemplation of the universe At heart its the ultimate woman-in-peril movie sort of like ""Alien without the alien. That woman is Bullocks Ryan Stone a medical technician on her first space mission. Were introduced to her as she floats weightlessly 372 miles above the luminous surface of Earth while installing an upgrade to the Hubble telescope. To say a lot happens in this enthralling 13-minute opening shot would be an understatement. A cloud of debris generated by an exploding Soviet satellite comes flying straight at Ryan (silently because its in space) and mission commander Matt Kowalski (Clooney) while destroying their shuttle and killing two other astronauts. Kowalski a cool-headed space veteran tells bad jokes to the rightly terrified Ryan to keep her from sucking up all her oxygen -- even as hes desperately struggling to attach a tether to keep her from spinning endlessly head over heels in space. Lost in space and cut off from contact with Earth their only hope for survival is using the limited power in Matts jet pack to travel to a Soviet space station. There they may or may not find a usable escape module before another shower of lethal debris arrives. Spoilers dont worry me as much as they do some of my colleagues but this is a very rare case where I think its worth respecting a films secrets. So if you like you can stop reading right after I tell you that Oscar-winner Bullock -- in a tour de force as Ryan confronts not only mortality but her very will to survive -- owns this remarkable movie as much as her inspired director. Both of them as well as the film and its technical crew will be getting lots of attention come awards time. Clooney has a much less screen time than her but he provides a crucial dose of humor charm exposition and hard-earned wisdom to leaven some of the films most intense scenes of peril. Cuaron -- the Mexican director who helmed ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the best in that series -- guides his camera into the claustrophobic confines of various spacecraft. Inside the taut script by Cuaron and his son Jonas has our heroine confronted by such challenges as fireballs and operating manuals in unfamiliar languages. The films biggest wow moments and there are many take place in space which has never seemed as real visceral and simply gorgeous in any previous fictional film. The illusion is enhanced by the remarkable special effects used to simulate weightlessness. I am not generally a fan of 3-D movies but its extremely well deployed here to emphasize the vastness of space and to further immerse the audience in the story -- in a manner comparable to ""Life of Pi and ""Avatar. I havent seen the IMAX version but I strongly suspect its worth the surcharge if youre seeing it on a classic-size screen like the six-story behemoth at the Lincoln Square in Manhattan. How strongly do I recommend ""Gravity? Well Ive seen it three times already more than any other film ever before release. Its the sort of movie that reminds me why I loved movies in the first place.

But then theres the part thats--as we serious cinephiles like to say--infuckingcredible. 487 Shares Share 409 Tweet 67 Share 5 Share Email Print Share Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/? 2013 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. On one level Gravity is nothing new state-of-the-art Hollywood technology in the service of an old-fashioned supernatural (i.e. religious) theme. The premise Two shuttle astronauts played by two of our biggest stars (Sandra Bullock George Clooney) get marooned in space when speeding debris from an exploded Russian satellite takes out their craft and kills everyone else on- and off-board. So the drifting shell-shocked motion-sick medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and the gregarious veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) must find a working shuttle to get them to Earth--fast. Possibly its in the nearby Russian space station possibly not. Its a mess up there. Woven amid the multiple bombardments and cliffhangers is a stark spiritual odyssey A woman who is dead inside must find (or refind) her faith letting go to be born again. (Twelve-steppers like to say ""Let go and let God."") The movie is as cornball as all get-out and--once you discern the narrative arc--as predictable. But then theres the part thats--as we serious cinephiles like to say--infuckingcredible. The first shot of Gravity is very very long and entirely sinuous. We see a slice of the Earth and then a dot that turns out to be a shuttle moving toward us faster than we anticipate with three figures attached--two working on the craft one floating free. Of course it wasnt done in real time--its computerized--but its still one (count it) shot that goes from macro (the planet) to almost micro (a dislodged bolt floating into the camera). Its in these first pre-catastrophe minutes that the real and mind-expanding subject of Gravity manifests itself the Higher Math. My own puny brain goes haywire attempting to sort out the variables but computer programmers and Princeton mathematicians will find their own version of heaven onscreen. Is the camera moving toward the shuttle or vice versa or both? Or is it the Earths rotation thats controlling the shot? Or are all three variables working in tandem? Are there equations (or logarithms) for the way the bodies drift vis-a-vis the Earths rotation in zero gravity while the stars move in the background? What about the characters limbs weightless but subject to other forces internal and external? How do you determine the momentum and impact of an astronauts body as it collides with another or the side of a spacecraft with a head-rocking oomph? What about the debris? The shuttle comes apart the way something really would in oxygenless outer space--not with a Star Wars-like explosion of flames but in splinters and hard shards that spin (lethally) our way. All this isnt irrelevant to the human story. Sandy and George--I have a hard time calling them Ryan and Matt--have to calculate these variables themselves in order to live all while worrying about their fuel and O2 levels. (""O2 down to 2 percent ..."" ""Take shallow breaths ..."") If and when your child whines ""Why do we need to know math anyway? How will we ever use it?"" you can take him or her to Gravity and point not just to the awe-inspiring physics that put humans in space but the gods of cinema who made George and Sandy float. I saw Gravity in 3-D and so should you sitting as close as you dare to the biggest screen possible preferably in a seat like the one I had which rocked back and forth as I recoiled from the impact of light sound and my own bedazzled (and bewitched and bewildered) senses. Almost from the start director Alfonso Cuaron puts you inside the frame and subject (in your pummeled suggestible state) to the primal fight-or-flight instincts engendered by disorientation. The impact of the shuttles destruction sends Sandy spinning into space and we see the world (planet stars) from her point of view up-down-up-down-sideways-up the lights stabbing and streaking. The sound or its lack is essential to the illusion barely discerned NASA-speak on multiple channelsa-... a theater-shaking roar ... and silence. High frequencies go in and out underscored by a nearly omnipresent heartbeat that works its way into the music by Steven Price. Before the disaster there are passages of conventional awe--heavily orchestral--but then the score gives way to crackles and the terrible sound of silence. George plays it hearty and hail-fellow-well-met--his star power manages to come through even in his astronaut suit. But its Sandys movie. Shes our most down-to-earth A-list superstar which makes her the perfect person to connect with us in outer space. At first shes ashen and blank-faced. Then comes the sequence aboard a space station where she wriggles out of her space suit and floats--in a T-shirt and black undies--in zero gravity. There she is in the fetal position suspended in the films version of amniotic fluid about to swim through the birth canal that is a creaky clanky Soyuz--its the most expressive ballet ever captured in a sci-fi film and apparently achieved with the help of super-puppeteers from the War Horse play. Will she surrender to despair or be born again? Shes Sandy Bullock. Shes faith-based. I winced through some of the films climactic spiritual contortions but I had plenty of awe of my own for visual-effects supervisor Tim Webber and his team of obvious geniuses. And I dont think my reverence for the math is on an entirely separate track from the religious journey of the movies protagonist. Gravity is a crowd-pleasing version of what scientists and mathematicians are said to experience in their rarefied sphere--a wondrous fusion of faith and science. Its the Higher Corn.

Alfonso Cuarons overdue follow-up to ""Children of Men"" captures the beauty and terror of weightlessness as accurately as one imagines is possible -- or a civilian could probably tolerate anyway. A hard-science tale that offers a uniquely poetic portrait of hope and survival ""Gravity"" is a both a virtuoso technical achievement and a powerfully visceral cinematic experience. Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone a civilian engineer who joins the crew of the space shuttle on a mission to test an experimental scanning device. But after a cloud of debris destroys the shuttle its scattered crew -- including cucumber-cool commander Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) -- is forced to band together to avoid drifting off into space. As their oxygen supply dwindles and their prospects for survival grow increasingly dim Stone and Kowalsky make a last-ditch effort to find sanctuary in a nearby space station. But even if the duo manage to make it 100 kilometers with little functional equipment and even less breathable air they still have to contend with the impending return of the orbiting debris whose destruction of their one refuge may scuttle any chance they have to return to earth. Also read Pacific Rim Director on Alfonso Cuarons Gravity Its Mind-Boggling (Exclusive) In assembling the film from a concentrated series of vignettes -- each of which is photographed in long fluid takes -- Cuaron creates an immediate feeling of verisimilitude which is amplified by sound design and sustained by denying the audience a consistent horizon to remind them which way is up. Notwithstanding the massive blue marble that occasionally cascades across the astronauts viewfinders as theyre tumbling through space their environment is basically a pitch-black backdrop of nothingness and Cuarons first-person perspective -- including shots from inside Stones helmet -- makes it impossible for the audience not to identify with her paralyzing disorientation. Moreover Cuarons ceaselessly inventive camerawork manages to be artistic and functional at the same time creating set pieces of breathtaking dexterity while also showing the literal physics of how Stone navigates space in zero gravity. Clooney manages to be a little too Clooney oozing Danny Ocean levels of confidence and charm as the more experienced of the pair. Bullock on the other hand carries the weight of the film on her shoulders and maintains a delicate balance between debilitating fear and pragmatic resilience. After aging out of the ingenue roles that relegated her early in her career to playing spunky go-getters or romantic interests she has become an increasingly -- and successfully -- adventurous actress and she seems to apply her professional uncertainty in the unfamiliar territory of science fiction to the gradual empowerment of her character. See video Gravity Trailer Explains Why Sandra Bullock Must Get Home At the same time the film works best when it communicates character through action rather than exposition and the only time its emotional power wanes is when Stone and Kowalsky are put in the position of providing themselves with an ""arc."" Because quite frankly their battle for survival in humankinds most hostile environment is enough by itself to generate drama and it needs no additional trauma or back story to give it poignancy. That said its understandable that the film chooses to supply the audience with a form of verbal expression other than panicked breathing but with such a straightforwardly potent concept to explore the deeper underpinnings of their behavior provide an embarrassment of riches -- superfluous but effective dramatically speaking. It seems a bit early to declare the film a bona fide masterpiece but no film released in 2013 thus far has the singularity and the impact of ""Gravity."" While ""Children of Men"" is far too accomplished to serve as a trial run for almost anything this films sophistication feels like a direct outgrowth of the experimentation -- the alchemy of a unique idea and universal feelings - of its predecessor. Because if that film brought to life a childless world and made you understand the significance of its first new birth this one not only shows you the fear and desperation of character in a seemingly inescapable environment but makes you feel like youre trapped there along with her. In other words Cuarons technical virtuosity makes it possible to experience a catastrophe without actually having to endure it first hand -- which is why ""Gravity"" may eventually enlist more people to become filmmakers than astronauts.

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 8 2013 1206 PM Share Tweet Share Tweet As an excuse for Emmanuel Lubezki to rotate his camera through a bunch of cool-looking 3-D space hardware Alfonso Cuarons Gravity (Grade B-) does its job spectacularly. In narrative terms though its somewhat lacking essentially counting on viewers to be so lulled by gorgeous refractions of light and insane long takes a la Children Of Men that they wont care about dramatic anemia or missed opportunities for tension. The setup is simple. A collision with hurtling detritus leaves astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney the sole survivors of a space station catastrophe bobbing and weaving through the darkness. Visually immersive without being consistently involving Gravity like Avatar revels in its own virtuosity. Every scene aspires to be the ""open the pod bay door HAL"" sequence in 2001 A Space Odyssey as the scientists struggle to stay tethered to each other and to board what remains of their vessels. Still some of the hallmarks of Kubricks movie--the eerie silence the painstaking pacing--are in short supply. Cueing the viewer with a heavy-handed score Cuaron rarely slows the proceedings down long enough to generate lengthy suspense. The movie presents its characters with one challenge after another but doesnt take a breath to give the audience its bearings. Apollo 13 presented a more richly detailed space-rescue operation; the screenplay kept viewers acutely aware of say the condensation on electrical panels or which switches need to be pushed at a given time. Watching Gravity often feels like watching an especially long prep reel for Star Tours without ever being allowed to board the ride. Its true that the film--human-scaled technically precise inventive in its stereoscopy--represents a less depressing future-of-cinema scenario than Pacific Rims tedious gigantism but its a decidedly mixed bag. When it comes to capturing actors on film the aggressive 3-D makes Gravity look slightly cheesy. Clooney brings his usual insouciance to the task at hand but Bullock saddled with a too-pat back story doesnt convey the psychological depths her character requires. This is a case of technology put to expert use but one fears a future in which Hollywood decides to dispense with the humans entirely. Those who say television is the future of cinema might struggle make their case on the basis of the miniseries Southcliffe (Grade C) written by veteran miserablist Tony Grisoni (Red Riding The Unloved) and directed--though not with much of an apparent signature--by Martha Marcy May Marlenes Sean Durkin. The film chronicles life in the eponymous factious British town before during and after a shooting spree an event initially relayed obliquely. The first two of four chapters play tricks with chronology as a means of keeping viewers off-balance. Despite that suspense-goosing measure Southcliffe doesnt become compelling until the third of four episodes--though even then as Rory Kinnears Southcliffe-raised London-based TV reporter is drunkenly shouting that the town deserved what it got the movie has safely left the realm of common sense. Some affecting turns (by Shirley Henderson and especially Eddie Marsan as a grieving couple) salvage some of it but the film is an unilluminating--and with its unvaried palette of gray tones under-illuminated--wallow in grief. Another film about witnessing tragedy the JFK assassination drama Parkland (Grade C+) received some vicious pans at Venice; the title refers to the Dallas Hospital to which Kennedy was rushed after being shot which is also where Oswald died a few days later. The obvious comparison is Emilio Estevezs Bobby (2006) which similarly observed a cross-section of 60s America on the eve of RFKs assassination. But the crucial difference here is that the persons onscreen from Billy Bob Thorntons Secret Service agent to the young trauma doctor played by Zac Efron to Paul Giamattis suddenly besieged Abraham Zapruder are all directly involved with the aftermath of the murder. The feature directing debut of journalist-turned filmmaker Peter Landesman its not the best-made procedural heavy on cheap irony (""Nice day for a motorcade"" Ron Livingstons FBI agent exclaims at the beginning because who didnt say that that morning?) and overplaying tacky angles as James Badge Dale (playing Oswalds brother) is warned hell have to change his name and skip town. But theres still a morbid fascination in seeing these events play out from the immediate periphery whether its in watching agents decide how to load Kennedys coffin onto the Air Force One (hastily removing rows of seats) or learning where the Zapruder film was developed (a Kodak lab on the edge of town which was ill-equipped for 8mm--imagine if the footage had been overexposed). Tolerance for variable acting is a must; Thornton provides some gravitas as an agent who feels hes failed in his mission while Jacki Weaver as Oswalds mother gives perhaps the shrillest performance since the Kennedy administration. Much more current--maybe too current--is The Square (Grade C+) which really requires a provisional grade. This documentary from Jehane Noujaim (Control Room) observes the Arab Spring from the vantage point of activists in Tahrir Square capturing their changing perspectives as the government and constitution evolve. But upheaval in Egypt is very much ongoing--and even more than with The Fifth Estate this is a film in danger of being rendered dated by headlines at any moment. Edited until just before the festival--theres footage from Morsis ouster this summer plus title cards filling us in on August--the film is valuable for its ground-level view of a movement that the American cable news too often abstracts into facelessness. But the film seems scattered in search of a defined subject. As actor-activist Khalid Abdalla (The Kite Runner) explains on-screen it wont be possible to gauge the effects of the events in Egypt for decades--which leaves any filmmaker who wants to make a documentary on the subject in a bind. At a certain point a movie has to be finished and released especially if it might spur change. But it doesnt seem like this story has a clear upshot yet--or at least a cutoff that would allow Noujaim to focus the footage more clearly. In a cool development the Qamp;A following the screening adjourned to an alley around the corner from the theater where the filmmakers joined by a healthy crowd attempted (unsuccessfully) to contact another of the subjects Ahmed Hassan in Egypt via Skype as theyd done after an earlier screening. This time theyd prepared to project his image onto the bottom of mattress leaning against the alley wall. It didnt work but the scene was something else. The Square is grassroots activism first cinema second--and theres nothing wrong with that. --Ben Kenigsberg When it comes to festival coverage I subscribe to the perhaps antiquated notion that its not so important to be among the very first to weigh in on a buzzed-about title. Entertainment journalists thrive on getting the scoop and on feeling as though theyre ""shaping the conversation"" but waiting just a little longer--say an extra 24 hours--can help assuage the nagging temptation to align oneself instantly with the pro or con camps. Or maybe thats just my rationale for not wanting to brave the madhouse crowds of a Gala premiere. Either way while many of my peers spent yesterday watching debating or getting shut out of screenings of Alfonso Cuarons Gravity I was still catching up with the previous days major talking point Steve McQueens harrowing historical drama 12 Years A Slave (Grade A-) the episodic true tale of a free black man in upstate New York circa 1841 whos kidnapped and sold into the Southern plantation system. Whats not being widely acknowledged about the movie is that its not just the best feature McQueen has yet made but also--for all its unflinching brutality--also his most conventionally satisfying. Dont let me be misunderstood Theres nothing middlebrow about the film which tackles the nightmare of American slavery without sentimentality nor with the need to provide comeuppance or catharsis. Arriving less than a year after Tarantinos crass Django Unchained which trivialized the subject by treating its horrors as the catalyst for a kicky revenge fable 12 Years A Slave has a starkness that belies its status as an instant ""Oscar frontrunner."" Yet when held up against McQueens other pictures the Bobby Sands biopic Hunger and the sex addiction drama Shame this new one looks undeniably classical in construction. It is first and foremost a triumph of storytelling one less concerned with inspiring awe through aesthetics than investing viewers in its narrative. While those previous efforts found McQueen gazing upon his subjects from a remove his interest devoted more clearly to surfaces than psychology 12 Years A Slave erases the emotional distance between the filmmaker and his protagonist.  There are less showboating set-pieces--a few long single takes but no epic ones--because those would largely distract from the devastating understatement of Chiwetel Ejiofors lead performance. I tend to side with my colleague in his assertion that the film is best appreciated as a penetrating character study; to ascribe a grand historical agenda to its litany of sorrows is to rob it of its specificity. In any case whether one takes 12 Years A Slave as the definitive big-screen treatment of slavery or just a tough wounding vision of what one man is willing to do to survive theres no denying what it represents for its creator. Before our eyes a talented craftsman has transformed into a gifted storyteller. Strong acting was a through line in my third day at TIFF Besides 12 Years A Slave--which boasts great work from just about everyone onscreen including a tender Benedict Cumberbatch and a loathsome Paul Dano (who takes his most deserved beating since There Will Be Blood)--all of the high-profile American movies I caught on Saturday benefitted from the commitment of their stars. In yet another of his mid-career knockout performances Matthew McConaughey gets scary Machinist thin to play real-life Texas electrician Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club (Grade B). A homophobic good old boy with a taste for unprotected sex Woodroof contracted HIV in 1986; shunned by his friends and given 30 days to live by his doctors he ended up setting up an alternative medication ring for his fellow afflicted smuggling unapproved drugs into the country while the FDA was pushing the lethal AZT on the dying. As with too many biopics Dallas Buyers Club detrimentally attempts to conform its true story to dramatic conventions setting up a quasi-romance between McConaughey and doctor Jennifer Garner and establishing boo-and-hiss-worthy villains in Woodroofs battle with the government and pharmaceutical companies. Yet theres still something undeniably moving about the films trajectory which allows McConaughey to blossom into an empathetic figure--one whose homophobia fades as his fighting spirit intensifies--without losing his rapscallion spirit. Hes an indelible character around which to base a movie. Lingering sentimentality may be partially responsible for the good reviews bestowed upon Nicole Holofceners Enough Said (Grade B) which features the penultimate performance from the late great James Gandolfini. Truthfully though this is one of Holofceners better efforts largely because it eases up on the first-world problems she normally mines for comedic material. (A subplot involving the difficulty of firing a maid is the lone unfortunate exception.) Theres something more universal about this story of a single mother and middle-aged masseuse (Julia Louis-Dreyfus charming) who starts dating a fellow divorcee (Gandolfini) only to discover that hes the ex-husband her new friend and client (Catherine Keener) has been endlessly bitching about. Thats a fairly contrived sitcom scenario but Holofcener bends it into a loose lightly funny meditation on divorce getting older and impending empty-nest syndrome. Also yes Gandolfini is terrific. Things got weirder yesterday evening when I capped a day of American movies with two oddball international selections. Im still not entirely sure what to make of Celestial Wives Of The Meadow Mari (Grade B-) a bizarre blend of Russian folklore and sex comedy that unfolds over 23 vignettes of varying hilarity and grotesqueness. Director Alexey Fedorchenko who made the elegiac ethnographic drama Silent Souls has an eye for striking imagery and an admirable interest in disappearing customs. But Celestial Wives often feels like little more than a string of bawdy-surreal gags as though Apichatpong Weerasethakul had mounted a remake of Movie 43. (I know that sounds awesome and to the right eyes it might be.) Also some of the segments are just plain gross. See or maybe dont see the scene in which mischievous male spirits throw cups of jizz at the dancing girls who summoned them. Much more compelling though also exhausting was The Strange Colour Of Your Bodys Tears (Grade B) which finds Amer directors Helene Cattet and Bruno Forzani still gloriously riffing on the stylistic hallmarks of giallo. To both its benefit and eventual detriment this new one attempts to apply the duos nonstop virtuoso tricks to an honest-to-God narrative a mans search for the wife who disappeared from his forebodingly swanky French apartment building. The problem here isnt that Cattet and Forzani slice and dice their story into near abstraction; Amer did that too which was one of the things that made it such a pure-cinema delight. Strange Colour simply suffers from an excess of material; after a while the swirling camera moves split screen still-image violence deafening sonic assault and endless close-ups (of red lips leather-glad hands knives razors and lots and lots of eyeballs) becomes a little numbing. Until then however--and breaking points will vary--it feels like the most visually dazzling film of the fest. --A.A.

Movies | Inside Movies Toronto 2013 Alfonso Cuarons hypnotic Gravity is the space odyssey as head trip by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Enlarge Photo Close Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Film Images) Gravity Posted September 8 2013 -- 1030 AM EDT A paradox of watching special-effects films in the all-fantasy-all-the-time CGI era is that you can go to the movies every week especially in the summer and experience things that really ought to seem magical - a man of steel zipping through the air an endless zombie army shimmying over a wall cracks opening in the earth as the world ends - and as entertaining as much of this stuff is none of it at heart leaves you truly deeply amazed because eye-popping visual miracles have become so routine that theyre simply the new normal. (How far weve evolved from the days of ""Youll believe a man can fly"") But when you watch Gravity a tale of floating astronauts starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney set in what used to be called outer space (and now might be called 600 kilometers over the earth) you may find yourself thinking over and over again ""How the heck did they do that?"" Its not because youre seeing anything thats all that outrageously fanciful. Gravity though its set in space isnt really science fiction. Its a drama built around the technology of space travel as it more or less exists today. Whats astonishing about the film is its hypnotic seamlessness - the way that the director Alfonso Cuaron using special effects (and 3D) with a nearly poetic simplicity and command places us right up there in space along with the people on screen. Gravity opens with an extended shot of the earth looking gorgeously luminescent and real against the vast black nothingness and we hear radio burbles of talk between the astronauts and Houston. Then slowly almost imperceptibly a spacecraft enters our view from the right side of the screen - its a shuttle and the astronauts as we gradually come to realize are walking in space outside of it trying to repair a problem on the ship. Youll almost surely be reminded of 2001 A Space Odyssey because what Cuaron echoes from Kubricks great film - and what still seems haunting and novel in an outer-space movie - is the creeping rhythm of space the anti-gravity that places everything in a trance turning the ""action"" into a kind of moment-to-moment semi-slow motion a feeling of life suspended. As the camera drifts every bit as slowly as the astronauts gliding and dancing around them as they grab onto the ship to position themselves the effect of the sequence - and indeed of the entire movie - is to make us feel like were watching a single unbroken shot. At any given moment we may think we know how Cauron brought this off (he used CGI images he shot the actors in a studio and so forth) but whats thrilling about Gravity is the hallucinatory you are there sensation of free-floating cosmic rootlessness that the movie creates over time. Thats true even as were immersed in the quirky banality of the repair work or as we listen in on the jaunty ""office"" banter between Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) a veteran astronaut whos been walking in space so long that hes starting to feel like he belongs there and Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) a medical engineer whos still a relative newbie in space (shes struggling to keep her lunch down). But then theres a bulletin from Houston Due to an exploding Soviet satellite a bunch of debris is about to come flying at them and so they have to get inside the ship and abort the mission. Its too late though The debris shower hits them full force (the 3D places us right in the hurtling metal thick of it) tearing apart the ship. Seconds later there is no ship. They are lost in space. Gravity is a tale of survival and its suspense emerges from an implicit pact that Cuaron through the amazing verisimilitude of his staging makes with the audience. The movie is basically telling us that it wont cheat that the way the characters are going to get out of this if they do will be something that we can believe. The ebb and flow of Gravitys story is deeply organic - it seems to be making itself up as it goes along and thats how it hooks us. Yet because Gravity unlike the majority of science fiction doesnt hit us over the head with incidents what sustains our absorption in the movie is a rather tricky synthesis between our basic involvement in the plight of the characters and our head-scratching wonder at the awesome technological matter-of-factness with which the film brings the realities of space - the floating scariness of it the mysterious cluttered interiors of foreign satellites - to life. The two actors are sensational Clooney looking amusingly like Buzz Lightyear with a haunting chivalry beneath his bluster and Bullock as desperate and resourceful and anxious and brave and as primed to live as Sigourney Weaver in the last half of Alien. By the end of this year more than one commentator will surely have noted that Gravity creates an eerie bookend with All Is Lost the upcoming Robert Redford man-adrift-at-sea drama that is also in a very different way a marvel of organic filmmaking. What these movies are telling us perhaps is that we all feel a little adrift these days and that we want nothing so much as to get back home.     Four years ago the best movie I saw in Toronto - the best movie I saw all year - was Up in the Air Jason Reitmans sharply funny and melancholy screwball romantic comedy that was also a gut-punching snapshot of the downsizing era that was also a study of the charisma of George Clooney an actor so magnetically centered that his very presence raised the question Did he really need someone else to complete him? (The answer was yes but a hard-won yes.) Up in the Air did so many things at once and did all of them so well that it convinced me that Reitman had the talent to be a new-style old-fashioned mainstream Hollywood master - a Howard Hawks or Billy Wilder for the post-ironic age. Ive been waiting ever since for him to make good on that promise. But its starting to look like I may have to wait a long time. Two years ago Reitman delivered his follow-up film Young Adult starring Charlize Theron as a divorced author of YA fiction who had never gotten over her old boyfriend (Patrick Wilson) so she went back to her hometown and stalked him even though he was married with a kid and had no real interest in her. The movie was witty and sincere yet it was also trivial - the story of a basket case who persists in embarrassing herself which is fine (a little honest bad behavior can be just what movies need) except that she didnt really learn anything so the film seemed to circle around itself until it just sort of gave in and ended. Coming after Up in the Air Young Adult was no post-big-hit slump but I thought of it as Reitmans highly watchable post-big-hit trifle. Now after two more years Reitman has returned to Toronto with Labor Day adapted from a 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard and its the sweetest damnedest soggiest thing Reitmans lushly crafted version of a Lifetime movie set in 1987 in a lovingly photographed leafy New England small town with Kate Winslet as a depressed single mother whose life with her son (Gattlin Griffith) is interrupted - or more accurately completed - when the two are taken hostage in their clapboard home by an escaped prisoner played by Josh Brolin as a scowling macho in a Stanley Kowalski T-shirt but with a heart of TV-movie gold. How do we know how nice a guy he is? He never does anything thats even slightly unstable or off. The scene that seals the deal though is when he shows Kate and her son how to make a peach pie. His recipe and technique for the dough is a homespun dream and when he and Kate fuse their fingers on the sweet slimy peaches the movie lingers on this overly telegraphed moment of ""erotic"" baking as if it were the potters-wheel orgasm of Ghost as staged by Martha Stewart. Shot for gauzy shot scene for sentimental scene Labor Day feels like the exact movie Jason Reitman wanted to make which raises the question Why exactly did he want to make it? Hes an extraordinarily deft and sensitive filmmaker yet his gift for staging now so outstrips his instinct for choosing material that Im tempted to say that he needs a new agent or a new screenwriter (i.e. someone other than himself) or a new something that will shake him up. The period detail is as fussed over as anything on Mad Men Inside a grocery store every last item from the cans of Fanta on the shelf to the cards on a bulletin board looks like it came from the dowdy 80s. When we finally learn why the Winslet character is so depressed its affecting and I can appreciate that Reitman wants to tell stories that reach out and touch the women in the audience. But must he do so by turning a character like Brolins convict into such a noble scowling angel-man? Im all for sincerity in filmmaking but the quality that has defined Reitmans best movies - Up in the Air Juno and Thank You For Smoking - is audacity and he really needs to get that back.

Telluride Film Festival Review Is Alfonso Cuarons Gravity A New Kind of Cinema? Eric Kohn Sep 1 2013 204 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Theres an implicit irony to the title of ""Gravity"" director Alfonso Cuarons lost-in-space odyssey because gravity rarely enters into the equation. Almost entirely shot in a stunningly realistic but entirely digital representation of space the movie might be the most spectacular two-hander of all time. Working from a script co-written with his son Jonas Cuaron follows astronauts Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on a space shuttle mission gone wrong and sticks with them as they drift around the planet in peril for 93 minutes. The virtual camera practically never stops moving in several directions aping the weightlessness afflicting the characters with simultaneously hypnotic and disorienting results. Four years in production ""Gravity"" presents an artificial world that could only have been made today and provides a fantastic showcase of new possibilities. Cuaron has long explored the power of long unbroken takes ""Children of Men"" imbued battle scenes and car crashes with horrific realism while ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" practically spent more time constructing its wizardly universe than forwarding the plot. His use of the approach here however takes on entirely new dimensions. In the roughly 13 minute opening shot the shuttle slowly drifts into view while the planet pokes into the side of the frame while the frame increasingly magnifies the performers swirling about them as they tinker with the Hubble Telescope and trade barbs with mission control down below. While Matt enjoys a freedom of movement allowed by his jetpack Ryan and a third colleague remain tethered to the vehicle but their stability doesnt last long The sudden announcement that shattered satellite debris is heading their way forces the trio into panic mode but given little time to react theyre abruptly assaulted by speeding detritus and severed from their craft. Cuaron doesnt cut once creating the first of many immersions into the empty surroundings and the immediate sense that youre watching a historic achievement. Along with capturing the vividness of the accident he roots it in human experience as the camera gradually gets closer to his subjects and eventually makes its way into one of their helmets. Melting the CGI imagery into a physical intimacy with his subjects Cuaron establishes a delicate balance largely in place for the frantic remainder of the movie. While some cinematographers have voiced trepidation over the role of their craft in the context of such heavily digitized techniques -- most recently Christopher Doyle spoke out against ""Life of Pi"" winning an Oscar for Best Cinematography -- ""Gravity"" director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki clearly relishes the opportunity to play with new tools. Reflecting the same weightless of its subjects the camera possesses the free-roaming quality of space itself. At times it zips along with its subjects before hanging back and watching them transform into blinking lights against the unforgiving darkness as if a traveling astrophotographer simply happened upon the dramas of the NASA crew. The accomplishments of ""Gravity"" arrive right on schedule representing the culmination of several years worth of purely green screen storytelling in Hollywood productions that include ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" as well as Zack Snyders Spartan battlefields in ""300."" But while those movies and several others treated their fabricated worlds with traditional filmmaking techniques ""Gravity"" uses them in the service of a full-on ride. Which isnt to say that Cuaron makes things easy on his audience. ""Life in space is impossible"" announces an opening title card as Steven Prices overbearing score reaches a deafening roar that ends with abrupt silence. The discombobulated feel never lets up; the extraordinary sound design keeps pace with the restless camera. Despite the landmark feats on display ""Gravity"" fails to deliver an equally involving story. The Cuarons screenplay maintains a steady pace and some invigorating one-liners for Clooneys typically suave character but also clumsily attempts to work around the isolation of the characters by giving them somewhat uninspired histrionic monologues. Bullock a bigger protagonist than Clooney and on her own for long stretches of the running time engages in a conversations with herself that suffers from a forced sentimentality out of sync with the rest of the movie . But she still makes for a compelling survivalist her frenzied state nicely complimented by Clooneys usual and welcome smirking routine. Theres certainly ample humanism to legitimize the threat of sudden death. After a lengthy ""hike"" to the nearby space station the duo face another set of problems that further complicates the stakes of the scenario but Cuaron wisely changes up the surroundings. Inside the station the space suits come off and the audiovisual quality of the experience shifts dramatically. Contrasting the safe haven of the ship interior with the yawning apathy outside of it Cuaron sustains a love-hate relationship with the harsh conditions. ""I hate space"" Ryan sighs in a moment of humorous understatement yet neither she nor the filmmakers can deny its epic beauty The Earth as much a character as the abyss around it maintains a haunting presence its sprawling continents on full view for much of the movie and glimmering beneath the atmosphere. The constant visual bombardment makes it hard to entirely forget the fabricated qualities that give ""Gravity"" its appeal. Some of the POV shots lack the realism of the exteriors; it doesnt take a trained eye to spot the more unpolished CGI images. But ""Gravity"" gets away with dropping some of its realism because its implicitly about the evolution of new media. Compared by one recent viewer to watching someone play a video game and progress from one level to another ""Gravity"" is a uniquely contemporary work that merges the traditions of a conventional survival narrative with modern sights and sounds. Cuaron succeeds to a stunning degree at conveying the physicality of an otherworldly scenario rather than departing from it as so many over-processed blockbusters do. While unquestionably escapism as minimalist spectacle it delivers unprecedented delights. For that reason the regular story elements are something of a red herring. ""Gravity"" may suffer from being discussed as filmmaking in any usual sense. Cuaron always one eager to tinker with film form here has taken on the role of an Imagineer-like visionary crafting a cinematic rollercoaster thats both visceral and dreamlike in its capacity pull viewers into a queasy encounter with the realistic perils of space. ""Gravity"" lets you visit space without sugarcoating its dangers. Its a brilliant portrait of technology gone wrong that uses it just right. Criticwire grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? A hit since it opened the Venice Film Festival last week ""Gravity"" is sure to continue pleasing audiences in Toronto ahead of its October 4 release date. The combination of star power interest in the genre and technological wizardry should help it perform strongly and maintain some momentum during awards season when Bullock Cuaron and Lubezki all have a shot at recognition.

Reply A reader like any other May 12 2016 126 pm It would be very nice if you wouldnt tell so much about the plot of the film. I thought this was an analysis about the way of Cuarons making films not a list of Gravity screenplays plot points. Thank you. Reply Mirvish May 12 2016 126 pm Cant wait to see it but from what I understand the real technical wizardry isnt in green screen per se as much as the motion control robots to which the actors sets and cameras are strapped. Its a San Francisco company that modifies industrial car assembly robots tha worked with Cuaron. In other words I think it does Cuaronand his team a slight disservice to attribute the production to ""new"" technology as much as real artistic and technical genius in the use of and modification of existing technology.

In Gravity Sandra Bullock and George Clooney play nervous newbie astronaut Dr Ryan Stone and seasoned pro Matt Kowalsky whose work on the Hubble Space Telescope is violently interrupted by a catastrophic debris collision. Cut off from ground communications and drifting in space their only hope lies in making it to the International Space Station before Stones air supply runs out. Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron already displayed the depths of his skill with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men think of the eight-minute shakycam battle scene in the latter as he zoomed from bloody close-up to hectic overview without breaking the shot. But nothing he has done before comes close to matching the astonishing beauty force and originality of Gravity. This isnt just the best-looking film of the year its one of the most awe-inspiring achievements in the history of special-effects cinema. So its a shame that - as is so often the case with groundbreaking effects movies - the emotional content cant quite compete with the visual. The first half is close to flawless. Like the astronauts Cuarons camera is completely untethered allowing for astonishing feats of cinematic dexterity as Stone spirals off into deep space spinning uncontrollably we overtake and travel inside her helmet her breath the only thing we can hear her panicked gaze becoming the cameras view. The effect is nauseating but gloriously so. But then reality intrudes and the film loses pace. Played lightly Stones tragic backstory would have been a powerful emotional kicker. Yet as Gravity nears its conclusion honest sentiment is replaced by weepy mawkishness. Ironically the effect is to push us away from the characters and out of the flawless all-encompassing imaginative space that Cuaron has so painstakingly created. Still despite these flaws Gravity is cinema in its very purest boldest form and itll leave you weak at the knees.

Both Gravity and Don Jon have been given 4 stars and are nowhere in that league. To my mind 4 stars puts a film in the league of films very likely to be Oscar nominated - like Philomena. Truth be told I though Gravity was a bit of a bore - it went on and on. Its not that a find space movies boring - Apollo 13 was good. Finding herself alone in space Bulloch manages to destroy several space ships - one caught fire she crashed another maybe she also let the third one catch fire - by that stage I was getting bored. Was there a fourth she managed to wreck? My overwhelming feeling on leaving the cinema was that I wouldnt let a woman drive my spaceship.

I saw it in 3d but didnt experience any of the panic loss of breath dizziness etc that TH and others did. Perhaps it was the afternoon audience of pensioners all around me at least 3 of which spent most of the film rustling in their Sainsburys carrier bags for snacks which ruined the atmosphere. However Ive had this problem with elderly audiences before (and Im not young myself) but if the film has been good enough Ive managed to ignore it. Unfortunately Gravity just didnt hold my attention and I kept waiting for the story and some element of suspense to kick in and get me empathising with the actors so I could actually feel something other than irritation at the bag rustlers and boredom with what was happening on screen. The ending couldnt come soon enough and all I could think about it was that Sandra B must have lungs of steel and wondering if I could hold my breath for that long and is that the way astronauts are taught to exit a space pod because it seems a bit dangerous to say the least. Sorry to all the people who obviously had a much better experience with this film than I did.

Both are immersive movies they make you feel what it must be like in space both could be criticised for their plots and characterisation. Kubrick however could never have been accused of mawkishness like the latter parts of this movie. One thing that Cuaron did that I think was a major weakness for me was too many ""just in time"" moments it made it more formulaic than it needed to be. All in all though I really enjoyed the experience but it makes me appreciate even more the old tech SFX of 2001.

Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 12 2013Anastazja OppenheimFeaturedIn times when a minute-long Google search allows you to watch almost anything for free (if not always legally) filmmakers must look for new ways of attracting audiences to the cinema. Perhaps thats what Alfonso Cuaron had in mind when he directed ""Gravity"" - a movie that has to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. The plot itself is its weakest point for over 90 minutes we mostly observe Sandra Bullock trying to survive one spaceship failure after another although there are a few interesting twists and insights into the characters psyche. But more than a story ""Gravity"" is an experience. The visuals are so convincing that when a few drops of water fall on the camera many people instinctively reach to wipe their 3D glasses. In a way the film feels like one of there simulator rides in amusement parks - but its one hell of a ride.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 11 2013GedFeaturedA firm of two extremes - one the one hand the most spectacular visuals and on the other the weak script and characterisations. The plot starts of as quite plausible but about 45 minutes in descends into farce as the Sandra Bullock character fights to survive progressively difficult situations. Clooneys character was wooden and completely unrealistic - more like Buzz Lightyear than a real NASA astronaut. Sandra Bullock initially turned down her part in this film and in hindsight maybe that would have been a wise decision. Her acting talents were ill-matched to this film and her character lacked depth and emotional involvement. For a film that made high claims about its realism there were many numerous technical errors in the storyline too. The zero-g effects were initially quite convincing but in many cases the characters appeared to be hanging on the bits of spacecraft like someone holding on to a plane in flight when in reality there would have been no net forces pulling them away from the structure like that. Loss of comms to the ground would not have occured given the scenario presented. Getting from one spacecraft to another in the manner portrayed would never have been possible due to the enormous delta-Vs involved. Etc etc...And as for the final sequence well just ridiculous IMHO.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 10 2013Janet jonesFeaturedThis film was extremely boring and I really struggled to stay awake. On a good note it was visually good but lacked a storyline and was didnt appeal to me at all.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 10 2013Juan Carlos FeaturedI agree with a number of the reviews in that it is a film of two halves. The first half is stunning and must be seen on the biggest best screen you can. However it is all really rather ruined by an insipid second half. I found it difficult to warm to Bullocks character and on a number of occasions the script loses grip on reality and to that extent the film drifts to a rather disappointing end. I wanted to like it more but overall an OK 3 star film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 9 2013BigsandsFeaturedJust seen this movie and it was visually stunning but thats it.

I saw Gravity last night at the IMAX and it was great of the BFI to bring along the director to introduce the film. Gravity is unfortunately extremely flawed - visually it is superb. The huge IMAX 3D screen is THE place to see this film. There are genuine moments of terror suspense and awe. But once the visuals have impressed the film like space itself seems incredibly empty. The script is extremely weak the lighthearted tone jarrs with the severity of the scenes being portrayed on screen and whilst the entire film is quite enjoyable it just cannot deliver what it could have promised. Bullock is great Clooney a little annoying...its an odd film Gravity - its almost as though like space gravity or gravitas has been removed from the film completely. Its not all bad though - although lacking punch through its plot and script some of the visuals are truly breathtaking right through to the end.

Much like any art form great cinema is defined by its ability to transport those who experience it -- to an invented place to a bygone time even into a strangers state of mind. The medium can take us where we could never otherwise go and in the case of Alfonso Cuarons effortlessly riveting ""Gravity"" it can introduce us to fears that we never knew we should have in the first place. To hear it from veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) nothing beats the views of Earth and beyond from the stars. To watch rookie Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) hold herself together while working on the Hubble Space Telescope the vast void around them is to be feared rather than admired. ""Youre the genius up here"" Matt assures her. ""I just drive the bus."" Within his bravura 13-minute opening shot Cuaron (who co-wrote the screenplay with son Jonas) efficiently establishes our two main characters their respective skills and weaknesses and the dire circumstances that they will find themselves in an attempt to destroy an old Russian satellite has set off a chain reaction of debris the rapid orbit of which soon incapacitates their shuttle and effectively strands both in outer space. Now what? Thats better left for you to discover but know that the pacing rarely flags over a 91-minute running time as Stone and Kowalsky struggle to make their way back home. No matter the new dilemma Cuaron employs a remarkably lucid sense of geography and a fairly sound grasp on zero-G physics to convey their immediate peril and mounting hopelessness. Collaborating once more with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual effects supervisor Tim Webber the director exploits the camera-freeing scenario to even more elegant effect than he had in 2006s ""Children of Men"" (my 1 of that year) sometimes making his way from a daunting distance to within an astronauts claustrophobic P.O.V. over the course of a seamless take. The effects of weightlessness and worse are rendered impeccably throughout rivalling countless summer blockbusters (and with actual stakes to boot) and the use of 3-D -- a post-production conversion no less -- is incorporated to frequently astonishing effect. The sound mixing makes similarly canny use of both the silence of space and the cacophony of catastrophe that often pummels our heroes and Steve Prices score makes its own suitably bombastic contribution from time to time. Clooney rarely deviates from wise-cracking companion mode but his cool guidance under pressure still makes him an ideal foil to Bullocks already-fragile lead and although Dr. Stone is saddled with a somewhat boilerplate trauma to overcome the Cuarons set it up swiftly and Bullock sells her emotional journey as well as the roles more visceral demands turning in a performance of exhaustive resolve at every turn. Comparisons to this years Robert Redford survival drama ""All is Lost"" have been long in the making and entirely fair though I was myself called back to the surprisingly life-affirming tenor of ""The Grey"" (my 1 of last year). The fact that Cuarons film strives to be something more than thoroughly harrowing -- no small feat in and of itself -- solidifies its existence as a marvel of not just technical craft but sheer imagination as well. The one imaginable caveat that keeps ""Gravity"" from embodying every reason I go to the movies is its lack of a musical sequence (though in fairness I didnt stay after the credits). This is breathtaking dizzying filmmaking. This is truly awesome.

The late great Elmore Leonard advised writers never to open a book with weather. Does a lightning storm count? Last evening I was welcomed to Venice where Im just settling in for the 2013 edition of the citys film festival with a spectacular lightning storm over the Grand Canal. This is my fourth time at the festival as well as my fourth time in Venice and Ive seen these storms before--the atmospheric something-or-other plus all this water plus the magnetic beauty of this elderly and stately city combine to create the perfect conditions. But Im always struck by these storms; theres nothing like them at home in New York. And when I see one on my first night here I always wonder if its a good omen a promise of similar drama and majesty in the movies to come. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Alfonso Cuaron whom I now count as one of our greatest living directors hurled a massive bolt at me this morning with Gravity. I havent yet fully recovered. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney play two astronauts--one a medical engineer the other a sort of highly skilled grease monkey who knows everything about how spacecraft work--who find themselves adrift in space cut off from all (or almost all) Earth communication. This is Cuarons first film since his stunning dystopian fantasy 2006 Children of Men and his first in 3D. Im thoroughly sick of 3D movies and until this morning at least I would have been happy to never have to look at one again. But I wasnt prepared for the way Cuaron uses it to explore both wonder and despair in Gravity. Forget stretched-out blue people Peter Max-colored flora and fauna and explosions comin at you This is what 3D was made for.Gravity is remarkable because its both a spectacle and a platform for performers especially Bullock. Cuaron has some fun with stock 3D effects wrenches nuts bolts fountain pens a little Marvin the Martian figurine in its scrub-brushy helmet--all float by at some point in that optical neverland between the screen and our fingertips. Bullock and Clooney float too but its a different and generally more marvelous thing. In the movies early moments Bullock and Clooney have left the comfort of their space station. Shes intent on installing a very important whatchamacallit to a thingie outside the ship--doing so successfully will give her a chance at better funding for her research back home. He on the other hand is just drifting around being a goofball entertaining ground control in Houston with tall tales and general waggery. (The voice you hear from the home planet belongs to Ed Harris who played John Glenn better than anyone else could have in Philip Kaufmans superb adaptation of Tom Wolfes The Right Stuff.) The setup makes sense Clooney is the clown Bullock is the grind. Its a match made in heaven or at least the heavens.What follows is a romance with elements of romantic comedy and dream logic mixed in. If Clooneys is the voice you want to hear when youre trapped in the vast nowhere of space Bullocks face is the one you want to see. An early scene shows her drifting further and further away from everything she knows untethered possibly losing oxygen. Shes terrified but also astonished at what might be happening to her and her face has never looked more beautiful--cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki renders her skin as luminous as platinum. Even the sound of her breathing strained and intensified draws us close to her. This really is Bullocks movie. She continues to talk even after contact with home has been lost (Clooneys character has reminded hers that even though she cant hear Houston Houston may be able to hear her). She takes us into her confidence with her soliloquies--we might be the last human beings to hear them.Gravity is both lyrical and terrifying and sometimes Cuaron even merges the two sending us into free fall along with his characters. No space movie arises from a vacuum and the obvious comparative pulse points for this one include The Right Stuff and Brian De Palmas sorely underloved Mission to Mars. The Right Stuff isnt so much about space as about the space program but Cuaron--who co-wrote the script with Jonas Cuaron his son--captures the mingling of duty and curiosity that motivates any human being who actually makes it into space. And Cuaron just as De Palma was is alive to the empty-full spectacle of space and to the workaday poetry of the words astronauts use to describe it. At the time Mission to Mars was released detractors made fun of the allegedly stiff dialogue. But have you ever heard astronauts--who are usually men of science not Iowa Workshop grads--speak when they get that first long-distance view of planet Earth as a glowing orb? They grab for the simplest words which are often the best. (Elmore incidentally would agree.)Cuaron is even more of a romantic than De Palma if such a thing is possible. He finds all kinds of ways to link survival in space with life on Earth. There as here anyone might have reason to feel loneliness despair fear or exaltation and homesickness--for a place a person a planet--is universal. Incidentally the first person who tries to tell me Gravity is ""unrealistic"" or ""implausible"" is going to get a mock-Vulcan salute and a kick in the pants.Given the amount of balderdash we have to swallow just to get through a typical summer movie season taking a small leap of faith and imagination with Cuaron should hardly be a problem. Gravity is harrowing and comforting intimate and glorious the kind of movie that makes you feel more connected to the world rather than less. In space no one can hear you scream. But a whole audience can hear you breathe.

MORE FROM FRANCE 24 Venice looks to top Cannes with sex war and aliens Exclusive interview Ashton Kutcher talks Steve Jobs Racism sex crime French malaise hits big screen Indeed there were a fair number of empty seats in the theatre and free tables at one of the sun-baked outdoor cafe areas that make this sea-side festival such a pleasant bubble to play in. As one French critic told me mournfully fastening 3D glasses to her face in preparation for the movie ""Not as many people come to Venice now.""Thats more a reflection of the cash-strapped journalism business than of the festival itself which remains second only to Cannes in terms of international prestige and calibre of films selected.Gravity was anticipated with fervor--not just as a starry high-profile start to this festival but also as the unofficial kick-off of the fall movie season known in America as the Oscar race.And judging by the rapturous press reaction the film out in the U.S. on Oct. 4 will likely leap to the top of the list of titles aspiring to awards glory. The Mexican-born Cuaron made two dazzling pictures prior to this--the exhilarating sensual road movie Y Tu Mama Tambien (2002) and the gripping dystopian thriller Children of Men (2006) - but nothing hes done could prepare us for the sheer technical mastery on display in ""Gravity"".Centering on Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) a scientist and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) a seasoned astronaut the film begins with a jaw-dropping 13-minute shot that glides dips and turns with the two characters in space as they fix a mechanical problem outside their shuttle.To say that things go wrong from there would be an understatement.The films first half is an overwhelmingly tense and immersive sensory experience as Cuaron tracks the anxious Stone and wisecracking Kowalski trying to find their way back to Earth while contending with diminishing oxygen supplies and rapidly drifting debris from a Russian satellite accident.Alternating objective and subjective perspectives--the latter showing Stones view of the vast dark emptiness around her--the director cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual supervisor Timothy Webber provide a master class in fluid camerawork bold unfussy imagery and special effects that put most recent Hollywood blockbusters to shame.The casting of Bullock and Clooney is key to how effective the film is in jangling our nerves.As things turn bad then worse for our two leads Gravity becomes a ballet of bodies in motion--floating hurtling free-falling struggling--punctuated by Steven Prices foreboding score and the sound of Stones ragged breathing.The casting of Bullock and Clooney is key to how effective the film is in jangling our nerves; their familiar movie-star faces (visible mostly from underneath their helmets) warm voices and easy teasing rapport soothe us in several of Gravitys harrowing moments and make things even more disconcerting when their mission devolves into pure terror.Will Cuaron actually kill off two of American cinemas sweethearts? No spoilers here but suffice it to say that Gravity offers one of the most vivid big-screen evocations of panic I can remember.Much of the film is so transporting that its a letdown when a handful of corny Hollywoodisms start popping up during the second half. Cuaron and his screenwriting partner his son Jonas have given Bullocks character a back story that becomes too prominent--particularly during a monologue that seems intended to serve as an emotional climax but is distractingly sentimental.That scene and a handful of others brings out some Bullock-y mannerisms that mar an otherwise beautifully modulated performance and adds some unneeded fat to the films generally lean 90 minutes.Gravity shows Cuaron bravely pushing the form; its a bit of a shame he felt inclined to pull on our heartstrings in the process.A version of this post also appears on France 24 an Atlantic partner site.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Cuarons double fantasy comes true--and another dream the moviegoers--in Gravity a space epic of desperate peril and profound wonder. Gravity opens the Venice Film Festival this evening with the same blast of astonishment that greeted Ang Lees Life of Pi when it launched last years New York Film Festival. Both are thrilling 3-D dramas of survival in a hostile environment testaments to human grit and groundbreaking technical ingenuity. Both are the rare movies that need to be seen once for the ""Wow"" factor and a second time to try figuring out how Cuaron and his technical savants managed to make the impossible seem so cinematically plausible. No one dared to imagine this before; yet here it is vividly realized. You are there inside the awe and dread. Pi youll recall was alone on a small boat in the stormy Pacific his only companion a ravenous Bengal tiger. Sandra Bullock as NASA scientist Ryan Stone is stranded in space--no air no sound no connection to Mission Control--with George Clooney. So it could be worse. (READ Richard Corlisss review of Life of Pi) Having served on shuttle flights since 1996 Clooneys Matt Kowalsky is the bantering veteran Ryan the novice old cop young cop. Earlier he had transmitted a creepy Apollo 13 joke ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission."" But he also wants to reassure Ryan. ""Youre the genius up here"" this Buzz Lightyear tells the Doctor Newbie. ""I only drive the bus."" And he hopes she can enjoy the spectacle of being 372 miles above her shimmering home. As he rightly says ""Cant beat the view."" As Ryan works at fixing a glitch on the space stations jutting metal arms a message comes through from their ground control (Ed Harris himself a movie astronaut 30 years ago in The Right Stuff) ""Mission abort."" Debris from a satellite shot down by the Russians is headed their way; and as bright chunks fly past Matt still jokes ""Half of North America just lost their Facebook."" The laughter turns to terror when the rest of Matt and Ryans crew is killed. The space station arm jerks lose and Ryan spins wildly around finally catching Matts arm. Now they are tethered on a literally death-defying Cirque du Soleil bungee cord. They have lost contact with Mission Control as well as access to their oxygen supply. Alone together with time and options running out. (SEE The Gravity trailer with a section of the opening sequence) This amazing 13-min. sequence at the very beginning of Gravity is shown in a single shot. To say this is a marvel of camerabatics of visual choreography animation and physical acting (Bullock and Clooney worked on wires in front of a green screen) is to undersell Cuarons gift as a storyteller who takes the audience on a nail-gnawing space flight. Hes a cinematic astronaut whose Mission Control is his retinue of visual enablers led by Special Effects wizard Tim Webber. As the director told Entertainment Weeklys Jess Cagle ""Each single bit of film is a different technology."" Beyond technology Cuaron plays daringly and dexterously with point-of-view at one moment youre inside Ryans helmet as she surveys the bleak silence then in a subtle shift youre outside to gauge her reaction. The 3-D effects added in post-production provide their own extraterrestrial startle a hailstorm of debris hurtles at you as do a space travelers thoughts at the realization of being truly alone in the universe. [WARNING FOR (VERY VEILED) SPOILER] Like Life of Pi and J.C. Chandors All Is Lost--which manages the even bolder narrative trick of stranding a sailor (Robert Redford) with neither words nor backstory--Gravity eventually becomes a story of self-reliance of finding ways to survive and a reason to live. When Ryan reaches a Russian space station and sheds her astronaut gear until shes down to Ripleys undies in Alien she slowly revolves eyes closed in a fetal position a child waiting to be born or die. At the end of the movie an ancient astronaut emerges from the sea as if to recapitulate the evolution of humankind from sea creature. [END OF TORTUOUSLY VEILED SPOILER ALERT.] (READ Mary Corlisss review of All Is Lost) Some movies take forever to make. Gravity which Cuaron wrote with his son Jonas was in pre-production soon after the director finished Children of Men in 2006 went through two studios and more than a dozen actors for the main roles. Robert Downey Jr. was to play Matt but dropped out in 2011 allowing Clooney to bring his nonpareil charm bravado and maturity to the role. Cuaron offered the Ryan part to Angelina Jolie twice and then to Natalie Portman Jennifer Lopez Rachel Weisz Marion Cotillard Carey Mulligan Blake Lively Scarlett Johansson Olivia Wilde--everybody. When these actresses see what Bullock has been given in the role and the fiery commitment she gives to it they should all whisper a sincere Rick Perry-style ""Oops.""     Todays other entry Venezia 70 Future Reloaded comprises short films a minute or so each from 70 different directors including Bernardo Bertolucci Ermanno Olmi Catherine Breillat William Friedkin Atom Egoyan Paul Schrader Todd Solondz and the omnipresent James Franco. Many of these auteurs mourn the death of classic 35mm film in the flowering or festering of the digital age. Yes there are few ""films"" at the Venice Film Festival. Even the retrospective selections such as Roberto Rossellinis Paisan and Friedkins Sorcerer have been restored digitally. We should mourn the demise of a glorious century or more when ""film"" meant the passage of celluloid or acetate at 24 frames per second through the sprockets of a projector. Now its almost all on disc not pictures but pixels. But what Avatar achieved--and Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Life of Pi and now Gravity each outdoing its predecessor in the filmmakers eternal quest to astonish us--represents a triumph of digital technology and human artistry. Cuaron shows things that cannot be but miraculously are in the fearful beautiful reality of the space world above our world. If the film past is dead Gravity shows us the glory of cinemas future. It thrills on so many levels. And because Cuaron is a movie visionary of the highest order you truly cant beat the view.

TWITTER George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star as astronauts in Alfonso Cuarons jaw-dropping space thriller. At once the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space Gravity is a thrillingly realized survival story spiked with interludes of breath-catching tension and startling surprise. Not at all a science fiction film in the conventional sense Alfonso Cuarons first feature in seven years has no aliens space ship battles or dystopian societies just the intimate spectacle of a man and a woman trying to cope in the most hostile possible environment across a very tight 90 minutes. World premiered at the Venice Film Festival with Telluride showings following quickly on its heels this Warner Bros. release is smart but not arty dramatically straightforward but so dazzlingly told as to make it a benchmark in its field. Graced by exemplary 3D work and bound to look great in Imax the film seems set to soar commercially around the world. PHOTOS Toronto 2013 The Films ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" George Clooneys veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky half-jokes at the outset from his perch in orbit around Earth which looms massively beneath. Its a sentiment few viewers will agree with once their jaws begin dropping at Cuarons astonishing 13-minute opening shot which gyrates and swoops and loops and turns in concert with the movements of the space shuttle and those of Matt who jets around untethered while mission scientist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) tries to fix a technical problem outside the ship. Its as if Max Ophuls were let loose in outer space so elegant is the visual continuity making for a film that will have buffs and casual fans alike gaping and wondering ""How did they do that?"" and returning for multiple viewings just to imbibe the sheer virtuosity of it all. PHOTOS George Clooney Career in Pictures The story written by Cuaron and his son Jonas is very simple and straightforward How will the two surviving team members of a crippled American space shuttle contrive to get back to Earth before their oxygen runs out? Old-timer Kowalsky who flew his first mission in 1996 takes a self-deprecating attitude with space rookie Stone -- ""Youre the genius up here I only drive the bus."" -- but his smart-alecky kidding scarcely conceals his serious professionalism and vast knowledge of the ins and outs of staying alive in the frigid void. Before Cuaron even resorts to his first cut the peril jacks way up with word of approaching space debris the result of a chain reaction from the Russians having shot down one of their own satellites. Suddenly and shockingly the empty space is filled with a metallic torrent from which only dumb luck can save the exposed space travelers. In this terrifying interlude the ship is damaged and Stone her umbilical cord severed tumbles toward oblivion. VIDEO Gravity Sandra Bullock Fights to Rescue George Clooney Here as elsewhere in the film Cuaron coils the tension and visceral impact of key scenes via a startling mix of the objective and subjective and the extreme contrast between the stillness of empty space and the abrupt arrival of terrible threats. This is achieved by switching from the eerie electronic heaves of Steven Prices insidiously effective score to total silence; from violent physical action to tight shots of Stones face her breath visible on the inside of her mask and her nervous inhaling and exhaling the only sounds to be heard; from the beauty of a green blue and tan planet on one side and the depths of infinite darkness on the other; from the awe of the cosmic to the terror of nothingness from the warmth of the sun to the coldness of eternal limbo. These oppositions provide the sensory frame for a narrative that soon after Kowalsky rescues Stone from her trajectory into deep space shoots off in an unexpected direction. Urgently looking for a safe haven Kowalsky spots a Russian space station in the distance which might sustain them until a rescue ship can be sent up. Their oxygen supply is running low and Stone isnt convinced they can make it. Surprises await on the Russian craft and yet again on another space vessel and when a weightless Stone goes floating about in nothing but her underwear its impossible not to think of Sigourney Weavers Ripley in Alien. But no monsters pop out baring scary teeth only adverse circumstances of such extremity that they place Gravity alongside Life of Pi and J.C. Chandors contemporaneous All Is Lost as a survival tale requiring a heroically concentrated form of human resilience. Those two films involve the peril of oceans rather than space but then Gravity with its characters all suited up and their heads enclosed in helmets sometimes almost seems like its taking place under water -- except that you can see more clearly. ANALYSIS Clooney Bullocks Gravity to Open Venice Is It a Major Awards Contender? And seeing is what its mostly about here seeing space as if the film was actually shot there. Its a wonderful cinematic jolt to watch this film for the first time as it looks as if it had been filmed as it were on location. Given the brief running time it will be tempting for many to return for second and third visits just to take it all in again to absorb all Cuaron and his team of exemplary collaborators have done. The reliably brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who has shot all but one of the directors features has outdone himself here with images of astonishing clarity that given the finesse of the 3D here you practically feel you could step (or float) into. Andy Nicholsons production design is mainly devoted to creating multiple much-lived-in space ships so battered and abused they resemble banged-up old cars while Tim Webbers peerless special effects work never has a CGI look. With all the excitement and beauty Gravity delivers at a certain point around the time of the final long exchange between Kowalsky and Stone it becomes clear that Gravity doesnt intend to offer more than that; it shies away from proposing anything metaphysical philosophically suggestive or meaning-laden. For some viewers that will be a good thing as it avoids pretension and self-seriousness; for others its refusal to acknowledge the eternal mysteries to be anything more than a thrillingly made stripped-down suspense drama will relegate it to good-but-not-great status. The very ending is quite cool and replete with quiet cinematic as well as evolutionary reverberations. Clooney supplies both manly reliability and welcome lightness as a guy anyone would want in their corner in a pinch while Bullock is aces in by far the best film shes ever been in. An unseen Ed Harris supplies the voice of mission control. Venue Venice Film Festival (opening night) Opens Oct. 4 (Warner Bros.)

About halfway through Alfonso Cuarons astonishing ""Gravity"" Sandra Bullock playing a lost astronaut stranded 375 miles above Earth seeks refuge in an abandoned spacecraft and curls into a floating fetal position savoring a brief respite from her harrowing journey. Of the many sights to behold in this white-knuckle space odyssey a work of great narrative simplicity and visual complexity its this image that speaks most eloquently to Cuarons gifts as a filmmaker Hes the rare virtuoso capable of steering us through vividly imagined worlds and into deep recesses of human feeling. Suspending viewers alongside Bullock for a taut transporting 91 minutes (with George Clooney in a sly supporting turn) the directors long-overdue follow-up to ""Children of Men"" is at once a nervy experiment in blockbuster minimalism and a film of robust movie-movie thrills restoring a sense of wonder terror and possibility to the bigscreen that should inspire awe among critics and audiences worldwide.This story first appeared in the September 03 2013 issue of Variety.

Opening Oct. 4 Stateside following its Venice and Toronto premieres the Warner Bros. release offers in abundance the sort of eye-popping screen-filling spectacle that demands to be viewed in a theater. Not unlike earlier triumphs of 3D and vfx innovation such as ""Avatar"" and ""Life of Pi"" though conceived along less fantastical more grimly realistic lines ""Gravity"" is at once classical and cutting-edge in its showmanship placing the most advanced digital filmmaking techniques in service of material that could hardly feel more accessible. PHOTOS George Clooney Sandra Bullock Premiere Gravity As scripted by Cuaron and his son Jonas this tale of one womans expedition into the unknown is a nerve-shredding suspenser a daring study in extreme isolation and one of the most sophisticated and enveloping visions of space travel yet realized onscreen. It falls among that increasingly rare breed of popular entertainments capable of prompting genuine ""How did they do that?"" reactions from even the most jaded viewers even as its central premise is so simple and immediately gripping that one might just as readily ask ""Why didnt anyone do it sooner?"" The answer to both questions is that Cuaron in another remarkable collaboration with longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and visual effects supervisor Tim Webber (""Children of Men"") has pushed the relevant technologies to their limits in order to tell this story with the sort of impeccable verisimilitude and spellbinding visual clarity it requires. The long intricate tracking shots the three devised for the earlier film were a mere warm-up act for what they unleash here as is clear from the stunningly choreographed opening sequence -- an unbroken roughly 13-minute long take that plunges us immediately into the deafening silence of space. Specifically we are in the atmospheric layer known as the thermosphere the Earths massive form looming large in the widescreen frame as an orbiting shuttle gradually cruises into focus. Three members of the crew have left the shuttle to help repair the Hubble telescope though dramatically the picture is concerned with only two of them Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) a seasoned astronaut leading his final mission and Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) a medical engineer on her first. The mood is relaxed initially even humorous; radio music plays in the background as the astronauts exchange banter with mission control. Kowalsky drifting lazily about in his harness brags that hes about to break the official record for longest spacewalk. The far less experienced Stone nervously tries to stay focused on her task not the easiest thing to do for someone still adjusting to the woozy effects of zero gravity. ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" Kowalsky quips early on. Yet all joking ceases when Houston (voiced by Ed Harris in a nice nod to ""Apollo 13"") suddenly reports that a cloud of debris triggered by the self-destruction of a nearby Russian satellite is headed their way. The camera having gracefully bobbed and weaved around the astronauts without a single cut so far continues to observe with unblinking concentration as the ship is pelted with shrapnel killing the third astronaut causing widespread damage and severing all communications with Houston. Amid the chaos Stone comes untethered and finds herself spinning alone and helpless in the vast emptiness of space an experience the audience will soon share to a deeply unnerving degree. In one continuous shot the film has not only introduced its central crisis -- will Stone survive? -- but also completely immersed us in the beauty and majesty of a dark pitiless universe. While ""Gravity"" is hardly the first film to send characters into orbit few have so powerfully and subjectively evoked the sensation of floating right there with them. As it glides nimbly around the action the camera induces a deeply pleasurable feeling of weightlessness (the film might just as well have been titled ""Dancing With the Stars"") that can suddenly turn from exhilarating to terrifying leaving us gasping for oxygen alongside the characters. The filmmakers technical command here is so precise that theyre able to shift perspectives at will; more than once the camera zooms in tighter and tighter on Stone until it seems to enter her helmet sharing her frightening view of the great black expanse before her. Exactly what she sees and endures over the course of her journey would be unfair to reveal. Suffice to say the script modulates the tension expertly deftly preying on the claustrophobic and the agoraphobic alike and maintaining an unflagging sense of peril as it carefully throws Stone one lifeline after another. The most crucial of these lifelines turns out to be Kowalsky who initially comes off as the films most obtrusive element a glib smart-ass whos there to help Stone and the audience find their bearings and to provide a measure of comic relief. Yet while Clooneys flippant leading-man charm may seem incongruous in this context at first his tough-and-tender rapport with Bullock pulses with understated feeling never more so than when the two astronauts are tethered together trying to make their way to safety. Clooney gets one particularly audacious scene that perhaps only a star of his stature could have managed pulling the viewer through various states of shock disbelief and finally bittersweet understanding; its a haunting moment that firmly ties ""Gravity"" for all its uncompromising realism to the soul of classic Hollywood. There are glimmers of artifice too in the scripts conception of Stone who turns out to have a tragedy in her past an unhealed wound that feels rather needlessly engineered to provide the viewer with a psychological entry point as well as a deeper stake in her survival. Its the one on-the-nose element in a screenplay that given its rigorous intelligence in all other departments might have done well to trust the audience to stay invested in Stones journey without the benefit of an emotional hook. (Providing a fascinating contrast is J.C. Chandors upcoming stranded-at-sea thriller ""All Is Lost"" in some ways a purer more radical storytelling experiment in which words motivations and explanations have been almost completely expunged.) Nonetheless Bullock inhabits the role with grave dignity and hints at Stones past scars with sensitivity and tact and she holds the screen effortlessly once ""Gravity"" becomes a veritable one-woman show. In a performance that imposes extraordinary physical demands the actress remains fully present emotionally projecting a very appealing combo of vulnerability intelligence and determination that not only wins us over immediately but sustains attention all the way through the cathartic closing reels. The outstanding post-production 3D conversion enhances our sense of immersion in this foreign environment at every turn. Images of outer space give new meaning to the term ""deep focus"" while the scenes set in enclosed environs provide a pleasing visual balance and contrast with floating objects supplying a natural depth of field. As visual an experience as the film is it would be far less effective without the exceptional sound work by production mixer Chris Munro and sound designer Glenn Freemantle which makes especially potent use of silence in accordance with the laws of outer-space physics. Helping to vary the soundscape is Steven Prices richly ominous score playing like an extension of the jolts and tremors that accompany the action onscreen. All in all it would be impossible to overestimate the difficulty of what Cuaron and his top-of-the-line crew have pulled off or to guess at the staggering number of decisions that were made regarding specifics of camera placement and movement; the motion-control robots that were used on the actors to plausibly simulate zero-gravity conditions; the marvelous scope and detail of Andy Nicholsons production design; and the meticulous integration of visual effects all-digital backgrounds traditional lighting schemes and other live-action lensing techniques. But perhaps the boldest risk of all was the decision to combine these elements in a manner that would hold up under the prolonged scrutiny of the camera in single-shot sequences of such breathtaking duration and coherence. Somewhere one imagines the spirits of Stanley Kubrick and Max Ophuls are looking down in admiration. Venice Film Review GravityReviewed at Dolby Laboratories Burbank Calif. Aug. 14 2013.

Dj says September 26 2013 at 623 am Lets get real here though I myself read Kaleidoscope and it was a nice short story I would be shocked if even 1 person in 20 has read it. When I first heard of Gravity It flashed through my head that it might be based off of Kaleidoscope but upon hearing the plot and giving it some thought the concept of losing your spacecraft and being adrift in space in a space suit seems to be a pretty natural take-off point of a story to think of on your own. The idea of space as similar to the deep ocean we even call spacecraft ""ships"" and losing your ship and trying to survive is an OBVIOUS idea. Giving Bradbury some kind of ownership or meta-patent for writing a short story in 1969 is just wrong. Kaleidoscope came out in 1969 but so did Bowies Space oddity where we have a guy walking out of his capsule and floating out into outer specs. People collectively felt a lot of the same emotions on seeing the awesomeness of space and astronauts. Plus the plots arent even similar. In. Kaleidoscope the hapless astronauts are flung from a spaceship explosion and basically talk to each other over radios as they wait to die. In Gravity we have a protagonist actively struggling to survive in space for most of the movie. The backdrop is space it is a survival story. The main commonalities are losing the safety of the spaceship and in the beauty of space juxtaposed with the terror of dying and vast loneliness of space that evokes feelings that are universal to us tiny earthbound humans. Reply Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says August 30 2013 at 134 am Reblogged this on HORROR BOOM and commented As brilliant and thrilling as this reviewer found Alfonso Cuarons Gravity (and other reviewers are saying the same thing; were pretty confident this movies got the goods) were honestly not sure if our nerves could take seeing the film. The trailer and clips we posted had us teetering on the verge of a fucking panic attack. On the other hand theres quotes from Justin Changs review here like the following The outstanding post-production 3D conversion enhances our sense of immersion in this foreign environment at every turn. Images of outer space give new meaning to the term ""deep focus"" while the scenes set in enclosed environs provide a pleasing visual balance and contrast with floating objects supplying a natural depth of field. As visual an experience as the film is it would be far less effective without the exceptional sound work by production mixer Chris Munro and sound designer Glenn Freemantle which makes especially potent use of silence in accordance with the laws of outer-space physics. Helping to vary the soundscape is Steven Prices richly ominous score playing like an extension of the jolts and tremors that accompany the action onscreen. OK. Maybe a glass of wine and we could chill out enough to take in the thrilling experience... ""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission"" Kowalsky quips early on. Yet all joking ceases when Houston (voiced by Ed Harris in a nice nod to ""Apollo 13) suddenly reports that a cloud of debris triggered by the self-destruction of a nearby Russian satellite is headed their way.

Amid the chaos Stone comes untethered and finds herself spinning alone and helpless in the vast emptiness of space an experience the audience will soon share to a deeply unnerving degree. Or maybe a bottle... Gravity will open October 4 2013 Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 29 2013 at 425 am I had glimpsed a short-take of GRAVITY in a teaser trailer; the film ill-served and a trailer impossible to convince anyone what the movie might be. Varietys comment (Providing a fascinating contrast is J.C. Chandors upcoming stranded-at-sea thriller ""All Is Lost"" in some ways a purer more radical storytelling experiment in which words motivations and explanations have been almost completely expunged.) This and that on-the-nose remark seem the other distractions from an otherwise great achievement for a motion picture. Yet Im not convinced -- as the filmmaker wasnt -- that technique alone no matter how visually innovative is a movie; thus that ""on-the-nose"" business. CHILDREN OF MEN is a film everyone should watch at least once. For me it is a one-off. GRAVITY I look forward to with anticipation if also with reservations. Reply MovieWytch says August 28 2013 at 540 pm While attending San Diego Comic Con this year I was able to attend the panel presentation of Gravity. What was amazing and why I plan to go see this film was due to the nature in which they described the filming and the importance to detail. The example they used was the focus on no sound in space. The according to the director added to the suspense and the sense of isolation and added to the realism of movie. I found this so intriguing and reminded me of the famous movie tagline from Alien ""In space no one can hear you scream."" Reply Living the Geek Life says August 28 2013 at 314 pm Im glad this is turning out so well I saw one of the early teaser trailers at a convention in April and it was completely confusing and off-putting. Reply Federico Sanna says August 28 2013 at 150 pm elaborating a bit on what Justin Chang said the on-the-nose scriptwriting elements bothered me more than they should have. Stones backstory felt too much of a plant-and-pay-off narrative trick - too mechanical that is - and the fact that she throws that line to seal it off ""no more driving. now we go home"" - the pay off moment itself - oddly reminded me of a visual analogue in Sofia Coppolas Somewhere the car running in circles at the beginning of the movie and finally following a straight line in the last scene. it all feels like screenwriting 101. also Clooneys ""audacious scene"" - I dont want to give anything away - although effective per se felt well disneyish. as I said though these elements bothered me more than they should have the story is simple. damn Jaws story is simple and yet its a masterpiece and its Hollywood at its best. as it is Gravity. perhaps I expected something more radical from Alfonso Cuaron. but what can me more radical in recent memory than creating that kind of overwhelmingly immersive experience and pushing to name the most striking of all Emanuel Lubezki to yet another incredibly powerful feat? Reply Tressel says August 28 2013 at 1116 am Clearly Variety loves the SFX and VFX in this film but theres one line in the article that Im honour bound to clarify  ""The outstanding post-production 3D conversion"" - It wasnt a post-production 3D conversion. It was both shot and rendered in stereo. - Its also not 3D but stereoscopic (eg 2 lenses to mimic our two eyes). 3D would be holograms or the virtual VFX world inside the artists computers. - So called stereoscopic conversion (or 3D conversion if you must) is the practice of taking a film shot with a single lens and making the stereo layers afterwards mainly using a digital stenciling technique called rotosocoping. Apart from a few tricks to make you think that the stencils have a depth in their features youre essentially watching laminate cut outs placed into a made up virtual 3D word and re-shot via rendering on a computer. [Post conversion specialists will (rightly) point out that its not just flat laminates there is some extra tricks applied to the stencils and the images they contain...] - True stereo photography and rendering is not 2D laminates placed into a made up 3D virtual world. Everything has an apparent relative depth to everything else. eg the actors nose is at a different focal position than their cheeks or jaw. It is way more convincing. - Post-conversion is not as effective as shooting or rendering in stereo (no matter what you might read to the contrary). - Avatar was shot and rendered in Stereo. Clash of The Titans was a post-conversion (and one of the worst though that was due to time constraints not the skill of the converters). - Sometimes Post-Conversion can be effective (Transformers 3 Star Trek etc). Cuaron rocks. As does Gravity. Reply Honest Rob says August 28 2013 at 751 am Peter Cuaron has said in interviews he never read Kaleidoscope. Why should he acknowledge something that had no influence on him? Reply Peter Wicht says August 29 2013 at 1233 am ""Never read"" that doesnt mean that he didnt know it. This is one of Bradburys most famous stories and a director like him working in fantasy and Sci-Fi hasnt heard of it? But he makes a film with the exact same premise? Give me a break. But it might be true in way from what I see and read Gravity (as good as it seemingly is) is way less subtle and philosophical than Kaleidoscope. Reply Peter Wicht says August 28 2013 at 318 am How can one write about this film and not mention Ray Bradburys short story ""Kaleidoscope"" which it is obviously based on? Its a shame already that Cuaron doesnt mention it himself as an well ""inspiration"" in the credits.
