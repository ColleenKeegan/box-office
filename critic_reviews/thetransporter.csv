Photo credit Magali Bragard/Lionsgate Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Testosterone-pumping action scenes cardboard romance manly banter -- what more does a fanboy need or want? The ""Transporter"" films polished those ingredients to slick commercial success in two go-rounds of shamelessly schematic simplicity. ""Transporter 3"" follows much the same road map. Marseilles-based deliveryman Frank Martin (Jason Statham) will deliver any package anywhere in Europe that can be reached by his supercharged Audi sedan. Once again he follows three ironclad rules no questions no names no peeking into the parcel. As before the film sometimes plays like a stuntmans demo reel in search of a story but its high-revving excitement -- particularly if you enjoy sensory overload bordering on incoherence. The fun of the story comes from messing with the series established mythology. Frank is a tight-lipped stoic loner with a chaotic dangerous profession so this time we see what he does for much-needed relaxation. Not only does he spend afternoons idly fishing with his cop friend Inspector Tarconi (unflappable Francois Berleand) but he watches angling on TV at night. His relaxation is cut short when a car driven by a young protege of Franks explodes through the living-room wall. Frank who had passed along a bothersome job to the courier is strong-armed into completing the mission. He is to convey sullen Slavic party girl Valentina (Natalya Rudakova a constellation of freckles orbiting a pair of Mediterranean-blue eyes) and a large bag of unknown contents to the former Eastern Bloc. It all has something to do with Ukraines environmental protection agency and some polluted sludge that looks as if it was borrowed from ""The Toxic Avengers"" prop room. More to the point bad guy Johnson (Robert Knepper of TVs ""Prison Break"") has a really ferocious scowl. To ensure that Frank completes the drop Johnson fits him and Valentina with wristbands programmed to explode if they venture 75 feet from the car. This presents amusing difficulties when the Audi goes for a swim and Frank must choose between going down with the car or blowing up. Along the way Frank breaks every one of his own commandments and Statham violates the action stars creed by lightening up a bit. Although the script is littered with patches as rough as the stars permastubble it recognizes that Stathams character is ripe for a little humor. TRANSPORTER 3  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence some sexual content and drug material. Valentina is even more cynical than Frank and trumps his man-of-few-words stoicism with bratty silences of her own. Her fatalistic disposition triggers what I believe is the only Dostoevsky joke ever uttered in a film featuring Uzis and explosive bracelets. Since shes convinced theyre doomed anyway Valentina takes outlandish risks cooing that she wants ""to feel the sex"" one last time and blackmailing Frank into a striptease. Getting the hero out of his shirt is a recurring concern of Statham movies. Given that hes been photographed half naked more often than Matthew McConaughey and 50 Cent combined this approach to getting him scared shirtless is a welcome novelty. The trademark fight sequences are carried off with flair and some wit. Its wanton violence with a wink. Leave it to legendary fight coordinator Corey Yuen to find a way for Frank to beat people up with a grand piano. And the sequence that has Frank chasing his fugitive car on a kids banana-seat bike is endearingly absurd. The franchise takes a good turn in ""Transporter 3."" ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments The Transporter Jason Statham (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) uses his smoldering charisma to great effect as a mercenary whose well-ordered life is disrupted after he opens a strange package hes been hired to transport. Inside lies a bound-and-gagged woman (Shu Qi) and despite his professional resolve never to get involved in his clients affairs hes pulled into a web of intrigue that leads to an international slavery ring. Luc Besson (The Professional The Fifth Element) scripted this entertaining but forgettable 2002 action flick once again centering a Hollywood-blockbuster story on a philosophical loner drawn from Raymond Chandler Dashiell Hammett and French noirist Jean-Pierre Melville (Bob le flambeur). Director Cory Yuen who choreographed the action in X-Men and Romeo Must Die adds some dazzling fights and chases including one balletic brawl on a motor-oil slick. 92 min.

"Transporter The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; transporter-the ) Transporter The (France 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Transporter is cinematic extravaganza for everyone who disdains wimpy movie elements like ""plot"" and ""character development"". This balls-to-the-walls action/adventure makes the average James Bond film look like something by Eric Rohmer. Itas high rent Steven Segal - fights explosions and more fights but with a flair. Director Corey Yuan (well-known for his Hong Kong action films) and writer/producer Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita The Professional) want the audience to overdose on adrenaline and testosterone but they also want it clear that they donat take anything too seriously. Thatas why lead actor Jason Stratham always seems to be on the verge of turning to the camera and winking. To be fair the movie has something that passes for a storyline although itas so riddled with holes and implausibilities that one would do best to ignore it altogether. (For example thereas a scene in which a woman tied to a chair manages to get into the backseat of a car by herself without being freed from her bonds. Short of David Copperfield I canat think of anyone who could manage that.) The screenplay co-written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen steals liberally from Bessonas The Professional. The lead character Frank Martin - a.k.a. aThe Transportera (Stratham) - bears more than a passing resemblance to Jean Renos Leon. He makes money by taking things (or people) from one location to another no questions asked. He lives by three rules (1) The deal is the deal (2) No names and (3) Donat open the package. He gets into trouble when he violates Rule 3 and discovers a pretty girl named Lai (Qi Shu) trapped inside a bag. From that moment on Martin is on the run with all sorts of bad guys and even a few good guys on his trail. The film eventually has something to do with Chinese people being sold into slavery but the less the viewer pays attention to that the better of he (or she) will be. Aside from Jason Stratham (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Snatch) theres nothing special going on with the acting. Stratham is delightfully cool as the imperturbable Transporter but no one in the supporting cast makes an impression. Qi Shu brings little more than a cute face and a poor command of English to her love interest/woman-in-distress role. Matt Schulze is not imposing as the bad guy (perhaps because he doesnt froth at the mouth enough). And Francois Berleand is uninteresting as the police inspector who takes an interest in Franks situation. The action sequences are virtually non-stop with only occasional brief interruptions to facilitate minor exposition. Every example of hand-to-hand combat features lots of martial arts (high kicks but no obvious ""wire fu"") and enough explosives and ammo are expended to supply a small army. The film opens with an amazing thing a car chase that isnt boring (its so outrageously over-the-top that it cant help but be fun). Overall The Transporter will likely satisfy anyone on the lookout for a mindless cheesy action flick. The Transporters destination may be ordinary but to get there this film moves.

Nevius Mick LaSalle Carla Meyer Published 400 am Friday October 11 2002 BLOODY SUNDAY Historical drama. Directed and written by Paul Greengrass. (Rated R. 110 minutes. At the Embarcadero Act in Berkeley Century in Pleasant Hill Century 16 in Mountain View CineArts in Sausalito and Camera 3 in San Jose.) ""Bloody Sunday"" a re-creation of one day in recent Irish history is so astonishingly good that one feels a collision of simultaneous emotions elation at the superb craftsmanship and suspense that director Paul Greengrass accomplishes and heartbreak at the events he portrays and their relevance today. On Jan. 30 1972 British soldiers opened fire on unarmed civilians participating in a civil rights march through Derry Northern Ireland. Twenty- seven people were shot 13 killed. None of the soldiers was disciplined and the event known as Bloody Sunday became a turning point in the Irish troubles boosting the ranks of the Irish Republican Army and initiating a bloody civil war. Greengrass tells the story in the frame of one day and shoots it in documentary style -- capturing a sense of urgency and impending chaos showing us police demonstrators religious leaders and British soldiers through the same intimate lens. Nothing looks rehearsed and each of the dozens of actors seems to respond to the action while it unfolds. Theres not a false note no trace of ""acting"" -- just a searing realism thats very very rare onscreen. In a hospital sequence post-massacre Greengrass creates an amazing density of detail Families wait for news of the injured untended bodies line the corridors nurses scramble for help and reporters looking dazed and helpless hold notepads. ""Bloody Sunday"" is a great achievement tense and passionate a film that one feels not just emotionally but also physically. With the United States poised for military aggression against Iraq its impossible not to draw parallels between Northern Ireland and the Middle East or to wish that films like ""Bloody Sunday"" however great werent so necessary. . This film contains strong language and violence. -- Edward Guthmann TUCK EVERLASTING Romance. Starring Ben Kingsley William Hurt Sissy Spacek and Alexis Bledel. Directed by Jay Russell. (PG 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Perhaps the best teen date movie ever set in the year 1914 ""Tuck"" represents a brave leap against the tide. No sex no car crashes and minimal violence. It just might be a hit. Lets concede that you have to buy into the premise and that the languid pace may put off some viewers. You can see teenage guys getting dragged to the show by their dates. But theyd better be careful or the emotional ending may have them gulping back a lump in their throats. Not that theyll admit it of course. The story based on the popular book by Natalie Babbitt hinges on a will- she-or-wont-she decision but not in the usual sense. Winnie a self-assured teen who is battling the restraints imposed by over-protective parents is whisked away to the woods by a mysterious but sensitive stranger Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson). That he is also a total hunk wont hurt the box office. The two romp discreetly in the fields and streams and fall in love. Thats when Jesse reveals the family secret. By drinking from a hidden spring he and his family have become immortal. Jesse asks Winnie to take a sip -- the ultimate teen drinking dilemma -- so they can live together forever 17. As Winnie ""Gilmore Girl"" Alexis Bledel shines. Freed from the manic pingpong repartee of the popular WB TV show Bledel shows depth and range. A weaker actress could have turned this into cotton candy. Everyone else falls neatly into place. William Hurt as Angus Tuck cant stand to just play the wise and knowing patriarch; he has to throw in a distracting Scottish accent. Still he gets the payoff lines ""Dont be afraid of death. Be afraid of the unlived life"" and carries them off. Sissy Spacek makes another welcome appearance after a career hiatus. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley effortlessly commands the camera as the evil Man in the Yellow Suit. ""You speak blasphemy sir"" a character says to Kingsley. ""Fluently"" he replies beaming. If nothing else the lush emerald setting will keep you watching. Winnie and Jesse find love amid a backdrop of waterfalls forest glens and a spotted fawn. All that is missing is Vin Diesel on a dirt bike. Hell be back soon enough of course but this is a pleasant change of pace until then. -- C.W. Nevius  THE TRANSPORTER  Action. Starring Jason Statham Shu Qi and Francois Berleand. Directed by Corey Yuen. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If Jason Stathams starring role in ""The Transporter"" means well be seeing him headlining more movies in the future then something good will have come of this routine and rather silly action movie. Statham who was in Guy Ritchies ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a screen natural with the cockney insolence self-deprecating humor and basic geniality of a young Roger Daltrey. Unfortunately he doesnt get to show much personality in ""The Transporter"" in which he plays a machinelike fellow who values precision above all. Even the humanizing touch of a romance doesnt help -- Stathams chemistry with leading lady Shu Qi is nonexistent. Written by Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element"") and Robert Mark Kamen (""Gladiator"") the picture stars Statham as Frank a former Special Forces operator who now works as a freelance ""transporter"" in France. In other words he drives. Sometimes he moves merchandise; sometimes he drives a getaway car. Hes a scientific driver. He has everything worked out mathematically which is why in the first scene he is upset to find himself picking up four bank robbers at a crime scene instead of three. At his insistence one of the robbers has to be killed and tossed out of the car before hell drive away. Frank is big on rules one of which is never to look inside any package he might be transporting. But one fine afternoon he peeks and finds a woman (Shu Qi) and from there his life begins to unravel. It does worse than unravel. Soon guys are bombing his house with missiles and he has no idea why. That the movie becomes silly isnt necessarily a problem but it also becomes tiresome degenerating into a series of martial arts interludes -- everyone unaccountably leaves his guns at home. That suddenly everyone in the movie becomes a martial artist makes no sense until one discovers that the director is Corey Yuen who has served as martial arts choreographer on a number of high-profile Hollywood films (""Lethal Weapon 4"" ""Romeo Must Die""). Even then it doesnt make sense; its just explainable. This film contains violence strong language and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle FAMILY FUNDAMENTALS Documentary. Directed and written by Arthur Dong. (Not rated. 75 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and Shattuck in Berkeley). . Arthur Dongs documentary ""Family Fundamentals"" is an earnest heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives. Its also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views. The trouble with right-wing zealots is that theyre so darned organized. In ""Fundamentals"" they can elucidate their principles on command. Their gay offspring by contrast sputter or react emotionally when faced with examples of relatives intolerance -- usually supplied by the filmmaker. Dong devotes ample time to Kathleen Bremner head of a posse of parents who want their gay kids to go straight. She has to work double time because her daughter and beloved grandson are gay. Bremners lifestyle choice is disturbing but so are Dongs manipulative tactics. He alerts Bremners relatives to her anti-gay remarks on camera in hopes of provoking a response. Theyre hurt and angry and documentary filmmaking is sullied. ""Fundamentals"" has laudable qualities the best of which is its depiction of the complexity of faith and family. Brett gay son of Mormons knows his parents love for him is as entrenched as their conviction that hes going to hell. Gay people often talk of ""chosen families"" and the film depicts one of those as well. Brian Bennett a gay man and staunch Republican was a close aide to former congressman and strident homophobe Bob Dornan. Not surprisingly Bennett and the surrogate dad he called ""Poppy"" parted ways after the young man came out. Like his mentor Bennett is smart funny and likable -- until you consider his years of collusion with Dornans anti-gay rhetoric. Dong erred in presenting Bennett in the same light as the others. They were born into bigotry; Bennett sought it out. -- Carla Meyer KNOCKAROUND GUYS Drama. Starring Barry Pepper Vin Diesel John Malkovich. Directed and written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . The lackluster mob picture ""Knockaround Guys"" sat on the studio shelf for two years. Its finally seeing the light of day apparently because Vin Diesel has become a made man in Hollywood. The ""XXX"" star plays the muscle in a group of Gen-X Mafia sons trying to show their worth to their fathers. ""Knockaround"" proves that Diesel needs direction even if that direction is ""Drive your bike off the cliff."" He looks uncomfortable when shot in repose; hes simply inert rather than emotive unless hes pulling on a cigarette which allows for a squint. Diesel seems at ease only when cracking heads. The scenes of violence unfortunately are the most effective in the film. Director-writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (""Rounders"") dont spare the bullets but theyre otherwise adrift. The mob scions leave Brooklyn for Montana to find a lost bag of cash. But the picture doesnt know whether to be a fish-out-of-water comedy or male- bonding drama. Theres too little use of the comic talent on board -- including the always reliable Seth Green (""Austin Powers"") as the boys dimwitted pilot -- and too many heartfelt talks about honor among two-bit junior thieves. The real problem lies with the premise. Were supposed to feel sorry for these spoiled Mafia kids because their dads dont respect them and they cant make it in the straight world. Its like a whole film devoted to A.J. Soprano and his friends only these characters arent half as likable as A.J. Except Barry Pepper (HBOs ""61"") who has the lead role as the son of the most prominent mobster (Dennis Hopper). Peppers dark pompadour pouty mouth and leather jacket suggest Elvis in his 68 comeback special and his intense expression bespeaks a valiant effort to elevate this claptrap. Theres one truly disturbing element to ""Knockaround Guys"" John Malkovich has usurped the traditional Christopher Walken role as Peppers oily psycho uncle. Its a comedown for the respected actor sure but thats not the worrisome part. With Malkovich now available for the fey ham-fisted criminal roles what will become of Walken? . This film contains violence raw language. -- Carla Meyer THE RULES OF ATTRACTION Drama-comedy. Starring James Van Der Beek Shannyn Sossamon Jessica Biel. Directed by Roger Avary. Written by Avary from Bret Easton Ellis book. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If the film version of ""The Rules of Attraction"" were set in 1987 when the Bret Easton Ellis novel came out its characters would be mere degenerates. But director-screenwriter Roger Avary has moved the books cokehead date- raping college nihilists to the present day where they come off as pure sociopaths. Occasionally entertaining sociopaths but sociopaths nonetheless. Nearly every bodily fluid makes an appearance in ""Rules"" a mean-spirited paean to hedonism set at an East Coast college where students attend class only occasionally and then only to perform oral sex on instructors. Why this film was made now is a puzzler but heres a theory It lets a couple of WB stars be naughty. ""Dawsons Creeks"" James Van Der Beek finally puts that hulking brow to use playing a creepy drug dealer who preys on drunk women. But he doesnt prey on them to the extent the other goons do which in this sordid world qualifies him as our hero. Van Der Beek wears a fierce expression throughout perhaps to distance himself from that cerebral softie Dawson. To his credit he makes his character less a cipher than those around him. Jessica Biel (""7th Heaven"") plays a backstabbing tramp whose coke habit causes nosebleeds. But shes just a supporting character; the truly demeaning stuff has been saved for the leading lady Shannyn Sossamon (""A Knights Tale"") whose character is raped (and videotaped) in the movies opening moments. At least the film version of ""American Psycho"" acknowledged Ellis disdain for women by making them just as farcical as murderer Patrick Bateman. ""Rules"" tries to elicit sympathy for its female characters while it defiles them. Van Der Beeks character Sean Bateman might be Patricks brother. He once mentions a ""Patrick"" but obliquely. Its a nod to Ellis devotees if there still are such people. Filmmaker Avary once deftly mixed humor and ugliness in co-writing ""Pulp Fiction"" with Quentin Tarantino. Hes lost his touch. ""Rules"" has only a few truly funny moments and they come from bit players. Clifton Collins Jr. is an eye-popping riot as a drug dealer and Russell Sams is sublime as a flamboyant preppy who taunts his sozzled mother (a slurringly perfect Swoosie Kurtz) with constant references to his gayness. ""Rules"" might have been more fun were it a little gayer. Ian Somerhalder saucy and strikingly handsome plays a sexually ambiguous dandy who once dated Sossamons character and now pines for Van Der Beeks. But their triangle is underdeveloped. What a cop-out. Drugs and casual sex are very very old hat for teen movies. Having Dawson get it on with a guy would have been genuinely provocative. This film contains nudity raw language sexual situations and a rape scene. -- Carla Meyer POKEMON 4EVER RATING (Empty Chair) Childrens movie. Directed by Jim Malone. (G. 77 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Tepid claptrap. The filmmakers must have known that the Pokemon craze had fizzled when they were making this but even if Pokemon cards were still being traded frantically in elementary school this would be a snooze. The kindest thing that can be said is that this film successfully bends the time/space continuum. It manages to make 80 minutes seem longer for a 6-year- old than a formal dinner at Grandmas. Granted it isnt easy. The Pokemon target audience presents a pretty narrow window. They must be young enough to buy into the concept of something like Celebi who may look like a large clove of garlic with blue eyes but actually has incredible powers. And they must be old enough to make sense of the complicated Pokemon culture. Good luck with that. But what we get here is likely to please neither. A boy Ash leads a happy life using his trained Pokemon Pikachu to battle other Pokemon. In a scene that is presented as wholesome fun Pikachu sends out a bolt of electricity that knocks his opponent and the boy who owns him unconscious. Lets see pitting trained animals against each other. Isnt that illegal in most states? Things swing wildly back and forth from there. At one point two characters are sent out to battle one of whom has a campfire blazing at the end of his tail and the other a large bay leaf on his head as a weapon. At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day. -- C.W.

But while the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchies ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" has the bod hes unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle. ""The Transporter"" reps a feature-length audition for Brit hunk Jason Statham to join the wide-open ranks of young future action stars. But while the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchies ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" has the bod the moves and a passing resemblance to Bruce Willis in his favor hes unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle so second-hand and disposable is it in every respect. The imprimateur of coproducer-coscreenwriter Luc Besson will take this French-lensed actioner further internationally than it would travel on its own merits but this is a quick in-and-outer theatrically in the U.S. Directed by Hong Kong martial arts vet Cory Yuen with ""intimate"" scenes such as they are handled by ""artistic director"" Louis Leterrier a former assistant director to Besson pacey pic boasts a script penned by Besson with his ""The Fifth Element"" collaborator Robert Mark Kamen that has the feel of something dashed off over a long beach lunch. The good guy is the strong silent type who lets his actions speak for him the baddies are all glowering goons and the damsel in distress is able to step up when the going gets tough. In order to keep psychology and acting demands minimal Stathams title character Frank Martin an ex-Special Forces op is a mercenary BMW-driving delivery man entirely defined by the three rules of his trade Never change the deal; no names; never look in the package. That hes serious about his code of conduct is amply illustrated by the opening sequence in which he refuses to transport four bank robbers rather than the agreed-upon three forcing the ringleader to whack one of his accomplices on the spot. Kick-off chase sequence which cavalierly intercuts between locations in Nice and Cannes and smothers potential tension by repeatedly jump-cutting away from inconvenient circumstances is so over the top it suggests a semi-farcical tongue-in-cheek approach is in store. But a consistent tone proves beyond the means of the multinational filmmakers who when in doubt resort to standard-issue tough-guy stuff marked by attempts at a fresh spin that seem more desperate than inspired. Frank gets into trouble on a job when he breaks Rule No. 3 by unzipping a bag that obviously contains something alive. Although the illicit cargo a stunning Taiwanese woman named Lai (Shu Qi star of Hou Hsiao-hsiens ""Millenium Mambo"") briefly escapes Frank packs her up again and delivers the bag to its recipient an eminently evil Yank with the moniker Wall Street (Matt Schulze). Franks judgment comes into question once again when he accepts a briefcase from Wall Street that to anyone whos ever seen any movies in this vein obviously has a bomb in it. Surviving this Frank retreats to his seaside Cote dAzur villa a magnificent fort-like edifice that would cost millions but that he can unaccountably afford on his army pension. No doubt this is the reason he comes under some suspicion from local detective Tarconi (Francois Berleand) even before Wall Streets thugs brazenly attack the place with a barrage of shoulder-launched missiles. From here on yarn consists of skirmishes between the two sides mixing in Lais odious dad (Ric Young) who with Wall Street is smuggling Asians into France in huge shipping containers. Among action scenes that stress martial arts but sometimes add weapons into the mix (and in classic fashion usually feature the hero single-handedly besting numerous adversaries) most ridiculous is one in which the combatants do battle while slipping and sliding across a warehouse floor smeared with oil. Least original is a car-and-truck pursuit that borrows far too liberally from ""The Road Warrior."" Unintended laughs in the climactic confrontation involving Frank Lai and latters pa pushes pic to risible levels at the finish line. Although the former Olympic diver handles himself well physically its not evident here what additional qualities Statham might possess that would cause him to prevail over any number of other candidates for action stardom. Coached in English during the shoot for her Western film debut the lovely Shu registers with an effervescent personality while other turns are by-the-numbers. Splendidly rugged settings in the Alpes Maritimes are bathed in a warm glow by lenser Pierre Morel and special effects and stunt work are up to snuff.

The ""Snatch"" star whose stony features and receding hairline suggest a British Bruce Willis grunts and glowers as Frank Martin a ruthless driver-for-hire whos marked for death after he discovers that one of the packages that hes paid to deliver contains a bound-and-gagged woman (Shu Qi). Yuen best known as a fight choreographer (""X-Men"") grinds gears between high-speed car chases slo-mo gunplay and so much hand-to-hand combat even Jackie Chan would yell ""Knock it off"" Cram in a ludicrous romance between the monosyllabic Statham and the barely intelligible Qi hoot-inducing dialogue (""He was a bastard but he was still my father"" Qi blubbers after blowing away her bad-guy dad) and gratuitous Euro-product placement (BMW Orangina) and The Transporter is like the worst movie Jean-Claude Van Damme never made.
