Martin Guerre visits Bedford Falls in ""The Majestic"" a thick slice of bogus inspirational cheese that only makes itself look bad by recycling so many golden movie memories. Frank Darabonts latest marathon puffs itself up with an enormous sense of self-importance by injecting weighty issues relating to the U.S. Constitution and the Hollywood blacklist into a tale of an amnesiac embraced by a small town in the post-war U.S. Bursting with cliched notions of down-home Americana that it wants to pass off as profundity this elaborately appointed production will get a running start at the box office thanks to the toplined Jim Carrey whose performance is disappointingly reactive until the very end and pics obvious strokes will sucker the emotionally gullible. But unless you really can fool all the people all the time critical and commercial results should be disappointing. The main reference point for the original script by Michael Sloane whose previous screen credit is ""Hollywood Boulevard II"" is unmistakably Frank Capra. Carrey plays a decent but conflicted man pushed to an emotional epiphany by the misbehavior of so-called guardians of the American way of life and ultimately to a highly public denunciation of said individuals and an affirmation of the nations bedrock values. Its worth contemplating however that the hidden auteur behind the picture may be a corporate one in this case Castle Rock Entertainment; the companys recent venture ""Hearts in Atlantis"" was also about a mysterious stranger who materializes in a sleepy burg in mid-century and is pursued by grim men in long coats and ominous black cars. Asserting himself as the most deliberate of Hollywood directors since late-career George Stevens Darabont intros Carreys Peter Appleton as a B-movie studio writer who believes hes on the verge of his breakthrough to A status when hes paged for questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee about alleged commie connections back in his college days. Although his would-be red activities consisted of attending a ""questionable"" student org to impress a girl Peter drowns his sorrows in drink as he sees his career evaporating. He then drives toward Northern California where he runs his beautiful car off a bridge and promptly passes out. With the film set in 1951 its hard not to think of a film made the year before that also centered on a second-tier screenwriter who embarked on an unusual odyssey -- William Holdens Joe Gillis in ""Sunset Boulevard"" -- and equally hard not to wish you were watching his exploits again instead. As it is Peter is found by local geezer Stan (James Whitmore) and brought into downtown Lawson a picture-postcard coastal community where everyone thinks the dazed young fella looks kinda familiar. After Stan explains that the town is still reeling from having lost 62 of its own in WWII Peter is taken as one of them by Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) a widower whos certain Peter is actually his son Luke who never came back from the war. Not quite as certain but willing to be convinced is Adele (Laurie Holden) the blond beauty who was Lukes girlfriend a decade back. Shes gone to law school in the interim but is still available and she fills in the blank-minded stranger on the details of their long-ago courtship. It would have been interesting to see if Peter would have gone along with the game if the woman who made moves on him didnt look just like Grace Kelly but in any event hes swept along on the enthusiastic willingness of the town to embrace him into the fold. After cross-referencing ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" in the citizens eagerness to believe the unbelievable Darabont and Sloane proceed to turn ""The Last Picture Show"" on its head by making Harry the owner of a defunct cinema. The only derelict building in the otherwise pristine town the Majestic looks like a lost cause but Harry who has taken ""Luke"" in to live with him in his apartment above the theater is suddenly inspired to resurrect his forlorn movie house. With the help of Luke aged ticket taker Emmett (Gerry Black) mousy concessions lady Irene (Susan Willis) and Adele along with significant contributions from the towns merchants Harry sees his dream come true when the entire community turns out for the opening-night relaunch the magnificent marquee lit up with ""An American in Paris."" Lukes romance with Adele continues apace and there are warm and fuzzy feelings all around. Its all too good to be true of course. A potentially interesting story angle -- that Peter/Luke cant recall anything about his life but perfectly remembers movies hes seen -- remains undeveloped thematically but is used as a convenient story trigger at a crucial late moment. Eventually the long arm of the FBI and HUAC reaches into quiet Lawson to snare the ""missing commie"" disillusioning the locals and thrusting the suddenly recovered Peter into the unwelcome glare of TV lights and hostile questioning at a jam-packed hearing. Climax hinges on whether the previously uncommitted and self-serving Peter will read a sell-out prepared statement to the panel or stand up for the values of the ""real"" America he has recently discovered in Lawson particularly as impressed upon him by new lawyer Adele. Given that the film positively swells with righteousness there can be little doubt which way the reluctant hero will tilt in the end. Much like ""Hearts in Atlantis"" in fact ""The Majestic"" is laboriously precious dawdling over every minute detail of plot characterization and theme fetishizing the intensely prettified physical details and wallowing in its counterfeit notions of nobility. The world is divided into people who will swallow this sort of hooey whole and those who will gag on it but by any standard Darabont and Sloane are working in a zone well beyond safe limits of sentimental patriotism and ""inspirational"" courage. Although hes onscreen most of the time Carrey hasnt nearly so much to do here as he did in his previous ""serious"" acting outings ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon."" Stripped of a personality through most of the film he is mainly required to smile look vaguely confused at times and generally look pleasant as countless others especially his ""dad"" and ""girlfriend"" explain his past to him and tell him how happy they are to have him back. The only chance Carrey really gets to speak up is when he finds his true self at the committee hearing and whatever force this has is immediately undone by the dramatically fashionable but ludicrously implausible spectacle of having the press corps and politicos give Peter a big ovation after his testimony. Landau indulges his many opportunities to look misty-eyed and sentimental and also gets to deliver the big lines that undoubtedly will be excerpted in clips ad nauseum; trying to rouse excitement about reviving the Majestic his Harry denigrates the new invention television then raves about how in his day movies were ""magic"" and the stars were ""gods."" Holden best known for her recurring role on ""The X-Files"" unquestionably fills the bill as the ideal girl next door. Supporting turns in townspeople roles are mostly humble and folksy in the extreme while Bob Balaban makes his HUAC inquisitor into a particularly rabid species of right-wing crusader. Technically pic is polished to a fare-thee-well. Mark Ishams score abetted by a trunkful of period tunes intros strains of nuance and complexity that are absent from the script.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Jim Carrey. Directed by Frank Darabont. (PG. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""The Majestic"" Jim Carrey plays a man whose face looks familiar to everyone but himself -- hes got amnesia. He remembers movies but he doesnt remember the face in the mirror. Carrey plays a B-movie screenwriter during the Hollywood 10 blacklist era. He is taken for a war hero by the people of a small Northern California town when they find him after an accident. Carrey and director Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"") channel the spirit of Frank Capra in this serio-sentimental fable about a man who loses his memory but finds his soul. SUBTLE PERFORMANCE Anybody who thinks Carrey isnt capable of subtlety is in for a big surprise. At the same time the movie pulls off the neat juggling act of paying tribute to a sense of wartime patriotism while making a defense of civil liberties. No one knew when this movie was being made how timely the question would become. It goes directly to the heart of reconciling individual rights with the demands of a wartime posture a subject for which the movies may find a rosier emotional balance than real life does. ""The Majestic"" recalls classic Capra movies that affirm American values ""Meet John Doe"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in particular where Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart respectively stand up against powerful cynics somewhat to their own surprise for bedrock beliefs. I think Americans are in the mood today for a sentimental movie about their values and frankly its wonderful to see people get teary-eyed over the First Amendment. It is the early 50s the time of Bogart and Hepburns ""The African Queen."" As Peter Appleton the writer of a B movie called ""Sand Pirates of the Sahara "" Carrey is on top of the world with his new movie and other opportunities about to open. His sunny sporty clothes reflect his attitude. Hes nonpolitical and completely unprepared when HUAC (the House Un- American Activities Committee) drags him into its witch-hunt for Hollywood Communists. A drunken ride up the coast sends his spiffy Mercedes coupe off a bridge and the movie off in an unforeseeable direction. Theres a lot of codger power in ""The Majestic."" James Whitmore Hal Holbrook and Martin Landau all have key roles. Landau (from TVs ""Mission Impossible"" to Tim Burtons ""Ed Wood"") plays a father who thinks Carrey is the reincarnation of his World War II soldier son Luke. Whitmore is a geezer who seems to have wandered in from the garden to play in a production of ""Our Town "" and Holbrook most effective of them all is the canny HUAC chairman. ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE Laurie Holden (""The X-Files"") plays Lukes former girlfriend who is not so willing as the father to accept the man returned from the dead as the real thing. Holden a Jean Harlow-like coarse blonde keeps getting more and more under the audiences skin as she does Lukes as the movie progresses. The Majestic in ""The Majestic"" is a rundown and abandoned small-town movie house that Lukes father used to run. Now that his son has returned he wants to restore it. This episode provides some of the more starry-eyed sequences in ""The Majestic"" but remains a wonderful wish-fulfillment fantasy. When everything else fails theres always the movies.

"USATODAY.com - Carrey is ill-used in banal Majestic Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/24/2001 - Updated 1230 PM ET Carrey is ill-used in banal Majestic By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Majestic is named after a dilapidated movie palace that the movies stars Jim Carrey and Martin Landau renovate and reopen. If only they had managed to overhaul this overly sentimental movie while they were restoring things. Read more Video The Majestic trailer Both Landau and Carrey deserve better material. Carrey is miscast as Peter Appleton a 50s-era B-movie writer who is blacklisted loses his identity after an accident and discovers his inner integrity after being embraced by the kindly denizens of a California town. When Carrey breaks into an ""aw shucks"" smile you can spot the maniacal trickster lurking beneath the bland demeanor that the part imposes on him. Its not that he should star only in wild-eyed comedic roles. He was superb as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon and well cast as the goofy but well-meaning dupe in The Truman Show. But those films had an edge that allowed Carrey to vent his darker unpredictable side. The Majestic (out of four) Stars Jim Carrey Martin Landau Laurie Holden Bob Balaban David Ogden Stiers Director Frank Darabont Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for language and some thematic elements One hopes that this is a temporary deviation for Carrey and that he hasnt decided to follow in Robin Williams sappy footsteps. Both men have a witty cynicism that has worked well in more complex material. Once in town Carreys character is spotted by Harry Trimble (Landau) and mistaken for the son he lost in World War II. With little memory of his own past Peter begins to believe he is the prodigal son and gives no more thought to his Hollywood problems. The McCarthy era has been depicted more convincingly in other films. Peters banal work would have been unlikely to call attention to itself much less inspire the scrutiny of commie-baiting witch hunters. Further straining believability the cops sent to arrest Peter for failing to testify before a government committee stage a dramatic face-off right on Main Street. And the confrontation just happens to fall on the day that his accident-induced amnesia clears the same day as Landaus funeral. Meanwhile the flag-waving townspeople who had embraced him all turn on him as one. Even his brainy blonde love interest Adele (Laurie Holden) cant resist doing her own preaching. Director Frank Darabont whose The Shawshank Redemption was a better example of his talent sought to make a Frank Capra-style feel-good picture. But he produced a pale imitation that challenges credulity and tries too hard to win our hearts with schmaltz.

Posted January 4 2002 -- 1200 AM EST In The Majestic Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton a screenwriter in 1951 Hollywood whos used to having his scripts dumbed down by philistine producers. But Appleton is so undone by a House Un-American Activities Committee charge that he was a member of a Communist organization in college--the (false) accusation alone costs him his job and the affection of his girlfriend--that he gets drunk crashes his car and passes out. And when he comes to with no memory of who he is hes in Lawson Calif. a little town that time forgot not far as nostalgia flies from Frank Capras Bedford Falls. The townspeople remember him though They think his name is Luke Trimble that hes the war-hero son of old Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) gone missing for over nine years and that hes in love with Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden) daughter of the local doc (David Ogden Stiers). And maybe he is. Maybe this well-loved Luke is who his neighbors want him to be a good fellow who with his father reopens the old movie house in town--the Majestic--thus allowing his neighbors to dream in the dark again. There are so many achingly earnest themes in this strange and long movie from length-be-damned director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile) so many cadged elements from other greater earlier films (including all of Capras and some of Preston Sturges) in the unashamedly rhetorical script by Darabont crony Michael Sloane that its easy to recoil from the films blatant recycling and stubborn squareness. Yet its exactly The Majestics naked fetishization--of twisted history of imitative moviemaking of Carreys conflicted desires as a performer to simultaneously conceal and reveal himself--that makes this so fascinating a failed project. Is being a good productive liar (in service to the publics hunger) sometimes as ethical as speaking the truth to ears that dont want to hear? Jack Benny--and Jim Carrey--might answer ""Im thinking....""

"CNN.com - Review Majestic is good -- and sappy - December 20 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Review Majestic is good -- and sappy Not likely Oscar-helpful to Carrey By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""The Majestic"" directed by Frank Darabont [""The Green Mile"" (1999) and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994)] and starring Jim Carrey is a throwback to the highly sentimental films of director Frank Capra. Capras work reached the height of its popularity with leading men like Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" (1939) and ""Its a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and Gary Cooper standing up for American values in ""Meet John Doe"" (1941). Even then many viewers felt these films were overly sappy and corny labeling them ""Capracorn."" ""The Majestic"" will no doubt suffer some of the same critical slings and arrows. Not only is ""The Majestic"" set in the 1950s its a 1950s movie in its sensibilities acting style and pacing. Its themes are also very Capraesque -- set in a small American town where one man can make a difference by standing up against all odds for what is right and along the way taking down a few arrogant Washington politicians. In this case the politicians are involved in the House Un-American Activities Committee.
