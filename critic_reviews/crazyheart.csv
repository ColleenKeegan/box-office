First there are those inspired by true events films like Coal Miners Daughteror Walk the Line which explore the rise of a legend all one-room shacks abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves tales of hardship and loss redemption and self-discovery saloon bars acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin whisky.Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaals Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs and a gig writing songs for one-time protege-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Coopers trick is to turn that predictability into a strength like a song youve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings Crazy Heart feels familiar even comforting offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted immaculately judged wholly authentic emotion.The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Its also in Coopers solid direction despite his inexperience he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.And its in those remarkable central performances Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination but its impossible to overstate how much his honest unabashed performance - part The Dude part Kris Kristofferson - grounds the film. Hes backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal making magic from a potentially thankless role and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall who essentially defined the subgenre with Tender Mercies back in 1983 and whose quiet deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.A shame then that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude convenient feelgood twists leading to an abrupt unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadnt done their work so well hadnt made us care so deeply for these fractured souls maybe it wouldnt matter. As it is Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie but like the song says that aint bad.

Photo Credit Fox Searchlight Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A washed-up country singer falls for a fetching young journalist. BOTTOM LINE Oscar-worthy work from Bridges with stellar support from an original country music score. CAST Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhaal Colin Farrell LENGTH 151 If the attraction between a 57-year-old alcoholic and a willowy young journalist in ""Crazy Heart"" feels like fiction its because the rest of the movie is so utterly believable. The dichotomy lies in an unusual place Jeff Bridges beard. gt;gt;VIDEO Click here to watch the trailer advertisement | advertise on newsday Bridges plays Bad Blake a washed-up and unwashed country singer with Kris voice Hanks liver and Merles haggard face. Bad spends so much time smoking drinking and vomiting that youll begin to wonder about those discolored whiskers. Nevertheless the beautiful Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) concludes her interview by diving right in for a kiss. Once that hurdle is cleared however writer-director Scott Cooper (working from Thomas Cobbs novel) handles this story with care and lets his actors do their excellent work. Gyllenhaal is sympathetic as a single mother (Jack Nation plays her 4-year-old son) but the movie belongs entirely to Bridges who won the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama. His inimitable Jeff-isms have never been more endearing - the sloppy gait the whiskey glass balanced on his chest his general air of discombobulation. The other stars are producer T-Bone Burnett and the late songsmith Stephen Bruton whose original songs resonate so naturally in Bridges diaphragm. Its telling that their music like this fictional character feels truer than anything that actually exists on the country charts today. MoviesTrailer Crazy Heart The films only off note Colin Farrell whose uncredited but crucial role as a generic pretty-boy singer never quite convinces. Then again maybe thats the point.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 15 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 05 2013 119PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Scott Cooper Written by Scott Cooper Starring Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhaal Year 2009 Country USA Language English Spanish Another Oscar season another veteran actor bares his chest and roars again. In Crazy Heart Jeff Bridges follows in the footsteps of Frank Langella in Starting Out in the Evening (2007) and Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler (2008) as a once-famous figure and family failure who rediscovers his spiritual mojo through the love of a woman. Bridges plays Bad Blake a 57-year-old former country star who 30 years past his prime is reduced to driving his pickup truck around the country playing one and two-nighters at dives for people who remember his handful of hits. With his paunchy gut straggly grey beard and chain-smokers rumble Bridges performance is disturbingly authentic.You can almost smell the body odour and bourbon breath and feel a prickle of uneasiness at his drunken oversized movements and glazed stare. He inhabits the character in everything from the way he wraps his hands tenderly around a glass to the bow-legged way he sways across a room one part lurch two parts swagger.That said Bridgess big performance takes place in the context of a relatively minor movie. First-time director Scott Cooper adapted his script from a 1987 novel by Thomas Cobb (inspired by the career of the late Waylon Jennings). The film rolls through Southwest scenery and settles in cheap motels with an ambling rhythm. The plot is reminiscent of Horton Footes 1983 film Tender Mercies (based on a Larry McMurtry novel). That film earned an Oscar for Robert Duvall as a washed-up country singer who has a relationship with a younger woman and her son. Duvall also has a role here as a reformed alcoholic bartender who is Bad Blakes friend.Every fallen sinner needs a redeeming angel. Shes incarnated here by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean a reporter at a San Diego newspaper single mother of a four-year-old boy. She comes to Blakes motel for an interview while hes sitting drinking and watching porn but he recovers quickly and is candid and gentlemanly. The one subject he wont discuss is his former protege a singer named Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) whos now a big headliner. Blake makes a gentle come-on ""I want to talk about how bad you make this room look.""The two feel a connection or at least a shared sense of loneliness and resignation though the motive for her attraction never feels sufficient. Yes Blake has a roguish charm but its a big leap for a single mom to take up with a four-times-married itinerant alcoholic country singer who is old enough to be her father. It doesnt help that Jeans back story is so vague or that Gyllenhaals straight-forward performance suggests little emotional complexity.Of course every cowboy has to move on. Blakes manager calls; he has a gig for him opening for Tommy Sweet. Blake declines then reluctantly agrees. Farrell (also a solid singer) plays a pony-tailed and ear-ringed new-country artist who tries to mend fences with his old friend. Bridges and Farrell have one adroitly staged scene together where Sweet tries to help his old mentor by walking on during Blakes set. Blake is simultaneously annoyed and flattered offended at being upstaged but pleased to be recognized.From there on Crazy Heart goes through its paces with the predictability of the changes in a country tune as Blake undergoes a series of crises - medical creative and familial - until hes compelled to confront a lifetime of boozy evasions.One of the strengths of Crazy Heart is the authenticity of the songs written by T-Bone Burnett Steven Broder and Ryan Bingham. They serve as homages to the poetic alcoholic tradition of songwriting typified by Waylon Jennings Townes Van Zandt and Billy Joe Shaver. Theyre all about bits of wisdom wrung from heartache often of the self-induced variety. In a musical genre where emotional authenticity is essential Bridges is a great enough actor to make us believe these songs could be his own.

"Crazy Heart Hurts so good | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCrazy Heart Hurts so goodWith a story that reads like the lyrics of a hurtin song and the best performance of a stellar career from Jeff Bridges Crazy Heart is familiar in tone and exceptional in spirit.As bourbon-soaked Bad Blake Jeff Bridges gives an unself-conscious and occasionally brave performance.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Jan. 15 2010 Starring Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhaal Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell. Directed by Scott Cooper. 111 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A With a story that reads like the lyrics of a hurtin song and the best performance of a stellar career from Jeff Bridges Crazy Heart is familiar in tone and exceptional in spirit.As Bad Blake Bridges brings to mind hard-living country outlaws like Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. Once famous hes now 57 and broke fat and failing stuck on the road and driving to gigs at bowling alleys and crappy roadhouses in his creaky 73 Silverado. Article Continued BelowHis manager wont let him run band bar tabs anymore. Hell he doesnt even have a band. Pick-up musicians who join him at each show fill that role. After four - or was it five? - marriages Bads alone and to make it worse his onetime backup guitarist Tommy Sweet (originally uncredited Colin Farrell) is now a huge country star.To endure the boredom and likely his shame Bad gets systematically drunk before and during every show - even when its hard to afford the whiskey.""I used to be somebody"" he sings. ""Now I am somebody else.""Its an unself-conscious and occasionally brave performance watching a paunchy Bridges (he gained 25 pounds for the role) his belly flopping over the top of white briefs sobbing in misery as he hunches over the toilet to vomit after a night of hard drinking.Bad is prickly and ornery yet takes a stubborn pride in his work and has some tenderness inside him feelings he allows to show when he grudgingly agrees to an interview with Jean a decades-younger single mother (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has dreams of being a music writer.Their relationship is responsible for the only false notes in Crazy Heart. There is little chemistry between them and there is an awkwardness to their intimacy. In some moments they seem more like a crusty granddad and his granddaughter - creepy.But their pairing and Bads attempts to bond with Jeans 4-year-old helps turn the spotlight on the singers own failed family life.Bridges is the soul of Crazy Heart and will likely get his fifth Oscar nomination for the role. (Various British bookmaking websites have him hovering around 6/4 odds to win the Golden Globe Sunday night.)First-time director Scott Cooper wisely lets Bridges dominate and we quickly become familiar with Bads quirks he never does up his belt buckle unless he has to and has an endless thirst for McClures whiskey with a ""beer back darlin.""T-Bone Burnetts soundtrack (Walk the Line) done in collaboration with musicians including Ryan Bingham adds more than atmosphere to the movie. There are some solid songs here that have a ring of comforting familiarity amid the twang of guitars and pedal steel they sound as if they could well be 70s country hits especially the toe-tapper ""Fallin amp; Flyin"" with its lyric ""Funny how fallin feels like flyin for a little while.""They get added heft with Bridges at the mic who holds his own on guitar and has some talent and style as a county singer. Bridges isnt the only one to impress with his singing skills in Crazy Heart. Irish actor Colin Farrell does a very credible singing job too. When he sings the first few notes eyebrows should rise. But hes less successful holding on to his west Texas accent which tends to drift and theres nothing authentic about him as a country singer.An extra treat comes with a brief appearance by Robert Duvall as Bads long-time friend Wayne owner of a tiny Houston bar on the brink of bankruptcy where Bad often plays.He dispenses advice and offers solace in a role that has shades of his Oscar-winning turn as onetime country star Mac Sledge in 1983s Tender Mercies.Some goodwill evaporates in the final reel when a few false endings lead to a choice thats not the best one for Crazy Heart but the generosity of Bridges performance puts us in a forgiving mood.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune January 15 2010 -- 1104am Fox Searchlight Star Tribune Jeff Bridges in ""Crazy Heart"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""Crazy Heart"" Jeff Bridges takes the part of Bad Blake and he takes it with both fists. Bad is a washed-up country music legend reduced to playing bowling alleys and tiny bars singing sad songs that were hits a long time ago. Often playing top-notch music and just as often on the edge of self-destruction the character fits Bridges like a pair of custom Tony Lamas. Bridges could pass for Kris Kristoffersons dissolute brother and he sings in a pleasant Gene Autry tenor. ""Crazy Heart"" is a portrait of an artist with talent and soul aplenty but the discipline of a pile of marbles on a glass-topped table. He lives life by his own rules which frequently means no rules at all. You can see why Bridges signed on for this low-key low-budget character study. It isnt every day an actor gets the chance to pitch face-forward into the camera dead drunk. Like a good country song the film hooks us early keeps it simple and tells a story straight from the heart. Bad isnt as cussed as he claims but hes no bargain. He has a truck-drivin mans work ethic hauling himself around the Southwest in a battered 78 Suburban for ever-shrinking paychecks. He remembers all his lyrics though bourbon helps him forget the days when he was a much bigger act and the money arrived faster than he could squander it. He gets through his sets even though he may have to excuse himself midverse to Ralph into a trash can. And the honky-tonk mamas he snags are getting to be nanas. The film makes no attempt to explain Bads songs -- they just sort of occur to him -- but it sketches the conditions in which they begin to swarm and spawn. On a two-night gig in Austin Texas Bad consents to an interview with a music writer named Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal in top form). Shes the most beautiful woman hes had in his sights in a while; inside those scrunched features and gangling limbs is something interior and lovely. ""I want to talk to you about how bad you make this room look"" he says and Bridges makes you believe its a spontaneous burst of poetry not a standard line of bull. More than that he discovers he likes talking to her. A few topics are off-limits like his onetime sideman current superstar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell also at the top of his game). But they share a love of music and a common experience of hard times. Jean a single mom whos seen her share of losers takes a tentative shine to Bad who cleans up his act and spends some time with her baking biscuits for her little boy. This unmade bed of a man begins to pull himself together. CRAZY HEART  1/2 of four stars Rating R for brief sexuality language. Theater Uptown. Live music Bands will play a half-hour before the 715 p.m. showings Friday (the Evening Rig) and Saturday (the Prairie Sons). Bridges and Farrell do shrewd precise work together; Tommy offers his old mentor a hand back to the big leagues and Bad cant decide if hes outraged grateful or embarrassed by his own eagerness. This is called acting and it is why famous actors will agree to a pay cut to take a role. As sure as verse follows chorus trouble arrives and you may see the well-worn plot twists coming a mile off. Still ""Crazy Heart"" gets us worried about what will happen to Bad and Jean who matter to each other even though the world is no longer interested in them. It would make a heck of a song.

The liquor store proprietor down the street recognizes his hero and hands him a bottle. Midway through that nights set Blake is puking into a garbage can.Despite the familiar story line - the alcoholic artist looking for redemption and maybe an AA meeting to help him get there - Crazy Heart is the real thing and a real gem. Bridges an actor who makes it look effortless - he slips into his characters like hes just putting on a fresh shirt - has been handed the role of his career. (And for a guy whos already played the Dude a Fabulous Baker Boy a Starman and car builder Preston Tucker thats saying a lot.)Looking a little like Kris Kristofferson but sounding a tad less croaky (Bridges does his own singing) the actor finds the heart and soul of this broke-down man. But not so broke he cant be reached by a glimmer of light - by way of a newspaper writer and Bad Blake aficionado played by Maggie Gyllenhaal - that makes him think maybe hes got some life left in him. And even another song or two.Speaking of songs a movie about a guy renowned for his country classics wouldnt be worth much if the songs didnt sound like classics and in Crazy Heart they do. Written by T Bone Burnett Ryan Bingham and the late Stephen Bruton ""Fallin amp; Flyin "" (with the line ""Funny how fallin feels like flyin - for a little while"") ""Somebody Else"" ""I Dont Know"" and ""The Weary Kind"" could easily find themselves on the Billboard charts. And in an uncredited turn Colin Farrell shows up as a Toby Keith-like star who mentored under Blake and now packs arenas with a repertoire of Blakes old tunes. The Irish actor talkin in a dust-bowl drawl his hair pulled back in a ponytail sings the heck out of those songs too.Gyllenhaals Jean a single mother with a history of ill-advised relationships cant quite stop herself from falling into this new one with Blake. At first things go well. Blake takes to Jeans young son teaching him how to make buttermilk biscuits and playing with him in the park. But when Jean and her boy travel from Santa Fe to Blakes unkempt bungalow in Houston the vision of a happy new family turns dark and almost tragic.Robert Duvall who starred in the not-dissimilar 1983 Oscar-winner Tender Mercies (an alcoholic washed-up country singer) passes the baton to Bridges and passes him a shot glass playing a friendly barkeep who watches over his stuporous pal. Theres a beautiful scene in which the two men go fishing and Duvall casting a line lazily into the still water starts crooning a ditty called ""Live Forever."" (Stay through the end credits for a sweet encore.)Its a simple serene moment that feels sprung from real life. Crazy Heart feels that way from beginning to end.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments (4) click to enlarge Crazy Heart Recommended Video Rated R  111 minutes  2010 Jeff Bridges finds the perfect vehicle for his lazy charm and bitter irony in the role of Bad Blake a washed-up country star trying to climb out of the bottle and put his life back together. Once an incisive and lionized songwriter Blake now drives around the southwest wandering through his old hits at honky-tonk gigs. An unexpected romance with a newspaper reporter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) offers hope of personal redemption and a contract writing songs for a stadium-packing country heartthrob (Colin Farrell) promises something of a comeback but they dont call him Bad Blake for nothing. Robert Duvall who played a similar character in Bruce Beresfords Tender Mercies (1983) turns up in a supporting role and the movies make good companion pieces; Bridges cant match the emotional volatility Duvall brought to his ruined singer but he invests Blake with a humor and intelligence that make him more self-aware in his decline. Scott Cooper directed this 2009 drama which won Bridges an Oscar. By J.R.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Youve seen ""Crazy Heart before - many many times actually - but it doesnt much matter. Country and western music feeds on that sense of rueful willful repetition the knowledge that sins of the past will be sinned in the future even as the singer is lamenting those sins in the present.Thats where the humor and the dead-eyed fatalism of country both come from and thats what fuels Jeff Bridgess shambling yet masterful performance as Bad Blake faded Camp;W star and sorry-ass reprobate. When Scott Coopers film opens Bad is 57 and has sunk to appearing at a New Mexico bowling alley where the patrons cheer him on as a souvenir of their own outlaw youth. He gets halfway through his best-known hit rushes out back to throw up then returns to finish the song. In country music terms that means hes a pro.The chorus of that song goes ""Its funny how falling feels like flying for a little while and ""Crazy Heart is about Bad learning the hard way to appreciate the difference. The film could be mistaken at first glance for this years ""The Wrestler but it has deeper taproots in American music and American film. Through the holes in Bad Blakes soul you can see Rip Torn in 1973s ""Payday and Andy Griffith in 1957s ""A Face in the Crowd. Even Robert Duvall turns up in a few scenes as if he had decided to stroll over from 1983s ""Tender Mercies with some much-needed advice.The movies based on a 1987 novel by Thomas Cobb and samples both the mythos of Hank Williams and those whove tried to live down to his example. (At one point Waylon Jenningss ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way? mocks Bad from the soundtrack.) Since every country song needs its honky-tonk angel ""Crazy Heart also brings on Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean a small-town reporter and single mom with a weakness for sexy screw-ups. That Jean would allow herself to fall for the paunchy sozzled Bad - Bridges really is a wreck here - is the movies biggest stretch yet the scenes between the two are also its most touchingly erotic. Jean is damaged but still able to shine in the dimming glow of her new lovers star wattage; in her tenderness Bad sees reprieve.""Crazy Heart also looks knowingly at the music industry from the periphery. Bad gets periodic phone calls from his agent (Paul Herman in a stock role) begging him to get off the sauce and start writing songs again but his biggest stumbling block remains Tommy Sweet a one-time sideman who has become a New Country superstar. We hear a lot about Tommy - most of it sour grapes - and when he finally arrives in the person of a surprisingly convincing Colin Farrell hes much more sympathetic than his mentor cares to admit. Among other things ""Crazy Heart shows how the kids mass following lacks the bone-deep connection Bad has with his audience. Tommy just sings about his listeners troubles. Bad lives them and the movie views that bond - and the fans themselves - with the deepest respect.The music is terrific as it should be in a movie where T Bone Burnett wrote the songs with Stephen Bruton himself a musicians musician who died of cancer two weeks after finishing the collaboration. Bridges sings the lyrics with a bit of the old high-and-lonesome and a lot of boozy defiance; he gets deep inside the blissful hopelessness of a line like ""You never see it coming till its gone.He has always been one of our shaggiest leading men the movie star least interested in stardom and in ""Crazy Heart Bridges lets it all hang out gut tongue hair. Bad Blake is his appetites and just enough self-awareness to comment on them. He sweats like a pig; his jaw wobbles as if Bridges were still channeling the Starman. The character could be Kris Kristoffersons prodigal kid brother animated not by orneriness (attractive though that might be) but by craft. Bads battered acoustic guitar is never far from his hand; more than his four ex-wives and even more than Jean its the one lover that has never failed him.The role may yet win Bridges his first Oscar but it doesnt feel like a reach; it doesnt make you consider this actor anew the way 2004s little-seen ""The Door in the Floor did. Bridges has the same love of craft Bad does though and the same distrust of showing it off. What he does has to look easy and it has to feel familiar - only then can the truth sneak in. Trying out a new tune on Jean Bad observes ""Thats the way it is with the good ones - youre sure youve heard them before. So it is with songs country music movies and great performances like this.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Crazy Heart Good Director Scott Cooper. Cast Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhall Colin Farrell. Rating R for language and brief sexuality. Note At Harkins Camelview 5. RELATED For Crazy Heart Gyllenhaal plays it green Movies about musicians In the case of ""Crazy Heart"" director Scott Cooper has and then some. Jeff Bridges portrayal of broken-down liquored-up country singer Bad Blake may be the best of his career and thats saying something. The besotted country crooner is a movie trope. And why not? When done well - in Robert Duvalls Oscar-winning turn in ""Tender Mercies"" for example - you get to cover so many bases pain regret remorse recovery. Duvall shows up in ""Crazy Heart"" as a bar owner but Bridges performance is so powerful were not distracted by Duvalls previous work as Mac Sledge. When we meet Bad hes a has-been of his own making. Hes playing shows in bowling alleys crisscrossing the West in an old truck thats as worn out as he is. A former star he now has reached the place in his life and career that he occasionally has to leave the stage abruptly letting his backing band - local musicians retained for the night - to soldier on while he hustles outside to vomit. But his legendary songs endure largely through the efforts of country superstar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) for whom Bad was a mentor. Now however the combination of booze and jealousy keeps Tommy at a distance even though he wants to help Bad. At a gig in Santa Fe Bad meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a local reporter and single mother to whom Bad grants an interview. You can probably guess where this is going; originality isnt Coopers strong suit (he also wrote the screenplay based on Thomas Cobbs novel). Bad falls for Jean Jean falls for Bad he bonds with her adorable son. Where this will lead is pretty obvious but if the destination isnt a surprise the journey can be thanks to Bridges performance. Bad is simply a drunk. But we dont feel sorry for him; Bridges wont let us. Despite a life full of bad decisions (a string of busted marriages for instance) hes still ornery enough to fight with his manager over better bookings and thanks to Jeans inspiration still talented enough to write great songs. Bridges and Farrell do their own singing quite effectively. The songs written by Stephen Bruton and T Bone Burnett are perfect just the kind of thing Bad would write. For someone who has been around so long Bridges remains underrated. ""Crazy Hearts"" probably will change that and it should. Bridges doesnt just play Bad he inhabits him making him believable from his notable entrance (evidently he doesnt like to use rest stops) to his relationship with Jeans son to singing and playing onstage. You want Bad to get better to succeed. Everyone around him does. But as Bridges makes clear for that to happen Bad has to want it more than anyone else.

Movie Information Crazy HeartRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Scott CooperActors Jeff Bridges Colin Farrell Maggie Gyllenhaal and Robert DuvallRun time 100 minutesMPAA rating R (strong language sexual content)Synopsis Jeff Bridges plays a down-on-his-luck country singer in this film.More movies from GuideLive.comBridges has spent most of the past decade in character parts lending sophistication and understated charm to slick Hollywood movies such as The Contender and Iron Man. As Bad Blake he reminds us why hes a true movie star Few performers could make a character this potentially repellent so completely fascinating and endearing. The four-time Oscar-nominated actor seems to have finally found the role that will win him the long-overdue prize.When we first meet him Bad has just shown up at a bowling alley in New Mexico where his manager (James Keane) has booked him for a performance. This once well-known singer-songwriter is now broke and trapped on a dead-end concert circuit. Hes also consumed with resentment for a young star named Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell barely recognizable and terrifically convincing) whom he once mentored.Written and directed by first-timer Scott Cooper and based on a novel by Thomas Cobb Crazy Heart will seem familiar to anyone who remembers Robert Duvalls similarly tortured singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies. (In case you do forget Duvall shows up briefly here to remind you; he plays a bar owner and longtime friend of Bads.) The central plot device which finds Bad falling for a lonely single mother (an excellent Maggie Gyllenhaal) isnt especially original or believable. Would someone who looks like Gyllenhaal really sleep with a guy 50 pounds overweight 25 years her senior and perpetually reeking of booze and cigarettes?But so much about Crazy Heart proves irresistible. The soundtrack by Fort Worths T Bone Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton who died of stomach cancer this year features a series of country songs that are poignant eloquent and catchy; the songs are performed by Bridges and Farrell. Cooper illuminates the lonely hardscrabble experience of living on the road bouncing from dumpy motel to dingy bar seeking out fleeting sexual and emotional connections wherever they can be found. And Bridges commits completely to his character exploring every nuance of Bads physical and spiritual decay. The result is an old-fashioned melodrama with the urgency and grit of a documentary. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Crazy Heart Drama. Starring Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell. Directed by Scott Cooper. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Perhaps the idea of watching Jeff Bridges as a drunken broken-down down-on-his luck country music singer in ""Crazy Heart"" doesnt automatically sound appealing. But think this ""The Wrestler."" With good songs. Bridges command of this character and this movie are apparent from the first moments when he pulls up at the bowling alley where hell be playing that night. He gets out of the car with his pants unbuckled because thats how a fellow would drive whos got a big gut and 300 miles between gigs. When he talks theres whiskey in the voice and just the faintest hint of breathlessness like someone in the early stages of emphysema. Then he goes up to the bowling alleys bar and tries to charm the barmaid into giving him a free drink but its the thin charm of a drowning man. Scott Cooper who wrote and directed ""Crazy Heart"" adopts a smart strategy in introducing the central character. First he shows us everything thats wrong with ""Bad"" Blake (Bridges) and only then does he show him perform - and we get to see that this falling-down mess is actually talented. The songs are catchy and the voice is full of character and lived-in authenticity. This is Bridges doing his own singing of original songs by T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton and its nothing like some conscientious actor doing decent karaoke. As a singer as a stage presence and as a country music stylist Bridges has it all. So what happened to Bad Blake? Is this the fate of a talented recording artist popular today and forgotten the next? Is the pressure of the musicians life acting on a sensitive spirit or just a morally lazy man who went off the tracks long ago? The answer is a combination of all those things and one or two more. ""Crazy Heart"" gives us an aging musicians life on the road which consists of lots of drinking smoking and one-night stands - with groupies who are as weathered as he is. Along the way there are crystalline moments when the music is just right. Maggie Gyllenhaal turns up as a journalist who interviews Blake. Her questions are embarrassingly vague and show no preparation though this is just a professional quibble on my part. Bad journalism aside Gyllenhaals naturally skeptical amused and watchful quality is just right for a role in which she finds herself relentlessly drawn to a man she knows is bad news. But this show belongs to Bridges who starts off as a magnificent train wreck and then takes a journey with the character. He understands Bad Blake so completely and is so confident and competent in his capacity as a singer that the acting doesnt stop at the stage door. There are subtle differences in his singing when Blake is drunk or sober for example and not in the usual ways. When hes drunk he doesnt slur his words - hes just emotionally disconnected. And when hes sober hes all there. Likewise theres a difference in the way Blake sings his new songs and his old songs. Hes more present for the new material. Bridges has been this good in a handful of other roles but hes never been better. And Colin Farrell has never been worse although in ""Crazy Heart"" Farrell is awful in a benign way that doesnt hurt anybody. As country musics reigning star Farrell looks super-embarrassed every time he has to sing and in the offstage scenes Farrell keeps his head down and wont make eye contact with the other actors. Farrell seems as if he just wants to get out of the movie without anybody including critics noticing him. He even chose to keep his name out of the credits. He could run but he cant hide. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations strong language and substance abuse.

That was the year Roberto Benigni did his clowns leap to the stage to pick up his Best Actor Oscar but in retrospect the issue isnt that Benigni beat out Nick Nolte Edward Norton Ian McKellen and Tom Hanks for the award; its that Jeff Bridges wasnt even nominated. His deft hilarious thrillingly perfect performance as Jeffrey Lebowski a.k.a. the Dude in the Coen brothers genius film The Big Lebowski should have been showered with prizes. Instead the only official honor Bridges got for the 1998 film was a nomination from the Satellite Awards whatever those are. What has all this got to do with Crazy Heart which features Bridges as a washed-up country-and-western singer? A low-budget affair made by Country Music Television the film might have gone straight to DVD if ICM hadnt gone to bat for a theatrical release on behalf of first-time writer-director Scott Cooper. The agencys persistence is paying off in Oscar buzz for Bridges who has been nominated four times in his career and has always gone home empty-handed. If the Golden Globe nomination he earned this week is any sign it seems probable that hell be recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his performance in Crazy Heart as the alcoholic singer-songwriter Bad Blake -- and while the film isnt quite the timeless gem Lebowski is Bridges playing the perennially soused is once again spectacularly award-worthy. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) Thats not to say that Bad is just an older Dude. Certainly there are similarities -- both men wander around with a lowball in hand pot belly swaying in gentle tandem with the ice clinking against the side of the glass and Crazy Heart even opens at a bowling alley. But whereas bowling was the Dudes favorite sport and main occupation for Bad finding himself performing at a bowling alley in Pueblo Colo. is a misery. Hes a legend in the country-and-western scene but hes 57 broke and no longer even afforded the dignity of running a tab at the bars where he plays (""Im ..."" he starts to tell an unsympathetic bartender waiting for her 4.75 then gestures at the stage with a weary paw. ""Hell I am the band."") Moreover Bad has a lot more menace in him than the Dude; hes so self-destructive that anyone around him is likely to get hit with some sort of whiskey-soaked shrapnel. Indeed alarm bells go off the minute we hear that the love interest he meets on the road an aspiring journalist named Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has a 4-year-old. (And shes a single mother movie shorthand for Vulnerable with Babysitting Issues.) In his bitterness Bad might be closer to Jack Baker of The Fabulous Baker Boys 20 years down the road and without Michelle Pfeiffers Susie Diamond for motivation. Bad is angry at just about everything from what might have been in his personal life (theres an abandoned son out there somewhere) to the fact that his slick protege Tommy Sweet (a spot-on Colin Farrell) is hugely successful largely on the basis of having turned one of Bads songs into a smash hit. Bad would tell you Tommys career was never the one he was after but given how used up he feels by his life in music its only natural that he assigns the blame to the person who most obviously used him. Every movement of Bridges performance reveals not just the mess Bad is but something about the man he once was. There is a terrifically naked moment when Jean catches him watching porn on the couch with nothing but a towel tossed over his paunch. Shes embarrassed but more important hes mortified and for the first time as he attempts to gather the shambles of his dignity around him we see that Bad is not beyond caring. Cooper nicely juxtaposes this with a later scene of Bads seducing Jean when shes on her way out a different door and hes wonderfully courtly and engaged. (Unfortunately I didnt know exactly what to make of Jean. Theres something vaguely untrustworthy about the character which may have been Coopers intent or Gyllenhaals lapse hard to tell. Shes all squirms and smiles.) Yet for all that meticulous craft Bridges still gives such an organic performance you sometimes forget its him youre watching (peering into that face youd swear its Kris Kristofferson) and that hes playing a fictional character. When Bridges sings Bads wistful weary songs -- written by producer T-Bone Burnett and a group of other musicians including Ryan Bingham who has a small part in the film -- you feel like this is a guy you might be lucky to find at your local honky-tonk. One of the first lyrics we hear from Bad is ""I used to be somebody/ Now I am somebody else."" Jeff Bridges has made a lifetime of being somebody else and he just keeps getting better at it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 17 2009 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Fox Searchlight films Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal are shown in a scene from Crazy Heart. Lorey Sebastian/Fox Searchlight/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Crazy Heart"" is about a boozy washed-up country-and-western star and if you think youve seen it all before you havent. Thats because Jeff Bridges a great actor plays the singer.Bridgess Bad Blake still has a loyal following but mostly plays bowling alleys and rundown honky-tonks. He prides himself on never missing a show but once onstage his participation is iffy. In one garishly funny sequence he breaks off mid-number rushes into a back alley to throw up and then rejoins the band as if nothing was wrong. In his own strung-out way Blake has aplomb. Somewhere deep inside this bushy-bearded guy with a bum leg and a big belly is the young star he once was.The best thing to happen to Blake is Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a starry-eyed feature writer for a Sante Fe newspaper who interviews him and winds up in his bed. Groupies are nothing new for Blake but Jean who is divorced with a little boy is different. Shes smart tough-minded and has class. When she first walks into his dingy motel room he remarks that she ""makes the room look bad"" and hes not trying to butter her up. Hes just being honest. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It is because of Jean that Blake whose health is declining decides to reform. Because of the responsibilities she imposes Jean is also why he stumbles. The romance between these two doesnt quite convince perhaps because as Gyllenhaal plays her Jean seems too level-headed too unmasochistic to fall for Blake. But this criticism may be off the mark. ""Crazy Heart"" familiar as it seems doesnt play out the way you expect it to. What Gyllenhaal and debuting writer-director Scott Cooper are saying is You can be nobodys fool and still be a fool for love. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Crazy Heart movie review This is certainly true for Blake who seems to lose about 30 years whenever hes in Jeans company. His foolishness is restorative. Cynical as he is he still has high hopes. His relationship with Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) a former sidekick-turned-star is fraught but when Tommy who genuinely likes Blake asks him to write some new songs for him Blake delivers. ""I used to be somebody but now Im somebody else"" Blake sings early on. ""Crazy Heart"" is about how he joins himself together again.Bridges makes all this corn-pone sorrow worth watching. Not once does he condescend to his character. Blake is no rube no cracker. Bridges has been one of Americas best actors ever since he started out in his early 20s in films like ""The Last American Hero"" and ""The Last Picture Show."" Hes given amazing performances in everything from ""Cutters Way"" and ""The Iceman Cometh"" to ""Wild Bill"" and ""The Fabulous Baker Boys."" But because hes rarely been in blockbusters hes never gotten the popular recognition he deserves. ""Crazy Heart"" probably wont change that. Adapted from a novel by Thomas Hood its scaled small and its not startling enough to make us forget its antecedents especially ""Tender Mercies."" (The star of that film Robert Duvall is a producer of ""Crazy Hearts"" as is Bridges and has a small role in it.) It would be a mistake though to assume that Bridges is like anybody else youve ever seen. (He like Farrell even does his own singing and hes good.) Most of these country-and-western roles are open invitations to chomp scenery but Bridges who looks here like Kris Kristofferson from some angles is so supremely naturalistic that you never catch him acting. This is of course the most difficult form of acting. Bridges draws us deeply inside Blakes moment-to-moment heartbreaks. He makes us root for him as we would root for a dear friend. Ultimately his triumphs become our own. Grade A- (Rated R for language and brief sexuality.)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The lives of great country singers tend to be on the messy side to put it mildly. They wear their scars proudly brandishing hardscrabble upbringings bouts with drugs and alcohol abuse acrimonious divorces family troubles and haphazardly squandered fortunes as rites of passage and badges of authenticity. Consequently Bad Blake the self-destructive veteran country singer played by Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart could have been inspired by about a hundred different country icons (though physically he bears an uncanny resemblance to the supremely grizzled Kris Kristofferson). Hes a gifted singer-songwriter in the midst of a long seemingly permanent personal and professional freefall. Bridges plays a bloated depressed musician whose former sideman (Colin Farrell) has rocketed to superstardom while his own fortunes sank into an alcoholic haze of grubby honky-tonks and meaningless one-night stands. Bridges luck improves when a journalist and single mother (Maggie Gyllenhaal) takes a more-than-professional interest in him and hes offered an opportunity to open for Farrell and write songs for his next album. Robert Duvall who previously traversed this bittersweet terrain in Tender Mercies produces and co-stars as one of Bridges best friends a barkeep whose a cappella rendition of Billy Joe Shavers ""Live Forever"" provides a melancholy highlight. The world can be cruel to crusty old veterans like Bridges character but the universe smiles on him here Farrell doesnt let his former boss resentment of his success keep him from lending a helping hand Duvall is loyal and true and Gyllenhaal and her adorable son offer him a lifeline to happiness as he staggers out of an endless funk. Bridges brings a battered weary dignity and a suitably weathered voice to the juicy role of a survivor learning to value himself and his gifts after decades of neglect and abuse. Crazy Heart could use more rough edges but while its a little too sentimental and tidy Bridges humane deeply empathetic lead performance makes it easy to root for one mans redemption.

Jeff Bridges gives the performance of the year in Crazy Heart. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 17 2009 216 PM The Dude Abides Jeff Bridges gives the performance of the year in Crazy Heart. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Crazy Heart come back here and check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake in Crazy Heart Every detail of Jeff Bridges performance in Crazy Heart (Fox Searchlight) is so delicious you want to sop it up with buttermilk biscuits the counterintuitive line readings the throwaway bits of business the way he walks and smokes and drinks and flirts and sings. In Bridges hands the down-and-out country music star Bad Blake becomes a kind of Fender-playing Falstaff his pathos inseparable from his humor and his weakness inseparable from his strength. On first viewing Crazy Heart seemed like a pretty good movie with one great performance. After a second time through its sneaking up on the title of my favorite film of the year. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The debut feature of the young writer/director Scott Cooper Crazy Heart deals with the cliche of the alcoholic over-the-hill performer the way a good country song deals with the cliche of honky-tonks and Chevy trucks by embracing the familiar tropes with wit and craft and making them its own. In fact the film features an actual Chevy truck the 78 Suburban that Bad Blake drives from town to town with his equipment in the back gigging in ever-less-impressive venues. The first words we hear him speak are ""Shit. Its a fuckin bowling alley."" Advertisement In the small New Mexico town where he plays that bowling alley Bad meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) an aspiring music journalist who wants to interview him for the Santa Fe paper. Despite the 20-year difference in age they fall in love quickly and completely convincingly. (Heretofore the sexiest screen couple of the year was Clooney and Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air or possibly Streep and Stanley Tucci in Julie amp; Julia. Henceforth its Bad and Jean all the way.) Bad drives on to the next gig but he and Jean maintain a long-distance connection despite her doubts--shes a single mother whos been burned by love before. (I know I know. Just own it.) Bad and Jean circle each other gingerly until a physical injury forces him to admit his need for her as well as to confront the sorry condition his Johnny Cash-level addictions have left him in. On the career front Bad faces a similar choice He can keep touring the same downwardly mobile dives or swallow his pride and open for Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) the young country star who was once his protege. Tommy has done Bad some wrong in the past thats never fully disclosed--its enough to know that theres bitterness between them. Farrell is never quite believable as a country boy but in an odd way thats just right since his character is meant to be something of a slick pretender. Gyllenhaal is even harder to buy as a girl out of Enid Okla.--her East Coast pedigree is too indelible--but we believe that Jean is crazy in love with Bad and thats all that matters. Reading this plot summary you might think you know what kind of movie this is but youd be wrong. As Bad Blake Bridges displays not a trace of the masochistic wallowing in degradation that characterizes the conventional musician-on-the-rocks biopic (and which was so ably parodied in Walk Hard.) He never slurs his speech when playing drunk nor does the director cut from his flop-sweat-covered brow to a restless audience. Even at his lowest point Bad has flashes of self-awareness and humor; he may be committing slow suicide but hes doing it with a wry smile. Bridges great strength as an actor is his seeming effortlessness. Unlike a lot of his more solemn fellow thespians he doesnt like to show his work. Hes Zen in the best sense alive and open creating things in the moment. It was this quality that made The Big Lebowskis Dude such an unforgettable character--one who has in a sense outlived the movie he appeared in. (I barely remember the plot of The Big Lebowski but I often consult with my inner Dude.) Bad Blake is the same way; you walk out of the movie unable to stop imagining what might have happened to him before and after the story takes place. Ill end this sloppy kiss of a review with the observation that the songs written for Bad to play are all good and one of them is sensational. (Bridges does his own playing and singing--not a stretch as hes been a guitarist for more than 40 years.) I can hardly wait for the soundtrack to drop on Jan. 19. (Why so long New West Records?) The music coordinator for the film was T-Bone Burnett and he co-wrote Bads songs with a group of musicians including Ryan Bingham (who also has a small role as a pickup band leader) and the late Stephen Bruton. I dont know if these songs are credible as the monster country hits theyre supposed to be in the movie but theyre catchy as all get-out with lyrics that suit Bads style of almost jaunty self-loathing ""I used to be somebody/ But now I am somebody else."" A few of the songs get played several times over the course of the film and with each performance they accrue new meaning the old crowd-pleasers Bad is sick of playing the new song hes inspired to write by Jean the one he wrote for Tommy Sweet that made the apprentice more famous than the mentor. Its rare for the music in a film about musicians to advance the narrative in this way--another of the textural details that makes this apparently simple tale of addiction love and the possibility of redemption feel so unusual and so true.

"Crazy Heart | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crazy-heart ) Crazy Heart (United States 2009) December 16 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Crazy Heart is the country music version of The Wrestler a grizzled veteran whose days in the spotlight are behind him struggles to keep going while seeing the world through a haze of regret and booze. The story is unremarkable; the alcoholic coming to terms with an addiction and striving to overcome it has provided the framework for everything from compelling cinema to maudlin made-for-TV movies. What elevates Crazy Heart is the remarkable performance of Jeff Bridges. The Oscar buzz about Bridges which began to build slowly before reaching a critical mass when Fox Searchlight decided to go to bat for him is driving this production. Not to take anything away from Bridges co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal or supporting performers Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell but everything that is compelling about Crazy Heart is filtered through Bridges. He more than the story or the direction of first-time filmmaker Scott Cooper or T-Bone Burnetts country/western songs is the reason to set aside two hours to watch this. Bridges is Bad Blake a washed up country singer who has fallen so far down the entertainment ladder from his one-time A-list perch that there are no more letters to describe the rung where he currently dangles. He tours the southwest stopping in bowling alleys and bars to do sets primarily because he needs the money but also because without the gigs hed have nothing to do with his life. His means of transportation is a beat-up pickup truck and his rare moments of sobriety are confined to the early mornings. During one song he walks off stage and out the back door to throw up in a garbage can. Bad has a booster in hot young country star Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) but hes too proud and stubborn to accept Tommys extended helping hand. Tommy views Bad as his mentor; Bad sees Tommy as an upstart who left him in the dust on the way to the top. Bads love life is defined by a long line of one night stands typically with women whose names he doesnt know and whose faces he cant remember. That changes however with Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a journalist he meets in Santa Fe. Inexplicably shes as attracted to him as he is to her and they embark upon a relationship. For Bad theres something extra in being with Jean than the opportunity to interact with an intelligent independent woman. She has a four-year old son Buddy (Jack Nation) who is the age that Bads child was when the singer abandoned him a quarter of a century ago. Spending time with Buddy allows him to live out the illusion of being a father and he contemplates making contact with his now-adult son. But the specter of Bads alcoholic tendencies hangs like a pall over his every action and one senses its only a matter of time before he screws things up. When one considers show business the sad truth is that there are more Bad Blakes than there are Tommy Sweets. Bads chosen genre is country/western but hes like those once-popular rock n roll stars from the 60s playing half-empty venues while singing long-forgotten Top 40 hits and drowning their sorrows in booze. Bads story is not unique. In fact its a near-perfect clichA(c) right down to the neglected son and the chance at a fresh start. The pattern is pretty much the same one we saw Mickey Rourkes character navigate during the course of The Wrestler (which overall was a better scripted motion picture). At least this movie ends on a note that is less nihilistic. Considering his longevity popularity and ability its hard to believe Bridges has never won an Oscar. This should represent his fifth nomination and second as a leading man (he was previously one of the Chosen Five in 1985 for Starman). As has so often been the case throughout his career Bridges becomes the character. He buries himself so thoroughly in the role that theres nothing of the actor remaining. At times he more closely resembles Nick Nolte and Kris Kristofferson than Jeff Bridges. Yet this is the same guy who has a secondary part in The Men Who Stare at Goats. Bridges can also sing which is an important qualification for playing Bad Blake since the guy was once a top country star. The actors intensity is unflagging his attention to detail exacting. He gets everything right from the slow shambling gait of someone carrying around more weight than his 57 years to the dead look in his eyes - the mark of someone who has given up. Yet on those occasions when he picks up a guitar and lets his fingers dance across the strings some vestige of who he once was is awakened. The other actors in Crazy Heart do their jobs including Maggie Gyllenhaal (as the obligatory love interest) and Robert Duvall who is on hand primarily for his name (his part is inconsequential) but they are merely in low orbits around Bridges. This is his film. Crazy Heart is a labor of love for many of those involved. Duvalls participation will cause many to invoke the title of Tender Mercies (there are similarities) and he matches his on-screen appearance with an off-screen producer credit - something he shares with Bridges. For his part Cooper an actor by trade wrote directed and produced the movie. Until about a month ago no one had heard of Crazy Heart and Bridges interpretation of Bad was the best performance of 2009 no one had seen. Now with Fox Searchlights push to get the movie into the light its possible this could turn into the best performance of 2009 that Oscar voters will see.

The first feature from director Scott Cooper who also wrote the script based on a novel by Thomas Cobb is a showcase for Jeff Bridges who provides the years signature performance by a lead actor. Bridges fully inhabits singer Bad Blake from his wrecked liver to his tornado hair. His breath is combustible his hygiene lamentable his future brief. The 78 Suburban he drives around is livelier than he is. ""I used to be somebody"" he sings in a desperation gig at a bowling alley. ""But now I am somebody else."" The departed somebody was a hit songwriter now forgotten by the public if not by such fans as a former student and current top star Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell who must have been tempted to dial up the yee-hawing but doesnt). The somebody else has roughly as many ex-wives as fans and more empty bottles than either. Also theres a grown son somewhere. Bad doesnt know him and never will. Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a journalist with a small son of her own. She wont let him be raised by another whiskey slave but even so she finds herself leaning in to get a closer look at whats flickering inside Bad -- dying talent maybe unless its something else. She wants to know where all his songs come from (""Life unfortunately"" says Bad with woeful authority). He wants to talk about how she makes the room around her feel ashamed of itself. Gyllenhaal though she is essentially the romantic version of a straight man eases comfortably into the role instead of showing us how hard shes working at it with a sparkle in her eyes that is all the movie needs to keep Bad trying to be good. Uncertainly she even allows the geezer to baby-sit her child for a day. What might the planned activities be? ""Man stuff"" he says and the boy agrees. ""Man stuff"" Such found moments -- so elegant and mature is the screenplay that it usually doesnt seem to have been written at all -- make for genuine laughs just as the bleak interludes involve recognizable simple ruinous mistakes (in the car at the mall). Directing a picture like this one requires precision and dedication. The game is finished if we ever get the sense that our chain is being yanked that were being sold a story instead of told one. But thanks to evocative settings compassionate acting (including a brief but warm funny appearance by Robert Duvall) and the high-caliber country songs written for the film ""Crazy Heart"" is humbly radiant a small thing gracefully done. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Out of this world Read Next Out of this world Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Lorey Sebastian) Joe Neumaier Tuesday December 15 2009 653 PM Title Crazy Heart If country music speaks for honky-tonk souls everywhere then Bad Blake -- the fictional falling-down-drunk formerly famous Camp;W star played by Jeff Bridges in ""Crazy Heart"" -- could be their patron saint.Bads been drinking till hes petrified for decades. Now 57 his voice is as scratchy and lived-in as the station wagon he drives to Southwestern bowling alleys and taverns where he lights up tanks up and plays his old hits. With a whisky gut under his Fender guitar and a beard that could tell stories Bad is who he is complete with midshow sick bouts and postshow conquests (though his groupies are getting as old as life on the road). It may not seem like Bad has any pride left but he knows who he was -- and thats what keeps him from making some much-needed cash writing songs for Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) a former protege of Bads whos now a superstar. Then the four-times-divorced Bad meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a single mom and aspiring journalist in Santa Fe. Her love is what he needs to stop drinking though the haggard Bad has a knack of letting everyone including himself down.Writer-director Scott Cooper working from a book by Thomas Cobb turns this hard-living redemption tale into a rich lived-in portrait of a certain type of American fame. Bad Blake is a dying breed of outlaw cowboy -- a shot of Waylon with a George Jones chaser -- and Bridges lets us see the shadow of every low point that killed every high.Its a great companion role to the one Bridges -- once lauded as the best actor of his generation -- gave 20 years ago in ""The Fabulous Baker Boys."" It also has echoes of Robert Duvalls Mac Sledge in 1983s ""Tender Mercies."" Duvall a co-producer here appears in a kind of benediction as Bads good ol buddy Wayne.Yet what Bridges brings including vocals on new T-Bone Burnett songs and an amiable portrait of a wounded talent is crazy great. His scenes with Farrell are subtle and deferential not the aging-bull young-buck faceoffs you might expect.Gyllenhaal is charming and makes unexpected choices in her performance but this is Bridges show and hes as Best Actor-worthy as hes ever been.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIECrazy Heart   out of fourStars Jeff Bridges Colin Farrell Maggie Gyllenhaal Robert DuvallDirector Scott CooperRated R for language and brief sexuality. Running time 1 hour 51 minutes. Opens Wednesday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Jeff Bridges character may be called Bad Blake but his performance is incredibly good perhaps the best of his career. The simple ordinary story in Crazy Heart (   out of four) about a down-on-his-luck country singer is raised by the heartfelt and raw portrayal that Bridges makes look effortless. And he can sing too. EXCLUSIVE VIDEO The Crazy Heart theme song INTERVIEW Jeff Bridges strikes a new chord in Crazy Heart Bridges drunken hard-living cowboy is a variation of an American archetype. In his late 50s Bad has his private moments of sorrow and his public bouts of shame; hes self-destructive and out of control. But somehow he convinces us that while his career may be washed up hes not a total washout. Bridges imbues the character with a gritty authenticity and humanity. The story follows Bad on a series of lonely gigs in between which he meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a kindhearted reporter at a small newspaper. When he stumbles around in seedy motel rooms drunk beyond reason we believe him. We also completely buy it as he staggers onstage and somehow pulls it together to perform his signature tunes and engage an enthusiastic if tiny audience. His romance with the much-younger Jean is less convincing. The story helmed by first-time director Scott Cooper will invite comparisons to Tender Mercies the 1983 film about another fallen country singer. It won a best-actor Oscar for Robert Duvall who is a producer and a co-star in this film. Duvall plays Wayne the recovering-alcoholic owner of a bar Bad frequents. Crazy Heart based on a 1987 novel by Thomas Cobb also has great music. Even if youre not a country music fan the songs by T Bone Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton are infectious. Like a classic country tune the movie feels familiar. Weve seen other incarnations of characters like Bad the musician whom time and tastes have passed by. But he cant stop performing; its the life spark in him. So pride be damned he takes gigs in bowling alleys and nowheresville bars and clubs. Meanwhile his former protege Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) has achieved arena-size success. Bads reaction at first resentful is complicated. There is something inherently decent in Bad despite his alcohol-fueled behavior. We get a potent sense of it in his dealings with Tommy. The Irish-born Farrell is surprisingly persuasive as a country singer a much slicker character than the old-school Bad. When Bad meets Jean and her young son he wants to be a better man and you can feel the tug of war between his better judgment and the booze. He doesnt wrestle with his demons so much as lunge at them. But like a plaintive song the melancholy has a redemptive undertone. For the audience Bridges radiant acting is all the redemption needed. .) Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Its another in a string of low-paying low-turnout gigs with pickup bands half his age grinding the Greatest Hits out of an old Fender Tremolux including his breakout--with the chorus ""Funny how falling feels like flying . . . for a little while."" Bads not flying these days; hes dying slowly on a bourbon diet holed up in motels watching Spanish-language smut.Actor turned writer-director Scott Cooper adapted Crazy Heart from Thomas Cobbs 1987 novel (the title is a Hank Williams B-Side). Cobb wanted Waylon Jennings for Bad Blake; Jeff Bridges finally got the part though the now deceased Waylon and Bads other inspirations hang over it. Jenningss ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way"" gets soundtrack play; Bads shabby-romantic look recalls Kris Kristofferson his perpetual hangover ""Sunday Mornin Comin Down."" The movie never specifies but seems to take place around 87 before cell phones eliminated distance with the sad orneriness of country music more evident than it is today. Its easy to forget as Billboards Country charts fill with faintly twangy pop and lazy paeans to dogs and trucks that this music has an atavistic darkness. Cobb wrote while Jennings was just detoxing from decades of storied self-abuse and Johnny Paycheck was serving time for a barroom shooting.Bad has just about bottomed out when a small-time journalist Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) meets him for a rare interview--and sticks around. Crazy Heart follows the slow recovery of atrophied emotional responses that starts when Bad gets involved with Jean and her young son.Cooper knows exactly when a scenes over fills his movies margins with distinct bit players (Beth Grants middle-aged groupie Rick Dials pudgy part-time keyboardist) and is a smart custodian to Bridgess Bad Blake. The part is a vindication of Bridgess unaffected talent and is his best in years. Hes as good a reactor as actor so patient and sedentary that his performances quiet ache sneaks up on you when hes doing nothing more dramatic than settling onto a barstool. Bad recites his age as a refrain--""Im 57 years old""--and it seems Bridges has lived them all. Its in the habitual gestures the way he negotiates with a mic stand and passes a drink from his chest to the bedside table with a coil of the wrist--for Bad is usually sprawled and splayed.The physical effects of Bads drinking are almost luridly seen lingering over his dry heaves the soft pale torso his gut spilling out of his often unbuckled pants. The spiritual attrition feels harsher as Cooper contrasts huddled dank interiors with the big sky outdoors and shows that the saddest thing about being a drunk is the memories that go missing. Jean worries shell disappear in a blackout too. Gyllenhaal usually badly used and badly lit doesnt make a false move here. Their June-November relationship works because of her lucidity and Bridgess easy-come charm. (An improbably virile career alcoholic Bad is used to drifting into women and doesnt have to bully.)Bads other love--estranged--is Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) a former sideman protege and surrogate son who has eclipsed his old bosss fame selling out amphitheatres. You expect a showbiz grotesque but when they reunite Sweet is deferential toward Bad embarrassed by their switched fortunes and maybe what the old man thinks of his cheesy-rakish Nashville makeover (he rather daringly wears a pair of dangly earrings). The duet a spiritual-conversational tradition in country music gives them one great anxious scene. Having hired Bad as an opener Tommy sneaks onstage to sing with him. He thinks hes supporting the old man; Bad resents having the biggest stage hes seen in a while being stolen and hates himself for envying the younger man. No one says any of this. Its all implicit in their exchange of glances and epitomizes the movies double-sided look at the relationship between private feelings and public performance.In its attention to stage dynamics Bads dickering with sound guys and the distinct personalities of his different pickup bands Crazy Heart shows a rare knowledge and respect for real played music. Robert Duvalls interest in country is long-standing--his first directorial outing Were Not the Jet Set was named after a George Jones-Tammy Wynette song. He plays Bads hometown bartender and confessor with casual perfection and is among the producers. Another is T-Bone Burnett who wrote and arranged the films songs with Stephen Bruton a longtime Kristofferson collaborator who died this year. They sound like feasible hits; Bridges and Farrell sing their own parts--and well.Made with Country Music Television money Crazy Hearts winding road to Sundance avoided the superficial novelty of the ""indie"" market. The subject rehabilitation is old and resonant. (Says Waylon ""Weve been the same way for years/We need to change."") No scene feels obligatory and Crazy Heart shows a pragmatic but tender understanding of the relationship between physical breakdown and the discovery of morality. Its merely a well-done adult American movie--that is to say a rarity.

Its a juicy career-crowning role and Bridges -- a master of subtle brilliance -- plays the hell out of it. Not by showing off but by going bone-deep into a character who only thinks hes running on empty. Bridges just turned 60 and hes still the most underrated actor in America. Crazy Heart may finally win him the Oscar thats unfairly eluded him from his promising youth in The Last Picture Show to the glory days of The Fabulous Baker Boys The Fisher King Starman Fearless The Door in the Floor and his immortal Dude in The Big Lebowski from the brothers Coen. I could go on. Lets just say that Crazy Heart offers the pleasure of watching a great actor at the peak of his form. Hows the movie? Well first-time director Scott Cooper adapting Thomas Cobbs novel is riding a well-worn trail exemplified by 1983s Tender Mercies which won an Oscar for Robert Duvall (excellent here as Bads buddy).

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Has there ever been a movie about a country singer who isnt having a meltdown? The good news is that Cooper an actor himself shows a keen eye for authentic detail and an instinct for bringing out the best in the cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal is funny touching and vital as Jean the decades-younger single mom who might save Bad. The part is conventionally conceived but Gyllenhaal plays it with a tough core of intelligence and feeling. Colin Farrell puts his Irish on hold and comes up aces as Tommy Sweet the Camp;W star whos now surpassed Bad his mentor. Tommys also a movie star going the Kris Kristofferson route while Bad is an outlaw combo of Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard. Its Tommy who commissions Bad to write a new song for him. The result ""The Weary Kind"" is a killer ballad that should class up Oscars Best Song category. Props to Stephen Bruton and T Bone Burnett for original tunes that fit Bad and Bridges like scuffed boots that have paid their dues on the road. Even when you know whats coming Crazy Heart haunts you like a classic country song. Its a mesmerizer. So is Bad Blake. This dude also abides.

Theres nothing new in that since Bads days and nights are measured by the pint. Booze has rotted him destroying his health busting his marriages and rusting the talent that once briefly brought him fame. But in this case its not a liter of liquor but a container of urine from Blakes long drive -- a sign of his degradation emptied in a slosh of yellow liquid in the parking lot of the next crummy stop on his two-bit road tour Its the by-product of a man pissing his life away. The gesture is pathetic authentically lived-in grimy. And its just one of dozens enacted with utter authority by Bridges -- that well-loved movie vet that generously unvain actor so appealing in midlife spread. Bridges guileless performance makes this piquant little indie tale of country music redemption and the love of a pretty younger woman such a sad-song charmer. It doesnt hurt that Colin Farrell makes a keenly calibrated underplayed appearance as Tommy Sweet the protege whose fan base and fortunes have expanded as Bads have shriveled. Both stars do their own fine singing too to pithy country tunes of loss and longing by Stephen Bruton and O Brother Where Art Thou? maestro T Bone Burnett. As for the pretty younger woman thats where writer-director Scott Coopers otherwise bull-free first feature based on a novel by Thomas Cobb goes soft. When Bad pulls into Santa Fe for a gig he crosses paths with an aspiring journalist named Jean played by Maggie Gyllenhaal who just happens to recognize the good thats in Bad even if the guy is grizzled sozzled and wreathed in cigarette smoke. Jean is a divorced single mom with a generically adorable little son a lady in the slinky sensual Gyllenhaal mold whos so hip yet earthy that her garden blooms with color in the desert. Although she claims shes made enough mistakes not to pick another loser she gives herself (and entrusts her son) to a 57-year-old drunk with a beer gut. (Further enhancing Bads decrepitude Bridges is often shot with a view over his belly and up his armpit.) I can only figure that Jean takes a chance because the stranger looks a little like the irresistible Jeff Bridges. I mean what woman wouldnt give the dude a whirl?

By David Denby Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren as the Tolstoys in Michael Hoffmans movie.   Credit Illustration by Barry Blitt In ""The Last Station"" Christopher Plummer at the crest of a long career gives an impassioned portrait of the artist as an old man--Leo Tolstoy in his eighties imposing stentorian and almost alarmingly active. Helen Mirren letting her age show and still the most sexual actress onscreen is his equal as Sofya Tolstoys wife of forty-eight years. Like Tolstoy Sofya is built along heroic Old Testament lines she has borne him thirteen children; she has copied out ""War and Peace"" in longhand six times; she has run his household and loves him as passionately as ever. Based on Jay Parinis 1990 novel which draws heavily on diaries kept by the couple and by other men and women in their circle this production directed by Michael Hoffman is like a great night at the theatre--the two performing demons go at each other full tilt and produce scenes of Shakespearean affection chagrin and rage. The year is 1910 and Tolstoy is an uneasy survivor in the new century--hes bemused by a phonograph playing in his garden at Yasnaya Polyana. (A fine old house in Germany doubles as the estate.) As he approaches death he and Sofya fight over his will. Shall he leave the vastly profitable copyrights of his worldly masterpieces to his wife and their children? Or shall he bequeath them to the ""Russian people"" to be administered by an organization that propagates his late-in-life obsessions--a cultish neo-Christian neo-socialist religion that runs communes advocates passive resistance to violence and renounces sexuality? Sofyas nemesis in the struggle is Tolstoys chief disciple and administrator the fanatical Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) who introduces into the estate a youthful spy Valentin (James McAvoy) a celibate and an avowed Tolstoyan who becomes the writers secretary. Hes so awed that he can barely get a word out when he and Tolstoy first meet but his disapproval of the flesh disappears overnight after Masha (Kerry Condon) a terrifically flirtatious and intelligent fellow-acolyte climbs into his bed. Hoffman makes the scenes between the young lovers genuinely erotic so its not hard to guess which side the movie chooses in the philosophical dispute between asceticism and sensuality. Hoffman doesnt parody Tolstoys religious and pedagogical beliefs which after all exerted a major influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. yet the movie implicitly suggests that exalted self-denying spirituality however noble is less powerful as a guide to living than everyday love. Tolstoy no fanatic in his own cause seems to know this. In a beautifully written scene played with wistful longing by Plummer the old man talking to Valentin as they sit together in the forest at Yasnaya Polyana describes the early years of his marriage as a kind of terrifying paradise. Hoffmans career has wandered all over the place--he made the uproarious pop comedy ""Soapdish"" in 1991 and a mediocre ""Midsummer Nights Dream"" in 1999. In this movie he achieves a new expressiveness fluidity and power. ""The Last Station"" may not be original in form but its vibrantly alive with many scenes of scathing directness that seem to come straight out of Russian novels (though the pitch of feeling is closer to Dostoyevskys hyperthyroid manner than to Tolstoys firmer calmer tone). The juiciest material is Sofyas detestation of Chertkov whose celibacy she suspects is really just a cover for homosexuality. In any case shes sure that hes a poseur and an opportunist disguising his self-seeking with a veneer of piety. And for her Tolstoys anti-sensual bent is rubbish--this is a man of huge lusts who showed her his diaries of youthful whoring before their wedding. Sofyas situation is pitiable she still wants her husband sexually and will do anything to lure him back to bed and destroy his ideological purity. Helen Mirren may be the only actress who can beg for sex without losing a ferocious pride. Her Sofya dressed in white like a bride her hair long and full makes scenes howls and gets thrown about by her own anger and desire like a rag doll in a storm. Its the most emotionally naked work of Mirrens movie career; she gives poetic form to the madness and the violence of commonplace jealousy. Her look of pleading and then of tenderness toward Plummer is heartbreaking. Plummer who is turning eighty himself effortlessly suggests largeness of spirit even in foolish old age. Physically he seems enormous. His eyes devour McAvoys Valentin--his Tolstoy is hungry for information about everyone. He doesnt see why he has to choose between his wife and his followers; he wants everyones love and Sofya makes life at the estate complete hell. For him there is no peace except in flight and in death. In all the movie is worthy of its valiant pair. The splendor and the amplitude of Yasnaya Polyana affirm in every scene the magnificence of the sensuous world that Tolstoy with ambiguous energy and many fond backward glances so desperately wants to renounce. Theres another piece of extraordinary acting knocking about in the crowded Christmas season. What Jeff Bridges pulled off as a joke in ""The Big Lebowski"" lazing like a walrus he does seriously in ""Crazy Heart."" As Bad Blake a well-travelled country singer hes a barely functioning mess with a ratty beard and ponytail a large belly and a constant cigarette and glass of bourbon. Bad was once a famous performer and songwriter and hes written for other people including the darkly handsome young country sensation Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who openly acknowledges him as a mentor. But now Bad drives alone through vast stretches of the Southwest drifting from saloon to bowling alley performing with ragged pickup bands. He can still sing a little though he may not make it through a set without exiting the stage to go heave in an alley. The rest of the time he lies on his back in a squalid motel. As an actor Bridges luxuriates in indolence but Bad unlike the sublime Dude in ""Lebowski"" is not pleased with himself. Hes played out and past caring and Bridges muttering in a crabbed voice suggests a formidable intelligence fighting through a fog of drink and sloth. Bridges takes the character to the pits but hes spiritually active there at the bottom; he knows that Bad has to be shrewd and still proud in defeat or the audience would find him contemptible. Maggie Gyllenhaal ardent her round face glowing turns up as Jean Craddock a journalist and a single mother who penetrates the gloom of Bads motel room for an interview. At the start his attitude toward her is wary and distant but hes stirred by her interest and her loneliness. The first-time director Scott Cooper working from a novel by Thomas Cobb keeps the camera close to these two and the way that Bridges and Gyllenhaal ease into an affair--drawing together pulling back and starting again--feels right. Jean who must also look after her four-year-old son wakes up the decrepit singer but this is not a movie about miracles. Nor is ""Crazy Heart"" quite a miracle itself. It has a gentle unforced rhythm and whats there is good and true. But theres not enough of it--the movie needs more plot more complication more conflict--and it suffers from the mood of weary resignation embedded in Bads songs whose general theme is ""What the hell nothing can be done about it."" If ever a movie demonstrated how country music emerges from private sorrows this is it. But something can always be done to make a movie better. ""Brothers"" the new home-from-the-war film written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan has been made with obvious devotion and sincerity and I wish I could take it seriously. The movie is based on the 2004 Danish film ""Brodre"" but it feels like a 1948 Arthur Miller play without Millers toughness. Sam Shepard plays a dominating alcoholic father a former marine who has long tormented his two sons turning one Sam (Tobey Maguire) into a high achiever both athlete and war hero dutifully serving multiple tours in Afghanistan; and the other Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) into a resentful unemployable screwup. When Sam is captured his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) believing that hes dead leans toward Tommy who pulls himself together and helps her raise her and Sams two young children. Then Sam returns nearly destroyed by what he had to do to survive in Afghanistan. Will he be capable of resuming his marriage? Theres not much rooting interest for us since Maguire and Portman dont go together in the first place. Hes humorless and ungainly and odd-looking in his high-and-tight military haircut; shes elfin and flawlessly pretty and unconvincing as an ex-cheerleader turned mother of two and they dont set off the dimmest of sparks in each other. With the exception of Jake Gyllenhaal whose shambling self-disgust hits the only genuine note the movie is a classic of Hollywood miscasting and ambition gone askew. Maguire playing crazy when Sam comes home opens his eyes wider and wider as if he were trying to pop them out of his head. For three-quarters of an hour or so you wait for him to blow. And blow he does shrieking and smashing things in a display that seems more like pyrotechnics than like acting. To understand how this kind of role can be done with nuance and eloquence see Ben Fosters work in ""The Messenger"" a movie devoted to similar themes but finer in every way. Of all human illusions the hardest to give up is the belief that consciousness exists after death. This may seem a stiffly rational response to anything as shrewdly executed as Alice Sebolds best-selling 2002 novel ""The Lovely Bones"" but it becomes inescapable when you see the bizarre and sentimental movie that Peter Jackson has made from the book. In the movie as in the book Susie (Saoirse Ronan) a fourteen-year-old girl narrates her own murder in 1973 at the hands of a neighborhood creep (Stanley Tucci). Then she watches him cover his tracks and her father (Mark Wahlberg) her mother (Rachel Weisz) and her sister (Rose McIver) try to cope with her death. She is not merely present in their minds; they cant quite see her but she is there prompting warning claiming a kiss from her handsome teen boyfriend. The book was brought off with considerable delicacy--its really an affectionately detailed portrait of a suburban girls life. Literalized in the movie the material is closer to a high-toned ghost story. Jackson intermingles family goings on with Susies gossamer interventions and some of the brushed-with-ether imagery verges on the uncanny. Yet Jackson has become an undisciplined fabulist the movie is redundant and undramatic. Heaven is notoriously harder to make interesting than Hell but Jackson has outdone other artists in cotton candy--there are luscious hills and dales and gleaming lakes and fields of waving grain and sugarplum fairies with music by Brian Eno rather than by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. ""The Lovely Bones"" has been fashioned as a holiday family movie about murder and grief; its a thoroughly queasy experience. The lesson that Susie has to learn is that she must ""let go"" of her past life. Meanwhile skilled opportunistic artificers like Alice Sebold and Peter Jackson wont let go of a chance to mingle life and death.

At a grizzled 57 hes a broke chain--smoking alcoholic with four marriages under his belt and a tendency to run outside to vomit in the middle of a set. Still he hasnt lost his voice or when he needs it his charm so you can understand why Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a small-town reporter who wants to interview him might against her better instincts fall for him. (Article continued below...)Were drawn to him too no matter how many times weve seen these self-destructive singers onscreen before. Theres something irresistible about the anti-glamour of crashing stars. Think of Rip Torn in the 1973 Paydayor Robert Duvall in 1983s Tender Mercies. Actors love these roles and they bring out their best. Bridges is phenomenal. He knows this guy inside out from the way he straddles a chair onstage to the way he argues with a sound man when rehearsing for a big Santa Fe N.M. concert where he reluctantly plays warmup to Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) the protege whose success has eclipsed his own. Bridges whose instincts are as good as any actor working never hits a strained note.First-time director Scott Cooper who wrote the screenplay from a Thomas Cobb novel gives his cast (which includes Duvall in a small but tasty role) lots of breathing room. What he prizes in this character study is not originality but authenticity. From the songs Blake sings (written by Stephen Bruton and T. Bone Burnett) to the light in the eyes of his aging groupies the details feel right. Crazy Heart gets to you like a good country song--not because it tells you something new but because it tells it well. Its the singer not the song.

The rocky road of boozy nights busted dreams and the hope of one more chance traveled in so many country songs and movies is good for yet another trip in ""Crazy Heart."" Playing a drunken washed-up music legend reduced to playing small-town bowling alleys Jeff Bridges is the whole show here as a cowboy-style crooner who wrestles with his demons in ways that easily engage an audiences sympathies. Having skipped the fall festival circuit in anticipation of a 2010 release Fox Searchlight has quickly scrambled to slip the indie-style film into the year-end awards season hunt a likely shrewd gamble that will help yield sweet midrange commercial results. For those who have seen ""Tender Mercies"" the 1983 picture that won Academy Awards for star Robert Duvall and screenwriter Horton Foote this will seem like deja vu all over again not only due to the story trajectory of a broken-down country singer tended to by a youthful woman and her young son but also the presence of Duvall here as a producer and supporting actor. That said just as many country songs recycle the same scenarios and sentiments time and again theres nothing wrong with a variation on a popular favorite and Bridges (himself an exec producer on the project) writer-director Scott Cooper and company put a strong enough stamp on the familiar material to make it their own When seen at the outset bellying up to the bar in said bowling alley with his bushy gray beard and hauling his corpulent frame around on legs that seem on the verge of collapsing under the strain Bridges Bad Blake momentarily triggers the image of an errant older brother of the actors Dude in ""The Big Lebowski."" Near the end of his rope physically and financially at 57 Blake proudly proclaims hes never missed a gig no matter how wasted he may be but on this occasion he to races out the back door during the middle of a song to retch into a garbage can only to return to carry on. ""I used to be somebody but now Im somebody else"" Blake croaks in one of his standards and hes definitely a man with a past even if its one that hews closely to generic norms. Living down to the Merle Haggard tradition hes had several wives and innumerable women a son he hasnt seen the kid was 4 and a relationship with a younger protege current country sensation Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) that is the one subject he declines to speak about when interviewed by warm Santa Fe feature writer Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Heartened by the young ladys sympathetic interest Blake volunteers for a more in-depth interview providing her with details of an especially intimate sort during a late-night session in his hotel bedroom. But the next morning Blakes off for Phoenix where his irascible manager (James Keane) has booked him into the humiliating but financially worthwhile slot of opening an arena concert for none other than Sweet. Plotwise theres again nothing particularly surprising about subsequent developments; more smitten with Jean than he might have imagined Blake tries to build the relationship but he soon hits a do-or-die juncture on several fronts simultaneously Medically hes got to shape up or ship out; creatively and financially he must start writing new songs again; personally he feels driven to contact his long-lost son; and romantically he needs to prove himself to Jean. As in a good country song with the bitter comes the sweet. Adapting a novel by Thomas Cobb debuting director Cooper roots the tale in a recognizably real contempo Southwest thats a notch or two more modern and sophisticated than the rural rube environs depicted in such films a generation ago; the people here arent so much attached to country-cowboy ways by birthright as by cultivated affection and Sweet is an entirely up-to-date on-top-of-it showbiz figure unlikely to wind up like his mentor. The roughly 30-year age difference and Jeans earnest devotion to making a post-divorce go of it with her son raise some questions as to her quick willingness to get involved with a bibulous old neer-do-well. But Gyllenhaal makes it clear that Jean takes the plunge with Blake of her own accord with her eyes wide open (the actress eyes have never seemed so brilliantly blue) due to needs of her own and secondarily those of her male-bereft son enabling the relationship to play It takes a moment or two to adjust to Farrell portraying a Camp;W sensation but he quickly convinces by playing against the expectations that the character dropped Blake when he no longer needed him instead emphasizing the abiding affection the younger man has for the older one. But all others are mere planets revolving around Bridges sun and everything this seasoned pro does implicitly rings entirely beautifully true -- the self-awareness of his own sorry state the disgust with his slovenliness the inner core of pride hidden behind the fat and dirt and sloth the drive that still pushes him to journey hundreds of miles a day to play a gig or see Jean and the kid-like enthusiasm sparked by the prospect of a new relationship and fresh start. Ever-youthful in his looks and energy Bridges now stands as one of Hollywoods great old pros incapable of making a false move. Like a relaxed country tune Coopers direction is amiable but a tad leisurely; the tyro helmer puts the story and character values across but a little more snap wouldnt have hurt. The New Mexico-shot feature looks fine and real-life concert settings bring a convincing feel to the performance scenes as do the solid vocals by Bridges and Farrell.
