He plays Lee Gates the ""money monster"" of the title who used his TV show to tout Ibis an investment firm that then lost nearly a billion dollars due to a so-called computer glitch. Now Kyle Budwell (Jack ODonnell) a delivery man who sank his life savings into Ibis and lost it all sneaks onto the set with a gun and a bomb holds Lee hostage on live television and demands explanations for Ibiss losses. Lee aided by his talented producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) is forced to practice hard-hitting business journalism. The storys double twist--will the protagonists come out unscathed and what happened at Ibis?--ratchets suspense high but theres little substance behind it. Foster depicts working-class characters as crude-talking caricatures and puts Lee and Patty in shining armor as defenders of the people; noblesse oblige. The frenzied drama has no clear point of view besides its air of celebrity condescension.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Comments click to enlarge Money Monster Video Rated R  98 minutes  2016 In this far-fetched topical thriller a TV financial-investment analyst (played by George Clooney and transparently based on CNBCs Jim Cramer) gets taken hostage midbroadcast by an all-American loser (Jack OConnell of Unbroken) whos taken a bath on a bad stock tip. Meanwhile the shows director (Julia Roberts) tries to get the goods on the crooked CEO (Dominic West) who ruined this unhinged everyman. With all the ranting about a ""rigged"" financial system the movie certainly captures the zeitgeist but it so overloaded with action-movie tropes and tech-based plot contrivances that it begins to feel a little silly. Producers Clooney and Grant Heslov had their finest hour with Good Night and Good Luck (2005) another tale of politics and broadcasting yet that movie was quiet and sober in keeping with its hero Edward R.

TriStar Pictures 2.5 stars (out of 4) Usually when George Clooney and Julia Roberts team up on screen she helps him pull off an elaborate heist. The Oceans franchise is now long gone and the superstars have reunited. But after watching Money Monster its the audience who might want to check its pockets. Despite the dream pairing and the timely topic of a Wall Street meltdown the mildly entertaining hostage drama doesnt quite add up. The film had its world premiere at the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival on May 12 and opens wide May 13. Cannes Film Festival 2016 Red Carpet Fashion What the Stars Wore Money Monster is the name of an in-your-face live finance show on a CNBC-type network. Its hosted by a charismatic smart-ass named Lee Gates (Clooney) who uses amusing graphics to make stock predictions and dances like a wild man at Bonnaroo when his picks pan out. Essentially Clooney is playing a more boorish version of Clooney. (Note This is most definitely not a problem). His latest live show is going exactly as planned at least as live shows go. The pretty backup dancers have just finished their bit; his unflappable director Patty (Roberts steady but underused) is in the control room speaking into his earpiece; and a top executive from IBIS a corporation that just plummeted in the market is set to appear via satellite. Enter Kyle (Jack OConnell Unbroken) who storms the set with a gun and threatens to blow Lees brains out if his message isnt broadcast to the masses. Best and Worst Movie Remakes Kyle made the mistake of listening to Lees prediction about buying into IBIS. Can you blame the guy? Lee said it was ""safer than your savings account"" and Patty agrees to roll the footage as proof. Now Kyle is 60000 in the hole with a baby on the way. But hes more steamed about the 800 million that IBIS lost and blamed on a cryptic computer glitch. Hes not just mad at the Monster; hes raging at the Machine. Roberts in Money Monster. TriStar Pictures Though the movie unfolds in real time its oddly devoid of tension. No matter how many times Kyle waves his gun in the air and threatens to detonate the place with a bomb you never truly believe Lees life is in danger. (Maybe this is because the baby-faced OConnell is as intimidating as a candy striper.) The SWAT team thats plotting outside? Pure window dressing. Sure that sniper on the rafters could aim and fire after everyone clears the building. He has multiple open shots But then the film would be 36 minutes long. Julia Roberts Best Movie Roles The stakes also seem low. Audiences are watching on TVs all over the world and Lees impending death plays like just another story in a 24/7 news-cycle universe. A man could get assassinated on live TV and yet its entirely possible the headline could get bumped tomorrow if Beyonce drops another surprise album. Consider it the fallout of a popcorn flick too slick and frenetic for its own good. We dont have time to learn about these characters to care about them. Besides Lee is not the bad guy here. Neither is Kyle. That lofty title goes to the head of IBIS (played by Dominic West) who has suspicious (and overly intricate) ties to South Africa. And the ultimate villain is the corrupt banking system. Anyone who turns on cable news knows this is a hot topic of the current political climate; alas the director cant finesse the point. The director by the way is Jodie Foster -- an A-lister in her own right who has worked with the likes of David Fincher (Panic Room) and Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver). Given that there is indeed a smart nail-biting movie in here its frustrating that Foster didnt seem to learn much from those auteurs in creating suspense. In her May 13 press conference Foster noted that her film hit the same notes as 70s classics Dog Day Afternoon and Network. But some 40 years from now Money Monster will likely only be remembered as the film in which Clooney and Roberts took their money ... and ran to their next projects.

What transpires though is a bewilderingly facile and preposterously plotted misfire that offers few pleasures as either a star-driven thriller or a big-screen indictment of the forces that devastated global bank accounts an issue actively driving this years election. Clooneys character Lee Gates the louder-than-life know-it-all host of the titular financial news show one marked by macho posturing and flash-and-noise antics is clearly fashioned after personalities like CNBCs ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer who turn pushing investment tips to regular viewers into a kind of business-TV vaudeville. ""Money Monster"" -- its screenplay credited to Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf -- imagines a scary comeuppance for its fictional host Gates when a disgruntled viewer named Kyle (Jack OConnell) having lost his shirt acting on one of Gatess stock tips disrupts his live show with a gun a bomb and a need for proof its all a scam. See Video George Clooney Taken Hostage on Live TV in Trailer for Jodie Fosters Money Monster Cramer who notoriously hawked Bear Stearns stock days before it collapsed endured his own famously televised interrogation of sorts (minus the threat to his life) when he appeared on ""The Daily Show"" in early 2009 a few months after the financial meltdown and got shredded by Jon Stewart for ""selling snake oil as vitamin tonic."" Regrettably nothing in ""Money Monster"" is as gleefully tense or entertaining as that ""Daily Show"" clip. At the beginning of ""Money Monster"" news of an 800 million loss for one of Gatess heavily sold bets a behemoth called Ibis Clear Capital is rocking the markets. But it appears to be of no consequence to Gates who swans around with what is obviously his usual rakish workplace banter and has no qualms prepping softball questions for the scheduled appearance of Ibis CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West whod twirl a mustache if he had one). Also Read Can Jodie Fosters Money Monster Make a Dent in Captain America Civil War? Gatess spiky gab with his cherished producer Patty (a booth-confined but solid Roberts) is initially fun to watch these two pros smoothly dropping hints of their lonely lives -- his from soulless self-loathing hers from workworkwork -- and conveying the cynical acceptance that what they do isnt journalism. (He needs her though more than she needs him.) Their mic-to-earpiece relationship quickly gets a workout though when intruder Kyle sneaks in and hijacks the broadcast. As the police negotiation planned infiltration and live-managed TV crisis swirls around them star and producer see an opportunity to address a desperate ordinary mans grievance suss out the reason behind Ibiss stock drop and smoothly engineer some must-see as-its-happening viewing. (Cue the shots of bored coffeehouse patrons suddenly glued to the monitor.) Its clear why this material ticks a lot of boxes for a pro-journalism lefty activist like Clooney who is well-suited to play a media cad who changes heart. Its less clear though why he signed on to so hackneyed a screenplay which strives to combine elements of ""Network"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" but instead devolves into a ludicrous race-against-time mystery thats no mystery and an infotainment satire without laughs. (At one point pundits on other channels are shown whimsically covering the life-or-death standoff which strains credibility as commentary even in this callous age.) Foster who last helmed the underrated dysfunctional-family indie ""The Badger"" is certainly attentive to big-movie pace as she pings between the studio the assembling law enforcement horde (headed by Giancarlo Esposito) and goings-on at Ibis as its increasingly suspicious communications director (""Outlander"" star Caitriona Balfe) starts helping Gates and Patty by digging into her bosss motives. But theres a weightlessness to the busy vibe as if Foster knew rat-a-tat-tat momentum and an unceasing blah music score might hide the plots increasing ridiculousness. (This is one of those conspiracy unravelings in which everything falls into peoples laps with one phone call.) See Video Carpool Karaoke Julia Roberts George Clooney Join James Corden and Gwen Stefani Though Clooney and especially Roberts acquit themselves with serviceable star power professionalism the character of Kyle proves problematic a hapless schmo made less appealing through OConnells overcooked Noo Yawk accent. The movie uneasily slides between pitying him and laughing at him never more so than when his pregnant girlfriend (a fantastic Emily Meade) gets air time and shocks everyone by laying into him as an idiot. Its sort of a great moment -- the fed-up female screed against dumb men you never get in movies like this -- but it would have landed better in a more thematically assured movie. Coming on the heels of last years vividly funny and informative window into the bank meltdown ""The Big Short"" the missed opportunities with ""Money Monster"" loom larger. One of the frequently cited explanations in the movie for the Ibis stock collapse is a ""glitch"" in the ""algorithm."" The problem with ""Money Monster"" is that its a formula too and one with few dividends. Email 17 Donald Trump Haters in Hollywood From Chris Brown to Louis CK (Photos) ""Wow.

This dreary hostage thriller isnt it Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Cannes Film Festival Editors Picks George Clooney jodie foster Julia Roberts Money Monster Movies Thrillers Entertainment News George Clooney in ""Money Monster""(Credit TriStar Pictures) We could definitely use an old-fashioned character-driven drama about the aftermath of the financial crisis right about now something larger than life but close to the bone a big-time movie with movie stars and a satirical edge and its heart on its sleeve in the spirit of ""Network"" or ""The King of Comedy."" Instead we get ""Money Monster"" with George Clooney as a loudmouth financial talk-show host taken hostage by a regular Joe who followed his advice. This movie which marks Jodie Fosters semi-awaited return to directing (depending on how you felt about her work with old pal Mel Gibson in ""The Beaver"") yearns to be all those things and fails painfully. The pieces would seem to be in place but in practice ""Money Monster"" is a stodgy moribund plodder loaded with stock characters that wouldnt have felt edgy in 1983 and has about the same contemporary urgency as your average late-night rerun of ""CSI NY.""One could suggest that this formulaic dud offers yet more evidence how far behind the cultural curve Hollywood has fallen especially relative to TV drama and how clumsily Hollywood liberal behemoths like Clooney and Foster and Julia Roberts (who co-stars as Clooneys director) have adapted. Thats not entirely fair when you consider that just a few months ago a major studio released ""The Big Short"" one of the bravest angriest and funniest mainstream films of recent years. Still I cant resist making this point although it may not directly relate to why ""Money Monster"" is dreadful Adam McKay the comedy director who made ""The Big Short"" is a genuine left-winger and a Bernie Sanders supporter; Clooney and Foster and Roberts belong to the core Democratic Party cadre in Hollywood that has funded Hillary Clintons career for many years.Is it a coincidence that McKays film depicts the 2008 crash as the unavoidable result of systemic corruption and stupidity on a massive scale whereas ""Money Monster"" (whose screenplay is credited to Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf) is a ""bad apple"" story about one flawed company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars vanish? I report; you decide. Thats just one of the numerous ways in which ""Money Monster"" pulls its punches and avoids taking any controversial or provocative stance as if trying to avoid offending some middle-ground moviegoing demographic that hasnt existed for 25 years. Former Wall Street banker John Kasich would find this movie fair and balanced. Ted Cruz would hate it for obscure and pedantic reasons (though hed probably be right). Donald Trump would simply fall asleep; no hot babes and not enough action.Clooneys career as a filmmaker and star trying to walk the winding path between cultural relevance and adult-grade entertainment meanwhile continues to yield mysteriously diminishing returns. It all began so promisingly a decade ago with his genuinely excellent McCarthy-era drama ""Good Night and Good Luck"" -- and even before that with the underappreciated ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" Clooneys first and best effort as a director. His choices have grown more cautious rather than less so as he finds himself on the north side of 50 and on some level I dont get it Does he really think he wont get another chance if he loses some of Sonys money? I mean ""The Ides of March"" was solid political drama a nifty two-hander for Clooney and Ryan Gosling but not nearly as ruthless as it wanted to be. ""The Monuments Men"" was a cheerful period piece that wanted to win awards or make a lot of money but did neither. And those movies are pretty much the collected works of Frank Capra and Orson Welles compared to ""Money Monster.""Clooney didnt direct this likely because he plays the leading role and is in virtually every scene but his fingerprints are all over it and not in a good way. He plays Lee Gates host of the eponymous and obnoxious financial talk show on a fictional cable network. Lee is sorta supposed to be a soulless misanthropic TV guy with a string of divorces behind him and a daughter somewhere he doesnt even know. But hes also sorta not because hes George Clooney and this movie defaults way too easily to the ritual Hollywood position known as ""protecting the star"" which Clooney might once have resisted. In ""Syriana"" and ""Michael Clayton"" and ""The Ides of March"" you didnt have the feeling that Clooney was relentlessly laboring to persuade you that his character was fundamentally a great guy or soon would be once he got in touch with his true inner Clooney-ness. You Might Also Like Lets put it this way Lee is never enough of a worthless creep to seem worth redeeming by way of a brush with death. Hes not a Money Monster; hes barely even a Money Grumpus. Its transparently obvious that hell be fine once the enraged UPS driver and/or Trump voter played by Jack OConnell stops yelling and shooting out the TV monitors and that a valuable lesson will have been learned by all. Whatever it may be. Lee is basically just boring and irritating which goes for everybody else in the movie too. (If hes halfway modeled on CNBCs Jim Cramer for instance -- whose cheerleading for crap investments definitely lost lots of money for lots of people -- the latter is both a more odious and a more compelling character.)Ive pretty much told you the whole plot of the movie already so dont sit there waiting for some ABC synopsis. OConnell is a handsome young British actor of Irish parentage who was terrific in the claustrophobic Belfast war drama ""71"" and the British TV series ""Skins"" and I quite understand the theory that hes cut out for movie stardom. But like most actors playing Noo Yawk guys from da nay-buh-hood and especially like foreign actors doing it he lathers on the outer-borough accent with a trowel. Its as if he were trying to wake ""Money Monster"" from its coma by injecting it with emergency doses of ""Mean Streets"" or ""Bad Lieutenant"" or community-theater Clifford Odets. Except that OConnell is playing a stupider and more literal-minded version of Robert De Niros Rupert Pupkin in ""King of Comedy"" and theres no escaping the comparison. Foster and Clooney cannot be held entirely responsible for a script that has no point to make about the financial crisis or the nature of class and money in America or much of anything else and struggles mightily not to make it. But they are responsible for pushing onward with the movie anyway because people who wrote large checks told them to and then for flying over to Cannes and acting like its a big deal to unveil a formulaic hostage drama that resembles any number of other better films and makes a few vague gestures in the direction of media satire.In all seriousness ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a better movie than this and its genuinely terrible. ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is a better movie or at least a less boring one. Spike Lees ""Inside Man"" is about 30 times better than this as Jodie Foster should know since shes in it. Every film of the 90s in which Morgan Freeman plays a hostage negotiator is better and thats a number Stephen Hawking could not calculate. All those movies in fact have more to say about the world than this one does whether or not they meant to. ""Money Monster"" will be mercifully forgotten sooner rather than later. Whether Clooney and his talented and well-meaning collaborators can learn anything from this fiasco will take longer to play out. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

The two must act when Clooneys character Lee Gates is taken hostage on air. By Peter Rainer Film critic May 13 2016 Save for later Saved George Clooney in a scene from Money Monster. Atsushi Nishijima/Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide George Clooney plays a loudmouth stock market TV pundit in ""Money Monster"" a wildly ambitious but misguided thriller directed by Jodie Foster that is way too big for its britches. Clooneys Lee Gates is held hostage during a live telecast by an enraged investor (Jack OConnell) while his producer (an all-business/no smiles Julia Roberts) and millions of viewers look on aghast. The armed intruder Kyle Budwell lost his life savings on a bad investment tip from Lee and demands to know why. Channeling everything from ""Network"" to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" Foster and her writers Jamie Linden Jim Kouf and Alan DiFiore try to expand this tinny little suspense plot into a Statement with a capital S about corporate corruption and the nefariousness of Wall Street. As the action becomes more and more implausible with Kyle dragging Lee into the city streets with NYPD battalions in tow ""Money Monster"" turns into an unintentional parody. Investing in this movie would not be a safe bet. Grade C- (Rated R for language throughout some sexuality and brief violence.)

Privacy Policy or Movie review Money Monster is a great adult thriller Katie Walsh Tribune News Service on May 12 2016 Published in Entertainment News Subscribe Subscribe Your email is safe with us. Privacy Policy or ""Money Monster"" is the kind of film that Hollywood pundits mourn in the era of endless superhero franchises. A juicy yet serious thriller for grown-ups -- no capes no flying guys no merchandise tie-ins. That kind of movie seems a relic of the 90s so its immensely refreshing to see Jodie Foster bring her talents as a director to this kind of smart adult entertainment as well as George Clooney who not only stars in but produced the picture under his Smokehouse Pictures imprint. Not to mention his co-star Julia Roberts. The two of them together prove not only that they still have it and show just how its done.""Money Monster"" is a ""Network"" for the financial crisis era mashing up the sensationalist nature of cable news with anxieties about corporate greed and unregulated Wild West financial practices. Clooney stars as Lee Gates the host of a live cable news finance show ""Money Monster"" clearly cut from the same cloth as Jim Cramers ""Mad Money."" Lee preens and dances in glittery hats shouts stock tips and exhorts his viewers to grow a pair. Roberts is his patient director Patty Fenn just waiting out her last day before she starts a new job.During the broadcast a young man Kyle (Jack OConnell) manages to take Lee and the entire crew hostage on air strapping a bomb vest to the host. The world looks on transfixed by the real life or death drama on screen. Patty in the control room relying on instinct and talent does what she does best which is direct. She sees that Kyle wants to be heard and so she does the work to give him what he wants making sure the cameras and mics capture his words coaxing Lee to stall bargain and calm the young man.Kyle a working class New Yorker is apocalyptically upset about losing his life savings on an investment in a company that Lee recommended on air -- IBIS. They claim a glitch in their algorithm caused the company to lose 800 million dollars of investors money but as Patty digs deeper turning to her journalistic instincts as a way to placate their captor they discover that theres much shadier business pointing back to the companys CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West).The entire situation plays out in almost real time cutting swiftly between the hostage situation on the ""Money Monster"" set the police trying to make their way inside and the panicked damage control at the IBIS offices. But theres only one person running the show who never relinquishes control -- Patty. One cant help but tip the hat to Foster directing a film that places a strong confident woman in a position of control as the director of the show as well the crisis. While Lee is on the ground with Kyle its the work of Patty and her team thats not only keeping the delicate situation in check but driving it in an investigative matter to seek justice.The message of ""Money Monster"" is straightforward People are good and greed is immoral even if it isnt illegal. It uses the newsworthy setting as an opportunity to wring out human drama and the results are deliciously satisfying driven by the performances of Roberts and Clooney (and the great British actor OConnell). If only they made them like this more often.MONEY MONSTER3.5 out of 4 starsCast Julia Roberts George Clooney Jack OConnell Dominic West Giancarlo Esposito Catriona BalfeDirected by Jodie FosterRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesRated R for language throughout some sexuality and brief violence.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.

Entertainment ""Money Monster"" Makes The Case That Women Should Be In Charge Jodie Fosters thriller is all about male egos and the women working behind the scenes to clean up their messes. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > George Clooney and Julia Roberts in Money Monster. Atsushi Nishijima / Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 8642671 The best scene in Money Monster involves Molly (Emily Meade) the pregnant girlfriend of Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) a working stiff whos reached his breaking point after losing his savings in a bad investment. Now hes taken the finance news show of the title a riff on Jim Cramers Mad Money hostage.Kyle is holding a gun hes put an explosive vest on host Lee Gates (George Clooney) and hes insisted that the show continue to broadcast live while he demands answers as to how the company Lee told his viewers to put their money in lost 800 million overnight. Yes hes mad as hell and hes not going to take it anymore.The cops outside track down Molly whos just gotten home from work and they bring her in to try to talk Kyle down -- standard hostage movie stuff in which a woman weeps while begging her man to think of her think of their child. Only in Money Monster the scene doesnt go as expected at all because once shes linked in Molly proceeds to give Kyle a darkly hilarious reaming over his last stand histrionics snarling ""You are so fucking stupid. You have always been such a fucking failure."" After she questions his manhood Molly drops the mic and leaves her significant other to extract himself from the precarious position hes put himself in. Its a long-in-coming deeply satisfying twist on a teary cliche. View this image > Jack OConnell Atsushi Nishijima / Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 8642696 Money Monster Jodie Fosters fourth film as a director is never as interesting as it is in that moment. For the most part it feels airlifted in from the last decade not a Network update for the Occupy age so much as a sibling to Foster-led thrillers like Flightplan and Panic Room with ambitions of relevance but few distinguishing characteristics. It takes aim at the 24-hour news cycle that encourages Lee to dole out a daily stock tip without bothering to ask questions. ""We dont do gotcha journalism here -- hell we dont do journalism period"" Money Monsters director Patty (Julia Roberts) drawls to spokesperson Diane Lester (Outlanders Caitriona Balfe) in an effort to reassure her that an interview will go according to the talking points she provided.It also takes a swat at finance ethics as represented by Walt Camby (Dominic West) head of the high-frequency trading company Diane represents and Lee recommended and at amateur investors swayed by easy promises of big investments rather than researching where theyre putting their money. Its not pointed enough to give a good skewering to any of these parties not evil execubot Walt or poor dumb Kyle whose willingness to proclaim that the system is ""rigged"" is fed by his desire to clear his name. Money Monster comes closest with Lee who fancies himself more of a celebrity than a newscaster but theres devastating evidence that proves just how little the public cares about him when he tries to motivate the masses. View this image > Dominic West and Caitriona Balfe. Atsushi Nishijima / Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 8642700 Where Money Monster does more than go down slick and easy and fade fast is in the way it slyly undermines the trio of men in its spotlight -- Lee Kyle and Walt all guided by ego and all ending up looking foolish for it while women like Patty and Diane prop them up or attempt to eventually growing tired of cleaning up their messes. Patty exhausted by Lees preening and the shows lack of substance is on the verge of heading to a new job while Diane starts to wonder what exactly shes defending as the company she works for is scrutinized. And Molly does her walking away during the movie.Money Monster suggests that the need to prove oneself a big man fuels the flawed system its characters are a part of and that this is something its female characters come to understand and grow exasperated by. Its only too bad the movie isnt about them though being sensible is a lot less dramatic than arriving with a bomb and a gun to take a TV studio hostage.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims May 13 2016 Culture Money Monster wants to be a film straight out of the 70s a snarling satire of media mores and capitalist villains shot through with the profane fury of a Paddy Chayefsky script. At best its a star vehicle from the late 90s a creakier simpler tale of a hostage crisis at a facsimile of CNBCs Mad Money tied to the backs of two marquee idols--George Clooney and Julia Roberts. As its tense studio antics unfold though the sad truth becomes apparent Money Monster is a movie-star vehicle that isnt giving its movie stars anything to do. Related Story The Clooney Effect That flaw is especially galling since its the fourth film directed by Jodie Foster and her first since 2011s The Beaver a misguided but admirably demented attempt to restart Mel Gibsons career. Foster has been an actors director in the past--Home for the Holidays is a bunch of great performances wrapped around a mediocre script--but she errs in Money Monster by handing the up-and-comer Jack OConnell all the fun material. Beyond that the film is existentially confused Its a media satire that isnt humorous enough and a hostage thriller thats too light-hearted to maintain any real sense of danger.Money Monster doubles as the name of the obnoxious stock-tip show hosted by Lee Gates (Clooney) a smiling can of hairspray who repeats Wall Street talking points under the guise of financial expertise. Despite Fosters claims to the contrary Lee comes off as an obvious parody of Mad Money host Jim Cramer whose costume-and-sound-effect-heavy show suffered criticism after the 2008 financial crisis. To be sure Money Monsters script (credited to three writers) isnt looking for subtlety The financial industry is the villain and Lee is a mass-media enabler as well as an oblivious pawn in some larger fraudulent shell game orchestrated by a callous CEO (Dominic West).Midway through a broadcast Kyle (OConnell) an errant viewer who lost his savings on a faulty tip crashes the show with a gun and forces Lee to wear an explosive vest. Here the stakes are set Kyle wants justice for the systemic wrongs done to him and every other little guy and its up to Lee and his trusty producer Patty (Roberts) to comply with his demands. At this point Money Monster has to choose between being a nutty parody or a taut thriller but the tone swings wildly back and forth. At one moment Lee begs his viewers to buy a depressed stock to save his life and recover Kyles savings--a strange clever nod to the back-patting arrangement between the financial industry and the softball shows that cover it. But minutes later Kyle is shrieking expletives and firing shots at the ceiling.Money Monster swings wildly back and forth between being a nutty parody and a taut thriller.OConnell is a fine young actor who first emerged on the British teen series Skins and gave a breathtaking performance in the 2014 prison drama Starred Up that seemed to announce him as a major talent. Since then he hasnt quite clicked starring in Angelina Jolies prisoner-of-war drama Unbroken and now Money Monster saddled with an unfortunate American accent both times. If theres hidden depth to Kyle OConnell doesnt find it spending much of his considerable screen time jamming his gun against Lees forehead and promising to blow his brains out. Despite all that Kyle never registers as a real or interesting threat dropping out of the action (which is largely confined to Lees studio) whenever other characters need to take center stage.If Foster was aiming for the edgy vibrant energy of great hostage thrillers like Spike Lees Inside Man (in which she appeared) she missed what makes those kinds of movies great--characters. Kyle is a meaningless cipher a stand-in for the ""working man"" who does a disservice to the films overall message by barely feeling like a person at all. Lee should be more of a fun foil for him--Clooney is agreeably dumb in the films early scenes but this is an actor who has turned buffoonery into an art form for the Coen Brothers time and time again. Money Monsters plot demands he snap into competence too quickly to register a real story arc. Roberts largely trapped in the booth keeping things under control deploys restraint and star wattage in equal measure though her talents are largely wasted on her barking orders at everyone to remain calm.Theres plenty of hand-wringing about the death of the movie star in Hollywood as comic-book franchises and CGI spectacles that any young actor can be plugged into become the norm for big studios. Its an overblown concern but Money Monster is exactly the kind of film to inspire that worry If a sub-par script like this can attract names like Clooney Roberts and Foster maybe audiences really are doomed. Just a few more script drafts some visual verve and a tighter focus on the films satirical elements could have turned Money Monster into the 1970s throwback it wants to be. As it is its destined for the drugstore bargain bin.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Theres a lot of excitable talk about algorithms (or ""algos"") the overuse of the term perhaps fitting for a film that seems to have been constructed not by humans but by binary code. EXPAND Atsushi Nishijima Film Details Money Monster RatingR GenreDrama Running Time98 min. More Info Trailer In its real-time hostage-taking scenario and sendup of infotainment Money Monster weakly nods to the Sidney Lumet mid-Seventies touchstones Dog Day Afternoon and Network. Disgruntled blue-collar worker Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) sneaks onto the set of a TV finance program (the title of which is the same as Fosters movie) hosted by Lee Gates (George Clooney) a Jim Cramer-like clown. There Kyle points a gun at the small-screen huckster demanding that he strap on an explosive vest. Kyle a working-class construct whose prole bona fides are signaled by UK native OConnells aggressive outer-borough accent has become unglued after following a tip from Gatess show to buy stock in Ibis Clear Capital -- a company whose mysterious ""loss"" of 800 million includes Kyles 60K life savings. (Is it intentional that the firms name is only one letter removed from ISIS? Or that its NYSE symbol frequently shown on the large flat-screen monitor on Gatess program is IBS?) The CEO of Ibis is airborne and not picking up his phone; back in the studio Lees producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) keeps busy on her headset calming the financial guru via a hidden earpiece when not barking with ersatz indignation at Ibiss communications officer (""Because youre giving him the same bullshit answers"") EXPAND Atsushi Nishijima The increasingly unruly plot culminates in a showdown at Federal Hall though the actual Financial District settings showcased in the latter part of the film dont do much to vitalize it. Punch lines arrive two beats too late; the script written by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf is larded with redundancies (an exchange between Patty and that same Ibis exec ""Hes deleted all his emails."" ""Try texts.""); and Foster relies heavily on tedious reaction shots cutting away to crowds assembled in bars as they watch Lee fighting for his life on TV. Despite its many faults The Beaver (2011) Fosters previous film as director at least benefited from its outlandish sock-puppet concept and the queasy-making charge of seeing Mel Gibson then at the height of his offscreen toxicity in the lead role. Watching the far more adored Clooney and Roberts onscreen generates zero excitement; likewise Robert Reich who declares in the final moments ""Wall Street is a casino Theyre gambling with your money"" fails to rouse his words now empty rhetoric.

Rated R (profanity sexuality violence). Cross ""Dog Day Afternoon with ""The Big Short and throw in a dash of ""Network and youve got ""Money Monster a clever financial thriller with comic overtones thats a solid investment of your time thanks to stellar work by George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Clooney is in top form leveraging his star persona as Lee a self-loathing TV financial guru (think Jim Cramer) who pushes stocks to his gullible audience with props puns flashy graphics and backup dancers. A high-tech stock Lee touts Ibis Clear Capital drops 800 million in the blink of an eye. So Lee invites his pal Ibis CEO Walt (Dominic West) to come in for a softball interview on his show ""Money Matters"" where the CEO can spin a tale of how a ""computer glitch wiped out investors. Walt doesnt show but Lee has an uninvited guest Kyle (a very good Jack OConnell) an angry package-delivery man from Queens who wants an explanation of where his 60000 investment in Ibis went. His hostile takeover involves forcing Lee to don an explosive jacket at gunpoint on live TV while Kyle holds the trigger. Lee is spectacularly ill-equipped to give Kyle what he wants but fortunately Lee has a preternaturally unflappable and whip-smart director in Patty (Roberts in her juiciest role in years). Patty has to calm down the terrified Lee keep him from antagonizing Kyle make Lee participate in ""real journalism"" (probably for the first time in his life) and oh yeah hold off the overeager cops. Julia Roberts in ""Money Monster""Photo TriStar Pictures I dont want to give away too much about ""Money Monster which takes place more or less in real time and eventually moves the action out of the TV studio and into the teeming streets of lower Manhattan. But its packed with more twists than a bag of pretzels even if some of them strain credulity a bit. And there are more than a few lighthearted cutaways about Asian programmers Icelandic hackers and a producer who tests a new ""erectile cream on himself. Director Jodie Foster who keeps moving briskly draws uniformly excellent performances from a top-notch supporting cast. Irish actress Caitriona Balfe is great as the Ibis ""p.r. lady (as the casually sexist Lee introduces her on-air) left holding the bag by her CEO/lover Walt (a wonderfully sleazy West). Foster and the films casting directors have a great eye for New York types that would make Sidney Lumet proud -- Emily Meade as Kyles hilariously furious girlfriend who is pregnant; Lenny Venito as a seen-it-all cameraman; and Giancarlo Esposito as the NYPDs frequently exasperated hostage crisis commander. ""Money Monster may not quite deliver the Bernie Sanders-approved hard-hitting expose of the financial system that the opening moments of the film seem to promise.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 13 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 13 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jodie Foster Written by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore Jim Kouf Starring George Clooney Julia Roberts Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2016 Country USA Language English Since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008 Hollywood has discovered there are reliable returns to be made on Wall Street thrillers that expose the fraud and vilify the greed. Its a contemporary version of the heist movie audiences get the paradoxical pleasure of dastardly crime and righteous indignation. Now Money Monster cleverly expands the genre simply by changing the focus from the wolves of Wall Street to one of the lambs - a small investor who has staked all his savings on one stock pick and lost. Desperately seeking explanations as to how an investment company could lose 800-million in evaluation overnight because of a glitch in a financial algorithm one Kyle Budwell sneaks onto the set of a hyped-up TV business show and takes its host the campy stock picker Lee Gates hostage.If the naive and panicked Kyle played by the soulful British actor Jack OConnell has compounded one bad choice with another Money Monsters producers have certainly made the right ones. The film - tightly directed by Jodie Foster and marking a return to form for both George Clooney as the glib Jim Cramer-like Gates and Julia Roberts as his steady producer - could not be more perfectly timed.Out there in the real world Donald Trump plays to the worst instincts of the economically battered white working-class while Bernie Sanders lectures about income inequality; on screen Kyle finally gets Lees full attention not with his gun and vest of explosives but with the information that he makes 14 an hour delivering packages in a city where he cant afford to support an expected child. In a different year Money Monster might just be another solidly entertaining thriller with an admirable script; in 2016 it feels like the movie of the moment.The standoff between the two men all of which is being broadcast live to an increasingly titillated public is the main action here in a screenplay by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf that is at its trickiest when it foreshadows possible solutions only to continually dodge them.But Money Monster also offers a satire of celebrity and social-media culture in which the darkest moments are among both the films and Clooneys best as Gates forced into direct contact with his audience in entirely new ways faces the limits of his own popularity.This is also something of a workplace comedy with Robertss cool-headed producer playing straight woman to Clooneys preening host in roles that call on both actors comfortably familiar star qualities; hers to make common sense look charming; his to make self-satisfaction seem amusing.Meanwhile Foster recovering nicely from her last directorial outing in the surprisingly unfunny The Beaver proves her smarts by managing to balance these different strands of humour while keeping the action ticking along. Here only a joke about a producer who has to try out an erectile ointment seems entirely out of place while very wisely Kyles character his desperation touchingly revealed by OConnell is never made the butt of any jokes.Ultimately as Clooneys increasingly introspective Gates talks Kyle down the movie has to find a real villain and does so in the mysteriously missing CEO of the tanking investment company. (An effectively anodyne Dominic West plays the baddie.) This last act though is the weakest not because the action falters but rather because the unravelling of the fraud is simplistic enough that all of us who never could figure out what the hell was going on in The Big Short should be able to follow along here just fine.The conclusion is quick and convenient and for all that an audience has come to sympathize with the defrauded little guy Foster can find no easy way to attach much emotion to Kyles ultimate fate. This is after all an action movie in which Clooney and Roberts are the stars.So in the end if Hollywood proves very happy to probe Wall Streets more dubious formulas it knows better than to ditch its own.

Now Jodie Foster directs Money Monster an uncomplicated shamelessly populist hostage thriller about a little guy raging against the corporate machine as blue-collar America looks on and punches the air in support. Its Dog Day Afternoon for dough-brains as disgruntled truck driver Kyle (Jack OConnell shouty and twitchy) storms a TV news studio where charismatic maverick stocks reporter Lee (George Clooney who can do this stuff in his sleep) is doing his wacky thing with the help of long-suffering producer Patty (Julia Roberts solid and dependable). Kyles gripe? Lee recently banged the drum on TV for a financial stock that crashed so losing Kyle sixty thousand dollars. Yet its soon clear that the real bad guy is on a private jet somewhere Walt Camby (Dominic West) a hilariously cartoon version of a fat-cat CEO. Theres no escaping it Money Monster is a basic silly movie. But it has on its side a top-notch cast and an entire absence of self-seriousness. If you thought The Big Short was too complicated you might welcome Fosters no-nonsense preference for showcasing ticking bombs over financial graphs. Its hermetically hilariously American through and through from its throaty defence of the little guys access to a fair global stock market as an essential human right to its laughable brief scenes set in other countries including Korea Iceland and South Africa. But swipes against our rolling news culture and even financial corruption feel half-hearted. Most of the films energy is spent making this a swift brisk kidnapping romp that always feels just one beat away from the cast smiling at the camera winking and shrugging their shoulders.

We were not disappointed with this film.As can be seen in the trailer the premise of the film is that George Clooney hosts a TV money show and Julia Roberts is the studio manager.  Jack OConnell takes George Clooney hostage in protest of losing a lot of money on an investment that George recommended.  There are parts of humour in this film but it is not designed as a comedy.  You start to wonder who really is the bad guy in the film.  I thought the ending was a bit weak bur overall it was an enjoyable film.This is another film that you shouldnt worry yourself with trying to think through the logic of the story nd just sit back an enjoy it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore3 days agoNatalie OFeaturedWell - mixed reviews I had seen the trailer and I expected a really detailed plot - but it all felt rushed and not believeable. Julia Roberts didnt shine for me - George clonney did seem to develop during the role. Again- this film did feel like it was missing key chucks of plot which would have filled some gaps.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore5 days agoJohn CtastemakerFeaturedWith George Clooney amp; Julia Roberts leading the cast amp; with Jodie Foster directing I had rather high expectations. Id already seen the trailer which promised an interesting amp; lively drama.If Ive learnt anything in the cinema its to avoid trailers they either spoil the film by revealing too much or as in this case mislead you regarding the quality of the product.The film is weak feeble amp; contrived the plot is seriously dumb the dialogue is just sadly lacking. The whole thing It reminded me of an old time daytime made for TV movie which would be perfectly acceptable if you were very weak and recovering from something unpleasant. The final scene made me wonder if George Clooney had mistakenly thought he was starring in a comedy  rather than a drama.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore8 days agoSarah GTastemakerFeaturedIll start with Im a HUGE Julia Roberts fan and an even bigger George Clooney fan. So a film with both of them - starts of with a lot of credit. But I think objectively I really enjoyed Money Monster. It gets going fast - you get a sense of the characters their dynamic and style very quickly before the meat of the drama kicks in. I found it very funny - George Clooney is perfectly cast as the egotistical narcissistic celebrity and manages to use his trademark humorous incredulous face to very good effect. The film also provides a thought provoking interesting light touch social commentary on greed and how  money is made in the world - venturing into morality and legality - but never in a heavy or lecturing way. You could easily criticise this film as much of it is slightly silly and no doubt not supportable in fact - but i think it worked very well. My only mild disappointment was that Julia wasnt in it more and didnt have more lines. I also post ""The Affair find it hard to buy into Dominic West other than as Sol Goodaway - and the character he played here was a little too similar for my liking.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore13 days agonicknicknTastemakerFeaturedMoney Monster is a gripping thriller that will keep you entertained for an hour and a half. It is a Hollywood hostage movie set in a New York television studio. It has a big name cast; George Clooney and Julia Roberts are both on top form and Jack OConnell is excellent as the hostage taker. It is directed by Jodie Foster who does a good job subverting expectations in a genre that the audience will know well. The script and character development are fantastic because although all the main protagonists have flawed personalities we get to see their humanity and have some sympathy with all of them.Money Monster is funny surprising and knowing. It is also nicely subversive from Jodi Foster because all the men in the film are the brash sensationalist types getting all the attention and the women are the ones who get things done.Dont go to this movie expecting insights into the world of financial markets or the effects of the 24 hour news cycle on society. Go expecting pure light entertainment for that is what it delivers.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 30 2016Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedMoney Monster is a film whose trailer did it no favours. From the first glimpse of George Clooney mugging it up for the camera until I was actually sat in the dark watching the opening credits roll I was unconvinced that I even wanted to see it...90 minutes later I was its biggest fan.This is a brilliant film. Smartly written superbly scored and tightly directed this is the movie that will Men in Black style erase all thoughts of The Beaver from your memory and remind you what an uber-talent Jodie Foster is. The opening scenes nicely set up the chemistry between Clooney amp; regular co-star Julia Roberts hand holding us through the depiction of him as Lee Gates an embarrassing thoughtless ratings driven idiot and her as Patty Fenn an unflappable producer driven to leave the show that created his monster. Ten minutes in and I wasnt sure how much more of either character I could take but then thankfully enter stage right its Jack OConnell bringing with him the heart of the story.OConnells Kyle Budwell is an everyman. Hes you and hes me and its this relatability that drew me in quickly and wholeheartedly. He took a tip from Gates lost everything he had and wants answers. The financial crises of the last decade have been well documented on the big screen over recent years - 2015s The Big Short and the superb Margin Call from 2011 are both well worth a watch - to the point where it feels like everything in them can be related back to the average Joe in the street. You do want answers and you do want the banks to pay and you do question why the few profit so excessively from the downfall of the many. Theres no doubt whose side we are meant to be on here but it never feels forced. The direction is subtle and when Budwell says that he doesnt want the PS60k he lost he wants the PS800m that everyone lost its over. Youre not only on his side youre carrying his gun mopping his brow and asking if he wants a glass of water.Once Clooney has calmed down and started to vaguely resemble a normal human being hes very good with his begging the millions of watching viewers to consider the worth of his life a standout scene with a wincing sting in the tail. Roberts understated amp; quick-fire performance is dependably reassuring while Dominic West is grossly watchable as the films villain but make no mistake this is OConnells show. Fantastic in Starred Up but somewhat lost Unbroken its a huge relief to see him back on form here. At times terrifyingly familiar in his humanity and often extremely moving he holds your focus in a way that someone slicker amp; shinier would struggle to do and all credit to both him and Foster for bringing out the very best here.The financial tech speak is kept a minimum but I didnt mind that - I never felt as though it had been dumbed down for me more that it was explained in a way that was swift amp; non-distracting to what was happening on screen. Intelligent tense thrillers are few amp; far between nowadays but this film falls firmly into that bracket; the exterior scenes and the quality on screen reminded me of the excellent Inside Man and if youre looking for something that will have your breath held and your nerves shredded Money Monster unlike Wall Street is a sure thing.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 30 2016JKFeaturedYes - its silly and more than a little preposterous - but for sheer entertainment value this movie delivers. OConnell is brilliant as the disgruntled little man - the accent falters at times but there is a vulnerability about him that evokes total pathos from the onset. There are some moments of hilarious comedy to take the edge off the palpable tension and Clooney gives an assured performance throughout. The politics are confused but the 2016 take on our media-obsessed world succeeds in adding something to this well-trodden movie trope. Definitely worth going to see.

(I guess after youve gutted everything else -- moral outrage systemic corruption media vampirism basic human decency the plight of the common man etc. -- you need to reassure folks that its still nice to have a good buddy around.) Lee Gates (George Clooney) is hosting his goofball cable financial news show when sad sack Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) slips onto the set and takes him hostage. It seems Kyle lost it all after investing in Walt Cambys (Dominic West) troubled company IBIS which Gates touted as a sure thing. Now he wants answers and none of your fancy talk about algorithms and glitches thank you very much. Its up to show director Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) to figure a way out of all this even if it means bringing in hackers ex machina.

Atsushi Nishijima/TriStar Pictures hide caption toggle caption Atsushi Nishijima/TriStar Pictures Giancarlo Esposito and George Clooney in Jodie Fosters thriller Money Monster which never gets quite as crazy or convincing as say The Big Short. Atsushi Nishijima/TriStar Pictures The financial legerdemain lampooned in The Big Short was designed to be opaque and arcane -- so much so that even the supposed experts didnt really know what they were doing. The scenario of Money Monster is much simpler which is both a strength and a weakness. The movie is easier to understand but thats because as with so many Hollywood conspiracy thrillers the big payoff is actually pretty small. The films villains are not real investment banks but the fictional Ibis Clear Capital and its CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West). The protagonist stands somewhere between documentary and fantasy Lee Gates (George Clooney) host of FNNs Money Monster is a slightly camouflaged version of Jim Cramer host of CNBCs Mad Money. Lees program features sexy dancers silly props and the sort of macho bluster typical of sports-talk and drive-time radio. Also in the mix are stock tips one of which recently was Ibis. It proceeded to tank. To Lee thats entertainment. But one viewer takes offense and arrives at the shows Manhattan studio with a pistol and what appears to be an explosive-packed vest. Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) takes Gates hostage while hes on the air live. The cops come running but the person whos really in charge of the standoff is the shows flawlessly efficient producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts). She cues Gates and the crew while researching Kyle and juggling Ibis spokeswoman Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe). Diane is on the spot because her boss was scheduled to appear on the show but has gone missing. Is that suspicious? Does a bear market sleep in the woods? Aside from using Ibis to represent all the rogue companies that have crashed and burned since 2007 Money Monsters agenda is to humanize Kyle and redeem Lee. Kyle is just a little guy from Queens whos been pushed too far. (It sounds like even farther since OConnells accent betrays his British origins.) The thrice-divorced Lee is Clooneys usual silver-tongued rascal self-serving and sexist but just about to notice that Patty is kind of great. As the woman who can oversee a bustling set and manage the bad-boy star Patty is an obvious surrogate for the movies actual director Jodie Foster. Patty keeps Lee alive while following clues about Ibiss misbehavior that lead to hackers quants and old-fashioned physical laborers on several continents. That makes her as formidable as Foster a woman who could direct Mel Gibson in The Beaver. One of the challenges Foster sets for herself is staging Money Monster in real time. The movie begins just a few minutes before the show does and follows the on-air hostage drama to its conclusion barely 90 minutes later. The action is set mostly in Ibiss and FNNs respective buildings but ultimately it takes to the streets for Lee and Kyles tense tour of New Yorks financial district. The procession conducted while dozens of cops stand ready is not especially plausible but is well-choreographed. What deflates the last act is the easy explanation and glib resolution of the Ibis matter. This plots tricks cant rival the perplexities and absurdities of the The Big Short. The filmmakers do emulate that predecessor at the very last moment which offers a few seconds of commentary by big-capital critic Robert Reich and ends with Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbis line that Goldman Sachs is ""a great vampire squid."" But the brief finale is much testier than the rest of Money Monster which plays it straight with a topic that in reality is far more twisted.

Jodie Fosters Wall Street thriller is furious at everyone from the corporate crooks swindling decent Americans out of their savings to the callow media chortling as the country plummets toward disaster. George Clooney plays Lee Gates a pompadoured bobblehead who hosts a stock market show spangled with dancing girls dollar sign necklaces and Frankenstein GIFs. ""This isnt journalism"" admits his director Patty (Julia Roberts). But if it were more serious who would watch? The problem is Gatess show passes for journalism -- at least to rubes who dont know how else to get financial advice. And when one of them a twentysomething working-class schmuck named Kyle (Jack OConnell) loses his mothers inheritance to one of Gatess bum stock tips he shows up at the studio with a pistol and a suicide vest of explosives that he forces the host to buckle on over his expensive suit. Do the cameras keep running? Of course. And from the control booth Patty toggles between whispering in Gatess earpiece pleading with the cops and ordering her cameramen to dolly in for a better shot. She may be in the blast radius but shes still a professional dammit. Clooney is perfectly cast as the glib golden boy of infotainment. As soon as hes under the gun he deflates and every bit of his swagger -- the hair the tan the grin the jokes -- sags around his ankles. He whines like a toddler who needs a snack. Meanwhile it seems like a sardonic nod to sexism that actress turned director Foster sticks Roberts a star perhaps bigger than Clooney in the background as though no one would want to see her face in front of the cameras. (Even though shes seven years younger than the silver fox.) With angry white men dominating the news and our election cycle Money Monster feels so 2016 that it could be dated in a year. It gets that people who are broke feel as Kyle does that ""the game is rigged."" Some of the furious vote for Bernie or Trump and the worst ones long past believing that their voice or vote matters grab guns. Though Foster understands Kyle the Symbol she cartoonifies Kyle the Man whom Irish actor OConnell voices like an idiot. The last time I heard someone say ""Dem bankers"" and ""Dose crooks"" it was the moron in an old Orphan Annie comic strip. The irony is that Foster too finally loses sight of Kyle. Here hes gone to all this trouble to be heard -- ""I came in here knowing Im not walking out"" he says and we believe him -- and the film telling his story gets bored with the common man. Instead Foster increasingly focuses on the jet-setting CEO (Dominic West) who may have triggered a big stock crash and his accidental co-conspirators his PR flack (Caitriona Balfe) and a South Korean programmer (Aaron Yoo). By the time Pattys producer (Christopher Denham) flags an Icelandic hacker (Darri Ingolfsson) for help and we get our fourth cut to a mine in South Africa Fosters made her point The American economy is no longer the American economy. Its a global Gordian knot that Kyle can never understand no matter how many pounds of explosives hes carrying. Even though we get an answer of sorts the only clear thing is that Foster and writers Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf are mad as hell. Solutions are secondary. Mainly Money Monster just wants to yell especially at the media. Though Gates is shaken into doing real journalism the film refuses to forgive his sins. His big moments have cruel twists and his ""fans"" are just as callous. Here he is one button-push from death and his TV audience ignores the stakes. Hes just one more onscreen character suffering for our entertainment. Foster half-attempts to make him a hero but a film this bleak shouldnt pull its punches. Its better when it stops aiming at every villain and centers itself on one Gates begging his viewers ""Whats my life worth?""

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Entertainment 05/12/2016 0545am George Julia the key assets in tense funny Money Monster Julia Roberts plays Patty Fenn and George Clooney plays Lee Gates in ""Money Monster."" | TriStar Pictures Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Entertainment Newsletter Receive Theater Celebrity amp; Entertainment related Updates Sign-Up Even when ""Money Monster"" bends credulity to the tip of the tip of the breaking point its an entertaining ride reminiscent of tick-tick-tick thrillers such as ""Dog Day Afternoon"" ""Ransom"" and ""Inside Man"" -- albeit in a lighter mode. It works as a social satire about those slick superficial financial advice shows on cable TV; a commentary about the world of high-tech investment practices; a taut thriller and a sobering cynical examination of how quickly the public and the media jump on a story -- only to hop right off after the wave of breaking news stories and viral videos have run their course. This is pulpy sometimes lurid fare and the viewer will often be far ahead of the supposedly smart people onscreen trying to decipher the puzzle. But thanks to a stylish directorial turn by Jodie Foster and the shining star power of George Clooney and Julia Roberts (as well as a first-rate supporting cast) ""Money Monster"" rises above an uneven script that veers from clever and insightful to heavy-handed and obvious -- sometimes within the same scene. Clooney lights it up as Lee Gates a silver-haired huckster in a tailored suit who is ringmaster of the hit show ""Money Monster"" which is filled with so many theatrical gimmicks it makes Jim Cramers ""Mad Money"" look quiet dry and dignified. Lee is an arrogant and smarmy snake charmer who barely acknowledges his staff other than to bark orders at them as he saunters into the studio just in time for another live program. Once Lee is on the air he goes into full shtick mode donning boxing gloves and hopping about with two scantily clad background dancers; pounding a big red button on his desk to ignite sound effects and visual punch lines; and invoking cheap double entendres e.g. telling his viewers to have balls and take chances as the monitor shows a bunch of bouncing basketballs. Clooneys ""Oceans"" running mate Julia Roberts turns in one of her best performances in recent years as Patty the director and executive producer of ""Money Monster"" and the clear grown-up in their professional relationship. Whereas Lee likes to wing it and ignore the prepared notes Patty is the only one in the control room who can get him to listen at least once in a while. Lees ""Money Monster"" is such an unpredictable wacky show nobody is even alarmed when a sweat-drenched guy toting two cardboard boxes shows up on set in the middle of a live broadcast. Lee thinks its a gag sprung by the crew; Patty suspects Lee is up to his usual unannounced tricks. Even after the guy pulls out a gun everyone thinks its a prop --until he squeezes the trigger and fires a bullet into the ceiling. NOW hes got our attention. The man with the gun and the boxes is one Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell). Kyle has lost everything investing in the IBIS corporation whose stock Lee guaranteed as a safer bet ""than a savings account"" and hes a desperate man. Inside one of the boxes is a vest wired to explosives. Kyle makes Lee put on the vest and then he announces on live TV he will shoot Lee in the head and/or blow up the studio if he doesnt get some answers about why IBIS collapsed. Patty cant cut the feed because Kyle has a cell phone and he can see the program in real time and hell know if they pull any tricks. (Thats a semi-plausible built-in excuse to have the entire drama play out on live TV and just the first of a handful of ""Wait really?"" moments you just have to go with it if youre going to buy into this story.) Once the premise is established ""Money Monster"" kicks into a high-energy sometimes very funny and occasionally legitimately tense thriller that touches on a number of familiar elements including The arrival of the cops including a wise and measured captain (Giancarlo Esposito) and a meathead negotiator (Chris Bauer) who immediately writes Kyle off as a ""loser"" and a ""loner."" Crowds gathering behind police lines and patrons in bars and restaurants watching the drama unfold on TV and cheering and commenting as if its a reality show. The obligatory appearance of the significant other (Emily Meade) who is brought to the scene to try to talk some sense into Kyle. Lee taking stock of his own life (three failed marriages a child he never sees a viewing public that thinks hes a clown) while gaining empathy for Kyle. Nothing we havent seen before but director Foster and the actors always seem aware theyre dealing in cliches -- and those cliches are often turned upside down in a way that produces some big laughs. Absurd as it gets we kinda believe most of this could happen because have you watched the news this decade? One of the disappointments of ""Money Monster"" is Clooney and Roberts have only a few scenes in which theyre sharing the same space. Granted theyre in communication with each other for nearly the entire story -- but most of that consists of Patty in the control room talking in Lees ear via IFB while Lee is on set. But even via wireless remote they have remarkable chemistry. Next time they team up heres hoping the script puts them in the same room more often. 1/2 TriStar Pictures presents a film directed by Jodie Foster and written by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf. Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (for language throughout some sexuality and brief violence).

That makes the film both important and self-satisfied. But that does not automatically make it great. Instead this action drama is merely good just a cut above mediocre. It suffers from plotting and character development issues that undercut the overall effect. The film could be better -- and it should be better considering the depth of the talent involved. We all know that Wall Street should be savaged for its corruption excesses and its reliance on and exploitation of greed. But Money Monster pales in comparison to the incisive surgery performed by The Big Short Adam McKays Oscar-nominated film from 2015. In fact it does not even measure up to Hollywood films of the distant past which explored the same issues in the banking industry such as Frank Capras 1932 gem American Madness starring Walter Huston. Money Monster was co-written by a Canadian Alan Di Fiore and two Americans Jim Kouf and Jamie Linden. Clooneys Smoke House Pictures got involved bringing in Clooneys producing partner Grant Heslov. As for Foster this is her first directorial effort on the big screen since The Beaver (2011) which starred Mel Gibson. Otherwise she has been dabbling with TV series directing episodes of Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. Money Monster represents the kind of films that Clooney and Heslov love to make together genre pictures with a socio-political agenda that audiences can enjoy and then debate. Ditto for Foster whose 1990s films Little Man Tate and Home for the Holidays had subtext. The trouble with Money Monster is that it actually adds very little to our understanding of the weaknesses in the American economic system. It just frames the obvious issues in a new showbiz manner. Clooney plays a hotheaded financial adviser who hosts a New York television show with Julia Roberts playing his long-suffering cool-handed producer. That makes Clooneys Lee Gates the clown and Roberts his weary circus ringleader as the host dispenses his stock tips with plenty of razzle-dazzle and little gravitas. Their world is thrown into crisis when a desperate working man (Jack OConnell) shows up with a bomb-rigged vest and a loaded gun. Forcing Clooney to wear the vest and putting his own thumb on the remote detonator OConnells character hijacks the TV show. He wants to protest one of Clooneys stock tips -- which of course led to the mans financial ruin. The show is live Millions of viewers get caught up. Millions of words (only a slight exaggeration) get exchanged on the morality of the stock market and whether one CEO (played blandly by Dominic West) is a villain or also a victim when his company loses 800 million in value in just one afternoon. Clooney as the crisis grows emerges as a powerhouse performer. OConnell is convincing. Roberts is surprisingly appealing as the producer because she is the audiences eyes on what is happening. But the plot lurches and falters when New Yorks finest get heavily involved. These are not their finest hours. In fact some of the police scenes are so ridiculous that their activities become unbelievable and therefore not of the real world. Money Monster ends in pathos. Insight is missing. The world depicted here just goes back to doing business as usual. And that is an empty feeling for the audience no matter how passionate Clooney and OConnells characters were in their debate about money and morality.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / Atsushi Nishijima advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A television financial show host is taken hostage by an angry investor. CAST George Clooney Julia Roberts Jack OConnell RATED R (Strong language and mild violence)LENGTH 138 BOTTOM LINE A potentially topical thriller marred by pandering dialogue and clumsy plotting. Spend your money elsewhere. After the economic collapse of 2008 Jon Stewart and his ""Daily Show"" staffers focused their outrage on Jim Cramer a former hedge-fund manager whose popular financial news show ""Mad Money"" had been consistently upbeat on the very banks that tanked the economy. After days of Stewarts attacks Cramer came on the show. Their confrontation in which Cramer came off looking like a journalist who failed his duties when America needed him most -- basically the Judith Miller of the financial press -- drew a whopping 2.3 million viewers. Among them surely were the three screenwriters of ""Money Monster."" Theyve come up with a clever idea What if it wasnt Stewart who targeted Cramer but a furious investor with a gun and a bomb? Put them both on live television add a bit of global intrigue -- not to mention Jodie Foster as director -- and youve got the makings of a topical popcorn thriller. advertisement | advertise on newsday And check out the cast. George Clooney plays the Cramer-esque Lee Gates whose garish show ""Money Monster"" peddles financial analysis in the guise of trashy entertainment (Clooneys hip-hop dance routines are inspired). Julia Roberts plays his loyal producer Patty Fenn who stays in the studio even when a guy named Kyle (Jack OConnell) storms onto the set waving a gun. Kyle has two questions How did Ibis Clear Capital lose 800 million of its investors money and why didnt Gates see it coming? SUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerPhotosMovies that got zero-star reviewsCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 The answers are highly unsatisfying. ""Money Monster"" tries to channel populist anger but doesnt have an iota of substance. The dialogue sounds like a collection of trending hashtags -- rigged system government bailout complicit media -- but none of it addresses any real issue. The story centers on high-frequency trading a real and fairly frightening technological development but the twists feel highly unsophisticated. (One bit of crucial evidence is obtained after a five-second Google search.) Its no spoiler to say that the villain is a shady CEO played by Dominic West. Hes strung up in effigy by this pandering film so quickly that you almost feel sorry for him. ""Money Monster"" is one of those C-grade thrillers that depends on implausible behavior unlikely coincidences and slow-moving cops to get by. Its definitely not worth the investment. 4 more Clooney-Roberts filmsTeaming George Clooney and Julia Roberts seems like a safe investment for the makers of ""Money Monster"" to strike it rich. After all the two have been big draws with these previous collaborations. OCEANS ELEVEN (2001) -- In this smash remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper Clooney starred as ex-con Danny Ocean who hatches a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos and win back his ex-wife (Roberts).CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND (2002) -- Clooney directed and appeared in this film based on Chuck Barris memoir in which ""The Gong Show"" producer claimed to have worked as a CIA assassin. Roberts played a seductive CIA agent who becomes involved with Barris (Sam Rockwell).OCEANS TWELVE (2004) -- This ""Oceans Eleven"" sequel followed the same formula as the first film shifting the heist high jinks to Europe and adding a twist Danny remarried to Tess asks her to pose as a pregnant Julia Roberts as part of the scheme.AUGUST OSAGE COUNTY (2013) -- Clooney produced this screen version of Tracy Letts play about a dysfunctional family who gather together when dear old Dad (Sam Shepard) disappears. Roberts earned an Oscar nomination as the nasty eldest daughter who takes after her difficult mom (Meryl Streep).-- DANIEL BUBBEO Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"George Clooney and Julia Roberts get mauled by Money Monster - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review George Clooney and Julia Roberts get mauled by Money Monster ""Money Monster"" Atsushi Nishijima / TriStar Pictures George Clooney center stars with Giancarlo Esposito left in TriStar Pictures ""Money Monster."" George Clooney center stars with Giancarlo Esposito left in TriStar Pictures ""Money Monster."" (Atsushi Nishijima / TriStar Pictures) Kenneth Turan The names are big -- George Clooney Julia Roberts director Jodie Foster -- but the results are meager in ""Money Monster"" a film that is both less entertaining and less significant than it imagines.An attempt at combining a real-time thriller with a shot across the bow to a deceptive financial system ""Money Monster"" never achieves plausibility settling instead for cliched situations and uninteresting characters masquerading as contemporary relevance. As written by Jamie Linden and Alan DiFiore amp; Jim Kouf ""Money Monster"" primarily takes place in a Manhattan TV studios set and control room. That along with an ""Im fed up and Im not going to take it anymore"" theme give it a distant echo of Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefskys ""Network"" but the resemblance never manages to be more than skin deep.The TV show in question is called ""Lee Gates Presents Money Monster"" and features the titular Gates (gamely played by Clooney) singing dancing mugging in funny hats and periodically dispensing financial advice to the multitudes under shticky rubrics like ""Cant Miss Stock Tip of the Millennium."" Gates were meant to understand is as much entertainer as advisor an empty vessel who oozes misplaced self-confidence and counts on his fast-disappearing charm to get by. Money Monster trailer George Clooney and Julia Roberts must work furiously against the clock to unravel the mystery behind a conspiracy at the heart of todays fast-paced high-tech global markets. George Clooney and Julia Roberts must work furiously against the clock to unravel the mystery behind a conspiracy at the heart of todays fast-paced high-tech global markets. See more videos Keeping Gates on the straight and narrow as much as possible is his inevitably long-suffering producer Patty Fenn (Roberts not at her best) the calm center of any storm who gets to explain to a nervous guest ""We dont do gotcha journalism we dont do journalism at all.""Gates starts this particular day with a bit of news. A hot firm called Ibis Clear Capital which Gates has been touting as the biggest thing since sliced bread just announced that a ""glitch"" in its high-frequency trading algorithm caused 800 million of its money to disappear.A bit unnerved Gates would like Ibis CEO Walt Camby (""The Wires"" Dominic West) to appear on the show to explain but he cant be reached and company flack Diane Lester (an effective Caitriona Balfe of TVs ""Outlander"") is recruited instead. This is where things get both more complicated and less believable. Wandering onto the set while the show is being broadcast (studio security apparently not being what it used to be) comes intruder Kyle Budwell (""Unbrokens"" Jack OConnell) an ordinary guy from the outer boroughs who is well fed up and not going to take it anymore. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Brandishing a weapon and forcing Gates to don a vest filled with high explosives Budwell turns out to be irate because he lost his life savings when he listened to Gates Ibis tip. ""The system is rigged"" he shouts sounding like a Donald Trump supporter in the making. ""Theyre stealing the country out from under us.""With producer Fenn whispering calm instructions into Gates earpiece the host tries his usual ""Im not the real criminal"" routine but Budwell is not buying it demanding that CEO Camby show up to explain where his money went and threatening widespread death and destruction on live TV while refusing to take no for answer.All this may sound plausible in theory but in practice there are several difficulties starting with OConnells performance which is as uncertain as his trying-too-hard New York accent. Brilliantly convincing in British films like ""Starred Up"" and ""71"" he has difficulty finding his footing here likely because the film hes in has the same difficulty. For having a unified and convincing tone as those who retain bleak memories of 2011s ""Beaver"" can attest is not something Foster considers important in a director.""Money Monster"" is all over the map mixing earnest contemporary relevance black comedy bogus emotion and tragedy with its nominal thriller plot all to frankly bewildering effect. A film to bet on this definitely is not.ALSOThe Lobster offers a rich surreal take on modern loveJack OConnell wasnt intimidated by his Money Monster co-star George ClooneyRyan Gosling Meryl Streep and Swiss Army Man lead the counterprogramming charge at the movies this summer Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Julia Roberts George Clooney Jodie Foster Dominic West Sidney Lumet Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-money-monster-review-20160506-snap-story.html,200,moneymonster23,moneymonster,latimes
"Money Monster | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; money-monster ) Money Monster (United States 2016) May 12 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Money Monster wants to be more than just another mindless thriller. By building its foundation on a message about the dangers of playing the stock market roulette wheel it seeks to inject substance into a genre overrun by action-driven popcorn films. Unfortunately despite a surfeit of talent in front of and behind the camera the movie is unable to overcome a shaky narrative whose increasing preposterousness ensures its difficult to take seriously. The term ""suspension of disbelief"" comes into play with a movie that wants viewers to accept that it transpires in the ""real world"" rather than in some parallel universe where the laws of common sense (and sometimes physics) have been suspended. One doesnt worry about ""suspension of disbelief"" in a movie like Die Hard - we get that its pure fantasy existing exclusively to deliver adrenaline-fueled excitement. Money Monster on the other hand has a message and in order for a member of the audience to buy into the message the world in which it transpires has to exhibit a strong sense of plausibility and thats where the movie fails. As the contrivances build one atop another like a shaky house of cards it becomes increasingly difficult to remain immersed in the story. The outlandish climax strains credulity past the breaking point. The movie has a great hook imagine what would happen if a desperate man having lost everything as a result of following a TV financial advisors advice takes the host hostage on live TV. George Clooney plays Lee Gates the front man for Money Monster a cable TV show that mixes kitsch with market picks. Gates loud fast-talking approach (aping that of actual hosts) makes him seem more like a carnival barker than someone worthy of giving advice. His producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) is so tired of the day-to-day grind in general and Gates in particular that she already has one foot out the door when a mysterious ""delivery man"" arrives on set with a couple of boxes. With the cameras rolling Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) whips out a gun and forces Gates to don an explosive vest. Then after explaining how he lost his entire savings following a ""buy"" tip for stock that subsequently tanked he demands an explanation. Unable to provide it Gates contacts the corporations Chief Communications Officer (Caitriona Balfe) but she is unable to offer more than the standard ""talking points."" Her attempts to reach the CEO (Dominic West) prove fruitless causing Gates to wonder whether the stocks fall might be the result of malfeasance rather than typical Wall Street corruption. With all its talk of ""algorithms"" and ""glitches"" there are times when Money Monster threatens to mire viewers in double-speak. Although the movie seeks to indict the entire Wall Street culture it falls short of The Big Short in doing so. In fact in the end this is more about the greed of one person than the failings of a system (although the screenplay reminds viewers that the system encourages the corruption). The NYPDs image takes a hit - the cops come across as bumbling amateurs unable to manage a crisis. Director Jodie Foster wrings tension out of the situation with the level of suspense building as events conspire to bring Kyle closer to the brink. Foster turns the enclosed TV set location into a pressure cooker with the key players - Gates Patty (a disembodied voice) and a cameraman - fighting to keep Kyle from blowing. And as Gates recognizes his complicity in the young mans situation guilt starts to eat at his conscience. Foster has likely taken cues from Sidney Lumet here - the distant echoes of Dog Day Afternoon are unmistakable. Gates is a polished salesman whose on-camera demeanor is reflective of his off-camera personality charming but abrasive. Clooney brings his patented likability to the role; his performance is spot-on. Julia Roberts has the thankless job of sitting in a separate room watching Clooney on a monitor and whispering instructions to him through an earpiece. Jack OConnell plays Kyle like an uneducated unhinged man who (as evidenced by a brutal scene in which his girlfriend berates him) has problems beyond losing 60000 in a bad stock deal. As the film unfolds we (like Gates) are intended to become more sympathetic toward him but he too often comes across like a whiner. For a while with the drama playing out on live TV while the world watches Money Monster is compelling viewing. But when the police start implementing their undercooked rescue plan and Gates kicks off a long-distance investigation into the stocks crash the film loses its immediacy. Verisimilitude is overwhelmed by absurdity. Money Monster wants to be a smart thriller but its undone by a script that despite having a legitimate ax to grind resorts to hard-to-swallow contrivances and dumb characters to shepherd everything to a resolution.

Sony Pictures AP Sony Pictures Money Monster    1/2 (out of five) Director Jodie Foster Cast Jack OConnell George Clooney Julia Roberts Rated R (strong language throughout sexuality and brief violence) Running time 98 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 951am on Thursday May. 12 2016 Thursday May. 12 2016 Thursday May. 12 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Jodie Foster channels her inner 70s filmmaker in the slick streamlined Money Monster her cinematic shout-out to ""mad as hell and Im not going to take it anymore"" films such as Network and Dog Day Afternoon. Her first movie as a director in five years lacks those films resonance but theres no denying Money Monsters timely appeal.As with last years The Big Short and 99 Homes Money Monster plays on universal financial fears of systemic corruption and unscrupulous greed that can bankrupt those with more integrity than dollars. Thats why when an armed man Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) sneaks into a TV studio where the obnoxious stock-market guru Lee Gates (George Clooney) hosts his loud and loopy Money Monster show the line between hero and villain is paper-thin.Kyle is one of us an ordinary Joe who thinks he can make the system work for him. When he sinks 60000 worth of savings into Ibis Clear Capital a company that Lee shilled for on his show Kyle thinks his ship has come in -- and it did. But it turned out to be the Titanic.A ""glitch"" in the market sent Ibis stock into a nosedive wiping out small investors like Kyle while leaving Lee -- who could probably find 60K in his couch cushions -- with just more fodder for another comedic bit.But no ones laughing when Kyle takes Lee hostage live on television forcing the shows director in the control room Patty Finn (Julia Roberts) to play the abitrator between the often conflicting demands of Kyle and the police.Kyle also wants the head of Ibis Walt Camby (Dominic West) brought to the studio as well. Kyle wants more than just to be made financially whole again. He wants a televised apology and admission that were all just dirt to be crushed underneath the 1000 bootheels of people like Lee and Walt.Unfolding in real time over just more than 90 minutes Money Monster hints at being a more suspenseful and taut topical thriller than it turns out to be. While always compulsively watchable and often surprisingly funny it loses some of its steam once it becomes clear where its going.Written by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf the film has a tidy TV feel to it perhaps because DiFiore and Kouf have written for a ton of TV series. Instead of being a knockout punch against what they present as a rigged system its more of a glancing blow. And for a film that wants to seem like its ripped from real life it stretches credibility to the breaking point by having things happen within 90 minutes ""real time"" that could not possibly happen that quickly.But what makes Money Monster work as well as it does are the performances. Clooney was born to play a character like Lee a slick loose-limbed charlatan who has a soul buried deeply somewhere underneath the aging playboy facade. Roberts doesnt have much to do but bark orders to her frightened staff and Clooney in his earpiece while trying to keep the gunman calm. But you can feel both her growing exasperation and her coming into her own as she takes charge of the situation.OConnell is one of those actors who always seems like hes on the verge of a breakthrough that never happens. He was terrific in the small films Starred Up and 71 and the flawed would-be blockbuster Unbroken which didnt turn out to be the career-making hit it seemed like it would be.While the obvious comparison here is to Al Pacinos raving Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon OConnell makes Kyle his own turning him into a sympathetic but troubled man who has reached his breaking point.If nothing else Money Monster offers an efficient entertaining alternative to almost everything else in the multiplex these days. It gives those hoping for a superhero-free summer something to see while they wait for fall to get here. Its too bad that it doesnt give them too much more than that.

And Jodie Foster in her fourth film as a director goes for the burn. That she does it in the form of a vividly entertaining action thriller starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts is icing on the cake. Like last years The Big Short Money Monster wants you to laugh till it hurts. But Fosters subject isnt just the corrupt financial system but the human beings getting mangled in its gears. More News Gwen Stefani George Clooney Roberts for Carpool Karaoke The Rolling Stone Interview Julia Roberts Captain America Why Chris Evans Is the Anxious Avenger All Stories >> Related Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Superheroes supervillains sequels semi-reboots -- the scoop on the seasons surprisingly familiar multiplex stunners A stellar Clooney plays Lee Gates the host of TVs Money Monster in which he gives stock tips between clownish dance numbers and comedy bits. (Think a more extreme version of Mad Moneys Jim Cramer.) Gates treats everyone like crap including Patty Fenn (an excellent Roberts) his long-suffering producer whos thinking of jumping ship. Then midshow a guy wired with explosives pushes into the studio points a gun at Gates and holds him hostage on live TV. The guy Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) having lost his savings on a Gates tip wants revenge and a chance to expose a rigged system. Thats the setup which Foster engineers for maximum real-time ticking-bomb suspense. As Budwell moves Gates downtown to Wall Street to confront the CEO (Dominic West) who blames a technical glitch for his companys flame- out Foster moves her film from a pulse-quickening nail-biter with SWAT teams and choppers swirling to an incisive look at a beleaguered America undergoing a crisis of faith. Clooney has plenty of fun mocking the empty suit hes playing but he ups the ante by showing the fear self-hatred and buried integrity that are eating at Gates. And Roberts makes her harried producer an oasis of calm in the gathering storm. What the script lacks in emotional subtext youll find in their richly detailed performances. Unlike Budwell Gates hasnt let his rage against the machine push him over the line. Not yet anyway. Fosters film doesnt doubt that money rules our lives. But it does wonder provocatively why were dumb enough to let it.

Hearing him say such things youd think you were watching a movie made in response to everything that has been happening so far in the 2016 campaign. But this is a movie that began filming over a year ago in February 2015 and obviously it was written long before that. Its uncanny how movies can sometimes anticipate the historical moment and speak to it. This is a strong thriller buoyed by the serious star power of George Clooney and Julia Roberts and an astonishing chameleonic turn by Jack OConnell who looks and acts nothing like he did as Louis Zamperini in ""Unbroken."" Here hes scruffy and desperate not at all handsome and he even seems about three inches shorter than he did in the earlier film. It was wise that director Jodie Foster decided not to go with a known star in that role. Better to have someone with no associations. OConnell plays one character but he seems to stand for many. Add Lee Gates to Clooneys growing list of self-aware narcissists both in love with their own magnificence and disgusted with themselves. Lee is a cable TV personality a fast-talking financial adviser clearly patterned on Jim Cramer though a little more urbane. Lee sings and dances puts on gloves and shadowboxes and advises people to buy stock. Hes a money entertainer with a show called ""Money Monster"" but people actually listen to him. And one day one of the suckers who listened to him shows up at the station while hes on the air with a gun and a vest full of explosives. ""Money Monster"" runs a little over an hour and a half and it plays out in real time. Lee is forced to put on the vest while the young man Kyle (Jack OConnell) holds the gun in one hand and the detonator in the other. The movie feels so propulsive and full of incident that its only later thinking about it that the realization dawns that the movie could easily have felt static. The bulk of the running time is spent with two guys on a TV set one berating the other. Julia Roberts role meanwhile is done almost entirely from a chair. Easily half of her dialogue is spoken from her desk into the microphone connected to Lees earpiece. But nothing about the role feels sedentary. Things are constantly happening. The movies sense of motion derives from the script with the Clooney character constantly having to devise stratagems second by second to talk the younger man down. The sense of motion comes as well from the frequent cutting -- from the set to the booth to the police to the publics reaction to tragicomedy playing out on live television. Jodie Foster was handed an unusually good script (by Jamie Linden Alan DeFiore and Jim Kouf) and she rose to it investing it with urgency and enriching it with winning performances throughout. Starting today will people be talking about this movie? In a way its just another well-made thriller but there are things here -- currents captured ideas frozen in time -- that might make it more interesting as the years pass. For the time being its good entertainment and deserves to be seen now. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Lee Gates the main man in the complex thriller ""Money Monster"" plays a popular stock specialist on live television telling viewers what to buy sell or hold. He looks and acts like the classic stereotype of a Wall Street whiz on TV -- 5000 suit winning smile sharp patter. Lee played by the handsome and genial George Clooney is big on TV because even when his proposals are risky they sound brilliant. If he warns your retirement savings will tank unless you stockpile Nigerian hedge funds his polished presentation could convince you. Provided he stays in character. And you dont know Treasury bonds from bail bonds. Remorselessly vain Lee is like the friendliest gaming table croupier youll ever meet. When one of the biggest bets he is pushing crashes a furious young investor bursts onto his show with a gun and explosive vest and overinflated Lee finds himself to be sadly a mere mortal. Police-o-rama raids hostage negotiations gripping action sequences arise and high ratings for Lees broadcast ensue as his life falls apart. ""Money Monster"" the fourth feature directed by Jodie Foster resembles Lee. Its fairly smart and has fetching features. But its only kind of good. At the plot level its sometimes murky when you want it to snap into plausibility. While it often feels like Fosters instincts as a director outpace the abilities of her screenwriting team what she delivers is infernally attractive. The film is a sort of crime thriller and a kind of critique of malfeasance by Wall Streets masters of the universe. But mainly its a portrait of a man whose life is quickly turned upside down inside out and nearly shot full of holes. Clooney is great as a narcissist with multiple divorces and a messy emotional life being publicly dragged through the whole nine yards. When he begins connecting with the blue-collar guy holding him prisoner (Jack OConnell) is Lees increasing decency another act for the camera? Feed Loader Julia Roberts is producer Patty Fenn. Clooneys shifting approach to this antihero part is so different in terms of energy that when he steps away from his glib broadcast role its a relief. OConnell playing an unruly one-man riot is asked to do little more than brandish weapons and shout threats which he does with chaotic energy. Julia Roberts adds a grace note to the story as Lees producer remaining in the control room and trying to handle the crisis. Stage managing her anxious star performer through the lifeline of his earphone she guides him into conversations with the terrorist that prevent the siege from literally exploding. Keeping circumstances on the edge of total collapse with good advice she is genuine and at times wrenching. She also has the nearest thing to an emotional connection to the main character talking him out of the slick persona he peddles on camera and back to real humanity. Foster has made a long excellent acting/producing/directing career out of working with gifted people on excellent films and recent TV fare like ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange Is the New Black."" She takes a surprising step here and doesnt stumble. She carries the story across multiple hairpin turns as accusations of dishonesty trigger investigations into stock manipulation high-tech detective work and the appearance of a billionaire tycoon with an agenda of his own. The movie transmutes from high stakes suspense to the human comedy while it hops from Manhattan to Korea South Africa and Iceland. Thats a lot of shifting to do and Foster manages it without stripping the gears.

Share Tweet ""I havent eaten dinner alone since the 90s"" says TV personality Lee Gates (George Clooney) as a means of chiding his no-nonsense no-dining-companion producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) early in Jodie Fosters Money Monster. Despite what the film considers an of-the-moment hook its this line of dialogue that most clearly establishes a contemporary setting. Otherwise Money Monster could pass for a 1998 prestige picture pretty handily from the way it casts Clooney as the charismatic host of a morally questionable cable TV show to its teaming of him with former superstars Roberts (behind the pretend camera) and Foster (behind the real one) right down to the TriStar Pictures logo resurrected for the opening credits. Although Money Monster wants to situate itself in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis it instead takes place in an alternate world where Clooneys instincts for socially conscious drama were never shaped or guided by the sure hands of Steven Soderbergh.To be sure this is a chilling dystopia where screenwriters with seemingly little knowledge of this countrys financial systems are allowed to pontificate about where it all went wrong. The answer naturally is a cable TV show. Clooneys Lee Gates is a Jim Cramer type doling out ironic dance moves softball interviews and stock tips on his Mad Money-like program Money Monster. Patty is the only one who gives it to him straight though in this case ""it"" primarily refers to dreadfully low-energy quips about his short attention span and nonstop yammering. The crew is early into a live episode of Money Monster coping with a guests last-minute cancellation when Kyle (Jack OConnell) bursts onto the set armed with a gun and a vest bomb demanding accountability for the personal nest egg he just lost on one of Lees stock tips. Kyle also insists that the cameras keep running holding Lee hostage with Patty along for the ride. Its at this point that Money Monster should turn into some kind of a nail-biter but Foster a novice at suspenseful filmmaking doesnt seem to know which screws to tighten or if screws even need tightening at all. Why bother to ratchet up suspense over Kyles desperation when you have cutting-edge satire of callow financial gurus and the insidious phenomenon of flashy cable television? For example Lees Money Monster show is so irreverent it uses clips from old movies to punctuate his announcements. Similarly Fosters Money Monster movie is so tapped into the zeitgeist that it includes shots that zoom into digital guts and wires revealing the galvanizing truth that our money is really just ones and zeroes on todays information superhighway.With its cultural and satirical details firmly rooted in the previous century Money Monster might have been better served by going fully (rather than accidentally) retro. It certainly cries out for the kind of crack character-actor supporting cast that might have enlivened the 90s version of this script but it throws so much of its weight behind Clooney and Roberts that the side characters cant provide much color. That includes OConnell spitting out a working-class-schnook accent and constantly baring his teeth like a wild animal. Foster grants him license to rant and rave while also making sure the other characters develop sympathy for him with an alarming almost confusing speed. (Its rare for hostages to be preloaded with Stockholm syndrome). Around the midway point the movie actively deflates a couple of big moments--one featuring a personal plea from Lee another highlighting Kyles connection to the outside world--in a way that suggests it has something to say about the pitilessness of a rigged economic system. To be sure this is a film at its most believable when its characters are screwing up. But these moments of weakness turn out to be stalling tactics on a story level as Money Monster sends supporting characters out to conduct proxy investigations on behalf of its heroes. Why Patty starts to wonder did that stock tank just as hard as it did? This mystery is light on suspects procedure and clues; and the sense of journalistic curiosity reawakened in Patty is mostly of the Aaron Sorkin variety 70 percent righteous indignation 30 percent knowing a guy. Theres not much pleasure in taunting Money Monster as a ham-fisted tin-eared anticlimactic and lethargically shot parable about greed and the 99 percent. Clooney and Foster gravitate toward smart projects and its possible that Roberts could better play a TV producer in a movie that requires more than her just nodding ruefully at her own hard-bitten wisdom. The movies self-confidence actually becomes discomfiting if also a little bit fascinating. This is no economics lesson at least not as intended. Its a testament to the peculiar fragility of movie-star tastes--and the accompanying moral high ground. Theres not much honor in a movie that rants about the little guy getting screwed then hands out its stars chumminess as a damp consolation prize.

Instead a young man named Kyle (Jack OConnell) shows up unannounced on Lees stage with a gun and a bomb vest to hold the TV personality responsible for the loss of his savings until he can get an answer on what happened.The drama unfolds mostly in real time with Lees producer Patty (Julia Roberts) trying to keep her star calm but also attempting to navigate her own investigation into the financial shenanigans that have put her whole crew in harms way.

"Money Monster cashes in on the popular quest for scapegoats review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMoney Monster cashes in on the popular quest for scapegoats reviewJodie Fosters Wall Street hostage drama Money Monster is more wish-fulfilment fantasy than cogent social commentary. But it gets the anger of regular people exactly right.George Clooney stars in Money Monster directed by Jodie Foster.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 12 2016Money MonsterStarring George Clooney Julia Roberts Jack OConnell Dominic West and Caitriona Balfe. Directed by Jodie Foster. Opens May 13 at GTA theatres. 98 minutes. 14AJodie Fosters Wall Street hostage drama Money Monster is more wish-fulfilment fantasy than cogent social commentary. But it gets one thing exactly right The desire of many people to see somebody preferably a wealthy and arrogant loudmouth pay for the misery brought to millions by cowboy capitalists and their global misadventures.Article Continued BelowGeorge Clooneys obnoxious TV stock guru Lee Gates is the perfect scapegoat or at least appears to be to agitated viewer Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell). Blue-collar Budwell spent money he didnt have on the ""cant-miss stock tip of the millennium"" touted by Gates Money Monster show. The stock missed in spectacular fashion but cynical Gates shrugged it off as a hard lesson for suckers.Budwell lost his shirt; now Gates wears an explosive one. Budwell holds the detonator with a fidgety thumb demanding both redress and a broadcast audience to vent his rage. Watching pensively from the control room trying to figure out what to do next is Julia Roberts Patty Fenn Gates longtime show producer and exasperated friend. She considers Gates an ""emotionally stunted 7-year-old"" but doesnt want him to die for his childish and sexist antics.The stage is set for another of Fosters cinema epiphanies which shes been making in an increasingly grander scale since her intimate directorial debut Little Man Tate in 1991. Speeches will be made and lessons will be learned especially when the action expands to include the clandestine manoeuvrings of a tycoon (Dominic West) whose Gates-recommended stock mysteriously crashed taking Budwell and other foolish dreamers down with it.Money Monster is professional Hollywood product with the actors and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (Black Swan Noah) hitting their marks without challenging the brain or eye. You dont need or get the amusing onscreen explanations of stock jargon that Adam McKay shrewdly provided for The Big Short a financial hostage-taking of the metaphorical kind. Yet Money Monster is the more intuitive of the two pictures more in tune with the little guy. It recognizes the inchoate anger of people who suddenly realize theyve been duped by a fast-talking hustler who promised gold but delivered dirt.If this sounds like a coded reference to a certain U.S. presidential candidate Foster will be happy if you make that connection too.Read more about George ClooneyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Atsushi Nishijima/TriStar Pictures/Sony Pictures Entertainment) George Clooney mugs dances and pretty much looks like hes having the time of his life in ""Money Monster"" in which he plays a financial cable show host with the aggression of Jim Cramer and showboating glee of a modern-day Music Man. With his on-air gimmicks quippy catchphrases and a showgirl on each arm Clooneys Lee Gates is a cocky self-impressed avatar of post-2008 arrogance and self-regard a one-man booster for Wall Street players who treat him like a peer (""I havent eaten dinner alone since the 90s"" he boasts at one point) but secretly see him as a useful idiot. Gatess dawning awareness that hes been a pawn in a rigged game is one of the most interesting undercurrents of ""Money Monster"" in which the fun and games come to an abrupt end when a disgruntled investor -- a young working stiff named Kyle played by Jack OConnell -- invades Gatess set with a gun and forces the host to put on a vest outfitted with a bomb. Kyle doesnt want his money back he insists he just wants to know where it went. Transpiring virtually in real time ""Money Monster"" chronicles the efforts of Gates -- and his director played by Julia Roberts -- to placate Kyle find the answers to his questions and keep everyone plebes and plutocrats alike from going kablooey. Jack OConnell plays an armed disgruntled investor who enters the ""Money Monster"" set lookng for answers. (Atsushi Nishijima/TriStar Pictures/Sony Pictures Entertainment) Efficiently directed by Jodie Foster ""Money Monster"" gets off to a promising start not only with Clooneys amusing high jinks as a shallow roue but also thanks to his easy bantering relationship with Roberts whose constant voice in his ear recalls Emily Mortimer and Jeff Danielss dynamic in the HBO series ""Newsroom"" -- all the more impressive for the fact that Clooney and Roberts filmed their scenes separately according to Foster. Written by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf the film has a taut nervous energy that infuses what is essentially a chamber piece with three people into a substantive of-the-moment thriller. [How Jodie Foster stays one of the most real stars in Hollywood] Propelled by the same populist rage as films like last years ""The Big Short"" and this years most talked-about political campaigns ""Money Monster"" is nothing if not timely which makes it all the more disappointing when the plot takes increasingly outlandish even naive turns and what could have been a modern-day classic on a par with ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or ""Network"" instead becomes ""Speed"" with more high-frequency trading and arcane algorithms. Actually the film ""Money Monster"" most closely resembles is a ""Mad City"" a misbegotten parable about media and violence that came out 20 years ago and was almost immediately forgotten. In that case too the films relevance was made moot by overworked ultimately unbelievable plotting. It bears noting that Kouf is the writer behind ""Rush Hour"" and the ""National Treasure"" movies ""Money Monster"" which is at its best when its at its most crisply realistic and timely suffers from the kind of only-in-Hollywood plot twists and eye-rolling exaggeration that results in smarter than average pulp but pulp nonetheless. Still for most of its swift running time ""Money Monster"" is admittedly entertaining especially when Gates hits on the idea of persuading his fans to invest in the errant stock in order to bring Kyle back into the black His speech to viewers in which he calls upon them to behave like humans and not computers is delivered with every ounce of the sincerity Clooneys character in ""Hail Caesar"" brought to his climactic oration at Christs crucifixion. With all its talk of glitches blips and black swans ""Money Monster"" turns out to be a bit of a black swan itself not quite the sophisticated drama the era deserves but not the usual adrenaline-addled genre exercise either. Even with the fundamentals in place to yield a big payday it remains a break-even proposition. R. At area theaters.

Movies particularly big Hollywood ones arent nimble enough to keep up with the quicksilver shifts in the national mood. The pictures were seeing today may have germinated for months if not years. Thats why its a small miracle that Jodie Fosters superb thriller Money Monster is hitting theaters now. Its a movie of the moment an expertly made state-of-the-nation popcorn flick that also underscores just how little most of us know about the behind-the-scenes shell games of the banking and finance industries with our money as the disappearing nugget. If you could pour the nations collective financial anxiety into one vessel it would coagulate into Money Monster. George Clooney is Lee Gates the dazzling doublespeaking host of a live financial-advice show that puts more stock in style than substance (sort of like Jim Cramers Mad Money but with women in hot pants). Lee often goes off script a recurring headache for the producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts). When she sees a delivery guy lurking near the set just as the show goes on air she thinks Lee is pulling another stunt. But then he bounds into camera range and at gunpoint forces Lee into a vest laced with explosives. On camera he rattles off a list of grievances capped with a demand that Lee fork over 800 million. The intruder is a desperate working guy from Queens Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) who lost his inheritance after acting on a stock tip that Lee doesnt even remember giving. Kyle doesnt want that 800 million for himself the loot is the cumulative amount lost by Ibis Clear Capital-a shadowy firm run by Dominic Wests Walt Camby-as the result of what alleged experts like Lee will only call a ""glitch."" The word is repeated over and over in news reports as if it were a viable explanation for what happened. Foster pastes those sound clips into a punk noise collage kicking back at the terms meaninglessness. If youve seen the trailer for Money Monster you probably think you know how it all plays out though deep down you probably also know that the Hollywood marketing machine sells you the movie it thinks you want to see just as the finance industry tells you what it thinks you want to hear. Money Monster is both subtler and bolder than the trailer makes it look. Like the provocative classics Dog Day Afternoon and Network this is discomfiting entertainment-its edges are serrated sharp enough to cut. The camera moves to just the right place every minute and the editing is crisp. Moments of nearly unbearable tension are broken by bursts of energy and even humor. Foster navigates the tonal shifts with ease and her actors follow. Clooney is almost too adept at flashing that snow-job showbiz smile but he changes course seamlessly making us believe in Lee as a man who discovers he has a tiny sliver of a conscience after all. Roberts doesnt get much screen time but we hear her voice a lot through Lees earphone. When Kyle first takes charge pacing and sputtering like a tiger in a zoo ready to burst out of its skin Patty urges Lee ""Just keep breathing"" her voice cottony and soothing. She may as well be talking us down too. But OConnells face is the key to Money Monster. He gave a finely wrought performance in Angelina Jolies otherwise patchy Unbroken. Here he stretches even further. When Kyle tells Lee and everyone else watching at home ""Theyre stealing everything from us and nobodys asking how"" his anguish rolls out in waves the sound of year after year of just getting by. In the most wrenching scene-one that may be almost unbearable to watch if youve ever fought bitterly with a partner over money-a person hes let down berates him with escalating horrifying vitriol. Despair and shame cross his face like an eclipse snuffing out the glow of the moon. You could call misguided (but hardly crazy) Kyle a Marxist-terrorist Robin Hood a symbol of our collective rage at people who play with our money as if it were nothing. But symbols in movies are mostly sodden things that have little to do with how we actually live. OConnell offers something else. His face is like a folk ballad filled with the promise of life-but also with the shadows of everything thats been snatched away. This appears in the May 23 2016 issue of TIME.

And having the time of his life. Five days a week he goes on cable TV live. He dances out does a bit of comedy shtick - hes like Chuck Barris crossed with Jim Cramer -- and then serves up a cant-miss stock tip. Its the investment of the millennium he shouts. Youre not convinced? You hesitate and miss out? Dont worry. Therell be another ""investment of the millennium"" tomorrow. ""Money Monster"" is supposed to be a movie about the way we live and save now and its got a good pedigree. George Clooney pushing the smarm and charm is Gates. Julia Roberts is his steely-eyed producer and Jodie Foster directs starting the film with an adrenaline-fueled flurry of backstage crosscutting. Yet the movie itself feels a little out of date taking place in the present but emotionally invoking a world of Enrons Bernie Madoffs tech bubbles and Wall Street meltdowns. Are stock frauds still the American workers biggest financial danger? Greater than flat wages disappearing benefits and good jobs - hell whole industries - being shipped overseas? Im not so sure but ""Money Monster"" amps up its drama and the volume by having one of Gates broadcasts interrupted by a viewer whos lost his lifes savings on one of those tips. Hes got a genuine grievance. Also a gun with which he takes Gates show hostage. Hes played by Jack OConnell who spends the next hour and a half shouting his lines in a put-on too-thick New York accent. And like a couple of our political candidates this year he talks a lot about how the system is rigged against the little guy. He has a point. His girlfriend has a better one though Hes an idiot. What else do you call someone who bets his entire bank account on a stock tip from some cable-TV host? Still this idiot is smart enough to hold Gates - and his live show - hostage for an hour and a half. Hold us hostage too in a movie which -- told in ""real time"" -- really has nowhere to go. It would help if the characters themselves went someplace emotionally. Certainly theres plenty of reason for Gates to question himself and what hes doing with his life ballyhooing one half-baked investment tip after another. His producer could do a bit of soul-searching too. ""We dont do gotcha journalism here"" she assures one potential interview subject. ""Hell we dont do journalism period."" But how did she get to this point? And how complicit are she and Gates in this financial disaster and how many others have they enabled? Instead of really going there though ""Money Monster"" hesitates - and then turns Gates and his crew into heroes by letting them do a last-minute (and highly improbable) bit of investigative journalism on the fly on live TV from a remote location complete with clips and graphics. Except Gates and his TV-tabloid kind arent heroes and Clooney - whose dad was a broadcaster and who directed the terrific journalism tribute ""Good Night and Good Luck"" - knows that. Or at least he used to. These hacks are the media turned mediocre a bunch of shills and sell-outs. The film shouldnt forgive them so easily. Clooney who produced ""Money Monster"" is a genuinely smart man with a strong commitment to social issues. (Hes also a genuine matinee idol who holds the screen every time Foster turns the camera on him.) So why does ""Money Monster"" go relatively easy on these high-paid journos? Perhaps because its stars have their own conflict of interest. MORE A few words with Jodie Foster Look for example at the recent ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" another topical movie Clooney produced. It was meant to take on our corrupt political-consultancy culture. But then it cast Clooney pal Sandra Bullock and began pulling its punches to make her character likable (or at least likeable enough). Because shes a movie star. As is Clooney. As is Roberts. Which means any movie theyre in is going to focus on them making them sympathetic taking their side over any supporting characters grievance. Every story is always all about them. Theyre the ones who matter. Because in the end Hollywood only likes the idea of sticking up for the little guy as long as it doesnt take time away from the big star. And its only going to rail against the power structure if it can keep its own celebrity system safely in place. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and sexual situations.

Barnum type who snazzes up his daily stock picks with sound effects silly props (boxing gloves top hats stuffed parrots) and backup dancers in gold lame hot pants. His long-suffering producer Patty (Julia Roberts) provides adult supervision and nominally controls the chaos; shes also the first to notice the young guy who wanders on set in the midst of a live taping looking like a lost gaffer or Seamless delivery guy. His name is Kyle and hes not dropping off pad thai; hes got a loaded gun and two suicide vests. One is for the man hes decided did him wrong (that would be Lee) by recommending Ibis Clear Capital a ""sure-thing"" stock that drained his meager life savings when it suddenly and inexplicably plummeted and the other is for Ibis CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) who is scheduled to appear on that days show. In the tense nearly real-time standoff that follows we learn what drives Kyle (played with admirable intensity and a slightly misguided outer-borough accent by British actor Jack OConnell) Lee and to a lesser extent Patty. The resolution of the scripts central mystery feels rushed and its message--Wall Street bad common man good--isnt exactly nuanced. (The Big Short offered a far fresher take on American corporate malfeasance last year.) Still as a solid B-movie elevated by A-list talent and pushed along by a brisk running time--its only 98 minutes--Money has its own rewards.

A lot happens in a relatively short amount of time (the movie is 98 minutes long) and there is little wasted effort. The film whirs along with such entertaining efficiency that you may not realize that by the end it has shifted its blame in a manner that does not exactly betray a lack of courage in its convictions but a willingness to let some of the bad guys off the hook.George Clooney stars as Lee Gates in the thriller ""Money Monster.""

Reality TV has become so sordid that frankly its not as shocking a notion as it once was but its still pretty remarkable. A film like this locked largely in one place (though the search for Camby goes all over the world) is heavily dependent upon the actors and they are all good. Clooney an underrated actor (hes too often thought of simply as a celebrity) oozes charisma as a general thing; its not much of a stretch to add a layer of smugness on top of that. OConnell is one of the best actors working today (see ""Starred Up"" please).AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceUltimately however the women carry the film. Balfe is really good as a loyal soldier contemplating doing the right thing. And Roberts is terrific as Fenn who is literally in Fosters words producing their survival. I say this as someone who often finds Roberts annoying too eager to overwhelm the film shes in (and the other actors in the process). Here she dials that down and its a perfect fit.

Just a guy who walks past the security guards onto the set of a live TV show. Just a guy who pulls out a gun and forces the host to strap on a suicide vest. Thats how the taut and timely Money Monster begins with just a guy - a seriously disgruntled guy by the name of Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) - confronting Lee Gates (George Clooney) the self-described ""Wizard of Wall Street"" and host of the stock-tips circus act that gives the movie its name. ""Whos that guy on camera 2?"" asks Lees longtime producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) watching on a monitor as the stranger edges onto the set. For the next 90-plus minutes Lee and Patty get to know Kyle pretty well as their show is hijacked - and as an audience of millions tunes in to gawk at what could be a bloodbath. Whatever the outcome one things for sure The ratings are going to kill. Directed with cool dexterity by Jodie Foster this rage-against-the-one-percenters thriller plays like a cross between The Big Short and Network. Unfolding in real time Money Monster is smart and gripping - at least until the third act when everyone exits the midtown Manhattan TV studio for a march down to Wall Street and some high-tech trading hugger-mugger. As Lee and Kyle leave the building surrounded by NYPD hostage response cops and a horde of onlookers a certain amount of credulity leaves the building with them. Foster was one of the stars in a similar setup 10 years ago - in Inside Man with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen directed by Spike Lee. In Money Monster the Oscar-winning actress takes her fourth turn behind the cameras eliciting terrific work from her three leads. Clooneys the arrogant biz-world prognosticator mocking the CEOs touting IPOs and acting like a clown while hes doing so. He boogies with blinged-out chorus girls he pounds a big red prop buzzer but his cocky bluster turns to sniveling dread when Kyle shows up with his armaments and his angst. OConnell the British actor who starred in Angelina Jolies grueling Olympic hero/POW drama Unbroken plays the angry New Yorker with trip-wire palpability. Kyle invested his lifes savings in stocks for a company that Lee had guaranteed as a sure thing. Then the stock tanked. Kyle wants restitution on a major scale. If he doesnt get it Lee gets retribution instead. Watching from the control booth Roberts Patty is as much in control as anyone can be given the circumstances. Hers is not an easy acting job Wearing a headset wheeling in a chair behind a bank of monitors barking orders to the crew Roberts doesnt get a fancy wardrobe a dreamy romantic scene or a rollicking action number for that matter. With the exception of a few minutes at the front and back of Money Monster the actress and Clooney never even share the same physical space. But shes inside her costars head talking to his Lee via an earpiece that Kyle remains unaware of. Even if Money Monster ultimately gets held hostage by its plot intricacies Clooney Roberts OConnell and Foster do their jobs. Its a movie worth investing in. sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 Published May 12 2016 -- 645 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > Game of Thrones Emmy chances next year?

Daily Edition Login to download Money Monster Cannes Review 345 AM PDT 5/12/2016 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An ordinary film about an extraordinary situation. TWITTER 5/13/2016 George Clooney and Julia Roberts headline Jodie Fosters thriller about a finance pundit taken hostage while on the air. Big money Wall Street gets bashed by big money Hollywood in Money Monster a timely moderately engaging real-time thriller about a live-TV hostage drama that unfortunately lacks any suspense whatsoever. George Clooney romps gleefully as a Jim Cramer-like broadcast financial commentator until a disaffected young intruder straps an explosive vest on him forcing Julia Roberts as the shows producer to try to save the day while the whole country watches. Opening Friday in the wake of its non-competing Cannes Film Festival premiere the Sony release looks to do moderate business with older audiences amid a field of younger-skewing May openings. One of the scarier impressions created by Jodie Fosters peppy upright film is that more people may take their financial advice from a guy like Clooneys cynical clown-like Lee Gates -- who issues glib pronouncements on the market while enacting pranks and showing clips from monster and horror films -- than from more sober-minded analysts. Too rich himself to even care anymore Gates has made finance into just one more branch of the entertainment industry where any misguided predictions can just be tossed aside and forgotten like yesterdays bad joke. Unfortunately for him this time a fan who has taken his advice too much to heart decides to exact revenge. Working-class stiff Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) has lost all his money -- 60000 -- based on Gates enthusiasm for an outfit called Ibis Clear Capital whose stock has just tanked overnight. About 10 minutes into the film Kyle manages to slip into the studio and suddenly has Gates looking like an ISIS captive ready to be blown up in front of a worldwide audience if Kyle doesnt like what comes out of the older mans mouth. Much better to be victimized by Ibis than ISIS the TV pundit might have quipped. The unsteady Gates has an advantage in being equipped with a virtually invisible earpiece which allows producer Patty Fenn (Roberts) to feed him instructions and advice on what to say and how to behave. At first of course they have to play ball with Kyle to figure out what he really wants and how he reacts. As he seismically conveyed in the British prison drama Starred Up three years back OConnell is great at conveying bottled-up anger as well as its shocking release. Part of the problem in the script by Jamie Linden Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf is that Kyle explodes at the beginning and having shot the works soon lets his anger subside. By the final stretch he has very little to say at all leaving it to the rich and famous to sort things out. Although the virtually real-time format is maintained (there would seem to be a bit of cheating here and there given the variety of locations and time zones introduced) the story fans out as Patty bears down by phone on Ibis communications director Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) whose job it is to protect the reputation of her jet-setting CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) but whose official stories about the boss soon crumble as his chronic lying becomes irrefutable. The real-time conceit is ready-made to serve the cause of suspense and it should be remembered that Clooney has shown a rare predilection among contemporary artists for the format having done live broadcasts of both E.R. and Fail Safe for television. Unfortunately as a director Foster shows no knack or instinct for building tension; her style is strictly presentational brisk and efficient but with no sly trickery desire to surprise or to forge technique that suggests an imaginative approach to storytelling. Theres nothing subversive or disquieting in the imagery or editing which is to say that she learned little about creating suspense from working with the likes of Scorsese Demme and Fincher. Money Monster therefore emerges as a pretty ordinary film about an extraordinary predicament one in which the writers contrived to bring all the principals together down on Wall Street. The wrap-up and the way it too easily employs both comeuppance and tragedy is rather too neat for real life and theres a feel-good aspect to it as well in the way the sneaky morals-free culprit is forced to be held to account in the most public and embarrassing way possible. Its a fantasy in other words. While pointed at times the script should have been a couple of notches wittier and more caustic than it is and a few vivid character actors surrounding the big stars would have been welcome as well -- the sort of things that the old Hollywood provided as a matter of course. Clooney doesnt play a doofus here as he has done repeatedly for the Coen brothers but his Lee Gates could be a smarter more successful but jaded second cousin to those rascals. Attached to a phone or microphone most of the time Roberts has little to play other than on-point efficiency through most of the tight running time and her best scenes involve her exchanges with the fellow female executive intriguingly played by Balfe (intriguing in that the actress makes you aware that theres much more to her character than meets the eye or that is touched upon in the script). West has no trouble letting the audience feel all the scorn it can summon for the heedlessly amoral and criminal big-money guy by which time poor working-class Kyle has been frustratingly sidelined in favor of the fat cats.

Popular cable TV personality and financial guru Lee Gates played as a belligerent self-loathing whirlwind by George Clooney is preparing for his Manhattan-based show ""Money Monster"" plainly inspired by Jim Cramers real-life ""Mad Money."" Lees veteran producer Patty Fenn portrayed by Julia Roberts as a wised-up pro under pressure is about to scoot for a job at a rival station; shes had it with Lees last-second script changes the bullying charm the scramble for ratings-friendly guests.A high-flying hedge fund with the vaguely terrorizing name of IBIS Clear Capital -- Dominic West plays its elusive CEO -- is all over the news with sudden losses of nearly a billion dollars due to a wonky trading algorithm and some sort of computer glitch. Result Many many unhappy stockholders. Lees out for some good old-fashioned on-air shaming since he touted IBIS as a cant-miss stock buy. The CEOs in a plane somewhere and cant be reached; the best Patty can do on short notice is the IBIS communications director (Caitriona Balfe of ""Outlander""). RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURIn short order ""Money Monster"" turns into a hijacking crisis. Disguised as a delivery man a disgruntled and now broke investor (Jack OConnell) sneaks onto the soundstage and onto the show itself. Brandishing a pistol he holds Lee hostage slaps an explosives-laden vest on him and threatens to blow up the studio. Lees set becomes a reality-TV exercise in panic suspense and earnest investigative journalism as Lee and Patty and their colleagues burrow on a serious deadline into the real story behind the hedge-fund fiasco. Its all there in the trailer which is to say Far too much of the films second and increasingly preposterous half is also in the trailer. Written by Alan DiFiore Jim Kouf and Jamie Linden the film turns out roughly 65 percent smart and 35 percent silly. I dont need my thrillers to behave like documentaries but after a strong and confidently paced set-up the hostage situation -- which requires a lot of cross-cutting between the studio and the NYPDs attempts to defuse and resolve that situation -- struggles to maintain momentum and credibility.Part of the problem I think is OConnell. The British actor impresses in the right roles (""Unbroken"" the excellent "" 71"") but here hes preoccupied with mastering a generalized outer-borough New York dialect. As written Kyle is less a person than an emblem of working-class resentments feeding ""Money Monsters"" alternatively blunt and soft indictment of global capitalism as currently practiced.All that said ""Money Monster"" never quite messes up completely. Clooney provides the glue. Like director Foster he has a genuine interest in making commercial movies that matter at least a little bit -- movies that engage with questions of media hypocrisy and financial outrages. Fosters direction aided by cinematographer Matthew Libatiques sharp clean light is the most fluid and well-considered of her career. The script is an asset too.

EntertainmentMovies Money Monster a watchable TV hostage crisis with George Clooney Julia Roberts Originally published May 12 2016 at 1200 am Updated May 12 2016 at 1229 pm Movie review of ""Money Monster"" George Clooney plays a TV finance guru taken hostage by one of his bilked viewers -- but the movie doesnt live up to its promising premise. 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic An uneasy mixture of thriller and grim comedy ""Money Monster"" depicts a situation that seems all too possible. A live-television broadcast hosted by hammy finance guru Lee Gates (George Clooney) is interrupted by the arrival of an irate follower of the show named Kyle (Jack OConnell) whos lost everything after following Gates investment advice. He storms onto the set armed and unstable; Lee and the shows longtime producer Patty (Julia Roberts) must talk Kyle down and untangle a vast financial conspiracy in front of millions of viewers. All of this in a tidy 95 minutes sounds promising right? Unfortunately ""Money Monster"" though perfectly competent is one of those movies that promises more than it delivers. In the interest of keeping things tight director Jodie Foster and the screenwriters let the story play out in real time -- which means that we barely know Lee and Patty before Kyle wanders onto the set. The stakes arent high enough -- were not sufficiently invested in their fate -- and the movies blend of suspense wit and melodrama often feels oddly off-balance. Too bad because the idea of Clooney as a smarmy tap-dancing huckster seems like gold. (Literally He dances in a gold top hat in the shows opening and quite decently too. Would somebody please get this man a musical? With Channing Tatum? But I digress.) You watch ""Money Monster"" wishing it were a little better -- its refreshing to see a summer studio movie thats neither a superhero epic nor a sequel and one in which grown-up actors do their jobs. Roberts as Patty has a wry efficiency; this character is long-resigned to the fact that shes not saving the world. (""We dont do gotcha journalism here"" she snaps at a staffer. ""We dont do journalism at all."") OConnell (""Unbroken"") finds something vulnerable in the damaged troubled Kyle and Clooney of course can do fast-talking charm in his sleep (but thankfully doesnt). Ultimately ""Money Monster"" is always watchable -- but forgets to give us a compelling reason to watch.

As an indictment of Wall Street chicanery its largely toothless; as a pure thriller it only quickens the pulse once or twice; as a conspiracy saga its central mystery falls flat.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Yet somehow the film hangs together surprisingly well thanks to on-point performances from George Clooney and Julia Roberts a sprinkle of obtuse humor and Fosters streamlined direction which takes style notes from the likes of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Inside Man"" in the service of a far more lightweight confection. It may not linger long in the memory after credits roll and what multiplex audiences make of the film is anyones guess but in a landscape short on no-frills grown-up entertainment its worth the modest time investment. The film stars Clooney as cable news host Lee Gates. A transparent stand-in for Jim Cramer of CNBCs ""Mad Money"" Lee is a shameless self-promoter who deals out stock tips with the help of hip-hop backup dancers wild costumes and a morning zoo assortment of goofy sound effects. His long-suffering producer Patty Fenn (Roberts) is planning to take a job across town and as the station staff gets ready for the days live taping Lee prepares for a particularly delicate tap-dancing routine. Ibis Clear Capital a company whose stock Lee has been touting for months somehow just lost 800 million of capital through unclear circumstances and the companys Irish corporate communications officer Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) is standing by via satellite with talking points in hand. Any worries she might have of being grilled by Lee on camera are assuaged by Patty who tells her ""We dont do gotcha journalism here. Hell we dont do journalism period."" Foster and editor Matt Chesse deftly capture the controlled chaos of live TV in the early going cutting between the broadcast and the control booth with Patty feeding Lee lines into his earpiece. (The decision to stage the film in an approximation of real-time pays off handsomely.) One gets so caught up in the ins-and-outs of the production that the presence of a hoodied deliveryman in the wings initially goes unnoticed at least until he springs onto the set with a pistol in hand taking the whole soundstage hostage. The interloper is Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) a minimum wage-earning factotum from Queens and with great haste he forces Lee into a bomb vest clutching the dead-mans switch in his hand. Kyle lost his entire savings due to Lees stock advice and he threatens to scorch the whole studio unless Ibis gives him a satisfactory explanation of the ""computer glitch"" that sent its stock price tumbling. The film is at its best in these tense early scenes as Kyle makes his case Lee tries to use his mediagenic charm to talk him down -- generally making things much worse in the process -- and Patty runs triage before her TV producer instincts kick in and she starts moving the cameras around for a better shot. The world watches the standoff on the small screen an NYPD chief (Giancarlo Esposito) strategizes a SWAT raid and Diane desperately tries to locate her boss Ibis jet-setting CEO (Dominic West). As the standoff gets more and more involved an increasing degree of preposterousness seeps into the proceedings and Foster cant keep up the pace she sets at the start. The ultimate resolution is a bit of a bust and the late-game introduction of new plot elements like stoned Icelandic computer hackers feels like something out of a low-budget 90s thriller. (Exactly how the subplot of a Lee underling test-driving a new erectile-dysfunction drug made it past the final cut is a mystery.) Credited to three screenwriters the plot hurtles forward efficiently but the films underlying metaphors are ultimately muddled pulled in too many directions at once. Unlike last years ""The Big Short"" ""Money Monsters"" skewering of the financial industry is too superficial to draw any real blood but it arrives at an unusually relevant historical juncture. With two very different populist voter uprisings lifting the presidential candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump one could see Lee as a fittingly fatuous proxy for the out-of-touch punditocracy that failed to predict them too wrapped up in the inside-baseball shadow plays of finance and politics to realize how profoundly policies and market dips affect real people. But Clooneys performance lifts the character above a mere straw man. Lee is obviously a clown a thrice-divorced shuck-and-jive infotainer who seems as surprised as anyone to learn his advice was ever taken seriously. (Hes introduced while texting on the toilet and Foster gives a nod to his casual sexism when he guilelessly refers to a CCO as ""the PR girl."") In Clooneys hands however hes hardly a villain and as broad as the performance gets the actor smartly underplays its overall arc as this master B.S. artist slowly realizes there are levels of doublespeak and skullduggery that even he cant abide. As the end-of-his-rope hijacker OConnell lays the blustery outer-borough shtick on a bit thick while Roberts holds the screen well despite being confined to a control panel for most of the film. (Given how much of her dialogue is delivered via Lees earpiece hers is almost a voice-over role.) Yet the show is almost stolen entirely by Emily Meade as Kyles pregnant girlfriend brought in by police to attempt an intervention that takes a hilarious left turn. And perhaps thats appropriate a well-played minor character walking away with a well-crafted yet ultimately minor movie.

William Nichols says June 12 2016 at 635 pm This is a very much lackluster movie there is no tension drama or strong storyline but there is something none of the movie critics picked up on. There is a very discernable gender bashing going on where all of the males including the cops (except Clooney who is a liberal Hollywood untouchable) are stupid and all the women very smart and calculating. There is not one male who be labeled admirable except for the black South Africa labour activist who we never hear. Pretty shameless I think but it represents a trend in Hollywood; probably a bit of spite on the part of Jodi Foster who has exceeded her expiry date. Reply Roger Houston says May 13 2016 at 504 am Love Jodi Foster and Julia Roberts but this looks like another bomb for George Clooney oof-ah Reply stevenkovacs says May 12 2016 at 344 pm Love George Julia and Jodie Im so seeing Money Monster Reply cadavra says May 12 2016 at 301 pm ""Live taping?""
