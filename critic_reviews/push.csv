Painterly visuals take precedence over psychology in Turkish auteur Tayfun Pirselimoglus third feature ""Haze"" whose obfuscation extends way beyond its title. A resolutely interior drama -- set in a gray outer suburb of Istanbul -- about how poverty drives people to acts of desperation this is Pirselimoglus toughest pic to date likely to drive all but the most committed auds to their own act of desperation and seek the exit. Hardcore fest dates loom. The helmers previous films (""Innowhereland"" ""Riza"") have been rescued by strong female perfs but ""Haze"" keeps its focus tight on main character Resat (Ruhi Sari) whose vacant stare does little except mirror the bleak concrete burb of Altinsehir in which he lives with his silent chair-ridden mom. For reasons not entirely clear -- dialogue is sparse throughout -- Resat takes a job to kill the wife (Nurcan Ulger) of a slaughterhouse owner Emin (Mehmet Avci) who tells him he doesnt want her to suffer ""because I love her too much."" Pic is striking to look at -- a series of almost monochrome compositions sourced on HD by Ercan Ozkan (""The Storm""). HazeTurkey-Greece ProductionA Zuzi Film (Turkey)/Graal (Greece) production.

But little about Push makes sense. It builds a mythology involving psychics telekinetics and seers - retitled Pushers Movers and Watchers for the dumb among us. Chris Evans is Nick a Mover fleeing the sinister Division who becomes entangled with Dakota Fannings brassy Watcher. Theres a fair amount to enjoy notably Fannings performance and a manic sense of unpredictability. But silliness rules the day plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot this might have worked; as a film its loud confusing and inane.

Wednesday February 4 2009 at 4 a.m. By Aaron Hillis 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not to be mistaken for the acclaimed MoNique Sundance drama director Paul McGuigans harebrained sci-fi thriller about young Americans with extraordinary psychic powers banding together in Hong Kong seems to have been made up as it was being filmed. Its less X-Men and more ""Why man?"" Hero 1 Chris Evans is a second-generation ""mover"" with telekinetic abilities; government baddie and ""pusher"" Djimon Hounsou plants treacherous ideas in other peoples minds; a smugly precocious Dakota Fanning sketches pictures of the future as a ""watcher""; and the rest sound like the drug nicknames that Hunter S. Thompson came up with in his Las Vegas suitcase ""stitches"" ""shadows"" ""bleeders"" ""shifts"" ""sniffs"" and ""wipers."" All that the super-skills offer are ridiculous screenwriting shortcuts (Evans hands out instruction cards to his posse then has his mind erased by a crusty Chinese local to thwart telepathic villains and literally change fate) for a puffed-up plot that would make less sense to explain than to watch. The CGI effects are serviceable if thats your bag but the action has no suspense the setpieces are uninspired (besides all the neon why are they even in Hong Kong?) and the half-baked anti-climactic punchline had me expecting an announcement that Season One kicks off on Fox this fall.

Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning in ""Push."" Photo Summit Entertainment Hirotake Okazaki Movie review Push makes no sense 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Push Science fiction. Starring Chris Evans Dakota Fanning Camille Belle and Djimon Hounsou. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The idea at work in ""Push"" is that there are people of extraordinary telepathic and clairvoyant capacity walking among us and that the government knows who they are. In fact the government goes around catching them trying to harness their abilities for the Defense Department. Theyre given drugs to boost their powers but the drugs almost invariably kill them - you know government waste - so most try to hide from the feds as long as they can. But they cant hide for long because the government has other more cooperative clairvoyants and seers out looking for them. There are many problems with ""Push"" and most are the usual boring things unnecessary plot loops; long dumb musical interludes; a charmless script; and ostentatious action sequences in which the only person excited is the cameraman. But two awful things about ""Push"" are at least interesting The first is the way in which the story is confused. The second is that the story makes no sense. Lets talk first about the confusion. ""Push"" dumps a lot of paranormals on us giving each classification a special nickname. There are ""watchers"" who can tell the future; ""sniffers"" who can track anybody by sniffing an object the person has touched; ""movers"" who are telekinetic; ""bleeders"" who scream so loud they burst peoples blood vessels; ""wipers"" who can erase peoples memories; ""stitchers"" who can heal any ailment; and ""shadows"" who can hide people from sniffers and almost hide them from watchers. Hey wait a second You skipped that last paragraph didnt you? You just couldnt get through it. Well now you understand something about ""Push"" It gives you a lot to keep track of but no incentive to do so. It comes at you like your first chess lesson (a knight does this a rook does that etc.) without providing the opportunity to absorb the information. Incidentally the watchers those who can see the future are the most disappointing class of character. They dont really see the future. They just see how things will turn out if current trends persist. Theyre worse than economists. By the way why is the government pumping its most talented paranormals with instantly fatal brain steroids when in their untouched state these people are incredibly powerful already? They can do anything. An evil opportunistic government wouldnt be that self-defeating. This is why ""Push"" makes no sense. ""Push"" stars Dakota Fanning as a 13-year-old watcher and Chris Evans as a young mover. Fanning is basically playing a little girl whose special talent has forced her to grow up in a hurry and it seems this young actress knows something about that. As for Evans one of these days hes going to make a good movie. Really any year now. Its bound to happen. -- Advisory This movie contains scenes of violence blood and a little girl getting drunk.

"Push shoves too much at the audience - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Push shoves too much at the audience Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Summit Entertainment Dakota Fanning plays Cassie a ""watcher"" on the run from The Division. ABOUT THE MOVIEPush  (out of four)Stars Dakota Fanning Chris Evans Djimon Hounsou Camilla Belle Cliff CurtisDirector Paul McGuiganDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action brief strong language smoking and a scene of teen drinkingRunning time 2 hours 1 minuteOpens today nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Push a supernatural action thriller is jangly jarring and violent. But more disconcerting is watching the sweet-faced Dakota Fanning swear get drunk and pack heat -- in both fists no less. Fanning plays a 13-year-old clairvoyant part of a special class of paranormals whose origins go back to government experiments from 1945. The plan was to use them as surveillance weapons. But the children of these original human weapons arent so willing to comply. They live among us the narration says and they look like us but they have special powers like telekinesis and telepathy. Then there are some whose skills are truly creepy like the family that can shatter glass and pop blood vessels by screeching at the top of their lungs. Yes this is a silly movie that is partially engrossing and plenty convoluted. The categories of paranormals have names such as ""watchers"" (who see the future) and ""shadows"" who use their minds to hide things from ""sniffs"" who can track their quarry like human bloodhounds. ""Movers"" as one might imagine transport objects. What no shakers? If only the ""stitches"" had been comedians who could bend wills with their humor the film might have been more fun. But theyre merely psychic healers. Fanning plays a watcher named Cassie. With her blond hair streaked with pink shorts and knee-high boots she looks like an Olsen twin. Shes gone rogue on the run from The Division which monitors and controls paranormal operatives. Traveling solo across the globe Cassie goes in search of Nick (Chris Evans). They go in search of a mysterious suitcase that The Division represented by a malevolent Djimon Hounsou also seeks. Along the way they encounter Kira (Camilla Belle) who can plant thoughts in peoples brains. The title refers to the act of using special powers but it might as well refer to the jerky movement of the camera. And some of the fights -- which should have earned an R rating -- are enhanced by the shots. Director Paul McGuigan whose Lucky Number Slevin was more clever and fun uses this hyperkinetic approach presumably to enhance this dull story. But he only makes it disorienting.

Lil Fanning plays a girl who can see the future in ""Push"" a grubby cut-price sci-fi thriller. In the flick the sinister government ""Division"" is chasing powerful freaks such as ""pushers"" who can plant any idea in anothers mind (including the idea that he should kill himself a thought that may also occur to anyone who wastes 12 bucks on this flick). MOVIE BLOG The Other Push ""Watchers"" such as the Fanning character can see whats about to happen while ""movers"" such as a Hong Kong refugee (Chris Evans) from the Division can move objects without touching them. The Evans characters girlfriend (Camilla Belle) is a pusher who is also running from such Division spooks as ""sniffs"" who spend lots of time (Im not kidding) smelling toothbrushes for clues. There is also a group of villains whose superpower is to holler loud enough to shatter glass and generally ruin everything. Maybe they should be called ""critics""? All of this futuristic Philip K. Shtick leads to a frantic but meaningless clot of action scenes in which the superpowered face off. These supposed highlights make ""Fantastic Four"" look like ""Seven Samurai."" Several times the movers shakily point guns that wobble through the air as though being guided by puppet strings but how difficult is it to hold and fire a pistol? These guys are super-lazy and I was super-bored. Anyway if one telekinetic tried to attack another wouldnt they just cancel each other out? Not here Whichever one the story wants to win at that moment simply wins without explanation. Fanning whose character is 13 but who sports a thigh-high miniskirt and do-me boots spends the movie rattling off exposition and telling Evans what happens next. Whenever she has a vision of the future she draws a sketch of the scene thats about to occur while mouthing would-be Humphrey Bogart lines like ""You better do something quick because Im getting sick of drawing dead bodies."" Toughness thy name is Dakota Fanning. PUSH ESPuh-leeze. Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity smoking teen drinking). At the Empire the 84th Street the Union Square others.

(Summit Entertainment) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 5 2009 156 PM Humans with psychic abilities fight each other and a secret organization. With Chris Evans Dakota Fanning Djimon Hounsou. Director Paul McGuigan. (201) PG-13 Comic book violence. At area theaters. Just as its getting impossible to tell the superpowered humans without a scorecard along comes ""Push"" to muddy the waters. Ok lets focus So theres an unlimited number of mutants on Earth born with extraordinary abilities but its not ""X-Men"" or ""Heroes."" Theres also several families involved although it isnt ""Fantastic Four""-ish. And everyone does crazy things with their minds. Does the Mentalist know about this? What about the Ghost Whisperer? They ought to since ""Push"" welcomes all psychic powerhouses. The movie -- which feels like a pitch for a TV series -- creates a whole community of cerebral skills.""Movers"" can fling things around just by thinking it; ""watchers"" can see the future; ""pushers"" put ideas into peoples heads etc. A bunch of these handily-nicknamed folk come together for a showdown in Hong Kong when Nick Grant (Chris Evans) a mover in hiding is contacted by the Division a X-Files-like government agency that uses telekinetic humans to locate others of their ilk for use in experimentation. Apparently nations across the globe have been trying to create a race of super-psychics since the 1940s except that every attempt ends in death. Chris is contacted by 13-year-old watcher Cassie (Dakota Fanning) and together they set off to find Kira (Camilla Belle) a pusher whos survived the Divisions nefarious tests and is being hunted by the nasty telepath Carver (Djimon Hounsou). Before countless rooms and buildings are smashed Chris and Cassie meet characters who can heal wounds track suspects by following their scent or burst peoples blood vessels by screaming really loud. That last one is especially relevant as director Paul McDuigan (""Lucky Number Slevin"") amps up the visuals with a hyper-annoying minds-eye effect though there are a few kicky fight sequences involving flying objects and hurtling bodies (guns floating through the air alas look as silly as they ever did). More frequently however theres a lot of psych-speak clunky backstory about a mysterious briefcase and Evans rehearsed nonchalance. Maggie Siff has an eye-catching cameo as a healing femme fatale and Hounsou glowers convincingly but Belle is somehow even worse than she was in ""10000 B.C.."" As for Fanning shes doing a 2009 take on Jodie Fosters Iris in ""Taxi Driver"" only with more innocence and comic-book-thin substance. Fannings watcher is watchable yet the kid-actress extraordinaire is so polished it kind of makes your head explode.

She gives voice to a brave young girl battling spooks in the splendid animated fantasy ""Coraline."" And she plays a brave young girl battling spooks (CIA variety) in ""Push."" Shes batting .500. ""Push"" imagines a world where psychic savants live in hiding from The Division a powerful government agency that wants to convert them into superpowered warriors. They come in a Whitmans Sampler of varieties Movers toss objects around by force of will Sniffers track their prey through space and time by smelling their possessions Pushers force their thoughts into other peoples heads Shifters perform illusions Wipers cause amnesia. If we both had the time I would tell you about Watchers and Shadows and Screamers but you get the drift. Chris Evans in a superhero downgrade from his role as The Fantastic Fours Human Torch plays a Mover lying low in a Hong Kong slum. His command of his powers is unsteady -- he cant even fix a dice game reliably -- so when Fannings clairvoyant Watcher arrives explaining that they are destined to battle The Division together he blows off the spunky little seer. Then The Divisions henchmen strike and the pair recruits a group of paranormal sidekicks to join their cause. The battle becomes a psychic game of Rock Paper Scissors as Screamers beat Movers Pushers defeat Sniffers and so on. There are a couple of crackerjack fight sequences involving floating pistols and telekinetic jiu jitsu but fun parts are trapped in gallons of inert filmmaking like pineapple chunks in Jell-O salad. The movies momentum falters as director Paul McGuigan tries to cram in intricate character histories a complicated story line and huge swaths of Hong Kong location footage. They not only toss in the kitchen sink -- they throw in the whole Home Depot plumbing department. In a ploy to foil The Divisions mind-readers Evans proposes to his allies ""What if nothing we do makes sense?"" A lot of ""Push"" feels like it was created according to that plan. It should give us the willies but its willy-nilly. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Telekinesis thank you very much.A nifty action piece set mostly in Hong Kong and boasting opposing forces of good guys bad guys and shadowy government agents all equipped with paranormal abilities (clairvoyance mind reading the ability to smell stuff really well) Push has a cool sinewy style energy to burn and Dakota Fanning as a knowing 13-year-old who can see into the future.Directed by Paul McGuigan (The Acid House Lucky Number Slevin) from a hopscotching screenplay by David Bourla Push starts with a ""10 years ago"" prologue A dad and his kid are on the run from a squad of G-men led by the humorless Djimon Hounsou. Theyre in a hotel and just before the fatal moment of discovery the father tells his kid Nick ""Someday a girl is going to give you a flower.""Never has such a benign line been delivered with such a sense of dread and distress. Next thing Dad is dead and Nick has skulked off understandably shaken.Cut to the present day and Nick is living in a squalid Hong Kong flat. Hes fluent in Cantonese and trying out his telekinetic powers playing craps - without much success.And then along comes this girl Cassie - Fanning with pink streaks in her hair and a sketchbook where she draws her visions of events yet to be. And she offers Nick yes a flower. Push is off and running.There are similarities style-wise and plot-wise to the Bourne movies here The action is fast and frenetic the camera jumps and swoops capturing the teeming tumultuous buzz of a faraway metropolis. And memory erasure or the implanting of false memories is key.So when Nick a ""mover"" and Cassie a ""watcher"" meet up with Kira (Camilla Belle looking like a Japanese anime heroine) a ""pusher"" who can worm her way into other peoples minds influencing their actions by planting thoughts and memories all heck breaks loose. The government wants Kira back in the fold while Nick and Cassie try to thwart the secret agencys sinister plan to use a ""psychic steroid"" to exploit their paranormal powers.Add a gang of Hong Kong ""bleeders"" - tattooed thugs who scream at such high decibels that they can shatter glass and pop blood vessels. And then add a slinky Chinese femme fatale (ERs Ming-Na Wen) a ""shift"" who can transform the appearance of objects and a ""stitch"" a kind of super-powered chiropractor and youve got the makings of a trippy nonstop action fest with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes.Push zooms along pausing for the briefest of romantic interludes between Evans and Belle and for the snappy back-talk and moody meditations of Fannings Cassie. Remember Natalie Portman as the kid in Luc Bessons The Professional? Fanning shows a similar sophistication and self-awareness in the tiny tremulous frame of a young teen.The film loses some of its inventiveness and its momentum with a finale set atop an under-construction skyscraper. Glass goes shattering stunt-doubles go somersaulting and bullets ricochet around and around - theres got to be a smarter more satisfying way to wrap these things up. Perhaps if theres a sequel Cassie can peer ahead to Hollywood 2020 and see how its being done.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Starring Chris Evans Dakota Fanning Camilla Belle Djimon Hounsou Director Paul McGuigan Running time 151  Editorial Review ""Push"" pulls into the multiplexes without much baggage. A thriller about expatriates with paranormal powers the movie doesnt trail an entrenched superhero franchise that has been reheated every year to offend the fanboys. Its cast writer and director are undistinguished. This is a good thing.The premise -- a hide-and-seek game between superhumans and a government agency in Hong Kong -- is old but the execution is fresh earnest and inoffensive. Its a gussied-up knockoff of a Scorsese mob movie shellacked with an opaque sheen of Clancy-style espionage stir-fried with a bit of Tarantino Robert Rodriguez and the Wachowski brothers. Its the perfect brain vacation for those overtaxed by Oscar-nominated movies.Watertight storytelling isnt the point. ""Push"" seems to know what its doing so we surrender to it and are rewarded with clever plot twists a hip soundtrack and the unlikely-but-effective teaming of 27-year-old Chris Evans and 14-year-old Dakota Fanning.Fanning sheds her porcelain-doll image (""War of the Worlds"" ""Charlottes Web"") by playing Cassie a grungy-haired boot-wearing Watcher or someone with the ability to divine and then sketch images from the future. Using that skill she knows she must search out and team with a Mover named Nick whos hiding from a U.S. government agency called the Division. Together Cassie and Nick must snatch a briefcase from the Division or face certain death according to Cassies drawings of the future.It doesnt matter whats inside the sought-after briefcase. What matters is that everyone wants it and everyone has special powers that allow for double crosses Catch-22s shortcuts and other plot acrobatics.As fantastical as all that sounds the pleasure of ""Push"" comes from its glamorized grit its no-nonsense pacing and the committed performances of the actors roughhousing in the gray area between heroism and villainy. Its pure popcorn popped fresh doused in butter and sprinkled with soy sauce.-- Dan Zak (Feb. 6 2009)Contains violence brief strong language smoking and a scene of teen drinking.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As the gritty urban science-fiction adventure Push begins co-star Dakota Fanning walks the audience through a dossiers worth of backstory and explanation about the films good guys and bad guys including their origins and their various psychic powers. Its all profoundly unnecessary given that everything she says is obvious The bad guys are steely-eyed psychic Djimon Hounsou and his band of glowering humorless government killers who start the movie by murdering a man in front of his son and spend most of it smashing everything in sight to get at escaped experimental-drug test subject Camilla Belle. The good guys are the scruffy desperate outcasts--telekinetic Chris Evans and precognitive Fanning among them--who want to protect Belle and bring down the oppressive psychic-controlling regime called Division. Since the plot is a by-the-book empire-vs.-rebels concoction the powers are explained again as theyre used and the flavor mostly comes from the way director Paul McGuigan actually has this latest Heroes descendent play out why is the primer necessary? Especially since the films best moments often come when someone reveals an ability or agenda that hasnt already been spelled out in detail? The opening core-dump is symptomatic of Pushs diffuse focus McGuigan seems to want to merge arthouse fare with breathless action movies like Jumper and the Night Watch series. The subject matter is propulsive adolescent fun all the way with a pop sensibility some nifty costume and set design and a lot of special-effects-powered showdowns--but the execution reaches for a broader audience one so unfamiliar with the genre tropes that it needs the assiduous extra explanation plus time to ponder each new development. The resultant moderate pacing has its appeal; it turns Push into an ambling broody concoction along the lines of Strange Days. At times a more aggressive editor would help immensely. At others Push explores its brutish future Hong Kong with a patience and sense of milieu that seems cribbed more from Wong Kar-wai than Doug Liman. And given the familiarity of the material and the generally acceptable-to-lousy acting from the third-string cast (though Fanning is a surprisingly soulful coltish exception) that moody tone is a lot of what Push has going for it. Superhero fans will likely be into Push just for the cool-factor of watching embattled heroes and villains in a tense war of wits wills and skills. That broader audience is less likely to come along for the ride but this particular gateway drug at least has ambition and brains going for it as well as the usual spastic style.

"Humans with superpowers propel Push - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Push Humans with superpowers propel Push Chris Evans (left) and Dakota Fanning star in Push. (Hirotake Okazaki) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 6 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Push"" is that rare humans-with-superpowers movie where the powers are contagious. It made me feel psychic.Suddenly I found myself able to predict what Dakota Fanning would say next where Chris Evans would put his hands what Camilla Belles face might do. OK that last one doesnt make me psychic since Belle doesnt express much. Her pretty motionless face suggests a statue in a coma. And the cameras insistence on lingering upon it for what feels like minutes at a time is just one sign that this flaccid bid for franchisehood suffers from woeful judgment.The film doesnt hail from a comic-book series or graphic novel but from a screenwriter (David Bourla) whose imagination seems full of such things. Its ""Heroes The Movie"" minus the energy. Like that series as well as ""Jumper"" last years teleportation slog ""Push"" tries to create its own universe of superhumans - mind-readers telekinetics supersonic screamers and more - turned into warring factions. Not much of it makes sense. The rest isnt terribly interesting.The opening minutes require Fanning to narrate a hectic explanation of how these superhumans came to be Nazi experiments psychological warfare modern scientists who want them for killer weapons and so on. Fanning fails to explain why most of the action unfolds in Hong Kong.The cynical reasoning is that a big Asian locale would goose the movies international box office. Mostly though Hong Kong is just an elaborate backdrop in which people run through restaurants outdoor markets pleasure palaces and high-rise construction sites looking for a briefcase containing a single syringe. Once injected its contents will create super-superhumans.Fanning is what the film calls a Watcher. Evans is a Mover. Belle is a Pusher. An underused Cliff Curtis is a Shifter. There are also Stitches Shadows Wipers and Bleeders but alas no Writers or Filmmakers to speak of. Director Paul McGuigan sends his camera flying in every possible direction slowing occasionally to stare at Fannings bare legs scantly covered by combat boots and a micro-mini (her characters repeated instance that she looks 14 sounds distressingly defensive). Camerawork cant give rhythm to a narrative. Only a storyteller can. But the filmmakers dont seem to know what story theyre telling. ""Push"" feels made up on the spot - and not in a spontaneous manner but derivatively and self-consciously.At the very least a movie like this requires coherence to stay afloat. Barring that it needs a star to distract us. The original ""Superman"" had Gene Hackman. ""X-Men"" had Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman. ""Iron Man"" had Robert Downey Jr. Here Djimon Hounsou as a stylish supervillain wears a suit and sunglasses and lets the special effects department dilate his pupils.

Johnson / Summit Entertainment Youre already talking about Dakota Fanning. Word round town is shes been cast as punishing pint-sized vampire Jane in the ""Twilight"" sequel ""New Moon."" And she pulls off creepy quite nicely. Those unconvinced can check her out in the horror film ""Push"" in which she plays a 13-year-old clairvoyant on the run. (Friday) Youre already talking about Dakota Fanning. Word round town is shes been cast as punishing pint-sized vampire Jane in the ""Twilight"" sequel ""New Moon."" And she pulls off creepy quite nicely. Those unconvinced can check her out in the horror film ""Push"" in which she plays a 13-year-old clairvoyant on the run. (Friday) (John P. Johnson / Summit Entertainment) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Dakota Fanning plays her first-ever drunk scene in Push a new comic-book-inspired thriller about mind-readers and mind-benders people with telekinetic powers given to them by the government in some demented effort to create walking talking human weapons.Its an ambitious attempt to shove the whole of a fairly complex comic book universe into a single messy and garish movie. Its out there even if it is only a confusing mash-up of every movie or TV show youve ever seen about telekinesis -- well except for Firestarter. But back to Ms. Fannings woozy boozy moment. She plays Cassie a 13-year-old ""watcher"" somebody who can see the future and sketch it out on her note pad. Her mom once told her that shed see ""clearer"" if she had a few belts. So Cassie does and Fanning takes another giant stagger to leaving her child-actress screen persona behind.Cassie shows up at the Hong Kong door of a ""mover"" played by Chris Evans. Hes been expecting her. His dad a watcher told him to look for her 10 years ago. And here she is perky punky and ready to bring down ""The Division"" the agency that created all these ""special people"" such as ""sniffs"" (who can smell every place youve used an object and thus track you) ""bleeders"" (who scream until you bleed) ""shifters"" ""wipes"" and so on.Then there are the ""pushers"" who can shove a thought into your head convince you to kill yourself or alter your memory. One of them Kira (Camilla Belle) has escaped. And shes bringing a magic syringe to Hong Kong where people will die in an effort to shape the future that many of them already have seen.The race is on to get to Kira and the syringe full of telekinesis juice that will turn those who take it (and survive) into super weapons. ""Special"" Chinese agents including the lollipop-sucking watcher ""pop"" girl are on the trail. But so is The Division led by an evil-eyed Djimon Hounsou.Fanning is properly plucky Evans makes a passable if uncompelling action hero Hounsou isnt really menacing enough to pull off the villain part and Belle is all bangs and blandness. Director Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin) -- though practiced at juggling lots of decent actors in a huge number of roles  wastes a lot of talented people here. Maggie Siff (Mad Men) Ming Na (The Joy Luck Club) Cliff Curtis (Sunshine) and others play ""special"" people with other talents and gamble on roles that might have some sort of staying power in the unlikely event this becomes a franchise.Unlikely? Anybody not familiar with the comics may be a little confused by all the differing flavors of telekinetic folk. The odd snappy line doesnt make up for a generally heartless script. ""You lose a bet with your hairdresser?""But the telekinetic gunfights are amusing (guns floating in the air) for those who go for that sort of thing.My prognostication? Push will be pushed out of theaters and out of minds by Fannings 15th birthday (Feb. 23.).

There in neon shadows some folks born with telekinetic powers face off against shady government types who want to harness those powers to build an army of I dont know psychic spoon benders. Evans skill as a Mover means he can hurl stuff through the power of thought. But the most woo-hoo-mind-blowing of all is Camilla Belle as a Pusher who can plant ideas in a subjects head. The idea Im getting is that Id prefer Wolverine and Storm to do the hurling and mind-blowing in X-Men.

""Push"" has no pull. A confused jumble of parts in search of a whole the film plays like a mix-tape sample of scenes from ""Heroes"" ""Fringe"" ""Alias"" and ""The X-Files"" as it follows good guys gifted with paranormal powers trying to stave off bad guys with the same powers to create a U.S. super army. Director Paul McGuigan muscularly uses David Bourlas impenetrable screenplay to turn Hong Kong into his own plaything with enough energy to power solid worldwide opening week numbers and plenty left over for vid futures. A prologue set 10 years ago delves into the fate of a ""mover"" young Nick Gant (Chris Evans) -- one of several types of people who were guinea pigs in government experiments to use paranormal skills (seeing the future controlling thoughts or in Nicks case moving objects) for military uses. After witnessing his fathers death at the hands of Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) a powerful ""pusher"" (thought controller) in the black-ops unit known as Division Nick goes into hiding in Hong Kong. As a sure sign that Bourlas script needed some tidying a messy voiceover during the credits by 13-year-old Cassie (Dakota Fanning) has been inserted to try to explain the background of the myriad players with psychic powers. (Hint to Summit Entertainment Provide auds with a whos-who program as they enter cinemas.) After Kira (Camilla Belle) a promising pusher escapes Division labs with a syringe containing a steroid meant to enhance psychic powers for the army Carver envisions the action shifts to a teeming Hong Kong. McGuigan clearly wants to tap into the intense outrageous tone and rhythms of his potent 2000 debut ""Gangster No. 1"" and aspires to turn Hong Kong into a living character of possibly more interest than any of the humans. Cinematographer Peter Sova evincing the overwhelming influence of Chris Doyles lush image-making is a fine co-conspirator with McGuigan. Indeed so successful are helmer and lenser at creating sensual hyperactive and richly textured images that a viewer may wisely want to get lost in the pictures and not worry about tracking the storys nonexistent logic. In short order Nick finds his supposedly untraceable H.K. abode invaded by first two Division agents (Corey Stoll Scott Michael Campbell) and then by Cassie herself a ""watcher"" who scribbles her future vision in a sketchbook. In a role far stranger and more unhinged than her questionable character in ""Hounddog"" Fanning arrives in a miniskirt knee-high boots funky multi-colored hair and tons of attitude spouting ""shit"" ""damn"" and ""screw em"" and for good measure getting wasted. As a bid for a grown-up part the choice could hardly be more disastrous for a young gifted actor who needs to carefully manage her career trajectory. Cassies message to Nick -- find Kira before Carver does or they all die -- sounds simple enough to be the basis for a videogame which ""Push"" more closely resembles by the reel. Nick must come up with a crafty counter-attack and at first his plan sounds inspired Have his allies behave so erratically and illogically that a pusher like Carver cant possibly trace or overpower them. But while this notion provides opportunities for comically bizarre action that would tickle the likes of Terry Gilliam it isnt carried through onscreen. Instead subpar digital effects and willy-nilly fights (none amazingly for the Hong Kong setting including genuine martial arts) consume the third-act action in an unfinished downtown skyscraper. Evans (""Fantastic Four"" ""Cellular"") manages as usual to bring some likeable human qualities to utterly ridiculous material but the other thesps convey little impact. The real star is the city looking fabulously alive and pulsing with human traffic of all sorts. Supporting McGuigan and Sovas lavish visual design are production designer Francois Seguin and costume designers Nina Proctor and Laura Goldsmith.
