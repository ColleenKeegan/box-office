Bert and Ernie welcome everybody; Elmo wakes up in polka dot pajamas in his own adorable little-childs bedroom and sings a tribute to his comforting blue blanket; Elmo spills orange juice on his blanket; Elmo goes to the laundromat to wash it and a lot of people and Muppets from Sesame Street are there. The Henson magic is at work. The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland stays great right through the scene in which Elmo chases his blanket accidentally whisked away by a passing Muppet Rollerblader down the street and tells the gathered crowd to move on. Nothing to see here he tells the onlookers. Just a little monster trying to get his blanket back. But then Elmo descends into Oscar the Grouchs trashcan home and through a colorful spiraling magic tunnel into Grouchland and much too much of the warm fuzziness disappears. Sure his line upon arrival Elmo doesnt think hes in Sesame Street anymore is nice for the adults (there are Titanic and Gone With the Wind references too) but after that most of the jokes are about the joys of grossness (theres a car mess instead of a car wash and the most popular ice cream flavor is anchovy swirl). Yes small children love dirt but this magical land just looks depressing. And yes Oscar is a Sesame Street favorite but one grouch goes a long way; here we have an alternative universe of them. Elmos quest is the faraway hilltop castle of Huxley (Mandy Patinkin) who has come into possession of the blanket and wont give it back. Huxleys problem of course is that he hasnt yet learned to share. Mr. Patinkin wearing extra eyebrows is just right as the villain enjoying playtime as much as any child. Which one of you dares to question my evil ways? he says to his terrified underlings at one point. Vanessa Williams as the Queen of Trash looks beautiful but doesnt fare as well comically. The film offers lessons about cooperation perseverance and transformation including but not restricted to growing up (Ive got what it takes says a caterpillar explaining that hes a butterfly-to-be right here inside) and theyre well handled. But the somewhat complicated plot may disappoint or confuse some tiny Elmo fans. Its a good thing that Bert and Ernie turn up on screen periodically to explain reiterate and reassure. THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND Directed by Gary Halvorson; written by Joseph Mazzarino and Mitchell Kriegman; director of photography Alan Caso; edited by Alan Baumgarten; production designer Alan Cassie; produced by Alex Rockwell and Marjorie Kalins; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time 90 minutes. This film is rated G. WITH Vanessa Williams (Queen of Trash) and Mandy Patinkin (Huxley). Voices of Kevin Clash (Elmo) Carroll Spinney (Big Bird/ Oscar the Grouch) Martin P. Robinson (Telly Monster) Frank Oz (Bert/Grover/Cookie Monster) Fran Brill (Zoe) Steve Whitmire (Ernie) Jerry Nelson (Count von Count) and Stephanie DAbruzzo (Grizzy).

Preschoolers will be tickled by ""The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland"" an excessively winsome comedy aimed at little ones who might find Barney the Purple Dinosaur too intimidating. But this latest Muppet movie -- only the second after 1985s ""Follow That Bird"" to showcase the ""Sesame Street"" menagerie -- is too tepid to interest anyone old enough to operate a TV remote control. Even so theres a silver lining for the folks at Jim Henson Pictures After a brief theatrical run ""Elmo"" will doubtless generate brisk video sales enjoying a long afterlife as an electronic babysitter. Tissue-thin plot focuses on an eventful journey taken by Elmo the little red furball voiced by Kevin Clash. Normally a mild-mannered homebody the cute critter is forced to leave his Sesame Street stomping grounds when his beloved blanket is accidentally tossed into the infamous garbage can of Oscar the Grouch (Carol Spinney). Elmo jumps into the can to retrieve his animated blue buddy only to find himself in Oscars messy living room. One thing leads to another a secret passageway opens -- and Elmo along with his blanket is sucked into a swirling tunnel that carries him to Grouchland the yuckiest place in the universe. As Elmo traverses the trashy metropolis -- a city where children order anchovies on their ice cream and women get makeovers at the Ugly Parlor -- he runs afoul of Huxley (Mandy Patinkin) a bombastic bushy-browed bad guy whose selfishness has no bounds. He claims Elmos blanket as his own then flies back to his fortress in his giant flying machine. Not surprisingly Elmo follows -- and is in turn followed by Big Bird Oscar and various other denizens of Sesame Street. Working from a script by Mitchell Kriegman and Joseph Mazzarino director Gary Halvorson -- a TV vet making his feature debut -- somehow manages to make pic seem at once frenetic and soporific. There is a great deal of activity -- singing dancing wallowing in garbage learning of life lessons -- but absolutely nothing is allowed to get out of hand. Indeed each time a modest amount of suspense is generated the pic stops dead in its tracks so the affable Bert and Ernie can appear onscreen to tell the audience that theres nothing to worry about everything will turn out OK. ""Elmo in Grouchland"" is very much an audience-participation pic -- characters repeatedly address the camera and share their feelings or ask for encouragement. And just to make sure the target audience knows how to respond the pic comes equipped with the equivalent of a sitcom laughtrack. Unseen children laugh cheer clap and sing along. How sweet. Patinkin who looks and sounds as though hes channeling the spirit of Anthony Newley gives a zestfully hammy -- but of course not very frightening -- performance. And Vanessa Williams is an exceptionally radiant Queen of Trash while warbling one of the pics many aggressively cheery and instantly forgettable songs. Other human stars including ""Sesame Street"" regulars fail to register much impact. Standout among the new Muppet puppets is Bug the Bug (Joseph Mazzarino) Huxleys loyal but ineffective assistant. Elmo Big Bird and the other vet ""Sesame Street"" puppets go through their familiar paces with kid-friendly charm. Tech values are appropriately garish and colorful.

Starring Muppet characters Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Williams. Directed by Gary Halvorson. (G. 77 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Gotta love Elmo. In his latest big screen outing the famed Muppet of ""Sesame Street"" loses his precious blanket the one he promised he would always hug. ""Sesame Street"" fans -- and who isnt? -- will absolutely delight in ""The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland"" opening today at Bay Area theaters. It is full of that wonderful junky clunky huggable smartness that has made ""Sesame Street"" an enduring phenomenon. Its rated G and its only 77 minutes long. The innocent Elmo (Kevin Clash) is beside himself after his best friend Zoe (Fran Brill) more or less causes him to lose his blue blankie. An in-line skater inadvertently gets it wrapped around his head and sends it flying toward Oscar who sneezes on it and throws it in a trash can. In a deft mix of Muppet wackiness and live action the innocent Elmo dives into the trash can and begins a rollicking adventure into the yucky stinky world of Grouchland. Its a vast garbage dump ruled by a greedy guy named Huxley who claims ownership of everything including kids blankets. Huxley is played with maniacal good cheer by Mandy Patinkin and his nutty performance is certainly a major reason to see the film. Patinkins fun with the role is infectious -- his energetic blend of villainy and clownishness is truly wonderful never too scary for little kids. And he sings one of the films several songs (some of them a bit too dense). Vanessa Williams has an outlandish turn as the Queen of Trash and she also sings. Elmo meets all kinds of goofy characters in Grouchland while his friends from the Street try to help him out. The film a first feature by co-producers Jim Henson Pictures and the Childrens Television Workshop includes appearances by all the ""Sesame Street"" superstars -- from Big Bird to Grover and Cookie Monster. Bert and Ernie play narrators who frequently stop the action to comment on the movie. This one is fun. ..
