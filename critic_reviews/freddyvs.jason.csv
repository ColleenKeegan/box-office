Comments Freddy vs. Jason This monster mash should satisfy fans of the Friday the 13th/A Nightmare on Elm Street franchises. Forgotten by his hometown dream demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) revives mad slasher Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Elm Street but then a turf dispute leads to a gruesome showdown. At its best when the monsters are on-screen--with a cackling Englund addressing the camera and the massive Kirzinger managing some pathos behind his blood-spattered hockey mask--this chiller by Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) loses energy when it shifts to the dumb teen protagonists and the script faithfully wallows in cliches so ridiculous they border on Scary Movie territory.

Jason 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Freddy Vs. Jason Horror. Starring Robert Englund Ken Kirzinger and Monica Keena. Directed by Ronny Yu. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two dead horror franchises and two one-note jokes combine their burnt-out story lines and collective myths in ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" and the result is a horror movie thats better than it has any right to be. Its not scary. The Jason (""Friday the 13th"") and the Freddy Krueger (""Nightmare on Elm Street"") series were limp self-parodies long before they went dormant. But something in the combination of the two villains wakes things up. The presence of Freddy liberates this Jason entry from the monotony of a guy lumbering about with a ski mask and a sword while the presence of Jason liberates this Freddy film from the monotony of the usual endless dream sequences. The film also invites audiences to decide whether they prefer the silence and incisiveness of Jason or the nonstop prattle and irrepressible personality of Freddy. I spent the 80s hating both these characters but as often happens on election night faced with a choice I found myself pulling for one side. Freddy looks too much like a decomposed Lyndon Johnson -- hes hard on the eyes. Plus hes too fancy in his methods. Freddy is horror as beach drink the kind in an ornate glass with a paper umbrella sticking out of it. Jason is horror straight up. Count me as a Jason man. The movie devises a graceful enough way of getting the two villains into the same movie. Freddy a supernatural being whose power derives from terror has become a forgotten figure. To bring his name back into public consciousness he invades the dreams of Jason and persuades him to slaughter some young people on Elm Street -- the sight of Freddys notorious crimes. Like a good publicist Jason does exactly that and soon everyones talking about Freddy and worrying about him and thus Freddy regains his power. Specifically his power is to invade peoples dreams and kill them so thoroughly that they remain dead in the waking world. So its the worst of times and the absolute worst of times and the movie becomes a tale of two rampages. Freddy is killing people in their sleep and Jasons killing them awake and soon the town isnt big enough for both of them (and of course no one considers moving). The horror villains enter onto a collision course heading toward a final confrontation between evil and evil. Put your money on evil. ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" follows the usual pattern of 80s horror movies in that people are almost invariably killed immediately after doing something obnoxious. A character could have returned just last month from relief work in Calcutta but the moment the person says the f-word to someone or is rude to a parent or slights a boyfriend or girlfriend -- thats when Jason shows up. As in the 80s the sexually active characters are slaughtered while only a female virgin Lori (Monica Keena) stands half a chance against the fiends. The movie is anti-sex but its really anti-woman and although theres a playfulness under the surface misogyny get under the playfulness and theres yet more misogyny. Freddy is a child killer specifically of little girls and most of his snappy patter is sexual in nature and directed at women. Sure hes the bad guy but hes a bad guy whose dialogue is intended to incite recognition and laughter. Director Ronny Yu -- who gave us the delightful and ridiculous ""Bride of Chucky"" -- keeps it as light as possible. In one scene Jason is set on fire and walks through a field impervious creating a path of flame behind him. He proceeds to an outdoor party where he cuts a swath through a gathering of teenagers. Its all tongue in cheek not quite crossing the border into the straight comedy of ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" but coming close. As in most horror films its in the resolution that the movie bogs down but it never quite becomes leaden. Considering what the filmmakers had to work with and the fact that it has all been done before ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" isnt bad. And sometimes not bad is almost good. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations and extreme violence.

Freddy (Robert Englund) confronts Jason (Ken Kirzinger) in their new cinematic showdown. By James Dittiger New Line Productions/AP Those who count themselves as lovers not fighters might be let down after the movies promising opening a naked babe runs down a pier. After that the script briefly threatens to veer into psychoanalysis once we sense that A Nightmare on Elm Streets Freddy (Robert Englund) is threatened by low self-esteem. With the passage of time he has become as obscure to his hoped-for teen victims as Freddie Prinze Jr. is to life achievement award committees. Review of the movie Freddy vs. Jason ( out of four) Stars Robert Englund Ken Kirzinger Monica Keena Jason Ritter Director Ronny Yu Distributor New Line Rating R for pervasive horror violence/gore gruesome images sexuality drug use and language But hark If this behatted ghoul can coerce Friday the 13ths Jason (Ken Kirzinger) into committing homicidal mayhem at good old 1428 Elm Freddy figures that hell be the one blamed by chatty cops with memories. That will return him to teen nightmares where he can wreak familiar havoc with mind games. Gore ensues and lead Monica Keena (a Dawson Creek alum) screams so loudly and effectively that you fear vocal cord nodules may get her if Freddy doesnt. But as my teen son lamented ""Why did they have to kill the stoner? I liked him."" Indeed Kyle Labine in a smoky daze may have the movies best straight-faced line after witnessing a rampage by the hockey-masked Jason ""That goalie was (mad) about something."" Occasionally the leads halt their teen pursuits and battle each other a kind of high-stakes battle of the bands or maybe something akin to a WWE grudge match. For added showmanship one not-yet victim stands up to Freddy and taunts the perceived size of his manhood. Well a filmmakers gotta do something when a combo franchise is well into double-digit sequels. Truth be told the movie isnt among the worst sequels of this summer. Director Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) brings adequately crisp pacing to a 92-minute body count. And better Freddy vs. Jason than Freddy vs. Gigli right? At least these guys arent running for governor of California though just think what they could bring to a national-unity party.

The basic formula of iconic supernatural beings slaughtering plucky teenagers continues with even more graphic violence. Film is sure to draw a large initial audience. Jasons back and Freddys got him Such is the basic hook of this hybrid of the two most successful horror franchises of the 80s -- ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Its more marketing concept than aesthetic and problems inherent in both series -- like the fact the villains are indestructible -- are only multiplied. Still the basic formula of iconic supernatural beings slaughtering plucky teenagers continues with even more graphic violence. The film is sure to draw a large initial audience but its legs may be limited by both its bloody excesses and relative lack of humor. For the record back in 1972 writer-director Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham collaborated on ""The Last House on the Left"" which cleverly swiped the plot of Ingmar Bergmans ""The Virgin Spring"" and turned it into a horror film. After the two went their own ways Cunningham produced and directed the surprise hit ""Friday the 13th"" which introduced the killer Jason Voorhees and spawned nine sequels between 1981 and 2001. Meanwhile Craven introduced Freddy Krueger the razor-fingered haunter of teen dreams in 1984s ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" which in turn led to five sequels (1985-1991) as well as 1994s ""Wes Cravens New Nightmare."" Current film has Freddy (Robert Englund) rotting in hell and unable to insinuate himself back into the dreams of the towns teens; his access has always depended on his victims fear of him but the town authorities and the kids parents have managed to banish him by pretending he doesnt exist and by using drugs to suppress their childrens abilities to dream. ""Being dead was OK"" he tells us ""but being forgotten was a bitch."" When Freddy discovers Jason (Ken Kirzinger) who unlike Freddy can walk in the real world is in hell with him he takes on the form of Jasons mother and orders Jason to go to 1428 Elm St. and murder some kids. Just as Freddy hopes the adults assume Freddys to blame; the kids overhear the parents talking about this Freddy character; and the consequent rumors help reestablish him in the teens consciousness. Later with Freddys return fully enabled his progress in dispatching the local teens is hampered by Jasons presence. The result is the big final battle that spans Freddys dream world and Jasons Crystal Lake stomping ground where they duke it out -- while Lori (Monica Keena) who lives at 1428 Elm and ex-boyfriend Will (Jason Ritter) try to obliterate both of them. While helmer Ronny Yus ""The Bride With White Hair"" (1993) was one of the best Hong Kong films from that industrys greatest period none of Yus American films have been up to that level and ""Freddy vs. Jason"" isnt as inventive as the directors ""Bride of Chucky"" (1998) or ""The 51st State"" (2001). Screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift havent come up with much that is clever here beyond working out the mechanism to bring the two characters together. The Freddy series has generally been much better written -- one could even say more sophisticated -- than the Jason films which just pile one gruesome death on top of another. The most memorable sequence in ""Freddy vs. Jason"" involves a stoner (Kyle Labine) having animated hallucinations of a hookah-smoking caterpillar right out of ""Alice in Wonderland."" Tech credits are excellent. Cinematographer Fred Murphy excels giving the night scenes the misty blue glow that Yu employed in his Hong Kong work. The big fight sequence is also a hybrid effectively combining H.K. wire-work stunts with CGI and traditional Hollywood visual effects. Unfortunately nothing can really generate suspense when two indestructible characters fight to the (impossible) death. New Lines marketing is emphasizing the horror-villain smackdown aspect of the confrontation including the ""mystery"" of who will come out on top Freddy or Jason. But its hard to imagine even diehard fans of either character really caring when the outcome is clearly predetermined. Freddy vs. JasonProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Sean S.

Are we on the side of the horny young idiots who get sliced and diced? Or is the masked/maimed killer the real hero - a kind of homicidal rock star all id and no face? In Freddy vs. Jason were rooting for Freddy Krueger with his perverts leer to drag his fingertip razors through Jason Voorhees hulking torso; for Jason to plunge his machete into Freddys scarecrow sweater; for both of these psycho icons of the 80s to destroy as many kids as possible. In short were rooting for everyone to kill everyone else. There are far less lively ways to spend a night at the movies. Robert Englunds performance as Freddy hasnt lost its delight; it remains a juicy bloodsploitation burlesque that nuthouse cackle bubbling up from beneath his latex burn makeup. In hell Freddy recruits Jason to visit Elm Street and scare up memories of Freddys reign. Then Jason naughty boy insists on doing the killing himself. The two end up leaping dreamlike into each others back stories - which allows the film to layer the shocks like a trapdoor videogame. So can Freddy beat up Jason or what? Lets just say that neither one would have stood a chance against Abbott and Costello.
