Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris played the parts in the 1976 Disney movie. In this Disney remake Lindsay Lohan is 15-year-old Anna Coleman a surly high-school student and garage-band guitarist; Jamie Lee Curtis is her widowed mom Tess a stressed-out multitasking psychologist on the verge of remarriage.When an ancient Chinese hex kicks in they wake to discover how devastatingly unprepared they are to live each others life. Tess in her daughters body is hopeless at both guitar and algebra; Anna horrified to find herself wearing her moms middle-aged face is inept at comforting Tesss neurotic patients. (When in doubt Tess advises her just say ""But how do you feel about that?"") More ambiguous complications arise when Jake (Chad Michael Murray) the motorcycle-riding heartthrob Anna swoons for falls for Annas soul after all. Unfortunately thats her mothers body hes seducing.Screenwriters Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon have devised some lovely and hilarious variations on Rodgerss irresistible premise. Wisely neither they nor director Mark Waters (""The House of Yes"") push the farce too hard. This being a family movie--and one of the rare ones adults will find as captivating as kids will--they carefully avoid the darker and more daring possibilities; thus the romantic tangle is untwisted with somewhat unconvincing ease. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week But the most startling metamorphosis is Curtiss transformation from fading horror-flick queen to dazzling comedienne. She goes on a teenage tear--tormenting Annas younger brother (who wonders why Moms acting so weird) getting down and dirty on a TV talk show where Tess is supposed to discuss her book on aging--with fiercely funny conviction. Lohan holds her own registering prim parental disapproval from within the pierced body of a hormonal high-school girl. Mother and daughter each come to see the other with new and more generous eyes. No surprise but their predictable reconciliation managed to choke up a fully grown movie critic. Then again maybe its only adults wholl get teary-eyed--kids just wanna have fun. And they will.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Freaky Friday The classic kids book by Mary Rodgers about a mother and daughter who magically trade bodies for a day first hit the big screen in 1977 as a Disney comedy starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster. In this millennial update directed by Mark Waters (The House of Yes) and again produced by Disney mom (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a stressed-out multitasking psychiatrist whos about to remarry and her kid (Lindsay Lohan) is a high school rebel who loves the Hives and plays guitar in a garage band. Since the original film came out its role-reversal gimmick has been filched by countless other comedies but the premise provides a fine showcase for the two appealing actresses who appropriate each others vocal and physical mannerisms with dead-on accuracy .

A correction was made to this review on July 21 2003. One of the more pleasant surprises of a summer movie season littered with lumbering disappointments ""Freaky Friday"" is a fleet and funny comedy with more than enough cross-generational appeal to draw auds far beyond target demo of teen and tweener females. Indeed theres definite ""Princess Diaries""-style sleeper potential in this genuinely clever switched-identities romp. Expect a leggy theatrical run followed by brisk vid biz. Pic actually is third Disney film of the popular 1972 novel by Mary Rodgers. First version a broad 1977 farce paired Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster as single mom and adolescent daughter who magically swap personalities. (Comedy was a B.O. under-achiever in its time but subsequently developed a large loyal following.) Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffman assumed lead roles in the 1995 made-for-TV recycling. In this new and largely improved configuration Jamie Lee Curtis shines as single mom Tess Coleman a stressed-for-success psychotherapist and up-and-comer Lindsay Lohan (who also top-lined Disneys 1998 ""The Parent Trap"" retread) is appealing as Anna Tess 15-year-old daughter. Each thesp is adept at evoking the others body language and speech patterns after the switcheroo takes place. But Curtis bounds beyond mimicry and gimmickry Shes nothing short of dazzling as she enjoys one of her relatively rare opportunities to showcase her splendid comic timing and graceful physicality. Early scenes are a tad too over-emphatic -- almost strident really -- as helmer Mark Waters errs on the side of obviousness while setting up familiar premise. Anna is a spirited self-absorbed adolescent who repeatedly clashes with her bratty younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) and chafes against disciplinary restraints imposed by her totally uncool and control-freakish mom. Tess is a well-meaning but work-obsessed widow who doesnt approve of Annas fashionably grungy attire and usually takes Harrys side when the boy claims his sister is picking on him The mother-daughter squabbles escalate into a public shouting match in a Chinese restaurant two days before Tess marriage to the blandly affable Ryan (Mark Harmon). An aged waitress (Lucille Soong) with a recipe for magic decides to intervene by offering Anna and Tess some enchanted fortune cookies. The next morning -- a Friday morning of course -- the spell is cast Anna finds herself trapped in her mothers fortysomething body (""Im old I look like The Crypt Keeper"") while Tess is transported into her daughters more nubile carcass. Once he completes his expository duties Waters lightens his touch to allow for a freer friskier sort of comedic interplay. Curtis -- who hasnt been this enjoyably antic on screen since ""True Lies"" -- plays for big laughs as Anna-as-Tess uses her moms credit cards to finance a more becomingly cool fashion and hairstyle makeover. Better still she strikes the perfect balance of lovestruck bliss and anxious discomfort in scenes with Chad Michael Murray as Jake a hunky high-schooler whos attracted to Anna. As Jake finds himself much to his perplexity equally attracted to Annas ""mother"" Murray offers a textbook example of how to grab attention while engagingly underplaying in a thinly written supporting part. Lohan does a fine job of conveying Tess buttoned-down chronically disapproving demeanor inside Annas form. Shes especially effective as she faces down a tyrannical teacher (Stephen Tobolowsky) with a hidden agenda and reflexively turns motherly while Tess-as-Anna hangs out with Annas classmates. Climactic scenes -- a rock concert where Annas garage band auditions for a gig and a wedding rehearsal where Tess tearfully reconciles with her daughter -- are predicable but amusingly well-played. ""Freaky Friday"" comes complete with maxims about seeing life through someone elses eyes bridging the generation gap appreciating the pressures brought to bear on loved ones and blah blah blah. To their credit screenwriters Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon sugar-coat the bite-sized life lessons with humor and verve. A strong supporting cast -- including Mark Harmon whose character reveals surprising depth and decency in a key scene and Harold Gould as a sprightly grandfather -- also helps the medicine go down. Pic is a reasonably slick tech package and sports a tune-filled soundtrack that will generate CD sales. A nice touch To underscore the cross-generational aspects of the plot score employs two different versions of ""Happy Together"" (i.e. original Top Ten single by The Turtles and newly recorded cover by Simple Plan). Its worth noting by the way that director Waters originally attracted attention with ""The House of Yes"" (1997) an edgy Sundance-friendly indie. So whats next from Disney? A new version of ""The Love Bug"" directed by Larry Clark? Or perhaps a ""Candleshoe"" remake helmed by Todd Solondz? Consider the possibilities.

Freaky Friday pulls off the unexpected and offers one of the best family-friendly comedies in a summer that is rife with family movies. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play the mother-daughter duo in Freaky Friday. By Ron Batzdorff AP Screenwriter Heather Hach was wise to loosely update the book and significantly change the plot particulars. But the biggest reason this comedy works is the inspired casting of Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. Review of the movie Freaky Friday ( out of four) StarsJamie Lee Curtis Lindsay Lohan Director Mark Waters Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for mild thematic elements and some language. Opens Wednesday nationwide Curtis is one of the funniest and most natural screen presences around -- and one of the most underused. Had any other actress over 40 attempted a role that required her to play 15 audiences likely would have rolled their eyes or cringed in embarrassment. Watching a middle-aged person play a petulant teen can be akin to watching a 6-year-old act 25. But Curtis pulls it off. She plays Dr. Tess Coleman a dedicated but harried psychologist and widowed mother forced to change places with her spunky strong-willed 15-year-old daughter (Lohan) thanks to a magic spell involving a meddlesome restaurateur and a pair of fortune cookies. Lohan plays Anna a Fender-guitar-playing high school girl with strong opinions and a funky style. Underneath their differences in fashion and music mom and daughter have a healthy respect for each other. But that mutual regard is being eroded by Annas focus on her garage band rather than her studies and Tess preoccupation with her impending wedding and demanding job. Their differences come to a head when Anna wants to miss her mothers rehearsal dinner to audition with her band for a spot in a rock festival. Locking horns at a Chinese restaurant they fall under the spell of the fortune cookies. Body-switching stories are usually silly high concept but this transformation is cleverly comical mostly because of Curtis fearless embracing of the teen role. To hear her dismiss her 7-year-old son with a ""What do you want punk?"" in the exact tone his 15-year-old sister would use is a hoot. Her efforts at counseling neurotic patients from a decidedly teen perspective are ridiculously funny. Lohan tapping into her inner parent also has some amusing moments. Almost unconsciously she reaches out and tugs down a friends midriff-baring shirt. Later she proclaims ""I dont believe in physical contact with the opposite sex. Ever. And you girls would do well to follow my example."" There also are some far-fetched moments including those involving Jake (Chad Murray) the boy Anna likes who falls for Tess. And during a TV appearance Anna cant pronounce the title of her mothers new book. But somehow it all adds up to belly laughs aplenty and a rollicking good time. (Opens today nationwide.

Starring Jamie Lee Curtis Lindsay Lohan and Mark Harmon. Directed by Mark Waters. Written by Heather Hach. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Since its on TV about every 30 seconds youve probably seen the movie trailer for ""Freaky Friday."" In it Jamie Lee Curtis character wakes up one morning and looks in the mirror without realizing that she and her 15-year-old daughter have switched bodies. ""My God"" the daughter shrieks staring into her moms face. ""I look like the Crypt Keeper"" Know what? She does. Hey no offense. Once we reach a certain age we all look like that first thing in the morning. But unlike the two previous incarnations of the ""Freaky Friday"" franchise -- Barbara Harris in 1976 and Shelley Long in 1995 -- Curtis really does look like a middle-aged mom. It is the salvation of the movie. What could have been another teen/tween knockoff is transformed by Curtis who puts her venerable classy mug right in front of the camera and goes on to convince us that shes a 15-year-old. It is a fearless funny performance. If you havent grasped the premise of ""Freaky"" by now perhaps you should get out of the monastery from time to time. A self-absorbed workaholic mom bickers with her bratty rocker daughter until a cosmic event causes them to switch bodies. Each learns some valuable lessons about the other understanding reigns and blah blah blah. Luckily this is better than that. In what may be a breakout effort for director Mark Waters (""The House of Yes"") and first-time screenwriter Heather Hach the script skirts the usual cliches or gives them a slick twist. For instance the daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan ""The Parent Trap"") is just edgy enough to freak out parents. Shes a nice enough kid but that Avril Lavigne look and the stoner expression and the scruffy soul patch on her boyfriend (Chad Murray of ""Gilmore Girls"") keep you guessing. The hairstyles on her pals in the band are enough to make parents in the theater squirm -- which is perfect. Its the details that make this work. Dropping Anna off at high school Curtis character Tess spots one of Annas old friends from way back. Oh look she says theres Stacy. Why dont you ever see her anymore? ""Because shes evil Mom"" Anna replies. And she is. But like every clueless parent Tess continues to think of Stacy as that nice little girl they went trick-or-treating with. No wonder kids roll their eyes. Lohan has a tougher go of it. Shes best as -- surprise -- a teen. Even when she is supposed to be inhabited by her mothers mind she seems bright energetic and nice. Lohan one among the tidal wave of new teen stars makes the effort to channel the mothers voice and doesnt really hit any wrong notes but it is a bit of a shrug. One modern update on the formula is that Tess is a widow about to remarry. Stoic Mark Harmon plays Ryan the bridegroom and doesnt seem to be doing much but arching his eyebrows until he gets a nice little speech at the wedding reception. There are two kind of creepy moments. As the mothers wedding day approaches there is considerable apprehension about the 15-year-old spending the wedding night in her moms body. Worse is the extended bit where Annas high school boyfriend Jake is so taken with Curtis channeling Lohans character that he falls for the mother and begins to almost stalk her. Thats just weird. But this is Curtis film. Looking a little like a combination of Carol Burnett and Annie Lennox Curtis has this character down. Any parent who has attempted to mimic a teenager knows that all you have to do is shout ""Dude that is so totally awesome"" to identify yourself as an utter and complete loser. There are two scenes that show how Curtis nails this part without going over the top. The first is a speech at the wedding reception. Curtis stands and speaks with her daughters voice -- their identities are still switched -- to create a sweet lump-in-the-throat moment. The second is at a rock audition at Los Angeles House of Blues. Anna and her band have a chance to earn a spot in a concert but Anna is still trapped in her mothers body. While Mom cavorts on the stage as Anna pretending to play guitar Curtis character stands in the wings the daughter in Moms body blasting out the best end-of-movie guitar solo since Michael J. Fox did ""Johnny B. Goode"" in ""Back to the Future."" The shot of Curtis backstage head down in concentration working the frets like an old pro says it all about her performance. She rocks. .

Freaky Friday Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2003) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/freaky-friday-2003,200,freakyfriday13,freakyfriday,rogerebert
"Freaky Friday | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; freaky-friday ) Freaky Friday (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli With 2003s Freaky Friday Walt Disney Pictures is again cannibalizing its past. This is the third time the Magic Kingdom has turned out a version of Mary Rodgers novel. The first instance in 1976 starred Barbara Harris as the mother and Jodie Foster as her teenage daughter. 19 years later Disney re-adapted the text this time as a made-for-TV endeavor starring Shelly Long and Gabby Hoffman. In 2003 those roles are filled by Jamie Lee Curtis (one wonders if Disney tried to get Foster) and Lindsay Lohan (who already has one Disney remake on her resume - that of The Parent Trap). The philosophy behind the remake is solid. The 1976 version seems dated and many of the girls who saw this movie during its initial theatrical run now have children around the same age they were at the time. Freaky Friday is aimed squarely at the ""tween"" audience and they will universally enjoy this movie as will mothers who end up accompanying their offspring to theaters. Not being an 11-year old girl Im not in Disneys target audience but I must admit having experienced a guilty pleasure while sitting through Freaky Friday. I certainly didnt hate the film and at times I enjoyed its corny humor and low-key melodrama. Its not great cinema but despite problems with weak writing and sledgehammer moralizing it is more often cute and appealing than clumsy and awkward. I give a lot of the credit to Curtis and Lohan both of whom give top-notch performances. Most people going into a multiplex to see this movie know the premise - its a body-swapping film. (This was once a pretty popular cinematic fad. Thankfully it died out after the hideous Kirk Cameron/Dudley Moore picture Like Father Like Son.) Dr. Tess Coleman (Curtis) is a stressed-out psychologist who is juggling being the single mother of two children keeping her career afloat and planning a marriage to the perfect guy (Mark Harmon). Tess teenage daughter Anna (Lohan) is having trouble in school because her English teacher hates her. Anna is also more interested in playing music with her bandmates (Haley Hudson Christina Vidal) than in helping Tess with wedding preparations. And she believes that in general her mother is ruining her life. With the help of a little Chinese magic Tess and Anna unwittingly switch bodies and are consequently forced to see things from a different perspective. Tess discovers that being a teenager isnt as easy as it once was and Anna decides that being a single mother isnt the piece of cake she thought it would be. Neither Curtis nor Lohan takes the easy over-the-top way out. Both of them do real acting and thats the primary reason why Freaky Friday works as well as it does. Curtis does a great impression of an awkward teenager trapped in an older less flexible body. There are a lot of nice subtleties in the performance such as the way she uses her fingers. Likewise Lohan enables us to believe that she is a mature straight-laced woman squeezed into a younger less lived-in form. Its a credit to both actresses that we never lose sight of the characters (Tess and Anna) once the switch has occurred. Freaky Friday is motion picture cotton candy - sweet while it lasts easily disposed of and insubstantial. It will please those who seek it out and probably wont horrify or disgust anyone who ends up seeing it for other reasons (dragged along bribed or otherwise coerced). There are enough clever and/or funny moments to provoke laughter from even a scowling 13-year old boy who wants to be next door watching Terminator 3 for the third time. The screenplay credited to Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon has its share of dead spots (all that stuff about the nearly-deaf grandfather is irritating) but is there anyone who doesnt think the ""Crypt Keeper"" line is great? Freaky Friday delivers what it promises - no more no less. Modest goals if achieved arent always disappointing. Freaky Friday (United States 2003) Director Mark S.

But something wonderfully liberating has happened now that the 44-year-old actress has looked Hollywood middle age in the eye Shes glorious in Freaky Friday a funny shrewd no-bull family comedy about the relationship between mothers and teenage daughters that allows Curtis the comedian to remember her days as a slinky starlet while making use of her wisdom as the mother of an adolescent girl herself. In this particular ""Friday"" - an exemplary Disney update of its own 1976 charmer starring Barbara Harris and a young Jodie Foster - Curtis plays Dr. Tess Coleman an overscheduled widowed psychologist at noisy odds with her 15-year-old daughter Anna (excellent Lindsay Lohan princess of the Disney remake following her nifty work as twin sisters in the 1998 version of ""The Parent Trap""). Tess gives Anna a hard time about the girls rock band; Anna gives her mother grief about Tess affable fiance Ryan (Mark Harmon). Then with a boost of magic they find that theyve swapped bodies and lives. Comic near-catastrophes ensue followed by a deepened appreciation of each others point of view. ""Freaky Friday"" makes room for serious issues like a childs anxiety about a parents remarriage and a parents anxiety about a childs budding sexuality. But - written with a real understanding of contemporary kid culture by Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon and directed with a great appreciation of mother-daughter eye rolling by Mark Waters (""Head Over Heels"") - the movie also leaves space for plenty of smartly silly stuff much of it supplied by Curtis with a generosity and playfulness that is its own kind of sexiness. Embodying a teen horrified by adult squareness Curtis-as-Anna gets a spikier haircut and buys a cooler wardrobe than Tess would have dared - then sprawls in a perfect imitation of gosling gawkiness grossed out by the affections of a baffled Ryan. In fact Curtis empathy with girlhood and her wry pleasure in womanhood is all about grace.
