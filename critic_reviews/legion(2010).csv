Back in 1995 Gregory Widens The Prophecy cast Christopher Walken as the renegade Archangel Gabriel; Stewarts jokier messier take on The End of Days has similar high-flown ideas but nothing serious with which to back them up. This time its the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) whos gone rogue. Tired of humanitys capacity for self-destruction God has lost patience with those he made in his own image and the harbingers of the apocalypse - storm clouds swarms of flying insects a crazy old lady who spews obscenities and walks on the ceiling a demonic ice-cream man - have reached an isolated diner in the Mojave Desert. Its here that the fate of mankind will be decided as conflicted Michael tries to protect the unborn child of unmarried waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) from time-serving Gabriel (Kevin Durand) who has come to do Gods bidding. Meanwhile sundry minor characters are given nothing to do besides explaining their tedious backstories to one another.  Eventually just when it seems that we have entered a purgatorial limbo where time stands still it becomes apparent that director Stewarts way of wrestling with big metaphysical themes is to have the Archangels Michael and Gabriel beat the shit out of each other. So we get a punch-up between the lick-spittle Gabriel armed with a CGI-enhanced mace and the rebellious Michael armed with a profound sense of moral righteousness. Celestial tosh of less than Biblical proportions.

While director Scott Stewart (who penned the script with Peter Schink) obviously cant compete with James Camerons mega-budget visuals he does share with Cameron an affinity for cliche-addled storylines. Unbeknownst to eight months pregnant cigarette smoking waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) the baby shes carrying is coming to save us all. The heavily tatted gun-toting angel Michael (Paul Bettany) drops from the heavens to act as protector with a cavalry of ""demons"" (theyve got a secret) in fast pursuit setting the stage for a bloody biblical showdown. This wan rebooting of the Christ tale has decent acting serviceable if familiar visual effects a few jump-in-your-seat moments and the always crowd-pleasing gimmick of a senior citizen cussing up a storm. But the down time between action scenes is deadly dull and the films hoary cinematic shorthand (i.e. a young Black man enters the film to the sound of hip-hop and fights with his baby mama) is more terrifying than anything else served up.

Comments click to enlarge Legion Video Rated R  2010 According to an introductory voice-over God Almighty is ""tired of all the bullshit"" and orders his angels to wipe out humankind. But its hard to get good help and the winged bums outsource the job to zombified humans with black eyes and serrated teeth. Things look bad for us mortals until the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) fed up with Gods mysterious ways smuggles a ton of ordnance to eight people trapped in a remote desert diner; among them are Dennis Quaid Charles S. Dutton Tyrese Gibson and Adrianne Palicki as a waitress whose unborn baby represents humanitys last chance. This feature debut by writer-director Scott Stewart may sound like an enjoyably goofy theo-horror romp but its a serious penance. R 100 min.

Credit Lewis Jacobs/Screen Gems In ""Legion"" the world ends not with a bang but with a short stack. Recycling motifs from ""The Birds"" ""Near Dark"" the ""Terminator"" films and other apocalyptic fantasies the film convenes a collection of strangers -- upper-middle-class white family with issues black father with handgun etc. -- at a diner in the Mojave Desert where they are caught in the crossfire of a celestial battle.Their task is to mow down waves of angelically possessed humans (easy to kill even by zombie standards) and hold off a mace-wielding ninja angel while waiting for the diners waitress to give birth to the child who will save us all.Unfortunately the script by Scott Stewart who directed and Peter Schink emphasizes stagebound melodramatics and banal television-style catharsis over action and humor; its like ""The Petrified Forest"" (the 1936 film of Robert E. Sherwoods crisis-in-a-diner play) with assault rifles. The leaden dialogue and flat-footed storytelling hobble a talented cast that includes Dennis Quaid Charles S. Dutton Jon Tenney and Kate Walsh; only Paul Bettany as an action-hero angel who takes the humans side and Adrianne Palicki of ""Friday Night Lights"" as the pregnant waitress appear to be taking things seriously.Amid a bull market for end-of-days tales ""Legion"" stands out for its explicitly biblical underpinnings and its claustrophobia. There are no orgies of planetary destruction; the action almost never leaves the diner which may be just as well since a short scene in heaven looks as if it were filmed on the set of a community college Shakespeare production.""Legion"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It takes a lot of blood to cleanse the world.LEGIONOpened on Friday nationwide.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heres Legion in a nutshell Just before Christmas 2010 God gets fed up with humanity and decides to wipe everyone off the face of the Earth. But following through on all that Revelations crap would apparently be too much work and just sending His thousands of immensely powerful warrior angels down to do the killing would be way too easy. So he empowers those angels to climb into fragile easily slaughtered human shells and run murderously amuck. The archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) not keen on Gods new ""wear a human kill a human"" policy heads to Earth to protect grungy bitter eight-months-pregnant waitress Adrianne Palicki whose unborn baby is somehow the key to restoring Gods faith in mankind. And yet when he delivers this news to her and the ragtag band of disposable customers and employees at her desert diner not one of them thinks to ask why the baby is important much less what the survival plan is. No wonder God is as Palicki suggests ""tired of all of the bullshit""--his creations are apparently irredeemably dumb. And so is Legion a cartoonishly grim supernatural thriller that could stand a lot less talk and a lot more thrills. When the first possessed people turn up at Palickis diner director Scott Stewart goes into gleeful Evil Dead mode sending a cackling befanged old lady scrambling up a wall and turning an ice-cream man into a stretchy-jawed mutant straight out of The Mummy. But those two too-brief moments of joyfully over-the-top horror-humor jibe poorly with rest of the movie which consists of excruciatingly torpid pause-filled speeches mostly about the characters histories and motivations none of which prove remotely relevant as they die one by one and are instantly forgotten by the film and the other characters. Theres a lot of melodramatic breast-beating and angst-wallowing but never to any point; its exactly as though everyone is killing time between expensive CGI segments. Horror-thrillers are allowed to be stupid as long as theyre fun but they should never be this boring. The downtime could be forgiven if the rest of the film held together. But while the normally reliable Bettany lends the film a little undeserved gravity the story is simultaneously predictable and nonsensical a series of supernatural-thriller cliches executed in a rote rush. When several of the characters die offscreen its a warning that the filmmakers dont really care about them backstories be damned. When Legion staggers to its obvious heavily foreshadowed conclusion its clear that the filmmakers dont care about the viewers either.

(Lewis Jacobs) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday January 22 2010 424 PM Title Legion Talk about playing both sides of the fence. In ""Creation"" Paul Bettanys Darwin defies the God-fearing masses by making a case for evolution. And in ""Legion"" Bettany embodies one of Gods most loyal soldiers the archangel Michael. Now hes more than welcome to work out his theological issues in public. But it would have been nice if he had chosen this path with some thought for us. Instead Bettany fans are stuck choosing between a staid arthouse drama and a cheesy apocalyptic thriller that wasnt even good enough to screen for critics in advance.According to ""Legion"" God has had enough and is ready to destroy the lot of us. Having already gone the flood route Hes chosen to smite the earth with B-movie cliches like a storm of flies an evil granny and a demon-driven ice-cream truck. As End of Days disasters go these hardly seem up to the challenge. But they are pretty scary to the folks in the desert diner chosen as Armageddon HQ. The reason things are kicking off in dusty Paradise Falls is because a local waitress (Adrianne Palicki) is pregnant. Her unborn baby is humanitys last hope though no one ever feels the need to wonder how or why. Then again perhaps when an angel shows up you arent supposed to ask questions. Bettanys Michael is meant to annihilate humanity but hes got a sentimental streak. So instead he decides to help the staff (Dennis Quaid Lucas Black Charles S. Dutton) and customers (including Tyrese Gibson and Kate Walsh) survive. Its hard to say why Gods avenging army cant take down this handful of stragglers in one move but Michael does arrive armed to the teeth. So they all sit inside shooting at slow-moving zombies chatting about life and  occasionally entertaining visitors like the angel Gabriel (Kevin Durand) whos annoyed that Michael disobeyed The Boss.There are a couple of decent action scenes and Bettany approaches the slapped-together script with impressive seriousness. But even if you overlook the lousy lighting awkward editing and uneven acting theres so much talking -- and so little story -- that your mind is likely to wander. When that happens we recommend making a list of all the movies that donated various plot points to this one. Like ""The Terminator."" Or ""Daybreakers."" Or the entire oeuvre of Kirk Cameron. (If thats not a Netflix queue I dont know what is.) Come to think of it lets all pray that Bettany pursues any further spiritual studies in the privacy of his own home.

(Lewis Jacobs) C- Legion Genre Horror Action/Adventure Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Paul Bettany Dennis Quaid Lucas Black Doug Jones Kate Walsh; Director Scott Stewart; Author Peter Schink Scott Stewart; Release Date Wide 01/22/2010 Posted January 22 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Remember that passage in the Book of Revelation when the archangel Michael kills a bunch of possessed tiny-dentured zombie types with a machine gun at a rundown desert diner owned by Dennis Quaid? Us neither. Still thats pretty much the entire plot of this dull horror movie. The problem lies not with any lack of interest on the part of the B-lister-filled cast. Paul Bettany sells the hell -- or perhaps the heaven -- out of his gun-toting angel and Adrianne Palicki from Friday Night Lights is convincing enough as the heavily pregnant mother he has defied Gods orders to protect. Meanwhile Kate Walsh deserves some sort of medal or another zero on her paycheck for gamely portraying a woman who in one of the films more memorable sequences narrowly escapes being dissolved by pus. Alas after a brisk start the script turns out to be a rough and humorless beast slouching its way towards utter ludicrousness. ""The future has been unwritten"" intones Bettany at one point. But there are times when Legion barely seems to have been written at all.

Heavily armed archangels flesh-chomping demons humongous insect hordes and other unsettling signs of the apocalypse are on graphic garish display in ""Legion"" a dramatically muddled but surprisingly involving Bible-themed fantasy thriller that imagines Armageddon in a dingy roadside diner a la ""The Prophecy"" meets ""The Petrified Forest."" Even when the blood-and-thunder hokiness of the over-the-top plot tilts perilously close to absurdity the admirably straight-faced performances by well-cast lead players provide just enough counterbalance to sustain aud curiosity and sympathy. Expect strong (if not quite miraculous) opening-weekend biz followed by extended afterlife on homevid and cable. First-time feature helmer Scott Stewart co-founder of f/x company the Orphanage begins with a bang -- several bangs actually -- in a prologue that vaguely recalls the opening of James Camerons original ""Terminator."" No less a luminary than the archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) plops down into a dank Los Angeles alley and after painfully shedding his wings and loading up with automatic weapons commandeers a cop car for a race against time. Once he reaches a desert cafe portentously named Paradise Falls the newly wingless wonder finds a besieged group of characters Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid) the diners cynically cranky owner; Percy (Charles S. Dutton) his more easygoing partner; Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) a very attractive very pregnant waitress; Jeep (Lucas Black) Bobs mechanic son; Kyle (Tyrese Gibson) a stranger whos taken a wrong turn off the highway; and suburban couple Howard (Jon Tenney) and Sandra (Kate Walsh) and their sarcastic daughter Audrey (Willa Holland). Long before Michael arrives the folks at the diner are seriously spooked out by dead telephones dark clouds of insects and a seemingly sweet little old lady who after chewing on a rare steak sinks her teeth into someones neck. According to Michael however the worst is yet to come God has tired of mankinds sinfully destructive ways and has set into motion the Final Days. The good news is Michael -- certain that Gods wrath is nothing more than a temporary snit -- has defiantly chosen to save mankind by protecting Charlies unborn child. (Sharp-eyed viewers will note that when Michael first descends to Earth the date is specified as Dec. 23.) Unfortunately Michael may be hard-pressed even with all his heavy artillery to ward off the various and sundry zombiefied humans pressed into service by Gabriel (Kevin Durand) an archangel whos very eager to let Gods will be done. Working from a fanciful script he co-wrote with Peter Schink helmer Stewart strikes a sometimes effective sometimes awkward balance between f/x-amped sequences of slam-bang action -- the diner is repeatedly attacked by Gabriels minions during ""Night of the Living Dead""-style onslaughts -- and intensely emotional dialogue-heavy scenes enhanced by handheld camerawork. Pic cheats more than a bit by refusing to clarify just what Michael and Gabriel can or cannot do -- and whether either can truly be destroyed -- and theres an unfortunate hint of silliness to some conversations between the archangels. At one point you half expect one or the other to blurt out ""God always liked you best"" Still theres a rock-solid sincerity most of the performances. Bettany conveys the right note of stoic selflessness while kicking ass and shooting guns and Palicki credibly registers all the anxiety and dread you would expect of a mom-to-be who discovers her unborn child might be humanitys last best hope. Quaid and Black go a bit overboard with their characters hick accents but make potent impact in key scenes. Ironically ""Legion"" could miss out on attracting some ticketbuyers who might under different circumstances be drawn to the pics subject matter churchgoers who flock to religious-themed dramas like ""Fireproof."" Theyre the ones wholl be most upset by the abundance of F-bombs in the dialogue and the very idea that God ever should be second-guessed. Tech values are largely impressive though the editing of some fight scenes causes more confusion than excitement.
