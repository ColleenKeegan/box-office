The idea of aliens descending on a dusty Wild West town has widespread popcorn appeal and with a heavy sprinkling of big name actors Cowboys amp; Aliens gets off to a promising start. Daniel Craig plays the strong silent cowboy who wakes in the New Mexico desert with no memory and a chunky metal bracelet on his arm - the first clue to an impending alien invasion. Its soon clear he can remember how to fight however as he rides into the nearest town and humiliates Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano) the arrogant drunken son of big-shot cattleman Woodrow (Harrison Ford). But Woodrow and our hero must team up when an alien spaceship swoops in plucking up victims and prompting a disparate band of cowboys Native Americans and mysterious strangers to track it through the wilderness.Its here the pace starts to falter. Characters are undercooked with only a potential romance (Craig and Olivia Wilde) and a surrogate-son routine (Ford and Adam Beach) offering emotional engagement. The aliens themselves have little personality and their appearance is all too derivative (think slimy grey skin and Alien-style inner jaws). But the biggest problem is a lack of humour while Craig looks every inch the cowboy and handles gruff action well Robert Downey Jr he aint.A handful of funnies simply isnt enough in a film that should have been handled with B-movie glee rather than pompous plod. With slick action and effects Cowboys amp; Aliens is a good-looking movie that passes muster as a visual diversion. But once the gang saddle up what started as True Grit-meets-War of the Worlds ends up closer to - whisper it - Wild Wild West.

Cowboys amp; Aliens reviewed Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford lasso extraterrestrials. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 29 2011 720 AM The Good the Bad and the Slimy Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford lasso extraterrestrials in Cowboys amp; Aliens. By Josh Levin Harrison Ford and Sam Rockwell in Cowboys amp; Aliens I dont have any privileged information about how blockbusters get made. As a Hollywood outsider my best guess is that some rich guy sends an intern down to the comic book store and options every title the kid brings back so long as it doesnt feature tentacle sex. The movie bizs comic-adaptation cavalcade comprises classic fare like Captain America The First Avenger as well as new-school productions like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. The latest Cowboys amp; Aliens (Universal) represents a third way one thats the inevitable result of market forces. Scott Mitchell Rosenberg sold the film rights to his Hondo-meets-UFO comic nine years before the series came into existence when it was nothing more than a one-sheet poster. By 2013 I predict every film studio will have a department of ""pre-crime"" comic scouts wherein dedicated staffers scan the globe for ink stains and stray pencil marks. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. Cowboys amp; Aliens shows the obvious faults of the buy-now/write-later approach. Its all hat and no cattle. Its also simultaneously all goo and no spaceship. Instead of merging the Western and the sci-fi genre to form some new transcendent class of popcorn fare Cowboys amp; Aliens just regurgitates the conventions of both genres. Double the high concept quadruple the cliches. Advertisement The movies best sequence comes before the credits roll. Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with a gash in his abdomen and a weird-looking gadget cuffed around his arm. As he tries to break the gizmo with a rock a gang of gun-toting ruffians ride up and start talking tough. Lonergan sizes them up and in the fashion of Troy Polamalu takes a flying leap that knocks the toughest-looking hombre off his horse. He pounds his would-be assailants until hes covered with their blood then rides across the barren landscape on a pilfered horse red dust kicking up in his wake. Lonergan like Jason Bourne doesnt remember anything except how to be a total badass. Not long after he lands in a dead-end mining settlement he gets locked up for kneeing a sassy local punk (Paul Dano) in the nethers. While the entitled brat totally deserved it his father is Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford)--the richest man in town and a guy you really dont want to piss off. Before anything can come of this--spoiler alert if you havent read past the ampersand--the aliens attack. This is a ludicrous spectacle one that could only possibly work if its played for campy fun. Instead Cowboys amp; Aliens establishes a menacing tone in its opening few minutes one that a six-shooter-and-UFO combo platter cant possibly sustain. While theres some comic relief baked into the script largely from Sam Rockwells nebbishy bartender Doc this is still a movie that expects you not to laugh when a horse keeps pace with a flying saucer. Too often Cowboys amp; Aliens is ridiculous without being silly--the butt of its own joke. Handed a premise that demands ingenuity director Jon Favreau and a convoy of screenwriters fall back on a deep collection of movie-land tropes. The Indians are a noble indistinct people with a mystical connection to the spirit world. The aliens--who have no personality or back story--are discards from H.R. Gigers sketchbook. The space creatures first appear when a drunk guy has his pants down. A fiddler stops playing when a fight breaks out at the local saloon. The only way any of this stuff will elicit yelps of excitement is if Cowboys amp; Aliens gets screened during a round of hack-script bingo. Favreau who also directed Iron Man and Iron Man 2 wouldve made a better movie if he had Robert Downey Jr. on set. As James Bond Craig is the worlds most-convincing action hero because hes perfectly suited for human-scale violence. Bond though does not play well with beasties from outer space. Olivia Wilde as a woman whos desperate for Lonergan to shake off his amnesia is totally affectless endowing her role with no sparkle or wit. Only the creaky cranky Ford who has yet to encounter a script he couldnt wink at seems like hes at home in a world of spurs and spacecraft. Its fun to think about what Cowboys amp; Aliens might have been if any creativity had crept past the title page. Instead of bonding over their shared humanity it wouldve been fascinating to see the cowboys and Indians take opposite sides in the movies climactic intergalactic battle. Cowboys amp; Aliens vs. Indians wouldve been a far superior film as wouldve Cowboys vs. Aliens amp; Indians. Or Cowboys vs. Aliens amp; Indians amp; Predator. What were left with instead is a dumb movie that thinks its smart. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2. Khizr M.

But only one feels like it has a soul. By David Edelstein Published Jul 29 2011 ShareThis Franz Drameh Alex Esmail John Boyega Jodie Whittaker and Leeon Joness in Attack the Block. (Photo Matt Nettheim/Courtesy of Screen Gems) The inevitable blockbuster Cowboys amp; Aliens is an agreeable time-killer but Ill bet a couple of clever kids could make a livelier movie with a Woody puppet and a Predator doll. The filmmakersJon Favreau and five credited screenwritersmissed a chance to fool around with two disparate homegrown American genres and come up with something freaky and surprising. The movie is more Western than sci-fi but the cowboys are like Indians. I mean Native Americans. I mean people going about their business when all of a sudden a horde of plundering imperialist invaders descends on them. Now the boss-man capitalist the outlaw and even the Native American chief have a common enemy. It starts with a start Muscular blue-eyed Daniel Craig wakes up in the desert with a wound in his side a weird metallic bracelet locked on his wrist and no memoryalthough like Jason Bourne he can effortlessly waste baddies. Hes haunted but by what? Favreau is clever enough to withhold the pertinent plot details. With a narrative this hackneyed not knowing is more fun than finding out. No spoilers folks. But I will say its delightfully disorienting when the first shoot-out is about to erupt and thenwhat the heck ? The camera makes like Spielbergs tracking in on characters gazing in wonder at a glow on the horizon that turns out to be mini ships that whiz in and snatch up shrieking earthlings. Its too bad the aliens (amusingly dubbed demons there being no sci-fi frame of reference in the Old West) are a cosmic letdown. Their ships are clearly computer-generated and move too fast to generate awe. And the aliensapart from a Nazi-like surgeonare mostly CGI too and indistinguishable. They do have one odd aspect mandibles that open to reveal human-looking hands which pop out and grab stuff. Behind those hands are exposed internal organs ripe for stabbing an anatomical quirk that strikes me as evolutionarily speaking spectacularly nonadaptive. Rumor has it that Harrison Ford insists on having his parts beefed up so even in a supporting role (town boss) he has a lot of drawn-out scenes in which he gruffly bonds with sheriff Keith Carradines grandson and abuses his Native American top man (Adam Beach). Gorgeous cat-eyed Olivia Wilde stands around as a woman whowhat on earth is she standing around for? Dont think just ogle. NB Cowboys amp; Aliens is yet another PG-13 movie that will be seen by millions of kids that glamorizes tobacco use. Hero Daniel Craig sits puffing contemplatively after a big action scene and later a lit cigarette saves the day when one of Craigs henchmen nervously drops a pack of matches meant to light a mess of explosives. It could be argued that tobacco use was rampant in the old West so this is historically accurate. It could also be argued that aliens with disintegrating ray guns were not therefore the film is baloney anyway. So why make cigarettes look coolunless you have a deal with Big Tobacco? Joe Cornishs terrific low-budget British thriller Attack the Block could be called Homies amp; Aliens and it has whats missing from Favreaus impersonal Hollywood product. Its wall-to-wall sci-fi pop-culture bric-a-brac yet it feels organic. Theres something more at stake than the fate of a movie-ish Earth. The film centers on a roving gang of hooligans mostly black but with token black-acting whites who live in a South London housing project or council estate. In the opening scene they mug a white nurse (Jodie Whittaker) who gets away when something big falls from the sky and destroys a nearby car. As Moses the leader John Boyega (in his film debut) has the poise of a young Denzel Washington and a gift for appearing courageous and frightened at once. Mosess problem is his pridehe cant be shown upwhich is why he chases the alien kills it and carries it on a stick like a trophy. Its only later he understands that his macho instinct for revenge has caused much of the carnage. Not all though. These are nasty creaturesdescribed by one teen as looking as if a monkey had fucked a fishthat rip people to shreds with iridescent fangs. But the splatter is secondary. Attack the Block is the story of kids on their own with no viable authority figures one even wondering if the creatures werent sent to kill black boys because We aint killing each other fast enough. To defend the block the gangwhich now includes the nurse they muggedgrabs samurai swords and guns and fireworks. Its their chance to prove theyre more than societys castoffs. Cornish like Edgar Wright (who directed Shaun of the Dead and was an executive producer here) can parody a genre in a way that revitalizes it that reminds you why the genre was born in the first place. The movie is in a different galaxy than Cowboys amp; Aliens It has in both senses guts. 1 2 Next Share this story...

As advertised the movie concerns cowboys aliens and the inevitable disputes that arise between the two. If you find this conceit irretrievably silly the film is unlikely to persuade you otherwise. It opens with Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) regaining consciousness amid the barren scrub of 1873 Arizona with a nasty wound in his side a futuristic bracelet locked on his forearm and no memory of how he got either. As he tries to break the high-tech accessory off with a rock hes approached by three horsemen whose hearts are not filled with charity. After delivering a stern lesson in the virtues of Samaritanism Jake makes his way to the nearby town of Absolution. There he meets in short order a kindly priest (Clancy Brown) an ineffectual saloon-keep (Sam Rockwell) a taciturn sheriff (Keith Carradine) his timid grandson (Noah Ringer) a domineering cattleman named Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) his violent entitled son (Paul Dano) and various other stock characters from the Western canon. There is also a beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde) whose intended mysteriousness is easily mistaken for bland opacity. When the townsfolk discover that the amnesiac Jake is in fact an infamous outlaw hes stashed in a coach to be delivered to the federal marshals. The town is called Absolution but the redemptive theme is so underdeveloped that it comes across as excuse-making. Why not just name the town Narrative Incoherence? Then the aliens show up and all token stabs at background and motivation are quickly abandoned. When first spotted the small extraterrestrial ships look like a fire on the horizon. But they quickly whiz into town snatching up a number of residents like calves at a rodeo and spiriting them away. During the otherwise one-sided encounter Jake discovers that his bracelet is in fact a space-age blaster and he shoots one of the alien fighters from the sky. No one exhibits much interest in examining the downed pod however least of all the resolutely incurious script. The next morning the aforementioned characters--minus the sheriff and Dolarhydes son who were among those taken--saddle up to follow the aliens and rescue their loved uns. On their journey they will be assaulted by aliens by highwaymen by Indians and by draining bouts of narrative inertia. When they finally reach the alien mothership there is a prolonged battle--cowboy-hatted actors on one side CGI creepies on the other--that seems like a laboratory-pure experiment to prove the essential ridiculousness of the movies premise. There are a handful of things to like along the way beginning perhaps unsurprisingly with Craig. Though his voice never quite achieves the right timbre--he appears to swallowing a little hard on his accent--his creased visage and lean physique (which yes we are given the chance to inspect closely) neatly summon the mythic Western ethos. If Sergio Leone were still with us the things he could have done with that face A minute-long closeup of Craigs pale-blue squint while a Morricone score quavered would be more evocative than the entirety of Cowboys amp; Aliens. There are other hints of promise in the early pre-alien going as the movie unrolls the familiar tropes of the genre the mysterious loner; the gun-happy loudmouth; the unhurried lawman; the confrontations on dusty streets and in darkened bars. Alas the film soon loses its way. Fords performance is disappointingly overcooked Instead of revealing a quiet core of malice--it should after all be less work to be a villain than a hero--he snarls and growls his way through the role. At the other end of the spectrum Rockwell is utterly wasted as the mild-mannered barkeep his loopy charisma kept firmly under wraps. And while Id like to suggest that the less said about Wilde the better I fear more will need to be said in a moment. The direction meanwhile by Jon Favreau is slack and unfocused less Iron Man than Iron Man 2. But lets move on to the men whom Forbes described in a May article as the ""real stars"" of the film screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. (The two longtime friends and collaborators are among at least 12 writers not including the author of the graphic novel who worked on the film at various points; but it was they with Damon Lindelof who wrote the final draft.) As Forbes noted movies written by Orci and Kurtzman--including the first two Transformers films the third Mission Impossible and Star Trek--have made 3 billion at the box office over the past six years. But while this figure is certainly notable it is perhaps less notable than method underlying this success which consists essentially of a phenomenally successful two-man war against narrative clarity and continuity. Now I have nothing against Orci and Kurtzman Their movies are not ill-tempered (like the most recent Transformers movie with which they were not involved) and they generally share a certain jaunty exuberance. Yet the films most notable commonality is the way they elevate incoherence to something approaching philosophy. MiIII centered on a global hazard so haphazard (maybe the ""anti-God?""; no probably not) that we never even learned what it was; Transformers 2 had John Turturro begging for clarity from within the movie itself; and Star Trek though quite enjoyable otherwise sent its plot spinning through a black hole.

How better to explain the glaring non- and counter-sequiturs of Cowboys amp; Aliens? Early in their journey the gang comes across a massive paddle-wheeler dumped upside-down in the Southwestern desert ""500 miles away"" from any river big enough for it to have traveled. One might guess that at some subsequent point in the film wed be offered an explanation for what the aliens did to the boat and why or some hint that the aliens had even been 500 miles away. But no their incursion seems aggressively local and the paddle-boat remains a set design in search of a rationale. As for the aliens themselves why are we told that they huddle deep in their caves because they cant see well during daylight--only to have them pop out to fight unhindered while the sun is high? Or take a scene in which Jake encounters his former band of banditos now under the command of a mutinous lieutenant. After settling the mutiny does Jake reassume command of this useful regiment of cannon-fodder? No he flees them incomprehensibly--only to return and reassume command later. Theatergoers at the screening I attended were particularly perplexed at the movies refusal to explain why the aliens who have come to Earth to plunder our gold want the gold in the first place. And dont get me started on Wildes character eventually revealed to be a plot device so lame that it almost left me nostalgic for the time-travel trap doors of Star Trek. A further casualty of the scripts random swerves and loose ends is the entire concept of character. With MiIII and Star Trek and their second Transformers outing Orci and Kurtzman had the advantage of pre-established protagonists We all knew who Kirk and Spock and Ethan Hunt and Sam Witwicky were supposed to be. Without such personality backstops the cast of Cowboys amp; Aliens wander aimlessly back-and-forth across moral and characterological spectrums. Fords Dolarhyde is particularly schizophrenic alternating on an almost scene-by-scene basis between apparent Bad Guy and presumed Good Guy. (Danos metamorphosis is no less awkward though because he is absent for the middle portion of the film somewhat less striking.) Now it is true that the preacher has a couple of lines about ""seeing good men do bad things and bad men do good things"" and the town is after all named Absolution. But this redemptive theme is so underdeveloped that it comes across primarily as excuse-making. Why not just name the town Narrative Incoherence and be done with it? There is however reason for hope. Orci and Kurtzman have written (and the latter directed) a small film called Welcome to People scheduled for release next year. The movie is a drama about a man delivering an inheritance from his deceased father to a sister he has never met. It contains as best I can tell no robots or aliens or spies or cowboys. Let us all hope that it is a good film and a great success--one that offers Orci Kurtzman and the moviegoing public an escape from the storytelling black hole into which we all seem to have fallen.

Twitter previousHow Twitter Is Easing You Into Seeing AdvertisingnextNo One in Congress Is Safe After the Debt Fight Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Starting with Layer Cake and perfected in Casino Royale hes dialed in on this particular acting method. So it makes perfect sense that Cowboys and Aliens opens with a confused Craig bloody and battered. Longish opening credits play over the scene where we see (gulp) five people worked on the screenplay. Still the quiet stoic Western mood is set. The year is 1873 and were talking Cowboys plus Aliens. The title alone really works in terms of setting the table no? At the beginning of the film Daniel Craig has no memory of where hes from who he is or how he ended up wandering around in the ol West. He beats up / kills a few guys before heading into town to try and make sense of it all. A mangy dog shadows him tumbleweed in the foreground. In town he comes across Harrison Fords son played by Paul Dano (of There Will Be Blood fame). Harrison Ford is a grizzled war vet name-checking the Battle of Antietam with verve. Olivia Wilde appears on the periphery in a bar Craig visits; shes instantly concerned for him though slightly wary of his apparent predilection for violence. Perhaps his handiness with a weapon will come back to help them? Yes indeed all personal vendettas are abruptly put on hold as aliens invade via spacecraft to abduct a few of the townsfolk. A posse is gathered the fight must be taken to the non-Earthling interlopers and were off. The first compelling aspect of Cowboys and Aliens is the much appreciated lack of price-gouging 3-D. Glorious 2-D The effects are solid throughout the film aliens and horses intermingling in perfect harmony. The chemistry between Wilde Craig and Ford works for the most part though the film has lulls when the genre is Western (as opposed to sci-fi). The innovation of the film is another feather in its cap as the dilemma of killing massive (and fast-moving) aliens with light weaponry is put front and center. There are also a fair amount of strong one-liners. Yep Cowboys and Aliens has jokes Still the story does have a rather cheesecloth feel. The holes are small but placed all over the place occasionally causing Cowboys and Aliens to lose its whey. Theres also the minor problem of character motivation. A few of the protagonists act in a manner thats not exactly authentic. The father-son relationship between Harrison Ford and Paul Dano is quite thin and the fight physics seem to change from scene to scene. Its as if there wasnt a central guiding force no essential story that everyone wanted to tell. The other thing that might not be apparent from the marketing efforts is the mystery vibe of the film. The first 90 minutes deal with the myriad of questions that would present themselves if aliens appeared to a pre-computer culture. Who are they? What do they want? Can we ask them nicely to leave? The answers to all these questions and more can be found in Cowboys and Aliens. Part mystery part sci-fi part Western this is a film that mostly entertains even if it doesnt live up to the full-on madness potential the title portended.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 29 2011 203AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English First a heartfelt thanks to the screenwriting quintet listed below. It makes my job so much easier when the movies title doubles as a full plot summary. Cowboys amp; Aliens - pretty much says it all. And to think it only took five of them. As for whos who well Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig suit up for the cowboys although given his status a long time ago in a galaxy far far away Harrison can be considered something of a convert. Over on the aliens side its hard to make out faces but theres no doubt about their place of origin These slimy growling bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting. Actually the ampersand in the title is a tad misleading since the genres never fuse into an extraterrestrial horse opera. A more accurate label would be Cowboys Then Aliens Then Cowboys Again Then a Big Mess of Aliens. Theres no whole just parts so lets examine them separately. Cowboys Jake (Craig) wakes up in the badlands with a bad case of amnesia and a thick metal bracelet locked onto his left wrist. Still we know Jakes a cowboy cause he shoots three men before the credits roll then rides into town as the lone stranger. There you got your rich and imperious cattle baron (Ford) his punk of a son the good yet ineffectual sheriff the wussy saloon keeper with his specs and the tow-headed kid whos about to grow up quick. The town is called Absolution but Stereotypeville seems more apt. The exception could be Ella (Olivia Wilde). Her gingham dress is cliched enough but those eyes do look unconventionally bright. Aliens Initially they pop up in their flying machines spewing fire and snatching victims aloft and generally spooking the horses. The appearance of said machines suddenly prompts Jakes bracelet to emit a ring tone light up and morph into a weapon of mass destruction - its enough to make Apple rethink the iPhone 5. Anyway the cowboys being cowboys seem remarkably blase about the ""demons"" in their midst and are quick to do the manly thing They form a posse. Cowboys Again Off the posse rides into the badlands presumably in the vague direction of the you-know-whos. The posse encounters bandits and stage-robbers yet not for long - Jake pulls his bracelet on them. Later the posse further encounters the cowboys erstwhile enemies the Injuns although theres nothing like a shared intergalactic adversary to turn former foes into fast friends. Or as those five scribes so eloquently put it ""We must work together."" Somewhere along the way we get our first close-up glimpse of a central-casting alien and immediately understand why the cowboys are so blase. Big Mess of Aliens Nestled down in an arroyo the mother ship is sighted. Cowboys Indians surviving bandits and Ella all gather for the Gunfight at the E.T. Corral. There the central-casting aliens prove touchingly vulnerable to six-shooters arrows ropes that bracelet and an occasional punch to their slimy noggins. In the midst of the frenzy Ella gives Jake a piece of advice that resonates deeply with the audience ""You have to stop thinking."" Of course for performers in the empty blockbuster genre you have to stop acting too. Craig manages the feat quite well simply by going blank and channelling the young Clint Eastwood. Ford is less successful insisting on discharging his dialogue as if his mouth were stuffed with a bale of cotton. The words come out in a deep growl accompanied by a bug-eyed stare - you almost get the feeling he wants to switch sides. Now since this is decidedly not an actors picture it would behoove Jon Favreau who so recently put the irony into Iron Man to make it a directors picture. Given the lumpy action the clunky camera the scareless frights and the mirthless laughs its safe to conclude that Favreau declined the challenge with a polite but firm ""No thank you.""

There are indeed both cowboys and interplanetary travelers. It also delivers a seemingly peerless pedigree. Steven Spielberg is a producer as are Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. Jon Favreau -- coming off ""Iron Man"" and its sequel - directed. And the stars are genuine big names -- Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford rather than the no-name newbies populating so many of this summers other would-be blockbusters. You wont find Shia LaBeouf in this one. Nor Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth. Also read Can Cowboys amp; Aliens Save Harrison Fords Career? All of which adds up to a competently made big budget special effects-driven action film that will satisfy those looking merely for a plenitude of fist fights shootings stuff blowing up and hostile alien monsters. Whats lacking is a sizable jolt of wacky fun or the shock of the new or even compelling characters. Set in the New Mexico Territory in 1875 it begins promisingly with the camera lovingly panning a bleak western landscape. Suddenly Craig pops up from the bottom edge of the screen as his character groggy and dusty sits up. Clearly just coming to hes puzzled to find himself with a mysterious thick metal bracelet encircling one wrist and a gaping wound near his waist. He cannot try though he might remember who he is what happened or how he got there. Or remove the bracelet Turns out hes Jake Lonergan and hes a wanted man. Both he and we discover this when he heads into the nearby town of Absolution (get it?) where he comes up against Col. Dolarhyde (Ford) a wealthy cattleman who rules the town; Ella (Olivia Wilde) a mysterious young woman with a keen interest in Jake; the local sheriff (Keith Carradine); an assimilated Native American (Adam Beach); and the saloon keeper (Sam Rockwell). Faster than you can load a Winchester rifle alien spacecraft -- this is 1875 remember so actually any spacecraft would be alien -- are strafing Absolution. Even worse the craft are swooping down with long metal cables hooking folk and lifting them skyward. By daybreak Jake and the Colonel are leading a posse on horseback in pursuit of the aliens. ""Camp;A"" is most effective and amusing when it is plumbing the cliches of cowboy movies and goosing them as in when Jake galloping on horseback attempts to outrace an alien plane. The sci-fi half of the film is disappointingly ho-hum and familiar drawing on ""Alien"" ""Independence Day"" and a score of other films from the past couple decades. Really by now if youve seen one goo-drooling alien monster youve seen them all. Characters are so sketchily drawn that little is really at stake here. Everything simply lurches forward in episodic fashion with cowboys going after aliens being pretty much the sum total of the movies plot. (This despite five credited screenwriters two of whom along with a third devised the screen story which they in turn adapted from a 2006 graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg.) As for the cast Craig does just fine as a strong silent type. Hes not as suave here as he is when portraying James Bond but hes admirably stoic and given the chance wrings laughs where possible. Ford playing a bossy old cuss has the most fun of anyone maybe because he knows hes no longer responsible for carrying a franchise on his shoulders. Wilde isnt handed many acting challenges but looks fetching in calico and scrambles up and down cliffs nimbly. In the end ""Camp;A"" is a movie for a Saturday night rather than one for the ages. It has one great idea its title but then comes up mostly empty. And thats too bad because the western a Hollywood staple since 1903s ""The Great Train Robbery"" has proven itself adaptable and resilient over the years able to accommodate allegories and comment on current times. But all ""Camp;A"" does is illustrate how mechanical and intellectually lackluster movies have become in the age of global-minded studios. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(Timothy White/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday July 28 2011 1221 PM Title Cowboys amp; Aliens With Daniel Craig Harrison Ford. Cowboys battle aliens in the Old West. Director Jon Favreau. (155) PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. There are more cowboys than aliens in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" which was the best decision made in this hybrid action-adventure since there are certainly more then enough aliens at the multiplex these days. In fact the huge cockroachy guys who show up in ""Camp;A"" are approximately sixth in line this summer behind Thor the refugee in ""Super 8"" most of the casts of ""Transformers"" and ""Green Lantern"" and the villains of this weeks ""Attack the Block."" But these here aliens know its location that counts and also apparently millennium. So a century before E.T. they show up in the American west circa 1873 to pluck some frontiersmen and women from the mining town of Absolution Arizona. Just before they do a mysterious stranger (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with no memory and saunters onto Main Street right-about the time cranky cattle barron Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) is riding herd on anyone who looks sideways at his bully son (Paul Dano). Its then when them thar lights arrive in the sky and Dolarhyde and the stranger -- who soon discovers hes a wanted thief named Lonergan -- round up a team to search for their kin snatched up by the weird flying things. Along for the ride is tavern-owner Doc (Sam Rockwell) Meachum the preacher (Clancy Brown) ncomfortable-looking Native American Nat (Adam Beach) and beautiful Ella (Olivia Wilde) who has a ridiculous secret of her own. The sole treasure of ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" is that director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"") has fashioned an actual rawhide ride from a graphic novel (that took six writers to wrangle to the screen). His cast is game with Craig leaving no stone face unturned as essentially a Man with No Name and Rockwell bringing character-actor chops. Ford is kicky and loose as an old saddle bag though the story gives him little to do. That decision emerges as the movies real curse. Its chockfull of elements from classic oaters -- a posse a dusty round-up saloon stand-offs -- as well as monster flick staples like abductions experiments and explosions and still nothing very exciting happens (except that the poached folks here and in ""Super 8"" should compare notes). Everyones pretty blase about the saucers. Heck someones even a covert cosmic visitor and does nothing cooler than not burn. Even the extraterrestrial weapon Lonergan cant get off his wrist isnt used to great effect. Its a futuristic laser. Think what Butch and Sundance couldve done with that. Magic Moment The aliens first big appearance a thrilling close encounter of the 19th-century kind.

Starring Daniel Craig Harrison Ford Director Jon Favreau Running time 158 Release Opened Jul 29 2011  Editorial Review A galactic battle at home on the rangeBy Ann HornadayFriday July 29 2011As an exercise in chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter mash-ups the concept of cowboys fighting aliens joins cars that turn into robots and snakes on a plane as either the best idea ever or so-bad-its-good kitsch. ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" Jon Favreaus inspired adaptation of the comic book of the same name could teach Reeses a few things about how to do it right. A loving throwback to the classic westerns and sci-fi adventures of yore this celebration of two of cinemas most revered genres doesnt stint in lavishing their most cherished conventions with even-handed affection and respect. Whether its the loner riding into a desolate dusty town or an E.T.s squishier scarier brother disembarking from a huge spaceship ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" gets both vernaculars exactly right. Of course Favreau found a pretty good loner. Daniel Craig plays Jake Lonergan who as the movie opens wakes up alone in the desert with a mysterious injury and a heavy metal bracelet around his wrist. When he rides into nearby Absolution he immediately makes his presence felt swatting down a bully named Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano) whose father Woodrow (Harrison Ford) owns a huge cattle ranch nearby. When strange lights appear in the sky and some of the townsfolk are sucked into hovering vehicles overhead the taciturn Lonergan and the crustily misanthropic Woodrow Dolarhyde join forces to track down the interstellar outlaws and bring their people home. Eventually theyre joined in their quest by some local Apache tribesmen an alliance even more subversive than the notion of Outer Space in the New Mexico Territory circa 1875. Theyre also helped by a beautiful woman named Ella Swenson played by the gorgeous Olivia Wilde with the same brisk professionalism everyone else brings to the enterprise. (Terrific supporting players include Dano Sam Rockwell as the town saloon owner and Keith Carradine as the sheriff.) With a concept so ripe for overkill and excess ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" keeps the story and visual approach remarkably plain-spoken and simple. For the most part its a western with dashes of anachronistic weirdness an aesthetic clash that Favreau (best known for his ""Iron Man"" films) handles well. With the exception of those slippery Creatures from the Intergalactic Lagoon that have inexplicably invaded 19th-century Earth most of the sci-fi accoutrements dont look all that out of place including Lonergans manacle which fits right in with the chains and handcuffs he also occasionally wears or the spaceship that looks like a soaring exotically carved mesa. There are moments of startling brutal violence in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" which with its grim mission and truly terrifying monsters isnt strictly kid stuff. Still when the wonderfully grumpy still Indy-fit Ford socks Craig on the jaw and Craig hits back even harder it feels like a baton is being passed. (""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" was produced by Steven Spielberg who between this and ""Super 8"" seems refreshingly un-self-effacing about financing oblique and not-so-oblique tributes to himself.) Between ""Super 8"" ""X Men"" and ""Captain America"" of course ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" risks being greeted with indifference by an exhausted audience. It may be two treats in one but for an audience thats pigged out on spectacle all summer that might be two treats too many.

Photo Aliens abduct astonished townspeople in the Old West A mysterious amnesiac gunslinger rides to the rescue Extraterrestrials get lassoed and blown to bits in cool-looking ways Whats not to like? Western/sci-fi mash-up ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" also boasts a killer cast steely-eyed Daniel Craig as the gunslinger grumpy Harrison Ford as a cruel cattle baron and sexy Olivia Wilde (of TVs ""House"") as a mysterious beauty who joins them in battling the murderous ETs. Its not quite ""The Searchers"" meets ""Close Encounters"" as advertised but by playing its genres straight this midsummer crowd-pleaser from the ateliers of Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard is still a great deal more rip-roaring fun than say the campy movie version of ""The Wild Wild West."" The generic extraterrestrials may look strikingly like ancestors of those in the Spielberg-produced ""Super 8"" and treat their abductees in a remarkably similar fashion that just skirts the limit of the PG-13 rating. But on the other hand this sharp-looking committee-written adaptation of a genre-splicing graphic novel wins points by frequently smartly and affectionately tipping its hat to classic Westerns and their archetypes. Jon Favreau can be an uneven director (witness the two ""Iron Man"" movies) but here he does a great and economical job sketching out Absolution a tough and struggling frontier town in the Arizona Territory in 1875. The nameless gunslinger (Craig) is trying to figure out who he is and why he has a chest wound and a strange-looking shackle on his wrist. Still hes got two lightning fists and is sure quick on the trigger as the cattle barons wastrel son Percy (Paul Dano) quickly finds out when he unwisely tries to pick a barroom brawl with our hero. Percy ends up accidentally shooting a hapless deputy (played by John Waynes grandson Brendan Wayne no less) obliging the grizzled sheriff (Keith Carradine) to take both Percy and the gunslinger -- who is wanted for a stagecoach robbery -- into custody. But before they can be shipped off to a federal lockup a 16-winged extraterrestrial spaceship swoops into Absolution abducting Percy and the wife of the timid saloon keeper (Sam Rockwell) among others. The abduction does not please Percys dad Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford) who loves Perrcy more than Nat (Adam Beach) his fiercely loyal Native American adopted son. A Civil War veteran the colonel is enough of a strategist to figure out that the Gunslingers shackle -- which turns out to be a sci-fi blaster -- is a far more effective weapon against the invaders than your average six-shooter. The gunslinger and the colonel join forces with the sheriff the saloon keeper a taciturn preacher (Clancy Brown) and the latters demographicallyfriendly young grandson (Noah Ringer of ""The Last Airbender""). Wildes mysterious Ella -- lets just say she has access to many secrets of the universe including waterproof mascara -- brings a tribe of hostile Indians as well as the gunslingers former bandit-colleagues into the big tent of this rather unlikely posse. The films climax is a lengthy -- maybe a tad too lengthy -- attack on the extraterrestrials fort-like spaceship amid the mesas a rather cool-looking if improbable mash-up of Mayan steampunk and brutalist styles. Colonel Dolarhydes tactics are strictly old school but the gunslinger has somehow acquired knowledge of what look suspiciously like 20th-century commando skills. ""Cowboys and Aliens"" moves fleetly enough that most of the myriad questions the script raises didnt occur to me until afterward. In the meantime as pure period escapism its yards ahead of competition like the dullish ""Captain America."" The hand-picked cast here really does help. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bridesmaids director says he is open to a sequel Read Next Bridesmaids director says he is open to a sequel Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16059 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Cowboys amp; Aliens Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Cowboys amp; AliensThe mash-up of western and sci-fi elements collapses under the weight of its clichA(c)s despite the efforts of Daniel Craig.July 29 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Daniel Craig left and Harrison Ford star in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens."" (Zade Rosenthal / Universal...)Its hard to say what is most depressing about ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" a the film itself or the fact that this was the best movie a posse of major Hollywood players could come up with. A leaden mash-up of western and science-fiction elements that ends up noisy grotesque and unappealing this Jon Favreau-directed film features five producers (including Brian Grazer and Ron Howard) six executive producers (Steven Spielberg and Ryan Kavanaugh among them) and six credited writers led by ""Star Trek"" rebooters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and ""Losts"" Damon Lindelof. No wonder the film plays like a business deal more than a motion picture. Listed as a producer not a writer is Scott Mitchell Rosenberg whose concept for the original graphic novel inspired the film. Thats right ""Cowboys"" doesnt even retell the story the graphic novel does; it sets out on its own. This is not a satisfying journey. Its not that there is anything fundamentally flawed about the notion of good guys bad guys and Native Americans joining forces in the New Mexico territories circa 1875 to fend off rampaging aliens from God knows where. Casting Daniel Craig as Alien Nemesis No. 1 was a capital idea as was hiring director of photography Matthew Libatique to give the cinematography a classic western look. Unfortunately little else about this film has worked out as planned. Both the cowboy and the alien halves of the venture play like tired retreads of once-vibrant material and putting them together doesnt disguise the deficiencies a it doubles down on the losses. Craigs character is introduced as a Man With No Name all alone in the middle of the desert with a strange-looking high-tech bracelet on his left wrist and a mind empty of all knowledge of who he might be or where he might have come from. Kind of like the redoubtable Jason Bourne however No Name has retained some very effective fighting skills as anyone who tries to get in the way of this James Bond in buckskin soon finds out. No Name makes his way to the nearest town where he runs into a gaggle of clichA(c)s masquerading as archetypes the weak-kneed saloon owner (Sam Rockwell) the sniveling son of a feared cattle baron (Paul Dano) the worried sheriff (Keith Carradine) and more. The town is called Absolution and that name is as hackneyed as the rest of the films western paraphernalia. Unlike last years splendid ""True Grit"" or even Ron Howards underappreciated ""The Missing"" ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" has a clumsy touch and zero feel for the intangibles of classic movie westerns. With a script eager to embrace every witless western chestnut a talking is ""flapping your gums"" to this crowd a and a passion for stock situations ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" displays one thumping clichA(c) after another as if its bankrupt derivativeness was in some way reinventing the wheel. Olivia Wilde has the presence to pull off the role of a mysterious woman who seems to know a lot more about No Name than he knows about himself. But Harrison Ford costarring as cattle king and disaffected Civil War veteran Woodrow ""Dont Call Me Colonel"" Dolarhyde is not so fortunate. Though the permanently apoplectic Dolarhyde is supposed to be a holy terror the actor unintentionally plays him on the edge of caricature. Once the aliens of the title show themselves aping the aliens of ""Super 8"" by yanking good citizens off the streets of Absolution with the tentacles of their dragonfly-shaped vehicles the film goes off the rails in a different way. The problem with these slimy unpleasant extraterrestrials is that they manage to be both repulsive (probably a good thing for the films intended demographic) and pro forma. The final fight to the finish with these entities is repetitive and tiresome partially because its never clear what it takes to eliminate one of them. The only sure weapon the cowboys have turns out to be No Names bracelet which also came from outer space though its never clear why he seems to have the only one of these all-powerful wrist gizmos. Dont these aliens know enough not to travel without a spare? As noted Craigs stern presence attempts to keep ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" on track but it is not enough. When director Favreau enthuses ""I believe that people are thirsting for something like this"" its hard to know what universe hes talking about. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAndrew Lincoln relishes his cowboy life among The Walking...October 30 2010Demise of Sex Farce The Mystery Is GoneMay 8 2001MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentRyan KavanaughCowboys amp; AliensCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cowboys-aliens-20110729,0,4269164.story",200,cowboys&aliens14,cowboys&aliens,latimes

Photo Timothy White AP Cowboys amp; Aliens review Saddle up 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Cowboys amp; Aliens Sci-fi Western. Starring Daniel Craig right Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The reason for ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" - the justification for it the appeal of it the whole point of it - is contained in the title. Take a cowboy movie add space aliens. Thats a gimmick that could easily have exhausted itself after 20 minutes but director Favreau a team of screenwriters and some well-cast actors keep it alive and the result is a crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most. The more you know Westerns the more youll enjoy ""Cowboys amp; Aliens."" Every Western cliche is pumped up and blown out not only the cliches of story but of character costume and set design. Sam Rockwell as a merchant shows up with the little round spectacles and plastered-down hair that youve seen in a hundred movies. Paul Dano as a spoiled sniveling drunken brat on a rampage starts shooting up the town like every obnoxious skinny kid with a gun from a thousand Westerns. And the shots of the rickety old town a few structures in a vast nothingness are a little more forlorn than usual. At the center of it all of course is a lonesome stranger with a dark past. This time its Daniel Craig as stern and unsmiling as Clint Eastwood who wakes up in the movies first scene in the middle of nowhere with an elaborate metal bracelet on his wrist and suffering from amnesia. But he does remember how to fight. When he takes down four creepy guys - theyre filthy with long beards and look like something out of Western central casting - the audience settles in for a good time. Related Stories Review Cowboys amp; Aliens Cowboys amp; Aliens more than a gimmick film For the most part ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" delivers. Favreau has a subtly satirical sensibility that can suggest absurdity simply through camera placement as when Craig stands framed in a doorway like some Western God and then says ""Hello?"" - sounding just a little unsure and ridiculous. The script is sprinkled with funny moments for viewers in the know. At one point an exasperated Rockwell turns on someone and says ""Why dont you sing a song cook some beans do something useful"" But the movies most inexhaustible source of delight is Harrison Ford as a cranky old entrepreneur in an Indiana Jones hat. Its a given in every Ford movie that hes ticked off about something. The trick is to give him a reason to be so surly. Space aliens taking his son? Alien death rays burning up his cattle? OK these are good reasons. Ford doesnt exactly play for laughs and in fact the movie provides him with several dramatic moments that he seems to relish. But Ford knows who he is onscreen and what he has come to mean over the decades. He knows exactly where the laughs are and he nails every one of them. On the downside ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" is not the Western answer to ""Inglourious Basterds."" Here genre isnt exaggerated to jar audiences from their complacency or to discover new truths. The movie combines cowboys with science fiction only for the sake of doing it for the fun of it. Like the novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" you already have the best joke going in. Lacking an overarching purpose or viewpoint the movie is no better than it happens to be in the moment and there is a 20-minute stretch about a quarter of the way in that drags. But ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" gets better as it goes along and benefits from a director with a solid command of tone. The actors may know theyre in a comedy but the characters certainly dont. Thats an important difference that allows us once the premises novelty has worn off to care whether Daniel Craig can rescue a very somber Olivia Wilde from the clutches of an alien spaceship for example. Or to maintain a reasonable interest in the fate of a humanity threatened by gigantic green snorting monsters. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Creatures from beyond the stars are constantly making cinematic pit-stops here for purposes ranging from ""Howdy neighbors"" to ""My dont you all look tasty"" This week finds two hostile forces taking over American theaters and though the basic story beats of the alien invasion genre are intact in both their settings and results could hardly be more different. The beasties in both Joe Cornishs Attack the Block and Jon Favreaus Cowboys amp; Aliens are inclined to subtle infiltration as opposed to the park-massive-spacecraft-above-major-city approach of those in Independence Day or District 9. In Block they arrive in the housing projects of South London in meteor-like pods their fiery descent camouflaged by the Guy Fawkes Night fireworks exploding all over the city. The furry black aliens armed with a mouthful of luminous teeth are here to breed though what it means for humanity if they succeed isnt quite clear. In Cowboys the somewhat more typically monstrous visitors -- large with sharp claws and simultaneously reptilian and insectile features -- are already here at the movies start. Like most travelers setting up shop in the late 19th-century American West theyre in search of both gold and a new place to call home even if that means subjugating or killing the indigenous population. One almost wishes the movies Indians could sit back and watch the settlers be decimated just so theyll know how it feels to be on the other side of the equation. Cornishs film centers on a group of teenage miscreants led by the aptly-monikered Moses (John Boyega). As he and his crew are mugging Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a young nurse on her way home late at night the first alien lands and with that the movie (and Sam) takes off at a sprint. The director doesnt waste much energy on exposition and setup there will be plenty of time to get to know this crew as they attempt to defend their block themselves and their weed from a steadily growing force that seems bent on going after them and them alone. Boyega is absolutely riveting leading with a stern glower and constantly trying to prove himself. Yet Moses has a deep well of tenderness and honor beneath the facade and Boyega almost single-handedly makes you care not just about his character but about everyone in any gang that would align itself with him. Hes that magnetic. Each of these characters has a distinct identity and Cornish engages the audience in each of their fates adding layers to their characters amid a steady stream of jokes heart-pounding chases and anxious horror movie set pieces. Much like another modern British horror-comedy classic Shaun of the Dead Block is irreverently funny without ever being spoofy. Cornish obviously has a deep love for the movies that serve as inspirations here mostly cultish 80s flicks like Night of the Comet and Critters. But his sharp wit as a writer turns the film into more than the trashy sum of its predecessors. The one-liners are hilarious and he has a deft touch at weaving social commentary on urban gentrification into the narrative by forcing the teens Sam an affluent stoner college student (Luke Treadaway) and a middle-aged drug dealer (Nick Frost) to fight alongside one another working out their issues on the fly. The scruffy chaotic appeal of Cornishs film which does most of its sci-fi trickery with practical effects stands in stark contrast to the polished professionalism and digital wizardry of Cowboys amp; Aliens. With two Iron Man films under his belt director Jon Favreau has a solid handle on how to deliver big-budget spectacle. And that gloss guarantees that the movie remains largely inoffensive even when the story fails to inspire. Daniel Craig and his icy blue gaze star as Jake Lonergan a bandit who wakes up in the rocky New Mexico desert with no memories and no trace of whats happened to him apart from a nasty wound in his side and a strange bulky bracelet firmly clasped around his wrist. Finding his way into the local mining town hes quickly identified as a wanted man but his stagecoach to trial in Santa Fe is waylaid first by Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) a man he stole from and then by a sudden attack of aliens aboard small fighter crafts lassoing and kidnapping the towns residents as they swoop down. (clockwise from bottom left) Leeon Jones Luke Treadaway Jodie Whittaker John Boyega and Alex Esmail are the London toughs who defend their turf from 80s-era slime monsters in Attack The Block a deadpan horror-comedy that provokes real feelings for its mismatched characters. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures You can tell Favreau is having plenty of fun hitting all of his favorite Western elements the silent stranger riding into town the gang of bandits Indian trackers the thundering hooves of a posse on the move. At the start it appears hes willing to treat the material with the winking tone a movie titled Cowboys amp; Aliens probably demands. Craig spends the first couple of scenes barely saying a word shamelessly (and satisfyingly) channeling Clint Eastwoods ""Man with No Name"" and Favreau gives Fords character a grand reveal that might as well bear the subtitle ""Yes I do realize Ive got Han Solo and Indiana Jones in my sci-fi Western and its pretty awesome dont you think?"" Ford plays along gamely having more obvious fun playing a quasi-bad guy here than hes had onscreen in years. But the restrictions of making a movie for the masses keep Favreau from taking the same kinds of risks that Cornish can in his film. Its easy to pick out whos going to have to die and whos going to make it to the end of Cowboys and that reduces the stakes to the point where the movie descends quickly from its fun exposition to a collection of meaningless explosions and predictable action sequences. Contrast that with Block with its consistently breathtaking pace and a real sense that anything could happen to characters that you care much more about. Based on a graphic novel Cowboys amp; Aliens never quite transcends the flat dimensions of its source material.

By Joe Morgenstern July 29 2011 A romantic comedy of intertwined lives overlapping dialogue and multiple themes--no wonder the filmmakers had their well-publicized problems finding a title--""Crazy Stupid Love"" has more naked contrivances than naked bodies. (Its actually quite innocent despite a facade of edgy sophistication.) For all its implausible twists and turns though the film which was directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa fills its scenes with bright surprises while making an appealing new case for the old-fashioned notion of soul mates. The precipitating event is an unmating. After two decades of ostensibly happy marriage Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) an earnest suburbanite for whom stylish leisure wear means New Balance sneakers discovers that his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) has been unfaithful and wants a divorce. That promises fidelity to a formulaic plot and to Mr. Carells familiar wistfulness. But Dan Fogelmans script takes an abrupt turn to a trendy club where a younger and supremely self-assured womanizer named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) takes pity on the verbosely morose Cal enlists him as his wingman sets out to make him over into a stud and instructs him in the not-so-niceties of the dating game. Why would Jacob do this? Dont ask. If he didnt thered be no movie and no pretext for him pursuing one of the movies main themes ""Im going to help you rediscover your manhood"" he announces to Cal. ENLARGE Kevin Bacon John Carroll Lynch Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell in Crazy Stupid Love. Warner Bros. Pictures Youd expect Mr. Carell to be funny in the pick-up attempts that ensue and he certainly is. The revelation is Mr. Goslings comic chops which come with a gift for tossing off smart lines at impressively high speed. Better still he finds his perfect counterpart in Emma Stone who was sensational as the self-ironic star of ""Easy A"" and is equally so this time in a smaller role that she transforms into a very big deal. She plays Hannah a young woman seemingly set to become one more of Jacobs conquests until they repair to his elegant home. Then they share their huge pleasure with each other in an extended sequence that feeds on the logic of love and grows into the films scintillating centerpiece. Apart from that sequence with its slow build and lovely development ""Crazy Stupid Love"" feeds on the logic of a patchwork quilt--exuberant set pieces punchy vignettes life lessons (seize the initiative be true to yourself fight for what you want) and secret loves that reveal themselves in a climax crazed by design and chaotic beyond measure. Yet the movie also fights for what it wants--to touch us in the course of entertaining us --and it succeeds with its zinger-studded script that transcends clumsy mechanics and a spirited cast that includes Marisa Tomei as a nymphomaniacal middle-school teacher and Jonah Bobo as a lovesick eighth-grader. I checked to see if Master Bobo is really as young as his character and indeed he is but youd never know it from his performance which is eerily witty and scarily wise. The Devils Double Watch a clip of ""Devils Double"" about the man who was forced to become the double of Saddam Husseins son. A special pleasure of the movie medium is watching actors play double or multiple roles Lee Marvin in ""Cat Ballou"" Jeremy Irons in ""Dead Ringers"" Peter Sellers doing three characters in ""Dr. Strangelove"" Alec Guinness doing eight in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets""--the list is long and goes back to the movies earliest days. In this latest example Dominic Cooper is both Uday Hussein the notorious (and happily dead) son of the Iraqi dictator and Udays former classmate Latif Yahia a peaceable Iraqi army lieutenant forced into soul-smothering servitude as Udays ""fiday"" or body double. The dual aspect of Mr. Coopers performance is immensely enjoyable and the film directed by Lee Tamahori--from Michael Thomass adaptation of an autobiographical book by Mr. Yahia--leaves no doubt about Udays vileness. Its star creates a new pinup for the gallery of human perversion a coke-snorting psychopath with a piping voice who fairly vibrates with delight at the depth of his own depravity. ENLARGE Dominic Cooper in The Devils Double. Lionsgate Entertainment Thats the constant in Udays psyche even though his mood may change from one second to the next. Instead of evils banality Mr. Cooper gives us the elation generated by Udays unmoored id as he plucks innocent schoolgirls off a Baghdad street defiles a bride on her wedding day or slaughters his fathers whoremaster in a delirium of displaced rage. Those who admired Mr. Coopers work as Peter Sarsgaards dashing friend and business partner in ""An Education""--I called it ""a supporting performance with star quality""--could not have imagined his achievement here. His remarkable range includes the subtlety of his scenes as Latif as well as Udays malign flamboyance. (Saddam Hussein appears occasionally making oracular pronouncements then vanishes.) ""You are asking me to extinguish myself"" Latif tells Uday at the outset. Thats true enough though Latif tries to function as the conscience of the unconscionable man he has the bad luck to resemble. But far from extinguishment Latif also starts to feel--from the first moment he bursts out of a hotel room in Udays character--the liberation that amorality can bring. The movie isnt deep or particularly intricate; it doesnt play all that much with the potential for mistaken identities and the cruelty it depicts becomes repetitive or worse still desensitizing. But ""The Devils Double"" does give us indelible images of Udays decadence--the filmmakers say theyre understated--and a double dip of dazzling acting. Cowboys amp; Aliens Watch a clip of Universal Pictures ""Cowboys and Aliens"". For the first half-hour this misbegotten mash-up of movie genres sticks to its six-shooters. A stranger comes to town in the Wild West of the late 19th century a mysterious and imposing stranger played by Daniel Craig. He must have a name but he cant remember it or anything else; his mind has been mysteriously wiped clean. Speaking barely above a whisper he evokes Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. But hes a man with no charm in a movie with no verve whether its poking along in joyless homage to classic Westerns or losing its way amid digital swarms of generic extraterrestrials whove made a home base on the range while they plunder our planets gold. (Jon Favreau who mined rich veins of humor in the first ""Iron Man"" directed from a script that five writers adapted from a comic book.) Cowboys versus aliens is a concept that may make you smile in anticipation but wipe that smile off your face before buying your ticket because the film takes its subject seriously--deadly seriously in the case of Harrison Ford who plays a nasty rancher with the snarls and scowls that have become his trademarks as if in penance for being so charming in the past. One interesting twist has a posse of cowboys teaming up with the Apaches they fear in order to vanquish the aliens but the storytelling punctuated by incoherent flashbacks is often inscrutable Im still trying to figure out which side of the cosmos gave birth to the woman played by Olivia Wilde. Youll be glad to know that the good guys win though you may be offended as I was by the misplaced homage of the aliens rocket which blows up during a hasty departure. Its jagged trail precisely mimics the smoke plume from space shuttle Challengers doomed flight. Point Blank Watch a clip from ""Point Blank"" a French chase movie set in the subways and streets of Paris. If you lop off the closing credits of Fred Cavayes preposterously exciting--and pleasingly preposterous--French-language thriller the running time is a mere 80 minutes. Not since ""Run Lola Run"" has the term been used more aptly. Throughout ""Point Blank"" which starts with men running men plus at least one female cop run around and beneath the streets of Paris at a frantic pace. One of the two main runners is Samuel (Gilles Lellouche) a hospital nurses aide studying for his nursing certificate. Thanks to his not-so-random act of kindness--saving a patients life--Samuels pregnant wife is kidnapped and he must find her before shes killed. His companion a criminal named Sartet is played by Roschdy Zem a powerful actor I first admired in Rachid Boucharebs ""Days of Glory."" What links them is too intricate to explain here and why in any case wouldnt you want to find out on your own? Suffice it to say that the two men need one another--think ""The Defiant Ones"" without chains--and the climactic chase is complicated by a city-wide crime wave that turns into a crime tsunami. Watch a clip from ""Life in a Day"" a documentary compiled from footage shot all around the world depicting life on July 24 2010. Life in a Day Kevin Macdonalds documentary imposes a semblance of unity on a planet of unfathomable diversity. ""Life in a Day"" is a diary of life on Earth as recorded by videographers all over the world on the same day--July 24 2010--and uploaded to YouTube for subsequent winnowing and editing. (The editor was Joe Walker.) The film treats our species generously for the most part--no videos of troops firing on funeral processions though one segment depicts a cows demise in a slaughterhouse while another touches on Germanys Love Parade tragedy when 19 techno fans died during a stampede. Love of life suffuses the footage as it should. From his bed in a cardiac intensive care unit an elderly man struggles to express his gratitude for how well hes been treated. A boozer on a bench at dawn calls it ""the best day ever"" even though he must consult his cellphone for the date. A shoeshine boy loves his laptop for the information it brings. ""Its a Wikipedia"" the kid says gleefully. ""Its a giant library."" ENLARGE Virginia Salvado Segu one of the many ordinary people in Life in a Day. National Geographic Entertainment Does the film add up to something more than a stunt? Maybe not. I was captivated by the several hours I recently saw of Christian Marclays 24-hour-long ""The Clock"" a video mashup in which thousands of clips from hundred of movies contain watches and clocks telling the same time that spectators can read on their wrists. ""Life in a Day"" doesnt aspire to such intricacy but its fascinating all the same an electronic update of Alexander Popes maxim that the proper study of mankind is man. DVD FOCUS Fracture (2007) ENLARGE Ryan Gosling is Willy Beachum a young assistant district attorney in this battle of wits between men of matching arrogance. Anthony Hopkins is Willys adversary Ted Crawford a structural analyst for the airline industry whos been arrested for what may prove to be the perfect crime. By suggesting unplumbed depths while Willy is still navigating the shallows of careerism Mr. Gosling sets up his character for a heroism thats fueled in equal measure by shrewd thinking and clear feeling. Gregory Hoblit directed from a screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers. The cast includes Rosamund Pike and Cliff Curtis. Tamara Drewe (2010) One year after his appearance in ""An Education"" Dominic Cooper played a fatuous rock star in this bucolic frolic directed by Stephen Frears. (Moira Buffini adapted a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which was in its turn a contemporary riff on Thomas Hardys ""Far From the Madding Crowd."") Gemma Arterton is Tamara who returns to the Wessex village of her birth with a cute new nose and newfound confidence to go with it. Once an ugly duckling known to the locals as Beaky she is now absurdly glamorous and given her erotic ambitions extremely dangerous. Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig became a star when he played James Bond in this thoroughly modern action epic that also functions as a prequel to all the others. His Bond starts out as a stone killer--The Spy Who Came In From the Warmth--though his heart is touched if not quite pierced by Vesper Lynd a lissome mostly cool British Treasury official played superbly by Eva Green. Mads Mikkelsen is the villain a cipher named Le Chiffre who channels money to the worlds terrorists while betraying little more than mournful menace. Martin Campbell directed stylishly.

(AP Photo/Universal Studios-Dreamworks II Distribution) <<1234>>If you miss ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" you will not be deprived of a great moment in cinema. You certainly wont be committing a crime against popular culture if you wait until it comes out on DVD.But the film which gallops into theaters this weekend amid much fanboy buzz and non-fanboy bemusement (Cowboys vs. aliens? Really?) actually works as a pure popcorn flick. Over its 1-hour 58-minute running time ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" is never less than an entertaining diversion. And while it isnt as smart or as sharply witty as you might hope given the credentials of those involved in making it it is a rousing good time at the movies. In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Another Earth Attack the Block Cameraman The Life and Work of Jack Cardiff Cowboys amp; Aliens Crazy Stupid Love Gunless Life Above All Life in a Day A Little Help The Names of Love The Smurfs The Tree Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Based very loosely on a 2006 graphic novel created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and written by Fred Van Lente and Andrew Foley the film is entirely what the title suggests a traditional Western in which the bad guys are big nasties from outer space. The filmmakers -- director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"") cinematographer Matthew Libatique and principal writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (the reboot of ""Star Trek"") and Damon Lindelof (""Lost"") -- go to considerable lengths to ground the movie in the mythos of the Old West as seen through the lens of Hollywood. The imagery evokes films from John Fords ""The Searchers"" to Sergio Leones spaghetti Westerns to such recent efforts as ""310 to Yuma."" And the main (human) characters are immediately recognizable and relatable the Man With No Name the town boss a saloonkeeper named Doc a preacher handy with a gun a mysterious frontier woman who may be up to no good.Advertisement Set in the Arizona Territory of the mid-1870s the Man With No Name (Daniel Craig that James Bond guy) wakes up in the middle of the desert with no memory and a strange bracelet attached to his wrist. After a confrontation with some raggedy human bad guys he ends up with new duds a six-gun a horse and a scruffy dog named Dog.Then like all good Western heroes before he rides into a small town called Absolution and finds himself caught in the tensions between the townspeople and powerful rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) whose son Percy (Paul Dano) is a punk and a bully. Lessons are taught and Percy ends up getting tossed in jail by the local sheriff (Keith Carradine one of several cool casting choices).But the sheriff also discovers the Man With No Name has one -- Jake Lonergan -- and he is the most wanted man in the territory. So our hero gets slapped in the hoosegow with Percy. Just as the two are about to be shipped off to the federal marshal a mightily unhappy Dolarhyde shows up with his heavily armed ranch hands. It looks like an old-fashioned shootout -- until the aliens arrive do an urban renewal job on the town and snatch a bunch of the townfolk.After the dust settles those left standing do whats spelled out in Western 101 They form a posse to track the aliens and rescue their kin.What follows is great fun orchestrated with a deft touch by Favreau. The chase eventually involves Lonergans old outlaw gang and an Indian tribe that also is mightily unhappy with the visitors from another planet and culminates in a rousing showdown between the unlikely band of brothers and the aliens. One key to the films success is that the cast generally plays it perfectly straight with only the occasional wink and nod to the crazy mash-up of genres. Craig and Ford -- action heroes of two different generations -- play off each other with ease. The camera loves Olivia Wilde (""Thirteen"" on TVs ""House"") who manages a certain otherworldly quality as Ella the mystery woman. Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") has fun moments as the nervous saloonkeeper and there is enough breathing room in the chase for such stellar character actors as Walton Goggins (""Justified"" ""The Shield"") and Clancy Brown (""Carnivale"" ""Lost"") to shine in small parts. There are problems along the way which keep the film from being better than good. Most importantly the CGI-created aliens arent very distinctive; kind of a cross between the ones in ""Aliens"" and ""Predator."" Some of the scenes dont have the sharp-edged wit or emotional resonance that you would expect from writers as talented as Orci Kurtzman and Lindelof. And there are moments when homage lapses into cliche.Still there is enough to like and to savor in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" that it makes for an enjoyable two hours in the dark with a big bag of buttery popcorn.Cowboys amp; aliens Rating PG-13 (for sci-fi violence and action and partial nudity)Cast Daniel Craig Harrison Ford Olivia Wilde and Sam RockwellDirector Jon FavreauRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The outlaw the sheriff the country doctor various tribes of American Indians the outcast prostitute We know them all through decades of repetition and occasional variation. Cowboys and Aliens the loud new action genre mash-up directed by Jon Favreau manages to flatten these frequently warring icons into a team with a common enemy. Its 1873 and aliens are invading Arizona Territory. Theyd better have their papers ready.Tedious in the manner of so many summer blockbusters that rely on the same action beats and large doses of CGI mayhem Cowboys and Aliens based on the 2006 graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg still manages to have a great deal of fun with the definitive American genre. Guns are cocked and horses gallop at full stride and volume. Wind-swept valleys and canyons in New Mexico provide the epic backdrop. (Its not quite John Fords Monument Valley but then what is?) Meanwhile nasty space critters fly over the land sucking townsfolk into svelte ships for nefarious purposes.Daniel Craig channeling his inner Steve McQueen cool is the lonely gunslinger who wakes up in the desert with a nasty gash a strange bracelet a bad case of amnesia and a talent for hand-to-hand combat. In another era hed be Jason Bourne. Here hes a variation on Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name and with no memory of whence he came. Soon he finds himself in Absolution a frontier town ruled by a growling cattle baron (Harrison Ford gnashing into a villainous part) and his sniveling son (Paul Dano who can snivel with the best). Favreau and crew clearly went on a steady Western diet to prep for Cowboys and Aliens and these opening scenes before the action-movie requirements kick in are the most vivid in the movie.Cowboys and Aliens gets bloated and silly as it gallops toward the climactic showdown between unlikely posse and nasty invaders which are designed with a knowing nod toward the Alien movies. Id love to see a version of this story with a little less budget and a little more imagination; constant explosions and digital warfare have a way of sucking the soul from potentially weird movies.Nonetheless its a pretty fun ride. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique a frequent collaborator of Favreau Darren Aronofsky and Spike Lee paints with shadow well enough to give Cowboys and Aliens texture despite the CGI overload; he also has a grasp of the Westerns scope and sense of motion. Craig Ford and Olivia Wilde who plays a strangely luminous stranger bring touches of recognizable humanity. But if you really want to scare away the aliens why not just call up Deadwoods Al Swearengen and have him say a few words? The slimy poachers wouldnt know what hit em. Then again neither would the ratings board.On Twitter chrisvognarCowboys and AliensB Starring Daniel Craig Harrison Ford Olivia Wilde Sam Rockwell Adam Beach Keith Carradine and Paul Dano.

If that all sounds exciting think again.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune July 29 2011 -- 1100am Timothy White ASSOCIATED PRESS - AP Harrison Ford left and Daniel Craig in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Action-packed yet curiously lifeless ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" shoots blanks. This multitasking genre mash-up successfully unites its discordant elements in a coherent dramatic universe. Despite a stellar cast and out-of-this-world production values however its a saddle-weary horse opera and a low-gravity space opera. Lacking the high-flying zing of Joss Whedons space-western TV series ""Firefly"" the movie is competent but never compelling. Daniel Craig plays a hard-bitten gunslinger who wakes up in the desert with no memory of his past but with a mysterious mechanical wristlet he cant remove. Making his way to the frontier town of Absolution he encounters meek saloon owner Sam Rockwell true-blue sheriff Keith Carradine trigger-happy town bully Paul Dano and the punks father malevolent cattle baron Harrison Ford. Five characters 4 1/2 cliches. Guns are drawn and conflicts are set in gear. Then comes the movies most unexpected and successful set piece. A formation of glowing lights in the night sky blitzes the town. Blue lasers strafe Main Street buildings explode and mechanical lassos ensnare a dozen terrified bit players lifting them into the darkness and who knows what terrible fate. Craigs bracelet comes to life during the blitz Its a weapon capable of downing an alien fighter. The survivors track the uncanny attackers back to their hideout. As the story proceeds Fords hard-man character is humanized. He reveals disappointment in his haywire son and feels a stronger bond to his trusted hired hand Adam Beach. This is a psychological complexity on loan from the fine James Stewart western ""The Man From Laramie."" Here it makes no sense. In scene after scene we have observed Fords quick temper and take-no-prisoners grit. Why didnt he raise his son according to his lights or knock some sense into the whelp? This is not unruly humanity it is blind inconsistency. The settlers band together with an outlaw gang and Indians to rescue the abductees. The big showdown arrives and disappoints. Horses fly and stuntmen fall. A child who has ridden into danger alongside the adults (the unlikeliest event in this fantasy film) gets to use his new Bowie knife. The aliens are as undifferentiated as the redskins of old clay pigeons for the good guys. I havent mentioned the acting. There isnt much. Craig has become a specialist in dour killers. Here he wears chaps. Ford always contributes an honest days work but here hes like a contractor supplied with substandard materials. As the Billy the Kid-style psycho Dano provides a flare of interest to the proceedings and Clancy Brown is ticklishly funny as a wry whiskey-swilling preacher. Neither gets the screen time he deserves. Even the reliably vivid Rockwell is colorless. Most of the players are ciphers. You felt a pang of loss for each doomed killer in ""The Wild Bunch."" ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" races to its happy ending casualties forgotten. The alien fighter who crashed onto Main Street? Gone. Its as if the film passed through the amnesia machine itself.

""Its like Jaws but on a spaceship"" Alien. Then the hybrid blossoms into its own format until it devolves and devours its own with Alien vs. Predator and finally collapses exhausted into the heap of Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus. Thats what happens when moviemakers take Spenglers theory of the rise and decline of nations and use it as a business model. The title Cowboys amp; Aliens -- suggesting a merger of the cowboys-and-Indians Western genre with science fiction -- triggered the salivary glands of some very important film people. As packed as the cast list is with stars (Daniel Craig Harrison Ford) and vaunted character actors (Sam Rockwell Keith Carradine Paul Dano) its fair to say theres more movie muscle behind the camera. Steven Spielberg Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are among the producers. The director Jon Favreau did Iron Man and Elf. The quintet of writers who receive script credit include guys who had worked on Star Trek The Proposal Lost Alias and the Transformers and Mission Impossible series. Now all they had to do was dream up a movie that lived up to its title. The film takes its name from a recent graphic novel ""created"" by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg that imagines an alien race has landed in Arizona in 1873 to mine the gold that is even more precious on their planet than on ours. The story intercuts scenes in the alien camp with those involving a ragtag team of earthlings -- hard-bitten cowboys a tribe of Native Americans and a newly-arrived wagon train of settlers -- and pits ray guns against rifles and bows and arrows. Beneath the comic-book sound effects of the weaponry (""SWABAMM"" ""TWONG"" ""KRAKABOOOOM"") the book presses the metaphor of Manifest Destiny with the aliens plundering the West as the white men did the Indians home land. Like many earlier Westerns the Cowboys amp; Aliens novel is a political morality play on horseback. Whats clear is that the filmmakers loved the title hated the book. Prudently deciding that the white folks in the audience wouldnt enjoy the movie so much if they kept being reminded that their ancestors were guilty of genocide the writers cobbled a new story with more familiar contours. Now the hero is a nameless bravado (Craig) wandering into the frontier town of Absolution and helping the locals and some nearby Indians fight off the invaders from another planet. The outpost is stocked with attractive stereotypes the gruff sheriff (Carradine) the meek saloonkeeper (Rockwell) and his loving Latina wife (Ana de la Reguera) the imperious cattle baron Dolarhyde (Ford) his wastrel son (Dano) and a smart Indian (Adam Beach) hes adopted. Also a preacher (Chris Browning) a pretty girl (Olivia Wilde) and a kid (Noah Ringer) -- the whole sagebrush ensemble from Gene Autry or John Ford pictures reunited for a retro movie with a nine-figure budget. At first the man with no name and his mysterious alien bracelet suggest a Western remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still what if the Clint-Eastwoodian stranger who upends a Western town were an extraterrestrial? But its soon revealed that he is the all-too-human renegade Jake Lonergan wanted for many a nefarious crime and more important ripe for redemption. So are the townspeople who like rival members of a platoon band together to fight the otherworldly intruders. The Absolutionists also need to free their loved ones whove been abducted by the aliens both for purposes of research and as expression of an intergalactic Bad Neighbor policy. In its first half when its content to plunder favorite Western tropes the movie provides some vagrant pleasures. The supporting actors savor each element of their characters as if it were the tastiest tobacco chaw. (Kudos in passing to Rockwell Browning Beach and Ringer.) Lonergans entry into the Absolution saloon plays like a live-action reprise of a similar scene in Rango with Johnny Depp voicing a cowboy chameleon; but that just proves the sturdiness of the genre and the ability of modern filmmakers to honor and tweak Western conventions. And when tough-guy Craig confronts mean-man Ford its like the world champion glare-off of steely blue eyes. In Hollywoods ancient prime maybe a third of all movies were Westerns. But those days are as dead as the horse-mounted cavalry; in the past 30 years the genre has been resuscitated only when some powerful director wanted to make a movie like the ones he grew up loving. So Cowboys amp; Aliens has got to get to the aliens pretty damn quick. Even here Favreau and his crew sprinkle a few memorable moments the aliens low-flying scout planes looking like 10-winged titanium dragonflies and lassoing the townspeople for abduction; a desert vision of an upside-down steamship which momentarily summons the ghost of Werner Herzogs Fitzcarraldo; and the recurring image of Craig retrieving his cowboy hat whether hes fighting off human varmints or escaping from the aliens stronghold. A man aint a man without his Stetson. Gradually though the movie sinks into ordinariness serving up too many Spielbergian reaction shots of each cast member gawking or gulping at an alien encounter and too many moral lessons that must be learned or taught. Cowboys amp; Aliens is the kind of movie where anything that happens in Act One (the kid is given a knife the saloonkeeper doesnt know how to shoot) will predictably pay off in Act Three. And why is the ancient wisdom of Indian shamans always taken at face value? Modern movies usually mock a Christians belief in miracles; yet the summoning of spirits by aboriginal Americans here as in other Westerns is shown as a certain conduit to another higher world. These cliches test the attention span of viewers and force them into the fallback job of seeing how the actors are doing. Wilde as an ethereal cowgirl with a few mysteries of her own has not a trace of 19th-century dust on her slim frame but her runway beauty seizes the screen. Craig in the interval between his last James Bond movie and his starring role in David Finchers remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo occupies the Lonergan character forcefully though his appeal still stops just this side of star quality. And Ford as hes done ever since the early Star Wars movies overindulges in scowling and growling. He should know by now that his weathered face is its own cranky editorial comment. We wish that the movie had lived up to our expectations and its makers ambitions. But in films as in foods some hybrids make sense and others dont. Cowboys amp; Aliens could have been the tangelo of genre-blenders. Instead its more like the Jimmy Dean Chocolate Chip Pancake amp; Sausage on a Stick.

Here i was pumped for an awesome thing but it seemed almost as awkward as the 4th Indiana Jones i mean i was a good film and it was entertaining but it left a LOT of questions. Why did they need gold? Why did they take humans and aliens as prisoners? What was the glowing sack of goo that basically moonblinked the people? Near the end how did Jake get off the table he was strapped to and get the shotgun? Oh well it was good enough Katysaid on Wednesday September 28 2011 113816 PMThis movie was horrible in the most awesome kind of way. Anthony Coviellosaid on Saturday August 06 2011 13833 PMI didnt like it as much. I do agree with how I cared about all but two of the major characters. I just didnt like Daniel Craig or Olivia Wilde. Craig pretty much play his verion of Bond in the Wild West (And I dont like him as Bond.) And Olivia was pretty much a robot. Also adding your negatives from your review I would give it a high C or low B. This is just my personal opinion it still was an enjoyable film.

More about Cowboys and Aliens >> Or maybe he was abducted by invaders from another planet and managed to escape and cant right remember who he is or what happened to him you reckon? Yup. Think Ill spit out my tabacky juice just about now. Cowboys amp; Aliens the title-says-it-all mash-up of two rich and venerable movie genres westerns and sci-fi begins thusly in the wide-open Arizona desert. Its the 1870s and the mystery man in question isnt about to sit around and let these sagebrush thugs cart him off. Seems the stranger - kind of looks like Daniel Craig - has some serious hand-to-hand combat skills. Before the trusty cattle dog thats looking on can blink twice he has disarmed dismounted and dispensed with the three cowpokes. And disrobed one of them to wear his vest hat and chaps. Directed by Jon Favreau of the rollicking Iron Man franchise (in fact Craigs wrist gizmo looks like it was pilfered from Tony Starks lab) Cowboys amp; Aliens is based on a comic book and graphic novel. The screenplay credit goes to seven (yes seven) writers which is at least five too many. Tonally the movie is off not quite as sober and majestic as the John Ford westerns its inspired by nor as ironic and irreverent as well Favreaus two Iron Man films. Instead its somewhere in between neither fish nor fowl (nor extraterrestrial) and thats a problem. Craig handsomely craggy plays it straight and like Eastwoods Man With No Name he doesnt have much to say (""I dont want any trouble"" is about as epic as he gets) so the British star moonlighting from Bond manages to walk through this business with his integrity intact. Not so Harrison Ford as the powerful rancher whose callow son (Paul Dano) gets lassoed by the space-jockeys in their metallic dragonfly ships. Ford who probably jostled elbows with this very same alien scum at the Mos Eisley Cantina runs around popping his eyeballs like Gabby Hayes exclaiming ""Jesus Mary and Joseph"" while hes at it. Sporting a scruffy stubble and a crusty demeanor he seems less concerned about ""the machines that took our kin"" than with just keeping up with Craig as they trot around the high country. And then theres Olivia Wilde as the mysterious woman whos been shadowing Craig since their first encounter in the town saloon. (Maybe she just wants to get close enough to see whos got the bluer eyes - shes definitely got the whiter teeth.) Wildes Ella it can be noted is fluent in Chiricahua Apache and when it comes time to battle the evil ETs shes the one who encourages the townsfolk the outlaws and the Indians to all work together. They could use her negotiating skills in Washington right now. And as for the aliens enough already Its time for Hollywoods storyboard artists and visual effects geeks to rethink the menacing intergalactic monster look. With their blurry CGIed movement and Alien-meets-Terminator appearance the title terrors of Cowboys amp; Aliens are unconvincing uninteresting totally generic. However their giant towering rocket ship planted upright in the picturesque canyons is another story. It looks like Frank Lloyd Wright had a hand in the design and thats pretty cool.

"Cowboys and Aliens movie review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Cowboys pits Craig and Fords six-guns against ray-gunsCowboys amp; Aliens a 3 starsJuly 28 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticHarrison Ford and Daniel Craig in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens.""Wait cowboys and aliens? In the face of constant competitive challenges the movie industry clings to a handful of truths among them Sex sells; concessions pay the bills; Taylor Lautner may have trouble headlining a movie on his own; and a film can deal in cowboys or it can traffic in aliens but probably it cannot accommodate both. Just because no ones tried it before doesnt mean its worth trying. And yet ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" in which Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford take on creatures from another genre turns out to be the unlikeliest good movie of the year. The component genre parts coexist excitingly without veering into camp or facetious desperation. Alien-invasion aficionados should be pleased. Western nostalgists may be pleasantly surprised. Fans of cowboys-versus-aliens movies well its been a long wait and heres your movie. The 2006 Platinum Studios Comics graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and written by Fred Van Lente and Andrew Foley has been stripped for parts and used as a mere outline for a newly hatched tale of a desperado played by Craig who wakes up one day in the New Mexico Territory desert (the year is 1875) with a strange metallic weapon locked to his forearm and no memory of a recent alien encounter. It all comes back to him in due course. Ford is the rapacious cattle baron who rules the dinky mining town of Absolution but who has a heart somewhere in there underneath all that leathery guff. He gets his chance to prove it when an uneasy alliance of hold-up artists ranch hands and townsfolk (Sam Rockwell plays Doc the saloonkeeper and no one could play a saloonkeeper named Doc better) conspires to send the aliens -- prospectors of a highly evolved sort -- back to their alien land. First though Craig the mysterious woman portrayed by Olivia Wilde (she of the piercing otherworldly gaze) and the Civil War veteran played by Ford must retrieve friends and loved ones abducted in the films first big action sequence. Youll know by the end of this early scene featuring crablike 10-legged flying spacecraft equipped with a sophisticated form of lasso if youre in or youre out. Directed by Jon Favreau ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" is one of this years many big-budget projects executive produced by Steven Spielberg. As in ""Super 8"" (also executive produced by Spielberg) Favreaus film freely samples much of Spielbergs own storied career from ""Close Encounters"" on out. Favreau and his quintet of credited screenwriters also riff on half the Westerns ever made notably ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers"" plus various less monumental efforts. The movie cannot quite support its attempts to take the milieu and the mythology as seriously as all that. Yet Favreau a workmanlike but improving director when it comes to shaping complex matters of visual mayhem has an ace in the hole revealed in among others the first ""Iron Man."" He knows how to get audiences to take absurd conceits seriously without killing them with solemnity. That said the aliens here are damn frightening and certain moments involving an innocent wide-eyed ""Shane""-bred boy and various near-death experiences recall ""Alien"" ""Predator"" and a few other movies too rough for 11- or 12-year-olds. The violence stays heavy and fairly brutal throughout even when its old-fashioned non-alien Western violence. Graphic novel creator Rosenberg published the ""Men in Black"" comics back in the early 1990s; ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" works with a somewhat heavier touch than for example Barry Sonnenfeld brought to the first ""Men in Black"" movie. Yet I admire Favreaus insistence on grounding this cockamamie premise in a world we can believe in even if its just a movie world. The writers honor the time-honored contours of a variety of different Western tropes among them the gathering of the manhunt posse (or alien hunt); the stranger in town brave and agile and gym-toned enough to set things right; the overmatched but honorable sheriff (Keith Carradine wonderful -- he should be required to make at least one Western a year the rest of his acting life) doing what he can to establish the peace. The climax involves Native Americans and their oppressors coming together to fight a common apolitical enemy (the graphic novel drew more explicit parallels between Manifest Destiny and interstellar colonization) and it couldve used a 10-minute shave. Yet Craig and Ford bring the gravitas the sterling supporting cast brings the color and the drooling aliens who have little claws hidden inside their stomachs bring the novelty and ick factors. Call it ""How the West Was Overrun or Nearly."" Its a disarming mash-up. mjphillipstribune.com Cowboys amp; Aliens -- 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of western and sci-fi action and violence some partial nudity and a brief crude reference) Cast Daniel Craig (Jake Lonergan); Harrison Ford (Col.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Cowboys amp; Aliens Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2011 A marriage of western and pulp sci-fi archetypes this Independence Day knockoff set in the Old West is almost exactly what youd expect. The filmmakers here (including Iron Man director Jon Favreau five credited writers and countless special-effects technicians) dont seem to have agreed on whether theyre paying homage to these genres or mocking them; the movie ambles from one familiar setup to another as if out of duty. Playing a variation on John Waynes character from Red River Harrison Ford gives an understandably bewildered performance often appearing uncertain if he should take his lines seriously. Some of the other actors (Daniel Craig Sam Rockwell) manage a little better.

"Cowboys amp; Aliens | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cowboys-aliens ) Cowboys amp; Aliens (United States 2011) July 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Cowboys amp; Aliens is a mashup of a mediocre Western and a mediocre science fiction story. The resulting film is far better than the sum of its two seemingly disparate parts. Although a little overlong the production will find favor not only with lovers of its root genres but with those just looking for a not-too-demanding good time. Although the title sounds jokey thats where the comedic element ends. Director Jon Favreau keeps the tone light but aside from the occasional low-key gag or one-liner the humor is never allowed to upstage the more serious elements. Marketing for Cowboys amp; Aliens may trumpet the pairing of Indiana Jones and James Bond (much as it did when Sean Connery joined Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) but neither lead actor is playing his character here the way he might in a franchise film. Ford looking grizzled with his unshaven stubble is not apt to remind anyone of Indy or Han Solo especially once we learn that his alter-ego Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde isnt the nicest of men. Meanwhile Daniel Craig may go through the entire film without cracking a smile. His Jake Lonergan is not guilty of everything of which he has been accused but he is an outlaw and hes out for revenge. Come to think of it maybe hes not that different from Quantum of Solaces 007. Favreau works magic interweaving the two genres showing equal respect for both. Western conventions entwine with science fiction ones. One moment were looking at an image pilfered from Alien; the next were watching a shadow of The Searchers. The way in which extraterrestrial involvement is explained in the 19th century uses religion rather than science as its lynchpin which is understandable. What we would call ""aliens"" in 2011 are regarded as ""demons."" Still the reaction to Lonergans plasma weapon (or whatever kind of ""ray gun"" it is) is surprisingly understated bordering on nonchalant. Cowboys amp; Aliens has a great hook. Lonergan awakens in the middle of nowhere with a bloody wound in his side a strange bracelet on his left arm and no memory of anything except that he can speak English. An encounter with a group of would-be bounty hunters lets us know hes a man to be reckoned with. When he arrives at the nearest town he refuses to back down when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano) the arrogant son of Colonel Dolarhyde insults him. This sets off a chain of circumstances pitting Lonergan against Dolarhyde until the aliens arrive in explosive fashion and forge them into reluctant allies. Meanwhile a townswoman named Ellie (Olivia Wilde) is inordinately interested in Lonergan regaining his memory and its apparent she knows more than shes saying about the ""demons"" and the ""bracelet"" Lonergan uses to destroy them. The movie which has at its roots a comic book is backed by a number of highly respected names including (but not limited to) Steven Spielberg (Executive Producer) Ron Howard (Producer) and Brian Grazer (Producer). Included in the gaggle of screenwriters are the men responsible for Transformers and its first sequel but dont hold that against them - they also wrote the Star Trek re-boot. Thankfully this is one of their better efforts although its difficult to say how much of the final product is theirs. Like Super 8 theres a ""Spielbergian"" feel to Cowboys amp; Aliens although here its less of an homage and more of a natural byproduct of the storyline and the participation of Ford. On a technical level Cowboys amp; Aliens is strong. The CGI creatures owe (like seemingly all extraterrestrials these days) a nod to H.R. Geiger although its not as evident when we see them in wide shots running down horses as it is in shadowy close-ups. Matthew Libatique has lensed the film as he might a Western with careful detail paid to the awe-inspiring landscape and the town wanting to fade into black-and-white (although I didnt notice if there were any stray tumbleweeds around). Harry Gregson-Williams score is forceful melding John Williams and Elmer Bernstein. Cowboys amp; Aliens has a strong start and an action/special effects-packed climax but there are times in the middle when it drags - especially during scenes when Lonergan reunites with his old gang and the Cowboys and Indians are forced to merge. Several instances have surprising dramatic heft - not enough to bring a tear to the eye but enough to mark this as more than a forgettable piece of cinematic fluff. Its a solidly engaging and well produced spectacle that puts to shame some of its bigger and flashier predecessors on this long depressing 2011 Summer Blockbuster Road. And since its not available in 3-D the only way to see it is the best way to see it and thats worth a solid recommendation.

Timothy White Harrison Ford (left) and Daniel Craig in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" (DreamWorks Pictures) I can still picture a junior-year parent-teacher conference. In the nicest way my math instructor told my parents ""Your son tried really hard this semester but I just dont think he understands trigonometry.""Thats the academic report on ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" a movie that tries hard with some exciting moments and beautiful scenery but one that never comes together into a unified piece of filmmaking.The film opens with lone cowboy Jake (Daniel Craig) waking up in the Arizona desert in the mid-1870s with no memory of who he is and nothing but an odd-looking piece of metal attached to his wrist as a potential clue. Making his way to a town run by an empirical cattle baron (Harrison Ford) and his obnoxious son (Paul Dano) Jake discovers he is a wanted man a fact not lost on the sheriff (Keith Carradine). He arrests both Jake and the barons son for accidentally shooting someone. But just when Dad rides into town to rescue his son -- WHAM -- Main Street is attacked by alien spaceships and humans are abducted.What we have after that scene is a parade of every remaining cliche in cowboy films and alien movies.There is a gun-toting beauty (Olivia Wilde) a milquetoast Eastern transplant (Sam Rockwell) an Indian tracker (Adam Beach) a boy on the verge of manhood a tribe set on killing the white man who destroyed their land Civil War horror stories and even a comedic outlaw gang. On the alien side you have high-tech probes slimy creatures with menacing orifices darting X-fighters and a monolithic mothership.One of the two major problems with the film is its conceptual foundation Aside from the idea of mixing two well-loved genres there is not a single original thought. The creators seem to have turned off their creative juices after identifying as many genre set pieces as possible. The second flaw follows from the first Director Jon Favreau working with a script that credits six people never manages to cobble those cliche-driven scenes into a cogent narrative. So much time is spent early in the film laying them out that Favreau has to let some story lines die to keep the film moving.Favreau -- who hit his directorial stride with the ""Iron Man"" movies -- does provide solid action sequences especially when the X-fighters attack the human posse as they near the mothership. He also composed an eerie unsettling attack on Main Street in the films early stages.The acting falls victim to the unoriginal story though Rockwell has some skillfully funny moments. Fords cattle baron is never truly developed and Craig is merely acceptable as a stoic Man With No Name antihero. Clint Eastwood actually said a lot when he wasnt speaking in those old spaghetti Westerns. Craig still needs to work on that. It would have been nice if ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" had come up with the right equation to balance originality and homage. But in the end it all turned into trigonometry.""Cowboys amp; Aliens""Two stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 153  Content Intense sequences of Western and sci-fi action violence; some partial nudity; brief crude reference Videos Watch a trailer for Cowboys amp; Aliens Jul 28 2011 (...)

"Cowboys amp; Aliens movie review Title says it all about the fun but seriously goofy movie |       NJ.com comments Cowboys amp; Aliens movie review Title says it all about the fun but seriously goofy movie Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 28 2011 at 831 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1105 AM View/Post Comments Zade RosenthalThe cowboys fight for their lives in an event film for summer 2011 that crosses the classic Western with the alien-invasion movie in a blazingly original way ""Cowboys amp; Aliens."" One of the great pleasures of speculative fiction is its introduction of modern concepts into classic conflicts a trick also beloved of Monty Python skits and Spike TVs ""Deadliest Warrior."" (""Suppose Al Capone faced Jesse James..."") ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" -- the winner of this summers most-obvious-title prize -- does exactly that. But its core pleasures dont come from just mixing grizzled gunslingers and goopy monsters. They come from mixing up their genres stereotypes as if some Hollywood hiccup had somehow spliced together ""True Grit"" and ""Starship Troopers."" The Western parts are filled to the 10-gallon brim with cliches -- the ruthless cattle baron the spoled heir the good bad man. The monsters are slithery skittering vaguely buglike giants gushing neon Nickelodeon slime whenever punctured. And they all fight and fight and fight some more. Whats the story about? You didnt just ask that did you? Movie Review Cowboys amp; Aliens (PG-13) Universal (118 min.) Directed by Jon Favreau. With Harrison Ford Daniel Craig. Opens Friday at 1201 a.m. in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Because everything you need to know is in that title -- and nothing the six credited screenwriters here have added to its comic-book framework takes things much beyond that. Basically though the plot has Daniel Craig -- trying very very hard to make us think of Steve McQueen -- waking up in the desert and getting into trouble with the law. And then getting into more trouble with sadistic cattleman Harrison Ford. It looks like someone is going to get shot -- until suddenly a gang of gold-grubbing extraterrestrials starts shooting too. And the two men joined by every Western movie group they can think of (settlers bankrobbers Indians) decide to join forces long enough to kill themselves some of these here varmints. Its all breathlessly silly -- particularly because the movie doesnt dare take a breath and really consider any of it from why the aliens are kidnapping dozens of earthlings at random (at least theres no probing involved) to why none of these uneducated 19th-century folks finds any of this particularly hard to accept. Yet in the midst of this happy nonsense old Harrison Ford actually gives a real rich performance as the cattleman an ex-Army man with some serious issues. (When we meet him hes about to have someone pulled apart by horses.) Hes something rare in summer movies -- an actual character -- and I would have loved to have seen an entire movie about him. He has enough conflict and drama all by himself without a bunch of giant preying-mantis invaders cluttering up the screen. But thats the kind of movie that Clint Eastwood used to make not the sort that Jon Favreau -- auteur of both ""Iron Man"" flicks -- makes millions from. So instead we get monsters and explosions and sound effects so amped up that every time Craig hits someone it sounds like he just smashed a watermelon with a sledgehammer. Really whos doing the sound editing here? Gallagher? But put that out of your mind -- in fact put most of this out of your mind -- and you can still have a relatively good silly time. Its like a double feature but with all the boring bits taken out and all the fight scenes run together. It doesnt make much sense. But it does make two hours go by in a painless blur.

Share Tweet The title of Cowboys amp; Aliens has been a subject of mockery since the movie was announced but really its a great example of truth in advertising. You want cowboys and aliens in the same movie? This ones for you. If you want anything beyond what the title promises look elsewhere. And that means even anything resembling a clever mash-up of established genres. Cowboys amp; Aliens has cowboys and aliens aplenty but its too beholden to the rhythms of 21st-century summer blockbusters to be satisfying as either a Western or a piece of science fiction. Working from a script by a long string of credited writers that includes everyone from Steve Oedekerk (Patch Adams Kung Pow Enter The Fist) the ubiquitous team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Transformers Fringe) and Losts Damon Lindelof Jon Favreau directs as if he didnt really give much thought to the movie beyond assembling a bunch of pistol-toting men and some CGI effects and letting things run their inevitable course. They do dully in spite of a supporting cast that includes Clancy Brown Sam Rockwell Paul Dano Keith Carradine Adam Beach and Walton Goggins who would all probably appear in Westerns all the time if anyone made them anymore. Its the top of the bill that gives the film trouble. Daniel Craig plays an amnesia-stricken cowboy who wakes up wearing an odd metal shackle on his wrist and has no memory of how he ended up alone in the desert. Stumbling into a frontier town the gruff inexpressive Craig stirs up trouble when he stands up to Dano the loutish drunken son of the gruffer even-less-expressive Harrison Ford playing a cattle baron whose money keeps the town afloat. When aliens attack the town roping its citizens like cattle and whisking them away to parts unknown Craig and Ford band together for the common good. Its an ill-considered pairing They have such similar screen presences that Cowboys amp; Aliens often feels like a peanut-butter-and-peanut-butter sandwich and the films weirdly solemn tone takes its cues from the leads. The cast of characters around Ford and Craig exists primarily so Favreau can field-marshal everyone toward a cowboys-vs.-aliens climax (with some Native Americans thrown in for good measure) thats big on booming noises but short on thrills. This is thin stuff made even thinner by attempts to shoehorn in some obligatory bits of human interest--Olivia Wilde as a love interest for Craig some fatherly business for Ford--between unsatisfying setpieces. The title reads like a checklist. The movie feels like an expanded version of the same.

EnlargeClose By Zade Rosenthal ILM/Universal Studios Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig left) and Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) go gunning for creepy aliens. With Jon Favreau at the helm the films blandness is even more surprising given the style and wit he brought to 2008s IronMan. The notion of space invaders shooting it out with Southwestern tough guys in 1875 would seem a spirited high concept. But sometimes ideas that sound inspired in pitch meetings dont transfer to the screen. Despite striking cinematography by Matthew Libatique an evocative score by Harry Gregson-Williams and a strong lead performance by Daniel Craig no new ground is broken in this Western/sci-fi hybrid. In fact the story is so well-trodden that it sinks into formula as if built on quicksand. The aliens are familiarly anonymous slimy monsters and the cowboys fall neatly into stereotypical categories. But the story starts well and seems headed for a great ride. Craig wakes up with amnesia in the New Mexico Territory desert. He has a strange manacle on his wrist an oozing wound on his side and he is suddenly set upon by a motley trio of outlaws on horseback. Bloody scalps dangle from their belts. Craigs wordless actions here are the films only surprise. The rest is simple and pat. He staggers into the town of Absolution and defends a nervous saloon owner (Sam Rockwell) from a bully (Paul Dano). But their gun-slinging is abruptly halted when aliens in spaceships descend and start abducting townspeople. About the movie Cowboys amp; Aliens   out of fourStars Daniel Craig Harrison Ford Olivia Wilde Sam Rockwell Adam Beach Director Jon Favreau Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of Western and sci-fi action and violence some partial nudity and a crude reference Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Dialogue is terse and predictable and the sci-fi thriller portion is even less compelling than the Western saga. Craig however embodies the tight-lipped cowboy hero as easily as he slipped into the debonair role of James Bond. He has a jot of Indiana Jones about him as well. Indy himself co-stars Harrison Ford plays a tyrannical cattle baron but his grouchy performance is one-note. (Craigs edgy-cool outlaw is the role Ford might have played a couple of decades ago.) Ford and Craig forge an uneasy alliance and head a posse to attack what they think are demons and rescue the snatched folks. Olivia Wilde plays a mysterious woman who follows Craig around. Wilde is one-dimensional; Dano miscast. Only Rockwell and Adam Beach who plays a Native American employed by Ford stand out from a bevy of cardboard supporting roles. The action is poky and unimaginative despite roiling explosions and creepy aliens poking and prodding with their three-fingered appendages. Theres a fine line between hitting the familiar touchstones of a genre and feeling like a reheated cliche. Cowboys amp; Aliens teeters into tepid convention and never makes its way out.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Cowboys amp; Aliens - it sounds like a game youd play in a 21st century backyard. That title the presence of Harrison Ford and the Steven Spielberg imprimatur (hes on board as executive producer) promise blockbuster Americana with a sprinkling of extraterrestrials a cinematic summer picnic suitable for the whole family.Trust me Leave the littlest guys at home because ""E.T. this aint. As directed by Jon Favreau (""Iron Man) ""Cowboys amp; Aliens is a hell-for-leather action film with a healthy serving of scares. It really is ""Aliens on the open plains ""Independence Day for the nations centennial and what the movie lacks in originality and stick-to-your-ribs Western authenticity it makes up for in pell-mell multiplex entertainment.And in Daniel Craig the movie has what feels awfully like the second coming of Steve McQueen. Maybe its the laser blue eyes under the broad forehead or the laconic refusal to speak except when absolutely necessary but Craig has a presence here that feels downright mythic. He plays a badman named Jake Lonergan who wakes up at the start of the movie with an odd stomach wound a strange metal manacle on his wrist and no memory of who he is.Whoever he is hes deadly. Wandering into the nearest town Jake is immediately pulled into the power struggle between stoic Sheriff Taggart (Keith Carradine) and the local cattle baron Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). The sheriff has thrown the colonels no-account son (Paul Dano) into the pokey and daddy aims to break him out.Wait what? Fords playing the villain? For a while yes and the chance to be as mean as he wants to be energizes the star whose storied crankiness finally finds a home. Its a character part and you can sense Fords relief at letting another man shoulder the load. Consciously or not theres a generational passing of the baton just under this movies surface and it helps immensely that Craigs up to the task.Still ""Cowboys amp; Aliens is looking like a fairly uninspired remake of the 1959 John Wayne classic ""Rio Bravo when quite suddenly the spaceship hits the fan. A nighttime showdown on Main Street is interrupted by a distant line of lights on the horizon - an unsettling moment of ""Close Encounters dread in a preelectric society. Then the aliens show their hand. Theyre not the friendly type.One of the pleasures of a pop culture mash-up like this is finding out where the rules of each genre bend break and fuse into new rules. The aliens are big nasty hopfrogs well within the slimy expectations of modern moviegoers but to the cowboys theyre demons possibly from Satan himself. They zip about lassoing humans as if they were runaway cows; late in the film theres a hair-raising scene where Craig has to jump not onto a speeding train but a runaway spacecraft.Its also fun to watch all the Western types whod normally be at one anothers throats gradually pulling together to face the common threat. The films last half-hour is a pitched battle between Us and Them with Us including everyone from placid townfolk to rotten-toothed outlaws to stone-faced Chiricahua fighters. This says ""Cowboys amp; Aliens is how you build community in the Old West. It takes a village to fight the squids.The movie has been imaginatively cast with Sam Rockwell as a milquetoast saloon owner Clancy Brown as a tough town preacher Raoul Trujillo as the warrior chief who bonds with Fords grumpy old soldier. And since this is a Hollywood Western theres an absurdly beautiful mystery woman played by the film industrys babe du jour Olivia Wilde but for once theres a reason the character looks like she just emerged from a Malibu spa.The elements are all there and you come out feeling you got your moneys worth - yet ""Cowboys amp; Aliens never goes over the top into full-blown popcorn greatness. Familiar ingredients stirred together still taste familiar and worse Favreau doesnt have a genuine feel for the genre. The sets and costumes and props all look right but none of it seems lived-in - not the way you sense a real unforgiving frontier hardness in Craigs face. Is it possible that they dont know how to make Westerns in Hollywood anymore? Are the aliens on the prairie us?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr.

But what you hope to see I think is a film that fuses those two familiar pop-movie elements into something with a tasty original flavor -- a genre mash-up thats greater than the sum of its cliches. The first half hour of Cowboys amp; Aliens is promising. The gifted director Jon Favreau coming off the two Iron Man films stages a kind of mini?Rio Bravo set in a dusty mining town full of cowards and bullies and ruled over by a snarling boss named Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Into this Old West haven trundles a man with no name...or rather a terse steel-blue-eyed gunslinger (Daniel Craig) who cant remember his name or anything else. He has no idea how he landed in the desert with a stab wound in his side and a weird metal bracelet locked onto his wrist. But he sure knows how to stare down the local cutthroats as well as a local petticoated dream girl (Olivia Wilde). Just as were getting drawn into the barroom hokum a spaceship lit up like something out of Close ? Encounters of the Third Kind looms in the night sky. But theres nothing friendly about these visitors -- and nothing you havent seen before either in a hundred alien-invasion potboilers. Cowboys amp; Aliens doesnt treat its war of the worlds as spectacular comedy -- or for that matter as innovative action. Unlike say District 9 or Spielbergs War of the Worlds (hes an executive producer here) the film rarely makes your eyes widen in wonder. And ? the whole aliens-on-the-frontier incongruity never comes to much really. There are nifty scenes like the horseback riders battling silvery skeletal airplanes but what Cowboys amp; Aliens lacks is a good story. Basically the characters -- Craigs enigmatic outlaw Fords scowling boss a tribe of Apache -- must put aside their differences to form a posse and defeat the invaders. Who do we care about on screen? For all of Craigs edgy charisma no one. Cowboys amp; Aliens has fun moments but its a plodding entertainment because it mostly tastes like leftovers.

Cowboys amp; Aliens Fair to good Director Jon Favreau. Cast Daniel Craig Harrison Ford Olivia Wilde. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of western and sci-fi action and violence some partial nudity and a brief crude reference. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Daniel Craig Spotlight Harrison Ford Westerns Invasion of the alien movies Fictional Arizonans Which means by extension that its lots of fun. Comic-Con hosts Cowboys amp; Aliens premiere The cowboy part is better than the alien part leaving us with a movie whose set-up is better than its payoff. But director Jon Favreau who directed the ""Iron Man"" films never backs off the premise - aliens attacking cowboys in the Old West an idea so delightfully twisted and perfect it had to come from a graphic novel (and it did by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg). This isnt a goof or a satire. Its cowboys fighting aliens straight up with an assist from Native Americans along the way and everybody takes the whole thing as seriously as if it were ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" or ""The Searchers."" If you added spaceships into the mix. The film begins with a man (Daniel Craig) bolting upright in the middle of nowhere in 1873. He cant remember who he is where he came from or what hes doing here - or why hes wearing a large metallic bracelet on his wrist which he cant remove. Three men show up and threaten him; theyre dispatched quickly and soon the lone quiet man arrives in the town of Absolution in the Arizona Territory. Like most towns in Western movies Absolution isnt welcoming to strangers. The man who has an odd wound in his side gets stitched up by the preacher (Clancy Brown) in time to see Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano) make a drunken ass of himself accidentally shooting a sheriffs deputy. The sheriff (Keith Carradine) arrests him but its more complicated than that - Percy is the son of Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) the crusty old cattle baron who runs the town so trouble is expected. Things get more complicated still when the sheriff realizes that the quiet man with the bracelet is Jake Lonergan wanted for all manner of crimes with a 1 million reward for his capture. Lonergan has no idea who he is of course or what hes done. But hes arrested too and he and Percy are about to be taken off to the federal marshal when the elder Dolarhyde arrives. And then a few minutes later so do the aliens swooping down from the night sky in space ships blasting everything in their paths and abducting townspeople. Whats cool here is that these are a 19th Century version of aliens. When they abduct people they dont beam them up or something so modern. They latch onto them with hooks and ropes and yank them skyward. Its a nice touch. If you didnt guess this is where the crackling-good cowboy movie takes a turn. Lonergan discovers that the thing on his wrist is actually a weapon thats effective against the alien ships and he manages to shoot one down. Its pilot or whatever it is gets away but leaves a trail. With several of their friends and relatives now zooming away in space ships Dolarhyde and others form a posse to hunt down the wounded alien. The party includes Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) a woman who wears a pistol and harbors secrets and Doc (Sam Rockwell) a saloon owner whose wife has been abducted. Cliches start to creep into the story. Rockwell is a truly great actor but when he decides to learn to shoot a gun and cant hit anything you know where that is leading. The group runs across trouble in its pursuit and secrets are revealed but at this point it really is basically just cowboys - along with remnants of a Native American tribe - fighting aliens. Luckily Craig is intriguing as the strong silent type of the Clint Eastwood variety. Ford has fun being an old crank. Rockwell is there mostly for comic relief but as ever he delivers. Wilde is good and Adam Beach has a nice turn as a Native American who works for Dolarhyde and thinks of him as a father figure. But the real star here is the idea and its a pretty swell one. Good for Favreau for taking a chance with the material and for the most part delivering. A mash-up of two storied genres could have been a disaster and ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" isnt. That doesnt mean were ready for ""Buddy Cops amp; Hookers with Hearts of Gold"" but who knows? Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

By Rex Reed  07/26/11 713pm Ford and Craig. Cowboys amp; Aliens is one of the silliest movies ever made but so many otherwise serious people have attached their names to it that as Arthur Miller wrote in Death of a Salesman attention must be paid. Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard are among the tangle of producers whose credits stretch from here to the next millennium the idiotic screenplay boasts no fewer than five writers and although I cannot imagine this farcical fusion of two separate film genres (science fiction and the Western) appealing to anyone over the age of 12 the two marquee lures at the top of the cast list are not exactly part of the bubble gum brigade. So with all the elements in place another in a long line of cinematic comic books could be a surprise hit as it reaches its target audience right up there next to the abysmal Captain America. Never underestimate the desperation of summer moviegoers to escape reality no matter how much they trash their I.Q.s. Theyll do anything to get out of a heat wave. Too bad Mr. Spielberg didnt also direct instead of Jon Favreau a terrible TV actor (Robot Chicken) who has somehow morphed into helming third-rate movies (Iron Man). He doesnt show a single shred of originality as he piles on the cliches in a parody of everything from The Big Country to It Came from Outer Space but the one Cowboys amp; Aliens owes the most to is the low-budget and forgotten The Dead and the Damned in which a meteor lands in the middle of the California Gold Rush and turns everyone into zombies. The result here is equally hilarious but Cowboys amp; Aliens works best when it plays it straight (an idea of Harrison Fords) instead of campy. And so from time to time it actually holds ones attention between the episodes of violence and carnage. One morning in the 1870s Daniel Craig wakes up with amnesia in the desert near Absolution Ariz. (played by New Mexico) wearing a strange metal bracelet attached to his wrist that looks like unisex jewelry at the Newport Beach art show. He has no memory of who he is or where he came from. Hes filthy splattered with blood and barefoot but with a great haircut. Riding alone into town like Shane he quickly attracts the attention of a vicious ruthless cattle baron named Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) his maniacal son (hysterically overacted by the pickle-faced Paul Dano) a comely barfly named Ella (Olivia Wilde) an honest but outnumbered sheriff (Keith Carradine) a well-meaning preacher (Clancy Brown) a nervous nerdy saloon keeper who needs a Valium (Sam Rockwell) and an Indian cowhand (Adam Beach). When the Unknown Man is suddenly recognized as the face on the wanted poster in the local jail--a feared stagecoach robber named Jake Lonergan--the sheriff makes plans to cart him off to the federal marshal. But this is a Western see so Shane doesnt die. Thirty minutes into what looks like a routine sagebrush saga the shackle on Mr. Craigs arm lights up a space ship blows up the town and a monster from another planet abducts half the citizens including the colonels rabid son Percy. (A homicidal maniac named Percy? These are the laughs kids.) Mr. Ford and Mr. Craig have no choice but to pool their two-fisted talents in a rescue mission form a posse and track the monster to a canyon of death. The rest of the movie is John Ford meets The Twilight Zone. Oh did I forget to mention the Apaches? It wouldnt be a Western without the Indians. They join the fray too--but what good is a tomahawk against 50 million of computer-generated special effects designed by George Lucas? The penultimate showdown between the alien invaders and the Roy Rogers boots spurs arrows and six-guns is noisy but less thrilling than expected. Still the movie aims for nothing but entertainment and I must admit its fun watching two grizzled roughnecks go at it like they were doing something meaningful and important.

A lone stranger with a mysterious past--Daniel Craig fills the boots here--rides into a God-forsaken town in the Arizona territory. More familiar archetypes are waiting for him there the grizzled rancher-potentate (Harrison Fords Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde); his feckless rowdy wastrel for a blood heir (Paul Dano); and his worthy and doting but unappreciated ranch foreman (Adam Beach) an adopted son enviously watching on--the dynamic from Anthony Manns The Man From Laramie. On the periphery are Sam Rockwells meek shopkeeper and Olivia Wilde as a strangely out-of-time elfin beauty with a gun belt on her waist.This motley bunch is soon at each others throats but when an attack from the outside ends with loved ones kidnapped the squabbling parties must circle the wagons and work together on a rescue mission. Forty years ago that attack would certainly have come from ""alien"" men called Apache Sioux or Comanche. Todays enemies are however literal aliens; the Cowboys amp; Indians rivalry played on by the title has fallen out of fashion. There are Apache on-hand in Cowboys amp; Aliens but after initial tension with Fords gruff old soldier they band together with townsfolk and outlawry alike to take a common stand for humanity.Director Jon Favreaus experiment in genre crossbreeding--a Western-sci-fi mashup pumped full of inspirational all-in-this-together spirit--is a cute crowd-pleasing idea though more decadent than a revitalization of either genre. The sci-fi element is such standard-issue space-invader stuff as to be hardly worth consideration as anything other than a gimmick. The Western tropes are more lovingly dealt with but here the genre which has long striven toward maturity is made ""fun"" again through dislocation from historical fact. Violence is likewise freed from any moral dimension with very grotesque extraterrestrials providing new definitely non-human targets that can be guiltlessly exterminated. (In one curious intervention of history and morality though theres a brief shot of piled pocket watches and gold teeth accumulated by the gold-harvesting aliens--it seems to equate the invaders with Nazis.) Abstracted the Westerns ideals and rituals become meaningless cliches. When ex-Yankees and Confederates unite under the Stars and Stripes together at the bitter end of Sam Peckinpahs Major Dundee theres weight to the rapprochement. When Favreau bands together unlikely allies against the Others its under the gray flag of something-for-everyone popcorn entertainment.It should be noted that Favreau is a capable storyteller among blockbuster blowhards. As in his handling of the first Iron Man he displays here the rare ability to patiently lay down the track along which his narrative will move and he gets some good work from his performers. Ford enlivened by dude garb seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for the first time in decades and his scenes with Beach have real reverb. They stand out amid rambunctious ""summer fun"" pyrotechnics which are much the same every year like on the Fourth.

Set where the oater and outer space collide ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" reps the first of a new breed of popcorn movie the feature-length genre mash-up in which unlikely bedfellows are spliced together for cheeky escapism and maximum coin (on the horizon ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" and ""How to Survive a Robot Uprising""). While the concept itself is more likely to inspire giggles than excitement director Jon Favreau and no fewer than six writers have risen to the challenge of crafting a full-bodied roundly satisfying yarn of it positioning this to join the half dozen Westerns to crack the 100 million club. A quick tour through Favreaus credits reveals a helmer who has managed to spin hearty entertainment from ever more anemic sources -- first a bedtime story (""Zathura"") then a comicbook series (""Iron Man"") and now a mere illustration intended to be the cover of a then-unpublished graphic novel. Still of all the directors to work in exec producer Steven Spielbergs shadow (including J.J. Abrams and Michael Bay) Favreau has emerged the most immediate heir to the masters heartfelt showmanship. (Besides what was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" if not a prototype for such a B-movie mash-up?) ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" begins like a 19th-century Bourne movie with Daniel Craig playing a stone-cold killer who wakes up in the middle of the New Mexico desert his memory a blank. He reaches for a bloody wound at his side and discovers a strange manacle cuffed to his wrist and a lovely strangers tintype photograph lying in the dust at his feet -- and so begins the mystery of how this loner will come to save humankind from a battalion of unidentified unfriendly and most unwelcome flying objects. After the muddled ""Iron Man 2"" this feels like a return to a more patient more coherent storytelling style for Favreau who finds imaginative ways to introduce each character before bringing on the alien mayhem. Back in town a dirtheap fittingly named Absolution Paul Dano plays the tyrannical son of local cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). The youth carelessly provokes Craigs character whose unflinching response indicates the kind of hero were dealing with. Ever so gradually further clues emerge revealing the amnesia-stricken Jake Lonergan as a wanted man and ... well anything else said about his origins would constitute a spoiler. Besides its more fun to unpack Jakes past as he does in a fit of flashbacks and seat-of-his-pants epiphanies. The first breakthrough concerns his bracelet which reveals itself to be some sort of turbo-charged blaster cannon pretty much the only weapon strong enough to fight back with when the aliens attack. The sheer uselessness of spears arrows and bullets marks a running joke in a lopsided intergalactic battle that unites sworn enemies -- cowboys and indians lawmen and outlaws -- in a common cause. Shot to look Clint Eastwood-tall Craig offsets much of the pics potential hamminess through the same brute mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity he brought to the recent 007 pics. Olivia Wilde who plays his equally enigmatic love interest works in the opposite direction however. She not only appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars but also embodies the films biggest risk an outlandish trial-by-fire twist that breaks the rules of both horse and space operas. Thirty years ago Ford could have easily tackled the lead role in such an adventure; here he goes against type bringing an intriguing emotional dimension to a character who would traditionally ride under a black hat. Historically speaking sci-fi killed the Western genre Instead of looking back Hollywood projected its themes of frontier survivalism and fear of the other forward into the equally lawless realms of outer space. So theres a certain karmic beauty in the fact that sci-fi should be the reason to dust off the oater if only just this once. While ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" offers little in the way of sociological insight (except perhaps giving the white man a taste of his own resource-stealing medicine) its still a ripping good ride. Beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart one that prizes both of the genres in play. Echoes of ""Rio Bravo"" and ""310 to Yuma"" resonate through the first act while the finale uses neato dragonfly-shaped UFOs and truly menacing monster design to update tropes from corny 1950s alien-invasion movies. In between the script cobbles together a bumpy second act tossing off serial-style cliffhangers -- cut off by bandits surrounded by Indians -- en route to the big showdown promised by the films title. Ironically Hollywood never would have lavished this much money on a cowboy or alien picture in the pre-Spielberg era. Today such lowbrow genres enjoy the most extravagant budgets and Favreau leverages his resources for maximum impact. A canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well while location shooting (featuring stunning widescreen lensing by Matthew Libatique) and Mary Zophres form-fitting period duds make the West look its best.

TWITTER This comic book movie from Jon Favreau spends a gratifying amount of time on its characters and actors rather the visual FX. SAN DIEGO -- Fusion is everything in gourmet cuisine these days so why shouldnt filmmakers mix and match movie genres no matter how crazy? Cowboys amp; Aliens -- well the title says it all. Taking the idea from a Platinum Studios graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg this film from Jon Favreau shrewdly blends an alien-invasion movie into a Western. The key to its success lies in the determination by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight. Even the slightest goofiness the tiniest touch of camp and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesnt. If you were to assess the mix it would be about 70 percent Western paired with 30 percent alien invasion. Which is pretty bold given that aliens are all the rage and the most recent Western to make a lasting impression was probably Clint Eastwoods 1992 Unforgiven. But thats where shrewdness comes in You expect space invasions; a Western is a tricky thing to pull off. A big hit here at its Comic-Con world premiere the Universal release looks primed to round up box-office gold with its target audience all in ample supply this weekend in San Diego. But you suspect this is one monster movie that might even reach older audiences who would love to slap on chaps and get rough and dirty with a good old-fashioned Western. Well heres that opportunity. Nor does it hurt the movies appeal to an older crowd that the film unhesitatingly pairs two mature stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford to go up against the aliens. Take a look at the credit box for this film and youll see an all-star team of Hollywood producers exec producers and writers. But such is the overriding intelligence and singular vision in this picture that you have to assume Favreau deserves the credit for keeping things true to both genres. A surprisingly good Western is taking place before those creatures drop down from another planet. True the Western characters and story are awfully familiar to those who still treasure the genre but the Western was always a conservative genre that stuck close to its traditions while allowing plenty of room for storytelling. PHOTOS Best and Worst Alien Movies All good Westerns begin when a stranger rides into town. But this stranger in 1875 New Mexico territory suffers from amnesia. Played by Craig the man awakens in the middle of the desert with a strange shackle on his left wrist and no memory of what happened to him. When he encounters three men who would take advantage of his situation he quickly learns -- as does the audience -- he is not a man to be messed with. The town he rides into on a horse belonging to one of those unfortunate men is called Absolution a name that would give anyone pause. It is ruled by a tyrannical cattle baron Colonel Dolarhyde and that would be Ford who lets his face and body sag under the weight of his own ferocious and bitter sense of power. You get the impression he really wants someone to stand up to him. When the man with no name challenges the colonels cowardly son (an amusing Paul Dano) it looks like the colonel has found such a man. But not before a few townsfolk get introduced into the drama -- which would include the towns preacher (Clancy Brown); a stressed saloon-keeper (Sam Rockwell) and his plucky wife (Ana de la Reguera); the colonels unappreciated Indian cowhand (Adam Beach); and the beleaguered sheriff (Keith Carradine evoking his late fathers considerable impact on the Western form) and his eager-to-grow-up grandson (Noah Ringer). Drifting mysteriously on the periphery but making sure that the stranger stays in town when everyone else is keen to see him gone is a woman Ella (Olivia Wilde) who might understand his plight and amnesia. Just as a showdown of epic proportions seems imminent an even greater showdown explodes in the town in a great WTF moment. Alien spacecrafts strafe the town and abduct a number of its citizens including the colonels son. Equally surprising is how the strangers wrist ornament suddenly springs to life as the only successful weapon against these alien forces. The stranger as strangers always do in Westerns has demonstrated his usefulness. Cowboys amp; Aliens has now reached the crucial juncture that will either make or break this odd admixture of a movie. Had the film given way to this sci-fi onslaught the whole thing might have turned into the fiasco that was 1999s Wild Wild West. But no Favreau and his legion of screenwriters wisely cling to the Western framework. The clear model for the rest of the movie is John Fords The Searchers about a Comanche abduction of a white girl and her would-be rescuers led by John Waynes virulently racist uncle to whom Indians were on the same level as reptilian space aliens. Faced with the demise of the planet all the Westerns warring parties -- the cowboys and Indians cattle barons and downtrodden townsfolk the stranger and the colonel -- suddenly realize they all belong to the same species. So they band together to form a search-and-rescue party to free loved ones and eliminate the alien scourge. As this posse tracks the aliens down to their lair with some unexpected help from the mysterious Ella the movie becomes perhaps a tad more conventional. Some of the movies niftiest sequences and best character-reveals happen during this rescue but if there is a weakness here its the aliens themselves. Thanks to quite a few filmmakers -- including Steven Spielberg one of the many exec producers here -- audiences are used to greater detail and more empathy for movie space creatures even as recently as the one in Super 8. The alien villains here -- while ingenious from a CGI standpoint with multilayered malevolence in bodies that pull back endoplasmic surfaces to reveal further weapons of destruction -- dont rate as characters. They are more like moving blobs you shoot at in a video game. Bam -- gotcha Nonetheless as the first of undoubtedly a bunch of copycat genre mashups some of which are bound to be horrendous Cowboys amp; Aliens is a solid success. For a tentpole Comic-Con movie this one devotes a gratifying amount of time to character and achieves most of its success because Favreau has intelligently cast his film and let his actors do their thing. As good as the visual effects are you walk away from the movie with a memory of actors faces lines of dialogue and actions that speak more to character than to shock and awe. And another thing That wrist accessory worn by Craig should be a merchandising stroke of genius.
