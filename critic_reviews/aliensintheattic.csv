Dragged off to a remote mansion for the summer months precocious teen Tom (Carter Jenkins) and his self-obsessed sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale) uncover a devious alien plot to launch a worldwide mind-control invasion from their loft. Theres not a great deal to recommend a few decent one-liners some inventive anti-gravity slapstick and a brief but enjoyably bonkers remote-controlled kung-fu battle between one of the kids and Toms brain-zapped granny. But such fleeting charms are largely outweighed by an unexceptional script a brace of shabby performances (from both kids and adults) and some dismal CG effects the aliens appear almost transparent like animated transfers barely clinging to the screen. Aliens in the Attic will probably prove an effective distraction for undemanding pre-teens; their parents might find it more of a chore.

Credit 20th Century Fox In ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" in 1988 aliens come to Earth see Geena Davis in a bikini and decide to spend their time partying and having sex. In ""Aliens in the Attic"" which opened on Friday a new group of intergalactic travelers comes to Earth sees Ashley Tisdale in a bikini and decides to continue with its plans for widespread massacre and planetary domination. Coincidence?Actually thats unfair to Ms. Tisdale the ""High School Musical"" star who spends much of ""Aliens in the Attic"" off screen. Most of the battling with the four-armed knee-high green critters is done by a crew of young actors led by Carter Jenkins (the son in ""Surface"") and Austin Robert Butler (""Ruby and the Rockits"") who fortunately for the film exhibit more personality than Ms. Tisdale.Still theres only so much they can do to alleviate the tedium in whats basically a tweener cable movie on steroids with a bigger budget and a larger cast of B-list character actors. Kevin Nealon Andy Richter and Tim Meadows pop in and out but are given nothing to do; Doris Roberts as the grandmother of the extended clan whose vacation rental is the aliens gateway gets to take part in an airborne martial-arts battle that may seriously disturb those who remember her in ""Everybody Loves Raymond.""The plot a childrens adventure larded with some light twaddle about feeling different -- i.e. alienated -- because youre good at math has a gimmick the aliens possess a mind-control device but it has been miscalibrated and works only on adults. The quick-thinking young heroes realize that rather than run to their parents for help they need to keep the old folks out of the way while they figure out how to stop the invasion. This gives the filmmakers the excuse they need to spend most of their time focused on the youngsters and their animated foes.The four aliens physically resemble the nastier and much wittier monsters of Joe Dantes ""Gremlins"" (1984). Unfortunately the new versions speak English and have their own sitcom-ready personal problems which just creates more noise in an 85-minute movie that has to accommodate 10 human family members a clueless sheriff and a loutish boyfriend for Ms. Tisdales character. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Robert Hoffman as the boyfriend who spends most of his time under the marionettelike control of either the aliens or the human children provides the films occasional funny moments.""Aliens in the Attic"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Except for one splendidly bizarre scene ""Aliens in the Attic is conveyor-belt family product an action/adventure/sci-fi/comedy made from the bland corporate DNA of Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. It appears designed for families who never leave the mall.That one scene though - its a honey. See the nasty little ETs who have invaded the vacation home of the Pearson clan shoot darts that turn grown-ups into zombies controlled by a video-game-style joystick. At one point both the arrogant boyfriend (Robert Hoffman) and dear sweet Nana (Doris Roberts) get zapped and embark on a kickboxing battle of epic comic proportions. Its almost worth the price of admission to see Mom from ""Everybody Loves Raymond go medieval a la ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.On second thought wait for the DVD. ""Aliens in the Attic rounds up a group of intensely unlikable cousins and asks us to sympathize with them as they fight off an advance quartet of unconvincing CGI spacemen (and women). The hero is Tom (Carter Jenkins) a lanky high schooler whos miserable because - sigh - he gets good grades. Henri and Regan Young play his Game Boy-addict twin cousins Austin Butler their obnoxious teenage brother and little Ashley Boettcher the designated Drew Barrymore who befriends one of the ETs.Ashley Tisdale - a special guest star in this context - knocks around the background as Toms spoiled sister. As that zombie boyfriend Hoffman gets most of the slapstick laughs and hes about as funny as youd expect from a third-tier Jim Carrey imitator. The aliens voices are provided by Thomas Haden Church J.K. Simmons Josh Peck and Kari Wahlgren. Kevin Nealon Gillian Vigman Andy Richter and Tim Meadows play the grown-ups.

"These Aliens ought to be illegal | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThese Aliens ought to be illegalMaking a quick stop in Earth movie houses before heading straight to DVD rental shelves where it belongs Aliens in the Attic is a forgettable bit of fluff that will zip out of your orbit as soon as the credits roll.Four-armed Sparks makes friends with the kids but he lacks the warm fuzzies of aliens such as E.T. -- or even Mac of Mac and Me.  (PHOTO CREDIT TWENTIETH CENTURY)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterSun. Aug. 2 2009 (out of 4)Starring Ashley Tisdale Kevin Nealon Andy Richter and Doris Roberts. Directed by John Schultz. 86 minutes. At major theatres. G  Article Continued BelowMaking a quick stop in Earth movie houses before heading straight to DVD rental shelves where it belongs Aliens in the Attic is a forgettable bit of fluff that will zip out of your orbit as soon as the credits roll.Not screened for critics in time for an opening-day review it stars teen heartthrobs some TV regulars and a pair of SNL alums in a kids-save-the-world popcorn muncher that shamelessly lifts from a dozen genre movies from E.T. to Gremlins Mac and Me and The Matrix. But as the press notes trumpet it was ""co-scripted by one of the writers of Madagascar"" so its got that going for it.It was also directed by John Schultz who has yet to be forgiven for The Honeymooners starring Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Epps.Theres also something very creepy about the fact teenaged Bethany (High School Musicals Ashley Tisdale) spends an unseemly amount of time in a bikini great globs of lip gloss on her petulant pout trying to pry some endearing words out of her new boyfriend Ricky who is played by a 28-year-old Robert Hoffman who does indeed look 28.Dad Stuart Pearson (Kevin Nealon) and mom Nina (Gillian Vigman) pack up15-year-old son Tom (Carter Jenkins) older sis Bethany and cute-as-a-button Hannah (Ashley Boettcher) to join Uncle Nate (Andy Richter) and the cousins - 12-year-old mop-top twins and rebellious teen Jake (Austin Butler) - on a family vacation. And dont forget doddering Nana Rose (Doris Roberts). She takes her teeth out a lot but shes fun.No sooner do they get to the holiday house - a multi-room Victorian mansion - than a quartet of diminutive troll-like aliens from the planet Zirkon crash lands on the roof and invades the attic. Theyre led by the power-mad Skip who looks like the Nicorette cravings monster with a beer belly.In fact none of the aliens is especially impressive. The CGI looks ragged and the characters lack originality. Whats up with Razor the busty blue-eyed female alien who is alternately vicious and upset about breaking nails? And how did Thomas Haden Church get mixed up in all this voicing Tazer the weapons expert alien who is sweet on Razor? Even the four-limbed Sparks who befriends the kids fails to radiate the kind of warm fuzzies lost aliens who bond with humans are expected to.The pint-sized aliens want to take over the world having found a way to mobilize adults and make them do their bidding. The kids have to prevent it because they love the world and also their parents. Thats about all you need to know. The dialogue is dumb - ""this isnt Xbox its real like Wii"" - and the acting by the kid crew is barely passable.Frankly kids deserve better movies than this. Producing smart and entertaining flicks for the G-rated set shouldnt be an alien concept.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDreaded Ice Bucket Challenge of 2014 paid for ALS research breakthroughMillions raised for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research from viral stunt funded research that identified a gene NEK1 that contributes to disease.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Aliens in the Attic Adventure comedy. Starring Carter Jenkins Kevin Nealon Doris Roberts and Ashley Tisdale. Directed by John Schultz. (PG. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to get worked up about ""Aliens in the Attic"" a new action/adventure family film for parents and children who have already seen ""Up"" and the latest ""Harry Potter."" Its doubtful that many people will be asking for their money back after seeing this movie. But they wont be remembering too much about it 24 hours later either. Our guess is that the filmmakers pitched this as ""Men in Black""-meets-""Home Alone"" and then made good on the promise. With no original ideas it mostly feels like a lowbrow crowd-pleasing checklist Ashley Tisdale prancing around in a bikini ... a paintball gun aimed at a preppy guys groin ... Doris Roberts in a martial arts showdown ... Carter Jenkins stars as Tom Pearson a geeky math whiz that has trouble communicating with his parents and an older sister played by Tisdale. (We know hes smart because he uses his computer to change his own grades.) The Pearsons drive to a lakeside vacation home with their cousins the alien invasion begins almost immediately and the kids spend most of the movie fending off three of the four well-armed little green men. Of course the smallest and cutest of the invaders is a kindly alien who breaks away from the others and befriends the youngest girl in the house. There are a few clever jokes - including one about how the kids cant operate a rotary phone - and a lot of drawn-out action scenes. How the parents in the film dont notice any of this is happening can only be explained as Hollywood magic. You can usually gauge the badness of these kinds of movies by the number of former ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""MADtv"" cast members are in supporting roles.

(Extra points for being 100 percent fart-joke-free). A band of scrappy space gremlins face off against a group of teen and tween cousins (including High School Musicals Ashley Tisdale) in a turf war over a Midwestern summer rental home. The E.T.s are after some kind of sci-fi device buried underneath the basement; the kids just want to make sure their clueless folks dont get tagged by the aliens mind-control gizmos. The ensuing war of the worlds is waged with weapons as fearsome as a bubble blower a skateboard and a sort of anti-gravity grenade that frankly looks like a lot of fun.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Given its particularly aggressive blend of wackiness and inoffensiveness Aliens In The Attic could pass for a Disney movie of a long-ago decade with just two exceptions the reliance on special effects and the way the kids take center stage. Aliens has all the modern ""kids rule adults drool"" mentality of Home Alone or Spy Kids but the broad acting hammy physical comedy and relentlessly G-rated language would be at home in a Don Knotts vehicle or a Herbie The Love Bug movie. Carter Jenkins stars as a gawky ineffectual pill of a teenager whos evidently smart but tanking at school for transparent reasons destined to come out in a rush of emotion when the film needs a little extra conflict. His many frustrations include his too-perfect sister Ashley Tisdale (the High School Musical series villainous Sharpay) and her smugly duplicitous boyfriend (Step Up 2 The Streets heartthrob Robert Hoffman) but really his problem is that hes at that age where everything and everyone seems exhaustingly lame and the only way to rise above the lameness is by loudly rejecting everything. Unfortunately he loses that luxury when a quartet of klutzy but murderous CGI aliens descends on the rental home where his extended family (including obnoxious single-dad uncle Andy Richter and a crowd of cousins) is vacationing. When the aliens implant a mind-control device in Hoffmans neck and turn him into a flailing living weapon the kids realize their parents grandma and local cop Tim Meadows are all in danger of a similar fate. Since the device doesnt work on the younger set its up to them to fight back with makeshift weapons and youthful cleverness. Adults will likely find Aliens pretty tiresome given that there isnt much going on but kiddie-power validation and slapstick humor though Hoffmans remote-controlled-robot act is agreeably game and a Stephen Chow-esque martial-arts face-off between him and similarly remote-controlled granny Doris Roberts is fairly diverting. But at least the film doesnt go out of its way to insult anyones intelligence and apart from the occasional crotch-focused attack its about the cleanest kids adventure around short of a Walden Media production. Like those mild old Disney comedies of the 60s and 70s it seems perfectly content with being a harmless distraction.

"Aliens in the Attic - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AliensMOVIE REVIEW Aliens in the AtticThis kid-friendly film isnt out of this world but its enjoyable.August 03 2009|Glenn Whipp The extraterrestrial advance team in the kid-friendly adventure romp ""Aliens in the Attic"" qualifies as the most unthreatening bunch of cinematic space invaders since the waterlogged aliens in M. Night Shyamalans ""Signs.""But then thats precisely the point since adults have as much place in the movies world as the grown-ups in the ""Peanuts"" comic strips. The ""Gremlin""-like little green men (and one little green lady) in ""Aliens"" can easily plant their mind-control plugs into moms and dads but kids are immune to their effects. That means the movies band of teens and tweens will have to save the day armed with only paint-ball guns Mentos and their joystick-related muscle memories.Better than most movies that arent screened in advance for critics ""Aliens"" is perfectly calibrated for the pre-adolescent set highlighting broad physical comedy and themes of kid empowerment and featuring one of the stars from the ""High School Musical"" series (a bikini-clad Ashley Tisdale playing a variation of her ""HSM"" princess).The action takes place at a lakefront rental home where a couple of related Michigan families have escaped for a little bonding time. Given the presence of teenagers the idea of togetherness figures to be a pipe dream. Making it more improbable The quartet of knee-high aliens who have landed (yes) in the attic.That aliens capable of intergalactic travel are incapable of busting out of an attic is just plain silly of course but the movie has no pretense about being anything other than goofy entertainment. Carter Jenkins is fine as the dont-wannabe geek who learns that being a mathlete has its advantages. And seeing ""Everybody Loves Raymonds"" Doris Roberts showing off her geriatric ninja skills is good for a laugh.But the movie belongs to Robert Hoffman. Playing Tisdales two-faced boyfriend Hoffman a classically trained dancer literally throws himself into the scenes in which the aliens use him as their personal remote-controlled errand boy. The extraterrestrials get title billing but Hoffman steals the show.--calendarlatimes.com--Aliens in the AtticMPAA rating PG for action violence some suggestive humor and languageRunning time 1 hour 26 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Judy Moody and the Not Bummer SummerJune 10 2011Movie reviews delayedJuly 31 2009Doris Roberts still knows bestJuly 29 2009Summer films go head to headMay 7 2009Fox is happy if Chipmunks finishes second to a LegendDecember 14 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTAliensAtticCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-aliens3-2009aug03,0,4777407.story",200,aliensintheattic8,aliensintheattic,latimes

The film also stars Ashley Tisdale. Aliens in the Attic review You can bet the producers behind the new kids movie ""Aliens in the Attic"" have been watching the Weather Channel - and the calendar - with high hopes lately. After all no other new childrens movies are coming out this week. Some kids are already finished with camp and others may be starting to get sick of their friends. And then there are those rain clouds. Aliens in the Attic (PG) Fox (86 min.) Directed by John Schultz. With Ashley Tisdale Carter Jenkins. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys review ONE AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains mildly vulgar humor What else are you going to do with bored little ones this weekend but take them to see ""Aliens in the Attic""? May I suggest cleaning the attic? A frantic but still pretty mirthless sci-fi comedy ""Aliens in the Attic"" - which did not screen for critics -- features an extended family on a weeklong Michigan getaway. The six children taken along are bored by the whole idea - even the meteor shower predicted for that night. But then the meteor shower turns out to be an alien invasion - and the half-dozen kids are quickly marshalling their wits (and a paintball gun) to fight off four little green soldiers. We have met the enemy and he is ooze. Unfortunately the child actors arent particularly engaging and the gags arent entirely fresh. Taking your inspiration from ""Gremlins"" is one thing; stealing your jokes from a ""Gremlins"" ripoff like ""Ghoulies"" is something else again. The dreary Carter Jenkins is our unappealing hero; the even less-appealing Ashley Tisdale is his eye-rolling teen sister. Whatevs. Along with the rest of the kids theyll soon have you rooting for the extraterrestrials. As for the adults Kevin Nealon picks up a check as a befuddled dad and Doris Roberts removes her dentures as the ""funny"" grandmother. The sole bright spot is Robert Hoffman who has the smarmy smirk of a young Jay Mohr and is more than game as Tisdales boyfriend (and eventual alien punching bag). Poor as the jokes are (they mostly involve Hoffman falling down or getting hit in the face) he dives into them with gusto. Unfortunately hes the best special effect in the picture. The CGI is generally dreadful except for a couple of anti-gravity gags. The aliens look like slightly squashed versions of ""E.T."" - particularly when one of them a shy scientific type ends up first frightening and then becoming the adopted pet of the teens little sister. E.T. phone home. And get your lawyer on the line. And by the way you parents? Stay home. I know youre desperate for something to do with your kids this weekend. Its been a long muggy couple of weeks. But trust me. Youre not this desperate. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Although its aimed at that vaguely defined ever-elusive constituency known as the ""family audience"" ""Aliens in the Attic"" doubtless will appeal primarily to a more narrow demographic of tweens and pre-teens. Despite the prominent presence of Ashley Tisdale the nubile note of discord in the ""High School Musical"" franchise its difficult to imagine many ticketbuyers between the ages of 12 and 18 queuing up for this homogenized PG-rated trifle (unless of course they buy tickets to sneak into an R-rated pic elsewhere in the megaplex). Pic posted a tepid 7.8 million in its opening frame but homevid biz may be passable. The plot pivots on close encounters of the farcical kind as high schooler Tom Pearson (Carter Jenkins) begrudgingly joins his family for a holiday at their three-story vacation home in rural Michigan -- only to find the upper floor has been taken over by four pint-sized extraterrestrials the advance party of an impending alien invasion. Previously ashamed of his status as a science nerd Tom finds his brainpower comes in very handy while he fashions improvised weapons against the little green home invaders whose resemblance to the eponymous critters in ""Gremlins"" surely isnt coincidental. (It doesnt help at all that at least one of the unfriendly aliens also resembles the anthropomorphized mucus in a recent series of TV commercials.) While leading the counteroffensive the unlikely young hero gradually becomes unofficial leader of a childrens crusade that includes big sister Bethany (Tisdale) 7-year-old sibling Hannah (Ashley Boettcher) aggressively cool cousin Jake (Austin Butler) and vidgame-obsessed twins Art (Henri Young) and Lee (Regan Young). Meanwhile the adults under the roof -- including Carters clueless parents (Kevin Nealon Gillian Vigman) easygoing Uncle Nate (Andy Richter) and eventually a local sheriff (Tim Meadows) -- remain blissfully unaware that the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance. On the other side of the fray the four aliens are armed with a brain-implant dart gun that allows them to manipulate humans with a device that conveniently resembles a vidgame controller. This does cue some genuinely funny physical comedy (tweaked by the f/x wizards of Rhythm amp; Hues Studios) by Doris Roberts as a doting grandmother who becomes a high-flying butt-kicking martial artist and Robert Hoffman as Bethanys sleazy overage boyfriend. Latter is especially hilarious as his jerky character becomes a herky-jerk puppet. Directed at an appropriately brisk pace by John Schultz (""Like Mike"" ""The Honeymooners"") ""Aliens in the Attic"" is so thinly written by Mark Burton and Adam F. Goldberg that the characters are defined entirely by the actors playing them (or in the case of the f/x-spawned aliens voicing them). Performances are unremarkable but acceptable pretty much across the board and the vocal talents -- particularly Thomas Haden Church as the belligerent Tazer and Josh Peck as the lovable Sparks -- are well cast. At times however its all too easy to imagine Schultz directing Boettcher by shouting (through a megaphone perhaps) such commands as ""More cute More adorable More winsome"" Special effects and alien gadgetry suggest the production team opted to emphasize tongue-in-cheek humor over technical razzle-dazzle. Pic was shot in New Zealand though its likely even most Michiganders wont be able to tell the difference. Release was preceded by no advance screenings and scant promo.
