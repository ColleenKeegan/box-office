Starring Pierce Brosnan Rene Russo and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan. (Rated R. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Think Donald Trump only smarter. Add thrillaholic art connoisseur and quite likely thief and thats the super-rich anti-hero of ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" This is a new version -- but not exactly a remake -- of the 1968 blockbuster that starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Among other things it made ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" an international sensation. In this updated ""Thomas Crown Affair"" its Rene Russo hot on the trail of Pierce Brosnan. And ""hot"" and ""affair"" are the operative words. Related Stories An `Affair to Remember / Brosnan Russo star in sexy new version The tycoon Crown (Brosnan) likes expensive toys and toying with expensive people. Luxury-class art insurance investigator and bounty hunter Catherine Banning (Russo) likes figuring things out. They both like being one step ahead of everyone else. They deserve each other. They know it and so do we. Especially when they drop their clothes and start going at it like panthers. One of the biggest differences from the ""Thomas Crown"" of 30 years ago is the sex and nudity. Its not often audiences see stars this big this naked. Garbo Talks? Russo Goes Topless. Not once but three times. Brosnan bares his Three-Quarter-Billion-Dollar Butt. Thats the worldwide take from his two James Bond movies. Brosnan and Russos sex scenes not only go a lot further than other major Hollywood releases -- ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is pillow talk by comparison -- they play characters in their 40s and its a nice reminder for anybody who needs it that the ""American Pie"" kind of sex is indeed childs play. Well enough about money and sex. Lets talk about the really interesting things. Such as Monets ""Impressionism Sunrise"" the painting that gave Impressionism its name. When it disappears from a deliberately unnamed New York museum in a heist neatly staged by director John McTiernan (""Die Hard With a Vengeance"") Crown and Banning become principals in a high- stakes cat-and-mouse game. There are other attractions. Dunaway does a wry turn as Crowns psychiatrist as well being a nice reminder of the McQueen film which was about a bank caper and not museum busting. More than holding his own in this company Denis Leary (""Wag the Dog"") shows up as a police detective and man of the people in contrast to the superior beings played by Brosnan and Russo. There have not been so many coolly smug smiles on a screen since 40s movies about upwardly mobile Nazis in Hitlers pre-bunker days. Crown enjoys what his money can buy a catamaran a glider an art collection including significantly an enigmatic bowler-hatted Magritte. Even more he enjoys the risks 100000 bets on golf shots hanging off the catamarans rig until it spills letting novice Banning pilot his glider (""Take the stick"" he says not entirely without Bondish raffishness). Banning is surprised at herself for starting to fall for him. Shes used to short affairs in which shes in charge (""Men make women messy"" she says). Russo completely captures this snazzy and self-contained womans confusion at her transformation from cat to mouse. She makes a spectacular entrance in slit skirt black stockings and heels; she is one tough cookie and a woman of the world but is capable of girlishly batting her eyes if it will get her what she wants. When Russo (""Lethal Weapon"" 3 and 4) who may have the best jawline in movies today shows up in a see-through gown at a swank black- and-white ball Bannings elaborate chess match with Crown turns into a battle of the sexes. Its here that hints of the theme from Michel Legrands ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" are first heard on the soundtrack as played by the society dance band. Bill Contis terrific musical score which also features the sound of unaccompanied tap dancing will later tease the theme on the saxophone until it finally comes out in all its remembered glory. Leary is completely sympathetic as the detective who always seems to be one step behind and is often left with a clenched-teeth smile. He wonders as the audience might why he is so preoccupied with something that is ""important only to a couple of rich people."" What ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" has to sell audiences is a fantasy of the life of the super-rich who jet off to Martinique on the spur of the moment and the super-smart who operate outside the rules. Somewhere in the course of all of these rich-at-play high jinks four schmucks end up in jail and are hung out to dry. This is not a moral objection to this kind of fantasy. Plenty of movies make the audience willing accomplices in larceny and other forms of getting away with it. Its just worth noting thats all. ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is a slick smart Hollywood production that gets away with it too. ..

R) Brash synthetic and very sexy. A remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway confection it stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown a billionaire Manhattan financier who steals a priceless Monet. Why exactly does he do it? Thats the merry mystery the movie revolves around. Rene Russo plays the worlds most spectacularly alluring insurance investigator who figures out that Crown is the thief. Brosnans faintly inscrutable Euro jet-set charm has more spark here than it does in the Bond films and the movie directed with a surprisingly light touch by John McTiernan (Die Hard) is a puckish tribute to the art of stealing beauty.

The characters in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" are cool -- too cool in fact for the film to develop much of a pulse. This redo of Norman Jewisons 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway hit is an ultrasleek and slick thriller that attempts to justify its existence by shifting the focus from the caper elements to the psychological and emotional factors that compel two hard-shelled professional adversaries to risk a romantic entanglement. Result is lush hot-weather entertainment that should generate solid late-summer B.O. with mostly older auds although alert viewers may sense that theyve recently seen much the same scenario played out in ""Entrapment."" While it still retains a certain allure due mainly to the adept casting of the innately rebellious McQueen in the role of a Boston millionaire and gentleman thief few popular films from the late 60s seem more dated and mannered today than the original ""Thomas Crown"" with its hokey split-screen storytelling and high-gloss polish that has since faded to reveal the tinniness of whats inside. A considerable overhaul was definitely in order if Alan R. Trustmans original script was going to be made to fit the 90s. In an unusual move to this end Leslie Dixon was hired to write the personal scenes while Kurt Wimmer was engaged specifically to pen the heist sequences. Combo works seamlessly with the intimate story such as it is framing the action and maintaining the upper hand. Signaling the revised orientation at the outset precredits teaser has the handsome richer-than-rich playboy tycoon Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) nonchalantly revealing his Achilles heel to his shrink played in a self-reflexive homage by Dunaway. Crown is a self-made man whos got it all but can never imagine settling down with one woman because he simply cant open himself up enough to trust anyone; what works for him in business is anathema to deep personal involvement. This time out risk-loving title character pulls not a bank job but the rather extraordinary theft of a 100 million Monet from New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art virtually in front of the eyes of security personnel. Along with Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) insurance company investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) is positive that Crown is the culprit and the sultry no-nonsense femme has no qualms about using any means necessary including getting horizontal to land her prey. Like her elegant foe Catherine is quite a hard case; shes undoubtedly snared many men in this same manner over the years and is perhaps both proud and weary of the fact that she can no longer find one who is her equal. Both Crown and Catherine suspect they might have met their match in the other and the only sliver of substance served up here is the figurative chess game (a metaphor famously made literal in the original film) between the two in which the question of who will outfox the other becomes dependent -- thanks to their growing personal involvement -- upon who will finally ""weaken"" emotionally and trust the other. The twists and turns of their relationship are not without interest especially because Russo takes seriously her rare opportunity at a part more substantial than her usual superstar pairings; when one of them finally lets down well-built defenses and is the victim of turned tables the result is momentarily affecting. But not for long as contempo Hollywood has trouble abiding the note of ambiguity and irony that even a successful mainstream production such as the original ""Thomas Crown"" had no trouble concluding upon 31 years ago. The impulse to take the characters deeper seems to have been there but its been nipped in the bud; despite all the time they spend together hanging out at Crowns art-festooned Manhattan townhouse or on a quickie vacation to Martinique they devote all their time to keeping up their guards and taking off their clothes. Lack of detailed characterization is hardly a fatal flaw in this sort of genre piece but the absence is especially noticeable in light of the storys heightened attention to the nuances of the central romance. The art removal (and replacement) sequences at the Met are cleverly and engagingly handled under John McTiernans well-tooled direction and production has been lavished with extravagant sets and locations that welcome the audience into a fantasy world of untold luxury and wealth which lenser Tom Priestley shows off to the desired effect. The stars look mighty good both in and out of Kate Harringtons costumes and their au naturel couplings while stylized generate a sense of rambunctiousness. Taunting teasing and challenging as a worldly woman who sees a possible chance to change her ways Russo rolls up her sleeves for this part and comes off very well. Brosnans Thomas Crown is carved out of ice and unfortunately thesps charisma is insufficient to melt it much. The cold calculation of this suave ruthless operator is efficiently projected but any inner desire to change seems a ruse or self-deception. In the only supporting role of consequence Leary is mostly called upon to register exasperation at Catherines greater success rate at getting the goods on their mutual foe. Bill Contis score while trying for something different ends up jarringly eclectic. The originals Oscar-winning tune ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" by Michel Legrand Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman is heard in several versions.
