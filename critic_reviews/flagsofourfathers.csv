DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks i A scene from Flags Of Our Fathers. hide caption toggle caption A scene from Flags Of Our Fathers. When you hear the name of the Pacific island Iwo Jima you probably picture soldiers raising a flag. The image in your head comes from a photo taken by Joe Rosenthal in 1945 -- a photo that is now the subject of the movie Flags of Our Fathers. The film directed by Clint Eastwood explores not just how that famous photograph came to be but also what it came to mean. The battle scenes in Flags are harrowing even before a shot is fired troops landing on volcanic black-sand beaches hundreds of ships behind seemingly no resistance ahead. But your nerves jangle because you can see what the soldiers cant gun barrels hidden in the brush tracking them as they advance. When violence explodes -- heads and helmets flying separately through the air -- death comes as unexpectedly and as realistically as it ever has in a war film. So its odd when something feels a little off the first time you see these same servicemen struggling up a hill to hoist Old Glory. Theres no wind not enough men explosions getting drowned out by ... cheers? Just as youre registering that somethings wrong the camera rises over the crest of the hill to show you why. This flag is being raised on a papier-mache mountain surrounded by fireworks. Its part of a cross-country tour by the three surviving flag-raisers to sell war bonds. As the film cuts back and forth from battlefield shelling to war-bond shilling you understand that the home front is also taking a toll on these men. One of them -- Ira Hayes played by Adam Beach -- is so distressed at the disconnect between the flag-raising (which was arguably the least dangerous thing he did on Iwo Jima) and the way its being used at home that he begs to be returned to his unit. As a director Eastwood has made a late-career specialty of matters of conscience and though hes filming on a grand scale here it is internal conflicts that are his focus. Working from a best-seller by the son of one of the flag-raisers Eastwood bumps the iconic photos reality up against the broader reality of troops under fire and the calculated unreality of wartime morale-boosting. Audiences will doubtless hear echoes in the story of more recent efforts to market an unpopular war but Eastwood doesnt lean on them. Rather he offers Flags of Our Fathers as a kind of eulogy for the passing of innocence with even the films look -- majestic but drained of color -- suggesting how lives get sapped by combat and by myths.

With Altman gone and Malick making films far too rarely Clints is about the most dependable pair of hands you could wish on such a subject - dependable not in the sense that hes predictable (other than predictably good) but precisely because hes one of very few around with sufficient clout nous and courage to go down unexpected paths.Hence we have a war-is-hell movie; a tribute to soldierly courage; an analysis of the role of imagery in both propaganda and private and collective memory; a scathing portrait of political exploitation and deceit; a study of social upheaval and injustice; an interrogation of notions of heroism; and an extremely moving account of the sacrifices stoically made by an entire generation all cohering in one magnificent film. The pivotal narrative moment is the raising of the US flag by a small group of soldiers on Mount Suribachi during the hellish campaign to wrest the isle from 20000 Japanese troops; but from those few seconds famously photographed by Associated Presss Joe Rosenthal and plastered on enough front pages to revive enthusiasm for a flagging war effort Eastwoods film radiates in all kinds of directions in terms of character chronology and theme.Which means the precise details of the story are sometimes tricky to follow; thats normal in a genre with endless blood- and mud-spattered young men shouting and struggling their way through noisy carnage but accentuated here by Eastwoods typically nocturnal lighting by the fragmented multi-perspective narrative and by many characters being shown both in callow youth and mutely haunted old age. But three soldiers stand out Doc Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) rushed home by the government to reenact the flag-raising for a hero-hungry public expected to buy war bonds. Switching between their experiences in Iwo Jima and back home the film probes the gulf between the horrific realities of war and the expedient lies perpetrated by the authorities and temporarily welcomed by a supportive but gullible public an ocean away.The relevance of all this to todays situation is crystal-clear but like everything else in the film its handled with an understatement characteristic of Eastwood at his very best. The movie could hardly be more different from the pat(riotic) sentimentality of Saving Private Ryan (even though Spielberg here co-produces); here the feelings run very deep and dark as dried blood with Clint aware that some things dont need to be said and others shouldnt be shown. Eastwoods Letters from Iwo Jima treating the same conflict from the Japanese perspective is eagerly awaited.

Plus Dirty Harrys anti-violence campaign. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Anooj Khan amp; Sons  (Photo Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of TriStar Pictures Inc.) The bar is dauntingly high for blaming-mom memoirs but Augusten Burroughss Running With Scissors delivers its unkind cuts from a singular vantage. The narrator is an adoring gay boy who loses his Auntie Mameish (and bipolar) mother to the seventies an era in which loony-tunes therapists counseled patients to act out their anger instead of learning to manage it and to indulge their inner childrensometimes to the point of abandoning their families. A quarter-century on Burroughs has learned to manage his anger. He chronicles his surreal upbringing in a voice thats craftily deadpan so that each outlandish revelation makes you gasp with a mixture of horror and vindictive glee. You feel at once Omigod the poor helpless child and You are so burned you bad mom Ryan Murphys jaunty screen version of Running With Scissors proves that nothing consecrates ones depiction of a narcissistic mother like having her embodied by Annette Bening. Benings specialties are (a) insane people and (b) actresses. No the two arent synonymous but for Bening the two exist on a continuum. Her genius is for locating the actress withinthe person struggling to translate her inchoate feelings into performance. As Deirdre Burroughs she spreads the wings of her irradiated yellow caftan and declaims her latest unprintable confessional poem then turns to her son eyes shining and asks Was it powerful? Was it emotionally charged? Deirdre needs to dramatize her lifelong oppression by males among them Augustens alcoholic and emotionally unavailable dad (Alec Baldwin). Theres nothing unusual about the absent-dad-overbearing-mom household The shrinks once said it was the garden-variety gay-male-engendering environment. The source of Burroughss bitterness is that his mother didnt stick around. In the film its when Augustens bond with his fame-seeking mom is strongestwhen he fantasizes hes Deirdre giving poetry readings to packed auditoriumsthat she has a particularly ghastly breakdown (the music goes out of Benings voice) and her psychiatrist makes a house call. Murphy shoots the arrival of Dr. Finch (Brian Cox) as if hes Father Merrin come to exorcise Deirdres demons which is cute but upside-down Encouraging this sick woman to plumb her dark side is like making up a guest room for her demons to reside. The director does gravitate toward the cute but thats in keeping with the detachment of his source The feelings of loss and alienation are woven into the portrait of the timeinto the otherworldly fluorescent seventies fashions and sitcoms in which its hero seeks escape. A director doesnt have to melodramatize a moment like Deirdres parting from Augusten after depositing him in the squalid chaotic Finch manse with leaning towers of filthy dishes and teenagers toying with electroshock machinesa household that Gomez Addams would find unhealthily permissive. (Deirdres smug feminist mantras are about as apt as mad Alexs in Fatal Attraction Had Augusten renounced his homosexuality Running With Scissors would make a textbook neoconservative attack on the counterculture.) Running With Scissors would be more involving with a less distanced Finch the therapist whose external world (mousy hunchback wife slavish and semi-delusional older daughter patients adopted like stray cats) expresses the disorder within. Burroughs describes a man with a reassuring Santa Claus warmth but Cox is a frosty actor with a gift for making you laugh at his creepy unknowability and he inhabits a different plane altogether from Joseph Crosss Augusten. Augusten is a passive role but Cross gets a lot of dramatic mileage out of his hurting blue eyes and throbbing Adams apple. Running With Scissors ends with its hero growing up and moving on but it doesnt seem finished until Murphy shows you the real Burroughs sitting side-by-side with his fictional counterpart. This coming-of-age story is cathartic only when it spells out the idea that writing a best-selling memoir is the best revenge. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 29 2006 1248 PM The Top 10 Movies of 2006 A family road trip; a world without babies; and yes Babel. By Dana Stevens First a disclaimer No critic who gave birth to her first child last Feb. 14 can reasonably lay claim to an exhaustive knowledge  of the movie year that followed. There were at least four months there during which the only movies I managed to catch were the fatigue-induced hallucinations on the inside of my own eyelids. But in mid-June I started as Slates film critic a job that along with the aforementioned child has made 2006 my personal best year ever. It was a pretty terrific year for movies too despite Fur and Apocalypto and My Super Ex-Girlfriend. In alphabetical order here are my 10 best of the year Babel Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Babel I wouldnt have thought this would be a controversial choice for one of the years best films but it hasnt been showing up on a lot of year-end lists. I know there were critics who found Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus swirling virtuosic vision ham-handed and message-heavy. But Clint Eastwoods lumbering Flags of Our Fathers has mysteriously escaped these same labels. I watched every minute of Babel with my heart in my throat and if Oscar had a category for best new performer Rinko Kikuchi would win it for her role as a deaf Japanese teenager with a secret or three. Children of Men Advertisement Children of Men OK maybe I was feeling a burst of yuletide generosity last week when I labeled this ""the movie of the millennium"" but its a long time since a filmmaker has brought together intellectual rigor technical prowess and compassion the way Alfonso Cuaron does in the dark futuristic thriller Children of Men. You dont have to be a new parent to be laid low by this movies dystopian vision of a world without babies but it surely helps. Deliver Us From Evil Documentaries (a four-way tie) As political and historical reality trips over itself to outstrip our worst imaginings (how much worse can it get? Oh that much worse) documentaries just keep getting better. This year was awash in fine nonfiction filmmaking from Our Daily Bread the impossibly bleak nearly silent German film about the origin of commercial foodstuffs to Iraq in Fragments the first documentary about the Iraq war to transcend the newsreel genre and aspire to be a work of art. For the sheer dreadfulness of its subject it would be hard to top Deliver Us From Evil in which a pedophile priest remembers the dozens of children he ravaged with an almost twinkly nostalgia. But my favorite doc of the year may have been Heidi Ewing and Rachel Gradys scrupulously respectful Jesus Camp which follows three born-again children to an evangelical summer camp in North Dakota. Bonus moment a pre-gay-sex-scandal Rev. Ted Haggard addressing the camera with the assurance that ""We dont have to debate about what we think about homosexual activity because its written in the Bible."" LEnfant With this tale of a Belgian petty thief who sells his newborn son on the black market the Dardenne brothers continue their run of astonishingly austere and uncompromising moral fables. The lead actor Jeremie Renier who played the blond little boy in the Dardennes 1996 immigrant drama La Promesse has grown into an actor perfectly suited to the directors style which might be described as offhandedly devastating. The absence of close-ups music and other emotional cues make you forget youre watching a drama at all until your heart is suddenly ripped from your chest. Its not too much to invoke Bresson as the spiritual antecedent of these acolytes of cinema. Little Miss Sunshine Little Miss Sunshine Part of this indies enduring charm is that on paper it looked so crappy a road movie about a nutty family on their way to a childrens beauty pageant? Sounds er heartwarming. But against all odds it really was with one of the most satisfying happy endings in recent comedy (unfortunately the current TV ad for the DVD ruthlessly gives away the climax). A second viewing reveals the scripts impressive attention to detail (watch the way the evolution of Greg Kinnears character traces the steps of his batty self-improvement program). In an age of splintering audience demographics theres hardly a viewing companion I couldnt imagine taking to Little Miss Sunshine. Though the plot elements include Grandpas heroin problem Uncle Franks gay porn and a corpse in the back of a VW bus Id buy tickets for either Gramps or Junior in a hot second. Man Push Cart Advertisement Man Push Cart Go to your Netflix queue right now demote Talladega Nights by one space--not that you shouldnt get around to it eventually--and add this first feature by young Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani. It follows a Pakistani pushcart vendor (Ahmad Razvi) around the streets of New York City where he befriends a Spanish girl (Leticia Dolera) does odd jobs for a wealthy fellow Pakistani (Charles Daniel Sandoval) and eventually faces an overwhelming reversal of fortune--not that things were going so well for him in the first place. But this slice of 21st-century Neorealism isnt eat-your-spinach feel-sorry-for-the-immigrant social cinema; its ruefully funny and quietly moving. Pans Labyrinth This tale of a little girl (Ivana Baquero) who becomes the prisoner of her sadistic stepfather (Sergi Lopez)  after the Spanish Civil War isnt fantasy in the mode of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings but fantasy in the mode of Alice in Wonderland or the tales of the Brothers Grimm. Mexican horror director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy The Devils Backbone) has reached into the depths of our collective unconscious--not to mention the fertile swamp of  his own mind--and pulled out a fever dream of a movie. More than any other film I can think of except possibly the Spanish masterpiece The Spirit of the Beehive (which it occasionally resembles in subject and mood) Pans Labyrinth evokes the mental landscape of childhood the feeling of what its like to slip between dream and reality just by whispering a magic word. But the political and psychological realities it explores are deep dark and ugly; though this is a great film about childhood its decidedly not a film for children. A Prairie Home Companion A Prairie Home Companion Robert Altmans last film is a dusty old trunk full of treats Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as an off-color singing cowboy duo Meryl Streep reminding us she can sing Lindsay Lohan reminding us--make that informing us--she can act. Midway through this elegiac tribute to the power of collective art-making theres an exchange that seems to presage Altmans too-early exit last month. A suicide-obsessed adolescent (Lohan) tries to convince the radio host played by Garrison Keillor to deliver a eulogy on his program. ""Dont you want to be remembered?"" she pleads. ""I dont want them to be told to remember me"" he responds. With a sendoff like this nobody needs to be told to remember Altman. The Queen The Queen Theres nothing about this tart comedy of morals that doesnt fall into place as discreetly as a perfectly served English high tea Helen Mirrens and Michael Sheens pitch-perfect performances as Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair Stephen Frears wry but loving gaze on the fusty customs of the monarchy and his scone-dry critique of the rising culture of confession and celebrity. To those few who are still avoiding it because (like me) theyre allergic to all things royal You dont have to read Hello magazine to love The Queen. Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story Literary adaptation has never been less ponderous or more fun than in this nimble movie-within-a-movie about a self-absorbed British actor (Steve Coogan) playing the hero of Laurence Sternes 18th-century novel while his off-screen life like the narrative itself disintegrates into chaos. Three that nearly made this list (and might have if I hadnt squeezed in an eleventh-hour viewing of LEnfant) were Little Children Quinceanera and Half Nelson all of which made the minutiae of human relationships into the stuff of potent drama. And there are movies Ive yet to see that are riding high atop my own Netflix queue for 2007Hou Hsiao-Hsiens lyrical three-part love story Three Times the French-Algerian war picture Days of Glory and Dave Chappelles Block Party in which French fantasist Michel Gondry films what the renegade comedian calls ""the concert I always wanted to see."" Please join me next week for Slates 2006 ""Movie Club"" where three of my fellow critics will no doubt give me hell for what I did and didnt include on this list. And heres to a New Year full of wonderful movies. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Hillary May Have Won the Convention War but She Did Not Win the Ratings War 2.

The flag had already been raised on Mount Suribachi earlier that morning; the moment Rosenthal immortalized was a substitute flag going up. According to one story a military bigwig required the original as a souvenir; other sources suggest the first flag was deemed too small.Either way the battle was far from over. In fact it would rage on for another month.Eastwoods new film ""Flags of Our Fathers"" counterpoints the bloody fight for the eight square miles of Iwo Jima with the hollow hoopla that accompanied the three men brought home to conduct a last-ditch war bonds appeal. And John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) are acutely aware that they have been designated heroes for no better reason than they were snapped in the right place at the right time.While Rene seems happy enough to capitalize on his good fortune and Doc is persuaded that stumping for cash is also a vital contribution to the war effort Hayes is consumed with guilt and starts drinking excessively. The other three men in the photo died at Iwo Jima and one of them has been misidentified a grievous error the authorities immediately cover up.Are the survivors heroes? Thats what they hear. But they wonder.For all his conservative associations Eastwood has been questioning notions of heroism ever since Sergio Leone made him a movie star. In the 60s and 70s that revisionism mostly consisted of debunking old myths and insisting on a cynical mercenary pragmatism. But ""Flags"" doesnt take the easy way out. Like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" Eastwoods film doesnt want for examples of courage under fire or the horrors of war. The only color in Tom Sterns desaturated battle palette is splash of blood or the flash of an exploding shell. (""Flags"" was produced by Steven Spielberg who directed ""Ryan"" and produced ""Brothers."")The film also refrains from easy potshots at the political propaganda machine into which Hayes and the others are fed. Though at times there is something distasteful and insensitive (as well as dishonest) about this publicity drive -- at one point the men are ordered to reconstruct the event on a papier mache mount in Chicagos Soldier Field with fireworks echoing artillery blasts and brass bands in attendance -- theres no question that the cause is just. (John B. Hickey is eminently dignified and nicely understated as the trios military minder.)Hayes at the centerAll the same even as the picture seeks to honor the fallen and make peace with the past there is a nagging undertow of regret and shame here that eventually finds its focus in the tragic figure of Ira Hayes. A Pima Indian inevitably nicknamed ""Chief"" Hayes suffers a barrage of racist condescension throughout his tour but the epithet that really rankles is ""hero."" Hes the only one to appreciate the disservice such a distortion inflicts on the living and the dead; how close meaningless acclaim might be to disdain. Adam Beachs agonized performance as Hayes is the films standout.Though much of the script by Paul Haggis and William Broyles based on the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers feels overly familiar and unduly repetitive the movie accumulates its power over time. A framing device features scenes of Doc Bradley shortly before his death still troubled by dreams of the battle and his son (Tom McCarthy) interviewing survivors for the book. Its an old-fashioned device and coupled with the extensive narration for the movies last 15 minutes it shouldnt work. Yet this epilogue is where the films emotion feels most heartfelt and true.As for Eastwood age has only sharpened his craft. He was 62 when he made ""Unforgiven"" back in 1992 and hes directed a dozen films since -- including ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" which tells the ""Flags"" story from a Japanese perspective and is already in the can merely awaiting a release date.Whats most interesting about these later works is how they make no bones about being an old mans films. Thats not always a positive some of his crime thrillers have taken on a hackneyed feel that feels lazy and complacent or just plain tired.But ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is an old mans movie in the best sense. The full weight of a lifetimes experience has been brought to bear in the unobtrusive staging the delicate score (by Eastwood himself) and a thoughtful honest accounting of World War IIs bloodiest and most iconic battle. If it unfurls at a deliberate pace you can be sure it is worth the wait.""Flags of Our Fathers"" runs 131 minutes and is rated R.What did Entertainment Weekly think? Click here.

WALLACE          Ryan Phillippe left and Jesse Bradford in Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" about the three survivors of the famous photograph ""Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima."" Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Flags of Our Fathers"" with Ryan Philippe Jesse Bradford Adam Beach Barry Pepper John Benjamin Hickey John Slattery Paul Walker Jamie Bell. Directed by Clint Eastwood from a screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis based on the book by James Bradley with Ron Powers. 132 minutes. Rated R for sequences of graphic war violence and carnage and for language. Several theaters. In this Sundays Entertainment amp; the Arts Freelancer Jeff Shannon goes on the set of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and meets director Eastwood; an interview with Beach will be on www.seattletimes.com/entertainment. It takes Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" awhile to find its way; the veteran filmmaker it turns out needed time to turn a big story into an intimate one. But once this World War II drama finds its footing -- and much of the film goes by before it does -- its extremely moving. At the end a flag dances quietly in a whispering breeze celebrating the films real-life heroes as eloquently as any words. ""Flags"" tells the story of the three survivors of the famous photograph ""Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima"" taken on Mount Suribachi on Feb. 23 1945. In the photo five Marines and one Navy Corpsman their faces obscured struggle to raise an American flag. It immediately became an image of the war but one without context. ""Everyone who saw that picture"" says someone in the film ""thought it meant victory."" James Bradley published the book ""Flags of Our Fathers"" in 2000 as a tribute to his father John (the Navy man in the photograph) and all the men of his generation who never talked about their experiences in the war. It traced the fates of the six men in the photograph three of whom never came home. For the trio who did the photo came to haunt them. They became famous for a while then faded into obscurity. ""Flags"" with its vast battle scenes is a change of pace for Eastwood following two small-scale character-based gems (""Million Dollar Baby"" ""Mystic River""). He seems to struggle with the first third of the movie. William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis screenplay doesnt make the characters distinctive and Eastwood cant find a way for the actors to emerge from the blur of uniforms. The blue-tinged battle scenes early in the film shot by Eastwood regular Tom Stern are impressive (a head is blown off in perfect CGI) but feel remote; and we dont yet know the characters well enough to be invested in their fates. But eventually the story gets smaller and more focused and the performances begin to take shape. Bradley (Ryan Philippe) Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) are wined and dined around the country to raise funds for war bonds. The experience is often surreal flag-raising re-creations in a football stadium; replicas of the photo carved from vanilla ice cream drenched in blood-red strawberry sauce. But they struggle with the idea that what they did was of any more importance than their forgotten comrades. ""I cant take them calling me a hero. All I did was try not to get shot"" says Hayes a Native American who stoically tolerates tomahawk jokes and turns to drink to dull the pain. Eastwood has become a marvelous director of actors and he coaxes fine work out of the trio; particularly Philippe who has a quiet maturity here that hes rarely shown before. Bradford playing a very young man trying to seize an unexpected brass ring is touchingly eager and Beach (who has the movies most emotional scenes) lets us see the sad weight his character carries. ""Maybe there was no such thing as heroes. Maybe there were just real people like my dad"" says a voice-over (representing James Bradley) late in the film. As we watch the soldiers splashing on a beach in a happy flashback the message resonates. Its sentimental but in an old-school way that works -- the sentiment is earned. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" finally finds its voice and sings proudly.

Wallace They survived the war but Iwo Jima marked them for life 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Flags of Our Fathers Drama. Starring Ryan Phillippe Adam Beach and Jesse Bradford. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 132 minutes. At Bay Area Theaters. A young medic stands on a battlefield only its not a field. Its all rock a scene of desolation. He sees nothing and no one and yet he senses the presence of mortal danger. Its a scene of panic and utter loneliness a vision of hell -- or to be specific a vision of Iwo Jima 1945. Then cut to an old man in bed decades later gasping for breath as he wakes from a nightmare. Wars may end but the impressions they leave on the mind dont go away. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" the latest from Clint Eastwood is an attempt to make the ultimate movie about war and its aftermath. But alas he cant quite get that flag up the mountain. Eastwood does his best to depict the horror of battle the true nature of what we call heroism and the real and thoroughly unromantic difficulty of postwar readjustment. But hes saddled with a screenplay that never finds its way to a compelling narrative. Likewise screenwriters William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis seem to have been saddled with the constraint of having to depict true events and real people. Based on the book by James Bradley ""Flags"" tells the story of the men who planted the flag on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima -- and of the three survivors enlisted to go on a cross-country savings bond tour in the spring of 1945. In sticking to true events everything (except for the battle scenes) is a bit lukewarm. The flag raising is presented in matter-of-fact terms. It was neither staged nor did it happen in the midst of a battle. As for the bond tour it was neither a cynical exercise in exploitation nor a noble crusade. And the guys -- they were just confused youngsters not especially heroic or interesting. I expect that people who end up loving the film will say ""Yes but thats exactly the point that its not about heroes or villains but about reality and real people."" Without a doubt the matter-of-fact approach works beautifully in the flag-raising scene. Eastwood understands the importance of that image in the American consciousness and he films it meticulously with a series of well-placed shots showing a pole being found and a flag being attached to it. He knows he just has to detail it not sell it and the audience will be moved. But that moment which comes roughly in the middle is the last powerful scene in this 132-minute picture. What follows is an account of what happened to each of those six men an undertaking thats a lot more conscientious than dramatic. The bond tour is a series of repeated actions Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) the reluctant hero gets drunk and cries. The media-savvy Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) blossoms in front of crowds and becomes the center of attention when his fame-seeking girlfriend (Melanie Lynskey) shows up. And John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) ... actually he doesnt really do anything other than watch the others with soulful understanding. Like clockwork there are flashbacks to Iwo Jima though once one realizes the reason for these flashbacks they begin to seem obligatory The movie keeps going back to show how the other Marines were killed. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is as painstaking as a documentary but without the satisfaction of a documentary or the impact of a drama. Still though this film may be less than the sum of its parts the invasion scene is one of the best sequences made by any director this year. Eastwood starts with a convoy of battleships heading toward Iwo Jima with planes flying low overhead -- he shoots this from a place high in the sky above the fighter planes and then cuts to the scene as experienced from aboard the ships. Its a majestic image. Then the men land on Iwo Jima and they arent attacked at first. Surrounded by eerie calm they start climbing the mountain ... and then slowly the shutters of the hidden gun emplacements open and we see the Americans from the Japanese perspective. Sitting ducks. In these early moments Eastwood doesnt show the Japanese soldiers just the gun barrels and the effect it creates is that of the mountain itself attacking the troops. One shot probably lasts no more than two seconds -- an American fires a big gun straight up at the mountain. How do you fight a mountain? The near impossibility of what these Marines accomplished is awe-inspiring. In the battle scenes at least to a greater extent than in the civilian scenes Eastwood is freed from the weak screenplay. Maybe this bodes well for his next effort ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" a companion piece that will present the battle from the Japanese perspective. -- Advisory Strong language and horrific gore -- open wounds gashes exposed intestines -- not for the squeamish.

Flags of Our Fathers tells the story of the men who raised the American on Iwo Jima during World War II. Photo Warner Bros. Flags of Our Fathers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Every jackass thinks he knows what war is"" intones a voice at the start of Flags of Our Fathers. But this one doesnt. I know nothing of war. I cant judge whether the battle scenes in Clint Eastwoods follow-up to Million Dollar Baby are authentic re-creations or Hollywood tripe. It just may be that war is as jumbled and confusing as Eastwood portrays it that a soldier who lives through armed conflict survives with no clear sense of the who what and when. Maybe he cant see the faces under the helmets. Maybe the mystifying anarchy of combat intrudes on him decade after decade with the shattering force of a salvo. Flags of Our Fathers may well be an accurate depiction of war-zone tumult and its psychic wounds but that does not make for a cogent narrative. I longed to comprehend it better to follow its cavalcade of doughty servicemen on their assault up the sulfurous mountainous Japanese island of Iwo Jima where five Marines and a Navy Corpsman raised a flag and created an icon of hope. Eastwoods movie makes a few things clear the significance of this battle near the close of World War II; the zeitgeists embrace of the flag-raising photo; and the war bonds campaign that co-opted the stories of the young men in it. The films sympathy for them -- on the battlefield and off -- is its noblest impulse and from a storytelling standpoint its greatest strength. The cast gleams with integrity; a few performances especially Adam Beachs as a distraught Pima Indian Marine have a chafed forthright intensity that kindles the movies best scenes. But like the Japanese in the Pacific the screenplay (adapted by William Broyles Jr. and Crash writer-director Paul Haggis from James Bradleys and Ron Powers book) bumps around from Iwo Jima to its immediate aftermath to several years later to 50-some-odd years later -- and back to Iwo Jima where so many combatants huff in and out of so many scenes that its a rough time keeping them all straight. The main characters make sense enough Beach as Ira Hayes Jesse Bradford as Rene Gagnon and Ryan Philllippe as the Corpsman John ""Doc"" Bradley father of the books co-author. Theyre the three who hoisted the pole and lived later touring the country to raise billions for the seventh war-bond campaign. Along the way they became flesh-and-blood embodiments of Joe Rosenthals legendary photograph which has been rendered in posters stamps bronze papier-mache and (according to the movie) ice cream. They were also lionized and arguably exploited forced into heroic role-playing that sometimes clashed with the facts. We learn who raised the flag and who didnt. We learn of a previous flag that went up hoisted by a different platoon. But we learn nothing or close to it of the Japanese presence on that forbidding rock. Next year Eastwood plans to release Letters From Iwo Jima which promises to scrutinize the battle from their point of view a move that suggests Flags of Our Fathers was never meant to tell more than half the story. Im not sure it tells even that. The director and his computer whizzes have toiled overtime to get the look of war just so -- the washed-out colors the gathering horde of ships the thud and crack of artillery and the sooty dreamlit minimalism of a landscape scoured by death. If only they had worked as hard on evoking the soldiers who fell there. ""The real heroes"" as Gagnon says ""are dead on that island."" And so they remain the film having failed to rouse them. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

Fireworks boom and blaze. Flashbulbs strobe. Flashbacks unfold. Navy Corpsman John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) and Marines Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) have been drafted into the nations war bond effort because they are heroes. The ersatz hill they ascend over the course of Clint Eastwoods powerfully intelligent morally rich ""Flags of Our Fathers"" represents Mount Suribachi. The pose they finally strike near the films end is the one captured Feb. 23 1945 by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal. Based on James Bradley and Ron Powers best seller the movie (adapted by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis) tells the story of the men who raised the Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima during one of WWIIs most brutal battles. Structurally intricate the film follows the men not only as they climb that makeshift mountain but also as they traverse the nation selling war bonds. The movie intercuts these journeys with scenes from battle. It also depicts author Bradleys quest to discover why his father refused to talk about the event but had written as a young man that it was one of his happiest. The flag-raising took place early in the invasion. By battles end only three of the six who raised the flag survived. But the shot carried on newspaper front pages back home fired a war- weary nations imagination. The government saw in the photo an opportunity to reinvigorate its coffers. Few other directors capture Americas contradictions the way Eastwood does. In different but no less telling ways ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" wrestled with our attraction to violence good and evil. In ""Flags"" he compassionately engages themes of heroism (real and imagined) patriotism (earnest and manipulated) duty to country and love of battlefield comrades. The six men Rosenthal captured actually raised the second flag of the day. The click of Rosenthals camera and the whirr of another were pretty much the only acknowledgment of that second raising until the photo landed on the covers of the nations newspapers. In ""Flags"" its the first raising that sets battleships off the island blasting their horns and the Marines onshore to whooping. But a bigwig wants a souvenir. So the order is given Take down the first. Hoist a second bigger standard. Traveling through the U.S. with handler Keyes Beech (James Benjamin Hickey) the men are glad-handed back- slapped and flirted with. ""Flags"" is a meditation on the burden of unsought celebrity. Beachs portrayal of Hayes angst and agonies is a breakthrough for the Canadian not least because he burns brightest in a very ensemble affair. Trying to evade the mantle of hero doesnt guarantee peace for Hayes a Pima Ariz. Indian. As Hayes drinks more and more he becomes a liability on the tour. Hoping to prosper from the heros welcome doesnt serve Gagnon any better. Bradfords depiction of the New Hampshire native captures a clumsy youthful mix of hopefulness and opportunism. Hes not alone in expecting benefits. His mother and fiancee are crushed when a celebration is scuttled because FDR has died. Given this is it any wonder author Bradley didnt discover his fathers feelings about the flag raising until after his dad died and he discovered his fathers letters tucked away in an office closet? Doc Bradley is ""Flags"" quiet steady witness. Theres a deep decency in Eastwoods approach to battlefield carnage. While cinematographer Tom Sterns palette is evocatively retro theres nothing visually celebratory here. The mayhem is graphic but confoundingly quick. One moment a Marine is running the next he is no more but not in some choreographed way that grants beauty to a hasty ugly demise. Combat ""Flags"" asserts is hell and hell is a very chaotic place. Some movies and their makers are essential to our understanding of ourselves. Eastwood has become such a director. With ""Flags"" he once again proves he is filmmaker for what ails us but also for what can make us extraordinary.

"The photo and the facts - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The photo and the facts Clint Eastwood focuses on too many elements in epic story of World War II image By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 20 2006 Theres a famous line from the 1962 John Ford movie ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""  ``When the legend becomes fact print the legend."" That sentiment goes to the heart of our national propensity for mythmaking and it applies as much to war as to westerns.In ``Flags of Our Fathers"" his new film about the 1945 battle of Iwo Jima and its legendary flag-raising photo Clint Eastwood simultaneously tries to honor the legend and lay bare the facts behind it. If that sounds confused well so is the movie.``Flags"" is also brutal elegiac caustic noble sentimental -- a World War II film that tries to be all things to all Americans. That may be a fine way to win elections but its hard on good filmmaking. You come out of the theater impressed by the scope of Eastwoods reach and frustrated by how little remains in his grasp. As gifted as this filmmaker is this isnt the sort of thing he does best.The chief flaw of the film is structural ``Flags"" intercuts between the grueling 35-day battle itself the ensuing US tour of three of the supposed flag-raisers and modern-day sequences in which the son of one of the men interviews his late fathers fellow servicemen sifting their memories for the truth.There are three movies here in other words and two of them are ``Saving Private Ryan. ""``Flags of Our Fathers"" is based on the 2000 book by James Bradley  son of John ``Doc"" Bradley and at one time it was intended to be directed by Steven Spielberg  who commissioned a script by William Broyles Jr . Spielberg is still credited as producer but when the directorial reins passed to Eastwood he brought in his house screenwriter Paul Haggis (``Million Dollar Baby"" ) to fine-tune the script. Thats a lot of cooks.There are even more in the movie. As is now known that iconic Joe Rosenthal photo of six men raising a US flag atop Mount Suribachi wasnt quite what it seemed. The flag had already been raised by members of Easy Company early on the morning of Feb. 23  1945 as American forces took control of the beachhead. Told that one of the Navy brass wanted it as a souvenir a battalion commander ordered a switcheroo -- no one but the Marines should have the glory of the memento in his opinion -- and sent another group up to replace the first flag.Thats the image that went into the newspapers and the history books an accidental fraud that doubled as a booster shot for an exhausted and nearly bankrupt America. Only three of that second group were alive by the end of the long battle -- Navy corpsman Bradley (Ryan Phillippe ) and Marines Ira Hayes (Adam Beach ) and Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford ) -- and ``Flags"" re-creates the months-long whistle-stop tour on which the US government sent them. Its an orgy of patriotic overkill meant to sell war bonds (and it does to the tune of 23.3 billion) but the effect of the hoopla on the psyches of the men is ruinous. Asked to climb papier-mache replicas of Suribachi in stadiums across the country -- to fireworks and Sousa marches no less -- they mostly retreat further into themselves. The slick naive Gagnon is happy to play the war hero; he certainly looks the part. The taciturn ``Doc"" Bradley a medic who risked his life dozens of times a day to aid the wounded constantly drifts back into bloody memories of the battle.The movie presents Hayes as the primary victim. A Pima Indian trained as a Marine paratrooper  Hayes wants no part of the glory but every time he steps away from the limelight theres some racist fool to put him in his place. Crippled by survivor guilt Hayes turns increasingly to alcohol. ``I cant take them calling me a hero"" he moans to his government minder (John Benjamin Hickey ). ``All I did was try not to get shot.""Its a solid unsettling point What really makes a hero? ``Flags of Our Fathers"" tries to answer by constantly returning to the battle for the tiny Pacific island one character likens to ``a burnt pork chop."" We see good men die horrible deaths and Eastwood memorializes as much military bungling as individual bravery.These are harrowing sequences and bloody as hell but they use the same cinematic vocabulary as the D-Day scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan"" without establishing their own emotional beachhead. Desaturating the colors from Tom Sterns cinematography so that everything is olive drab and deep crimson Eastwood thrusts dozens of helmeted young men at us and asks us to keep them all straight. You appreciate their actions even as youre sorting them out.The Japanese dug into caves remain unseen except for an occasional detonated corpse. Anyway Eastwood is giving them their own film ``Letters From Iwo Jima"" told from the Japanese perspective and due in February . The battle in ``Flags of Our Fathers"" is between dueling notions of valor the simpleminded kind used to sell war on the home front and the bitter endlessly compromised sort found in the trenches themselves.The relevance to current events is there for the taking; the director doesnt force the issue. Hes more interested in the young warriors who get caught between the legend and the facts -- between what we want from them and what they endure for us. Its a monumental subject and this heartsick but diffuse movie only occasionally glimpses its entirety.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Why arent we being shot at one of the young men wonders to a comrade. Why not indeed? With horror-movie creepiness a slit suddenly opens in what looks to be a thatched mound in the hillside and the barrel of a machine gun snakes out. The camera now assuming the point of view of the Japanese soldiers in the camouflaged bunker pans across a column of Marines soon so soon to be the latest casualties of war. ENLARGE This sequence which takes place early in Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is one haunting scene among many. His is a deeply affecting account admittedly a sometimes muddy one of the band of brothers in THE iconic photograph of World War II five Marines and a Navy corpsmen their faces obscured hoisting the U.S. flag atop Iwo Jimas Mount Suribachi. In fact it was the second of two flag raisings snapped that day by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal; a do-over was required when supposedly the secretary of the Navy demanded the first flag as a souvenir. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" also serves as testament to the fact that spin was as revered a tool in 1940s Washington as it is today. As a civilian that lone corpsman in the photo John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) worked as a barber for the local funeral home. When we first meet him hes none too skillfully trimming the locks of Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) a Marine runner whos also destined to appear in the shot seen round the world. In the days before the assault on Iwo Jima -- eight inhospitable square miles described by a superior as resembling a burnt pork chop -- Bradley and Gagnon play cards with their buddies including Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) whos nicknamed Chief Harlon Block (Benjamin Walker) and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross) the goofy naive kid brother of the unit. Despite the best intentions of their commanding officer Michael Strank (Barry Pepper) who like Hayes and Block and Sousley would also appear in the photo these young men were ill-prepared for what waited in the islands black sand. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which uses the hoary if reliable framing device of a journalist interviewing veterans inter-cuts the battlefield scene -- almost drained of color they have a stunning intensity and immediacy -- with scenes from the home front. There pols and public-relations specialists seek to capitalize on the sensation caused by the photo to sell more war bonds. They argue about strategy and turf and about how best to deploy their latest ""weapons"" the ""it"" boys of the moment Doc Bradley Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes the only three men from the picture to survive Iwo Jimas carnage. In fact the trio has simply exchanged one battleground for another a point made manifest by the pop-pop-pop of bullets bleeding into the sounds of popping flash bulbs. The decision to shoot from a distance the scene of the photo being snapped to forswear slow motion close-up views of the marines faces and images of the flag-raising taken from different angles -- honors the historical record. It also serves the plot which deals partly with the consequences of misidentifying one of the men in the picture. But whats good for the plot isnt necessarily good for viewers of the movie. Certain key Marines are given minimal face time and in their helmets they all look markedly similar -- so young and so scared. Consequently film audiences who might otherwise be focusing on the movies underlying themes of bigotry and media manipulation -- the casual racism directed at Chief the insistence that the trio re-enact their big moment by ""climbing"" a papier-mache mountain and planting Old Glory for the benefit of a cheering crowd at Soldier Field -- will instead be muttering to themselves ""Wait which one is Harlon?"" ""Was Hank (another Marine in the unit) in the picture or wasnt he?"" and ""Whose mother is that anyway?"" The cheap perfume of sentimentality wafts through the closing moments of ""Flags of Our Fathers."" Its all the more noticeable for having been avoided so well and so long. Mr. Eastwood knows that sort of thing doesnt mix with the stench of war. Running With Scissors Initially Deirdre Burroughs (Annette Bening) seems a quite delightful Auntie Mame to her young son Augusten (Jack Kaeding; as a teenager Joseph Cross) in the irritating adaptation of Mr. Burroughss 70s-era ""personal memoir."" Deirdre thinks nothing of keeping Augusten home from school to set her hair thinks nothing of rousing him in the middle of the night so he can listen to her latest -- ghastly -- confessional poem. ""Did it feel powerful to you?"" she demands. Augusten whos charmed by Mom and even at 6 nobodys fool gives the only possible answer that publication in the New Yorker is a slam dunk. ENLARGE Annette Bening plays an unconventional mother in Running With Scissors. But as the years go by and the rejection letters pile up and the vanity-published book of poems goes unheralded actually unnoticed Auntie Mame morphs into Auntie Maim. Deirdre with her delusions of grandeur is a one-woman wrecking crew hurling invective and punches at her soon-to-be ex-husband alcoholic Norman (the very good Alec Baldwin) and warning Augusten not to get in the way of her ambitions and her attempts to locate her creative unconscious. Ah life with mother. Finally Deirdre puts her head in the hands of Dr. Finch (Brian Cox) an unorthodox psychotherapist and unconventional thinker. How unconventional? He makes predictions based on the contours and placement of his bowel movements. Dr. Finch gives Deirdre Valium and false reassurances. He also gives her the opportunity to find her bliss in peace by insisting that the unwilling Augusten come live with his family. The menage includes his lank-haired mottle-cheeked wife Agnes (Jill Clayburgh) who eats pet kibble and obsessively watches episodes of the cult classic ""Dark Shadows"" perhaps regarding them as home movies; his daughters Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood) who snipe at each other like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane."" Theres also his patient and adopted son Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes) a 35-year-old schizophrenic who becomes Augustens lover. The laughter elicited by ""Running with Scissors"" tends to be of the embarrassed sort the impact of its neglected child horror story blunted. Blame it on the movies high-camp gloss; it trivializes what is far from trivial. It doesnt help that the story is told from Augustens adolescent perspective rather than from the vantage point of the adult Mr. Burroughs. Then theres the issue of the movies subject matter. Unless perhaps youre a psychiatric resident watching psychotics act out is equally disconcerting and tedious. Its the same old different over and over and over again. Ms. Bening takes her part and acts it all over the place while Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Wood do their best theater of the absurd. It is left to Ms. Clayburgh in a performance free of vanity and artifice to find the movies heart. Marie Antoinette It says something about Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"" that its most touching moment occurs at the French-Austrian border where the title character (Kirsten Dunst) and prospective bride of the future king of France (Jason Schwartzman) must give up her beloved little pug Mops along with everything else from her past clothes undergarments and demure coiffure. Tearfully she hands over the little dog and submits to a makeover that includes a tossed salad of ringlets trying poor child -- shes only 14 -- to do whats expected of her. Viewed through a contemporary lens and set mostly to a score of 80s pop tunes this highly stylized self-conscious enterprise -- really a music video -- posits the misunderstood and vilified Marie nee Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna as a figure in the mold of Diana Princess of Wales. Like Diana she was trapped in a loveless certainly sexless marriage -- it took seven years for this royal union to be consummated. Like Diana she was caught in a web of ritual and protocol. This included a protracted daily battle for the honor of slipping on Marias chemise. ""This is ridiculous"" she complained. No came the answer this is Versailles. And Like Diana Marie was victimized by gossip and misrepresentation in the media (mon Dieu she never said ""let them eat cake."") Marie who as portrayed by Ms. Dunst sounds like a valley girl (and I dont mean the Loire Valley) finds succor in shopping (a sequence of her trying on shoes set to Bow Wow Wows ""I Want Candy"" suggests nothing so much as a secretary at a sample sale) in heading off incognito to Paris to cavort at a masked ball (to the tune of ""Fools Rush In"") and in the bucolic pleasures of her getaway Le Petit Trianon where she makes like a shepherdess and makes music with her courtiers -- think Peter Paul and Marie. ""Marie Antoinette"" which was shot at Versailles looks absolutely sumptuous but is ultimately as substantial as a bonbon.    VHS TIP Genevieve Bujold received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the second wife quite soon the late wife of Richard Burtons vengeful Henry VIII in 1969s ""Anne of the Thousand Days.""    Last weeks film review of ""Deliver us from Evil"" described Cardinal Mahony as Bishop of Stockton in 1997. He was bishop there from 1980-85 and since then has been Archbishop of Los Angeles.

At 76 his skill for directing films that mine the human experience for truth and emotion continues to astound. He seemed at the top of his game in 2003 when he made Mystic River then reached a new peak the following year with the emotionally wrenching Million Dollar Baby. Who would have thought he could best himself with an epic and unflinching film about World War II especially after so many noteworthy war movies already have been made? INSIDE FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS Clip 1 | Clip 2 But with Flags of Our Fathers we undeniably pledge our audience allegiance. When it seemed that everything had already been said about the Greatest Generation along comes Eastwood with a compelling and eloquent examination of the nature of heroism. It is one of the years best films and perhaps the finest modern film about World War II. The story built around the battle of Iwo Jima and the political fallout from that epic clash between the USA and Japan is fascinating and morally complex. Its hard to imagine audiences failing to be riveted by the unrelenting combat sequences. The battle scenes are graphically depicted but never gratuitous. At the same time the story looks at life during wartime from several angles. Flags starts with the iconic image of the famous photo in which six exhausted servicemen hoist the American flag five days into a battle on Iwo Jima that raged on for more than a month. The story built around this seminal photo is eloquently written by Paul Haggis (Crash) and Bill Broyles Jr. (Cast Away). The focus is on the three surviving soldiers of the six -- played with sensitivity and intelligence by Ryan Phillippe Jesse Bradford and Ryan Beach -- tapped by military and government officials and trotted around on a nationwide tour as the ultimate symbols of courageous warriors. The intent behind honoring this trio was to inspire patriotic fervor and persuade Americans to buy war bonds. Each man copes differently with the dawning reality that he is being manipulated. Beach is brilliant as a Native American soldier who laid his life on the line but still must endure racism. His characters arc from proud fighter to lost soul is heartbreaking. The story is told years later to Phillippes adult son (Tom McCarthy) by photographer Joe Rosenthal (Ned Eisenberg) who took the Pulitzer Prize-winning image. The lives of all three men are marked by their experience. The glimpse we get of the relationship between Phillippes character as an older man and his son is achingly poignant. The film is patriotic in the truest sense honoring those who risked their lives in battle and questioning the motives of those in power who sought to use the soldiers as political pawns. Though the film respects the heroes it depicts it also takes a cynical look at the selling of war to the American people. Flags of Our Fathers is the rare action film that is superbly acted hauntingly powerful and deeply insightful.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 20 2006 Save for later Saved Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is based on the 2000 nonfiction bestseller about the three surviving soldiers who raised the flag at Iwo Jima in a moment memorialized almost accidentally by AP photographer Joe Rosenthal. Clearly Eastwood wants the story of what happened to these men to resonate as much for our own era as for theirs. Its a movie about the toll that heroism extracts in a wartime culture ready-made for heroes.Almost half the films running time is taken up with the military assault on the desolate Japanese air base. Eastwood doesnt skimp in his depiction of its brutalities. Not since ""Saving Private Ryan"" has there been such an up-close rendering of the thick of battle where a life can be lost in a millisecond by the thwack of a bullet or bomb. (Americans suffered more than 2000 casualties on the first day of the invasion.) Eastwoods camerawork is less virtuosic than Steven Spielbergs which in this case may be a plus. I felt I was looking at the unvarnished horrors of war.Continually intercut with these scenes is the story of the three survivors who raised the American flag on Mount Suribachi on the fifth day of fighting. (Three of the participating marines died soon after.) It actually was the second flag-raising of the day and none of the faces in the photo can be seen clearly which only added to the iconic Everyman effect. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) and John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) are brought back to the mainland as heroes to head up a much-needed war-bonds drive. Gagnon doesnt much mind the hoopla but Hayes and Bradley resent being pulled out of battle and singled out as saviors. (Bradleys son James in collaboration with Ron Powers wrote the book on which the script by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis is based.) (See related story.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The stark contrast between the blood-and-guts realities of Iwo Jima and the fripperies of the bond drive are not lost on these men particularly Hayes who calls the tour a ""farce"" and becomes progressively more unstable as it unwinds. By intercutting between the war zone which is shot in near- monochrome and the spangly drive Eastwood toys with our perceptions. An apparent mortar explosion turns out to be fireworks; a shot of the men clambering up a hill really is a reenactment of the flag-planting in Chicagos Soldier Field.We are meant to greatly empathize with these men and their revulsion at being spotlighted. Some commentators have pointed to their predicament as the first large-scale example of media myth-making in America although Abe Lincoln and Buffalo Bill are two earlier examples. But unquestionably Americans back then were far less accustomed than now to being media-hyped as celebrities.Eastwood simplifies the issues behind the hype. Although ""Flags"" makes clear that the bond drive is a necessary stunt to raise money for ammunition and uniforms the film presents Bradley and Hayess resistance as a noble response to coercion. The explicit plea at the end of the film is for us to honor these men by respecting them for who they really were.Perhaps it is a sign of todays cynicism but I didnt feel there was dishonor in having these men parade as heroes in order to shore up support for their comrades in arms. Bradley and Hayes felt otherwise but Eastwood doesnt do enough to dramatize their torment. With the exception of Adam Beach who gives Hayess story a measure of pathos none of the actors has the force of personality to put his life in focus.If Eastwood is making an analogy between World War II and our current situation in Iraq it doesnt wash. The three soldiers in ""Flags"" are a far cry from Jessica Lynch. The uses of heroism in wartime is a much more complex issue than Eastwood allows for. He has made an honorable movie about honor but the naivete of the conception - which some will call purity - keeps ""Flags"" at arms length from greatness.

"Flags of Our Fathers Salutes The Men Behind The Moment washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Flags of Our Fathers Salutes The Men Behind The Moment From Clint Eastwoods film the scene atop Mount Suribachi and the spectacle back home when surviving flag-raisers Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) and Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) toured the country to promote war bonds. (Photos By Merie W. Wallace -- Paramount Pictures And Dreamworks) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 20 2006 In his brilliant 1961 book ""The Image A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America"" the historian Daniel Boorstin examined a gullibility in postwar America a tendency to confuse the famous with the meaningful. He defined a ""pseudo-event"" as something that was famous for its own sake as opposed to an event defined by accomplishment character courage something intrinsic to human nature. He could have been writing about the flag-raising on Iwo Jima. It was a real event that became a pseudo-event; something genuine that became the engine of a huge marketing machine with goals far more ambitious than the original participants could have imagined. Indeed once their 1/400th of a second of freakish beauty was forever frozen in an image it went on and on feeding on itself nourishing hucksters and propagandists arguably destroying the men who had actually done the thing. And that process exactly and resonantly is the center of Clint Eastwoods heartbreaking and sobering film ""Flags of Our Fathers"" based on the bestseller by James Bradley son of John ""Doc"" Bradley one of the six servicemen who planted the flag on Mount Suribachi that day in February 1945 on an island that still lay at the epicenter of the battle. Dog-tired after five days of combat the men had been given the task of running phone wire to the mountaintop 550 feet up. The presence of Japanese snipers in the area made the mission risky. Once there they were asked to improvise a little administrative task They scrounged for a pole and came briefly together to push the thing up and then got on with the war. Hardly anyone noted a runty AP photographer grumpy and also bone-tired as he snapped a pic and like the men themselves thought nothing more of it. The photo was accidentally brilliant an image of a nation particularly its boys entwined in fighting a global war. A billion kitschy reproductions later its grace and power remain undiminished. Within a few weeks three of the flag raisers were dead. Back in the real world the photo was noticed by shrewd government operators and took on a life of its own. Thus the survivors -- Bradley Pima Indian Ira Hayes and New Hampshire millworker Rene Gagnon -- were pulled from battle (actually the wounded Bradley was pulled from hospital) and sent on a bond tour. Their new mission Pretend to be heroes. Most would say Whats the problem? They were heroes. But the three boys werent heroes in the one place where it counted their own minds. No one ever told them the elemental truth If you do your job son you are a hero. They thought they had to take machine gun nests or lead charges. Thus they were ordered to play a role in something like a national delusion the idea that war is about grace and beauty that heroism is a posture under a flag. It was true; it just wasnt real. Like author Bradley before him -- though in not so much detail and in some ways compressed by the necessities of movie storytelling -- Eastwood tells of what still seems shocking. Here was a mighty sales system industrialized driven by the best minds of Madison Avenue to push a product -- the Seventh War Bond Drive -- and nobody gave a lick about the three young men. Eastwood chronicles their destruction under the wheels of commerce. Hayes the most vulnerable was enabled toward the alcoholism that led to his death at 32 by Keyes Beech (played by John Benjamin Hickey in the film) a Marine war correspondent who shepherded the three through their media ordeal and whose answer to any stressful situation was to pour another drink. Hayes (Adam Beach who was a more idealized Native American Marine in John Woos ""Windtalkers"") deserves an Oscar nom for this the showiest role in the film. Still Beach doesnt go outsize on the film and he stays within the laconic emotional register Eastwood has constructed. Give it to Ryan Phillippe as Navy corpsman Doc Bradley for understanding the reticent repressed nature of the man he was playing. Doc understood that to get through the immediate ordeal and to survive the much longer aftermath he had to bury the horrors of the island and the slaughters he witnessed (and the killing he did) far far away. Thus Phillippe -- muted quietly in control -- essentially sacrifices himself as an actor for the sake of the storys truth. Jesse Bradford also has a queasy task Rene Gagnon according to James Bradleys book was immature till the day he died; movie-star handsome (his nickname in the unit was ""Tyrone Power"") he was also weirdly passive and hungry to obey. He let his early fame rob him of any career possibilities kind of like a child star. While the book was chronological Eastwood working from Paul Haggiss version of an earlier script by William Broyles postmodernizes the story. It flows freely between realities sometimes in the hell of Iwo sometimes in the different hell of the bond tour and sometimes into the future where old men are interviewed by a shadowy James Bradley as part of his research. Eastwood can cut from a tacky ""re-creation"" of the glories of the flag-raising in front of 100000 cheering civilians at Chicagos Soldier Field to Docs memories of a particularly squalid battle moment as far from glory as can be imagined and nothing that could be reenacted before a football stadium crowd. The re-creations of the Battle of Iwo Jima are also brilliantly managed. The movie shows the same high degree of technical accuracy in terms of weapons and uniforms as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" and DreamWorks was the production company behind all three films. But Eastwood has a different agenda While ""Private Ryan"" gave us battle as narrative -- defining us and them taking us through tactical maneuver and the search for fire superiority then climaxing in battles victory -- Eastwood conjures battle as weather. It simply appears from nowhere a squall that blows in over the ridgeline -- mean savage terrifying bloody -- and then vanishes. Theres no coherence or satisfying wind-up. Moreover his set-piece battle starts and then it stops; theres no ""climax"" where a gallant major leads troops up a draw and flanks the enemy. In fact the battle that Eastwood creates seems almost existential not that anyone on Iwo ever used that word. But the landscape is so indistinct the violence so arbitrary the damage to flesh so grotesque the enemy so invisible it seems like Brechts or Becketts vision of pointless mayhem. To play up this aspect hes directed his cinematographer to desaturate the color so the combat sequences have an almost monochromatic stylization to them. On the whole the film lacks a certain clarity for a nonfiction work so much so that two of the flag-raisers -- Franklin Sousley and Harlon Block -- arent sufficiently identified. And the suggestion that if the Seventh Bond Drive ""failed"" then the United States would have to settle for a negotiated peace with the Japanese is bunk; a more pungent argument might have been for the lengthening of the war. Still ""Flags of Our Fathers"" stands with the best movies of this young century and the old one the preceded it Its passionate honest unflinching gripping and it pays respects. The flag-raising on Iwo might have indeed become a pseudo-event as it was looted for maximum profit but there was nothing pseudo about the courage of the men who did it. Flags of Our Fathers (132 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for graphic battle violence and carnage and persistent profanity.

Wallace) B- Flags of Our Fathers Genre Drama War; Starring Adam Beach Jesse Bradford Joseph Cross Barry Pepper Ryan Phillippe Benjamin Walker Paul Walker Ken Watanabe; Director Clint Eastwood; Author William Broyles Jr. Paul Haggis; Release Date Wide 10/20/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 132; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted October 18 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT Stark in its valor graphically alive in its pose of action the famous photograph of five Marines and a Navy corpsman raising the U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi one of the crests of Iwo Jima exerts such a singular and iconic power that almost anyone could come up with a different explanation for what remains so stirring about it. The position of the men -- that crouch wrenching upward -- is a perfect metaphor for the crucial last gasp of American will that pushed the nation to victory at the end of World War II. And of course the fact that you cant see any of the mens faces incarnates the selflessness of their mission. They are individuals who by implication could be anyone; they are soldiers fused and transformed into a straining human statue that becomes in an instant timeless. As they lift the flag all of us lift the flag. And that is America -- or at least that is its promise. In Flags of Our Fathers director Clint Eastwood pays homage to the physical and spiritual force of that photograph. At the same time he wants us to know that everything about the image -- how it was created how it inspired people what went on in the hearts and minds of the soldiers before and after the photo was taken -- is less a reality than a mythology a concoction a telling even tragic example of how we as Americans are always too eager to overlook the truth and print the legend. Shot by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal on Feb. 23 1945 a mere 5 days into the crucial 36-day battle to take the forbidding black-sand Japanese island (which proved to be a tipping point in the Pacific campaign) the photograph entered the national bloodstream virtually overnight spreading to people through newspapers and other reprints. Eastwood sets his film in two different worlds cutting back and forth between the Battle of Iwo Jima in all its shattering chaos and horror and the homefront public relations war that gets orchestrated around the photograph with three of those quasi-anonymous flag-raising soldiers paraded around the country as heroes. They become shills for war bonds schmoozing with smarmy politicians and posing next to kitschy sculptures of their famous image in a kind of misbegotten military pop-star tour. As the movie presents it the stalwart ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) the lightweight dandy Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and the courageous turbulently troubled Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) all to a greater or lesser degree chafed at their roles. They knew they were selling themselves -- and in the process reducing the gritty bravery of their fellow soldiers to a wall poster a user-friendly parody of itself. In Flags of Our Fathers Eastwood is here to tell us that the reality of World War II was scarier and darker than any inspirational photograph. He comes close to saying that the war had no ""heroes"" just frightened young men straining to survive. Eastwood pounds us with that message over and over again. The trouble is hes preaching to the choir -- or at least to a culture profoundly influenced by Tom Brokaws The Greatest Generation and Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan that has already absorbed the lesson that ""the Good War"" while it may have been noble was never less than hell. I think its fair to say that most of us are past the point of thinking of the soldiers who fought in WWII as plaster saints yet Flags of Our Fathers an honorable and rather plodding movie insists on demythologizing what no longer needs to be demythologized. The battle sequences shot with a desaturated nearly black-and-white clarity in Iceland and with an added layer of CGI evoke Saving Private Ryan and thats a problem The rawness of the action holds us yet Eastwood never approaches Spielbergs mesmerizing logistical virtuosity his revelations of blood and terror. Inevitably the heart of the movie shifts Stateside. Yet here too Flags of Our Fathers offers more earnestness than urgency. I never felt we were truly getting to know the three soldiers outside of their awkward PR juggernaut. Phillippes Doc is crucially underwritten and Bradford never gets past a certain self-contained smoothness though Adam Beach the star of Smoke Signals digs deep into Ira Hayes tormented drunken ambivalence about his role as a symbol. His lacerating performance suggests what Flags of Our Fathers with a less didactic historical focus might have been an investigation into the everyday lives of American soldiers who saved the world but never knew what to do with the agonies they carried home with them.

Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Flags of Our Fathers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; flags-of-our-fathers ) Flags of Our Fathers (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Flags of Our Fathers is Clint Eastwoods homage to the honored dead of World War II as well as a meditation upon how an icon is formed. Based on the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers the movie centers around the Battle of Iwo Jima one of the key late war conflicts in the Pacific Theatre. However unlike other films that have trodden similar ground (in particular the John Wayne vehicle The Sands of Iwo Jima) Eastwoods movie does two things differently. First it uses the Saving Private Ryan approach to battle (not surprising since Steven Spielberg is a producer) by showing all the blood and viscera older war movies kept hidden. Secondly it intercuts the Iwo Jima sequences with those happening Stateside several months later where key events are transpiring. One of the most famous World War II photographs features a group of six soldiers hoisting a U.S. flag upright on the highest point of Iwo Jima. James Bradleys father John was one of those six and Bradleys book tells the story not only of the Battle of Iwo Jima but of the photograph its background and its aftermath. The U.S. military used that snapshot as the centerpiece of its late war propaganda campaign. The three surviving soldiers - John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) - were shipped home to go on a countrywide tour to shake hands and promote war bonds. The truth about their involvement (they only participated in lifting a ""replacement"" flag not the original) was kept hidden lest it embarrass everyone. Although the photograph was not faked the iconic image is less pristine than one might expect. At its best Flags of Our Fathers is eye opening and thought provoking. The battle scenes are raw and energetic while the post-Iwo Jima segments question our established ideas about heroism. The word ""hero"" has been used often following 9/11 so its interesting to hear the characters in this movie question what it means to bear that label and whether they consider themselves worthy of it. In fact most soldiers did not consider themselves to be heroes but if you asked them they could identify someone else - a friend a comrade a leader - who was. This aspect of the movie differentiates it from any other World War II film to have come before it. The picture is not without flaws. The intercutting is not done smoothly. Movies that shift freely between time periods must do so in a way that does not interrupt the flow of the story and that is not accomplished here. Plus there is a third unnecessary time line to confuse things - the movie follows Johns son James as he interviews aging veterans about Iwo Jima while researching his book. Eastwood uses color coding to separate the segments. The present is in color the Iwo Jima sequences are so desaturated that theyre almost black and white and the 1945 scenes are in between. The problem however is not a question of differentiating whats happening when but keeping the viewer from losing interest when theres an awkward shift. Character development is of secondary importance to narrative and theme. As a result we never really get to know any of the films protagonists. Sometimes when someone dies were not sure who he is or how he fits into the overall narrative. Flags of Our Fathers has a lengthy epilogue that details what happens to the survivors. Unfortunately these individuals are so thinly drawn that they dont deserve the 15 minutes it takes to sketch out their post-World War II lives. As a result the movie feels overlong. There are no acting standouts and no big names. The most recognizable faces belong to Paul Walker (continuing his attempt to be known as a serious thespian) Ryan Phillippe (ditto) and Barry Pepper. In general however Eastwood has stayed away from big names not only to keep the budget down but to ensure that viewers will not become distracted by the presence of a star. And the movie is different enough from The Sands of Iwo Jima that John Waynes ghost does not haunt the proceedings. The end credits are worth sitting through if you care about the real battle since they feature a collection of still photographs. Viewing them makes it apparent how rigorous Eastwoods attention to detail is. The use of CGI (to create the massive United States fleet of ships and to show the bombardment of the island) is limited enough to be effective. Because Japan did not allow filming to take place on Iwo Jima Eastwood worked on Iceland the only other island to have beaches of black sand. Flags of Our Fathers represents the first of two movies Eastwood has made about the Battle of Iwo Jima. The second made back-to-back with this one and called Letters from Iwo Jima presents the conflict from the Japanese side and will be released next year. Until then we have Flags of Our Fathers - not the definitive cinematic re-creation of the battle but an interesting (if flawed) production.

This review was updated on October 10 2006 Ambitiously tackling his biggest canvas to date Clint Eastwood continues to defy and triumph over the customary expectations for a film career in ""Flags of Our Fathers."" A pointed exploration of heroism -- in its actual and in its trumped-up officially useful forms -- the picture welds a powerful account of the battle of Iwo Jima the bloodiest single engagement the United States fought in World War II with an ironic and ultimately sad look at its aftermath for three key survivors. This domestic Paramount release looks to parlay critical acclaim and its directors ever-increasing eminence into strong B.O. returns through the autumn and probably beyond. Conventional wisdom suggests directors slow down as they reach a certain age (Eastwood is now 76) become more cautious recycle old ideas fall out of step with contemporary tastes look a bit stodgy. Eastwood has impertinently ignored these options not only by undertaking by far his most expensive and logistically daunting picture but by creating back-to-back bookend features offering contrasting perspectives on the same topic; the Japanese-language ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" showing the Japanese side in intimate terms will be released by Warner Bros. next year. One way to think about ""Flags"" is as ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" of this generation. That 1962 John Ford Western is famous for its central maxim ""When the legend becomes fact print the legend"" and ""Flags"" resonantly holds the notion up to the light. It is also a film about the Greatest Generation that considers why its members are or were reticent to speak much about what they did in the war to boast or consider themselves heroes. Skillfully structured script by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis throws the audience into the harrowing action of the Iwo Jima invasion as a personal memory that can never be softened or forgotten. But the brutal fighting is eventually juxtaposed with the governments use of the celebrated image of the Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi for propaganda and fund-raising with scant ultimate regard for the ""heroes."" Reflecting its origins in the bestselling 2000 book by James Bradley (son of one of the central figures) with Ron Powers tale is framed around a sons search into the wartime exploits of his father John Bradley one of the six men pictured raising the flag. The I.D.ing and matching of some old-timers to their younger selves is never the easiest thing to do and the same goes for getting all the names immediately straight for a bunch of young soldiers wearing identical uniforms and very short hair. But the camera focuses on a handful of the 30000 troops that landed on the inhospitable spec of volcanic ash and tufa that is Iwo Jima on Feb. 19 1945 to dislodge some 20000 well-fortified Japanese. Among the men are John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) the only Navy man in a group that otherwise includes Marines Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) the highly capable leader Sgt. Mike Strank (Barry Pepper) Hank Hansen (Paul Walker) Ralph ""Iggy"" Ignatowski (Jamie Bell) Harlan Block (Benjamin Walker) and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross). Such is the carnage at the initial landing (the Americans suffered 2000 casualties that first day alone) that there will be some temptation to compare the scene to current co-producer Steven Spielbergs justly celebrated D-Day invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But Eastwood does it his own way impressively providing coherence and chaos awesome panoramic shots revealing the enormous armada and sudden spasms of violence that with great simplicity point up the utter arbitrariness of suffering and death in combat. The visual scheme Eastwood developed for the picture is immediately arresting. Perhaps taking a cue from the islands black sand as well as from WWIIs status as the last war shot from a filmic p.o.v. in black-and-white pic is nearly as monochromatic as anything shot in color can be. Dominated by blacks grays and olive greens cinematographer Tom Sterns images have a grave elegance a drained quality that places the events cleanly in history without diminishing their startling immediacy. On the fifth day of fighting some Americans reach the summit where a great deal of the Japanese firepower is concentrated and six Marines plant a small stars-and-stripes. Shortly after a larger flag is sent up and in an event only shown in the film considerably later six different men Bradley Gagnon and Hayes among them responding to a photographers half-joking question of ""O.K. guys who wants to be famous?"" put their muscle behind pushing up the new flag held in place by a heavy length of pipe. At once AP photographer Joe Rosenthals shot became arguably the most iconic image of the American war. No faces were identifiable in the photo leading to some confusion as to who was even in the shot and three of them were killed soon after. But the surviving three are spirited back to the mainland to spearhead a final war bonds drive. Bradley Gagnon and Hayes are treated like gold-plated heroes everywhere all the while being confronted by replicas of the flag raising made of papier-mache or even ice cream. Of the three Gagnon embraces his sudden celebrity gallivanting around with his fiancee and expecting great things to stem from it. Already haunted by the horrors he witnessed Bradley copes in a subdued way. But Hayes whose story was dramatized onscreen in 1961 as ""The Outsider"" with Tony Curtis of all people portraying the Pima Indian can barely hold it together. Feeling from the outset that their participation in the tour is a ""farce"" that the real heroes are the guys who died or are still out there fighting Hayes drinks heavily embarrassing himself while having to stomach the everyday casual racism of being called ""chief"" or being refused service. And once theyve done their bit raising billions for the government theyre left on their own to put their lives back together. Its not an easy road particularly for Hayes who in one moving genuinely Fordian moment treks a long distance for a brief visit with the father of one of his fallen comrades. Given this dramatic wrenching arc Hayes story becomes the heart of the movie and Beach who previously played a Native American in the Pacific campaign in ""Windtalkers"" unquestionably takes the acting honors with it delivering a full sense of the characters pain and sense of entrapment in an absurd situation. Other perfs are thoughtful credible and deliberately unspectacular although Pepper supplies special power as the leader the young men need as they come face to face with the enemy. The director and editor Joel Cox find an effective and comfortable rhythm for the dramas parallel tracks. Spectacle is by no means limited to the battle scenes; one major setpiece is an enormous rally at Chicagos Soldier Field where the men are expected to scale a large model of Mount Suribachi and plant the flag. Perhaps the most felicitous of the films many outstanding visual effects is the elimination of the recently built flying saucer-like addition to the venerable stadium. The films themes are so thoroughly embodied in the drama as its told that there is no need for explicit statement of them which makes the final bit of narration about the nations need for heroes seem unnecessary. Another minor flaw is a Hollywood backlot look to a couple of Chicago street scenes. Otherwise ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is exemplary in its physical aspects. Combination of exteriors shot on the black beaches of Iceland with CGI work conveys a vivid and comprehensive feel of the godawfulness of Iwo Jima. This and the forthcoming ""Letters"" represent the final work of the late great production designer Henry Bumstead; no one could wish to go out on a better note. Pic is dedicated to him and two others who died during production Eastwoods longtime casting director Phyllis Huffman and flag-raising photographer Rosenthal. The director himself composed the spare effective musical score. Flags of Our FathersProductionA Paramount (in U.S.)/Warner Bros. (international) release of a DreamWorks Pictures and Warner Bros.
