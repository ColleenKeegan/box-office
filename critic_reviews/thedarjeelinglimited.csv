McCandless gave up all his worldly possessions changed his name to Alexander Supertramp and began a solitary cross-country odyssey that ended in wintry Alaska. Penns eye for landscapes is stunning and his affection for outsider lifestyles is tangible. Hirsch who carries the film on his increasingly emaciated shoulders performs heroically but theres an edge missing. The ideal casting would have been the young Sean Penn.Wes Anderson (""The Royal Tenenbaums"") transports his arch pristine melancholic sensibility to India where three estranged brothers meet after their fathers death and hop a train in a quixotic attempt to heal their spiritual wounds. The oldest is the bossy gung-ho Francis (Owen Wilson) his face swathed in bandages after a motorcycle crash. The suave and shifty middle brother Peter (Adrien Brody) is terrified of fatherhood. The well-dressed but barefoot writer Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend. A return to form after the flat ""Life Aquatic"" ""Darjeeling"" has a lightweight coloring-book charm that deepens and darkens after these odd privileged ducks are thrown off the train. They seek out their elusive mother (Anjelica Huston) who has become a nun in the Himalayas. You immediately see where Francis got his bossiness-- and her sons got their prodigious noses.

The lesson brief enough to avoid any risk of education is conveyed mostly by snazzy graphics and cut to the rhythms of a music video essentially its oil sheiks oil alien culture oil Shell-Exxon-Mobil shaky sheiks and extremist Wahabi militants threatening our supplies of oil. Once the title sequence ends MTV history gives way to Hollywood present -- horror depicted powerfully as only a feature film can do and a fevered response out of formula TV. The horror comes almost as quickly as it does in the films spectacular trailer. Terrorists attack an American compound and kill more than a hundred people including an FBI agent. The event seems all too plausible in its evocation of the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing but exactly how does America respond? By sending in an A-Team with CSI skills -- four FBI agents who are given five days to solve the crime. ENLARGE Actually some of this makes sense within the nonsense context. The five-day limit has been imposed by the Saudis who fearing a perception that theyve lost control would rather not have any Americans on the case. And the movie which was directed by Peter Berg makes a stab -- or clumsy lunge -- at depicting internecine tensions in Washington where the FBIs desire to avenge the loss of one of their own is opposed by a weak attorney general and a timid Department of State. Just as quickly however ""The Kingdom"" comes down to a police procedural and one whose procedures prove none too interesting despite the elite quartets fondness for hip chitchat and their extremely earnest efforts to search the crime scene for clues. Even so Jamie Foxx makes Fleury the groups leader an impressively energetic action hero and you cant blame Chris Cooper or Jennifer Garner for the failings of Matthew Michael Carnahans script which gives them little of consequence to do (at least until the climax when Ms. Garner makes her mark in a savage sequence that is if nothing else gender-neutral.) As for Jason Bateman the fourth member of the team he pulls off the dubious stunt of doing very little very badly. The films one great distinction is Ashraf Barhom a fine actor with a worthy well-written role as a Saudi cop Colonel Faris Al Ghazi. At first the colonel functions only as the Americans minder a dutiful functionary under orders to keep his unwelcome visitors on a short leash. But Al Ghazi defines duty broadly. He feels an obligation to the innocent dead as well as to the sheiks and shallow princes he must live with. In Mr. Barhoms portrayal the colonel has depth and a sense of tragedy; hes the sort of worldly-wise survivor who was played in an earlier time by Paul Henreid or Trevor Howard. When studio films take on political subjects theres inevitable tension between the desire to inform and the obligation to entertain. ""The Kingdom"" isnt without political content; were reminded in passing that the relationship between the United States and the nation supplying so much of our energy is fraught with problems. Two-thirds of the way through though this elaborate studio film turns wildly and mindlessly explosive with a firefight that starts on a freeway (Arizona doubling for Saudi Arabia) and carries on and on and on into chaotic urban combat. A bizarre coda seeks to put all the killing in some perspective but its dumb enough to make that historical preface seem deep. The Darjeeling Limited At a crucial moment in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" much of which plays out on a train trip across India the train takes a wrong turn and gets lost. Its a funny idea in a loose-limbed saga that doesnt lack for them. The film directed by Wes Anderson from a script he wrote with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman is full of amusing offbeat notions as well as a few surprises and all sorts of sumptuous visuals. (The cinematographer was Robert Yeoman who shot two previous Wes Anderson films ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."") Yet theres a sense that Mr. Anderson is also temporarily lost or at least stuck en route from precocious success -- the ineffable ""Bottle Rocket"" the inimitable ""Rushmore"" -- to artistic maturity. ENLARGE Jason Schwartzman Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody in Wes Andersons ""The Darjeeling Limited."" His latest comedy tracks the physical and spiritual journey of three brothers who havent spoken to one another for a year Theyre played by Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Mr. Schwartzman. What moves the brothers whether they acknowledge it or not is a yearning to grow up and pull themselves together both as individuals and members of a family. (Having recently lost their father theyre on a mission to find their mother a crypto-hippie dropout played with spirit by Anjelica Huston.) These are subjects Mr. Anderson has explored before in his stories of extended adolescence and dysfunctional families but his variations on familiar themes arent the problem; its the familiar style and tone he deploys in their service. Mr. Wilsons Francis a control freak who lost control in a near-death experience is yet another riff on his Dignan the blithe bumbler of ""Bottle Rocket."" And the film as a whole operates in Mr. Andersons patented semi-precious zone of antic and droll. Its not as if the filmmaker has gone off the rails. Hes just not solidly on them. Feast of Love ""Feast of Love"" is slim pickings even though it was adapted from a respected novel by Charles Baxter -- why do I smell a potboiler behind the admiring book reviews? -- was directed by Robert Newman and stars Morgan Freeman Jane Alexander and Greg Kinnear. The promise of the screen version set in an Oregon town where everyone knows everyone elses business is a celebration of love in many forms enlivened by the celebrants foibles. What passes for the movies reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst -- a Cupid-governed ""Crash"" -- plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by Mr. Freemans character who serves as the towns coffee-shop philosopher. At one point he tells a love-struck friend ""I think Id proceed with caution."" Id proceed just as cautiously to the movie. DVD TIP Israeli by birth Ashraf Barhom was introduced to American audiences as the leader of the Palestinian fighters in ""Paradise Now"" (2005) Hany Abu-Assads fictional -- and surprisingly successful -- account of two young Palestinian men who are trained as suicide bombers and sent on a mission into Israel. One of the two is played by Ali Suliman who gives an affecting performance in ""The Kingdom"" as the Saudi Sgt. Haytham.

James Hamilton/Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption James Hamilton/Fox Searchlight The Brothers Whitman -- Adrien Brody (left) Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson -- wander from Rajasthan to the Himalayas in The Darjeeling Limited with baggage both literal and figurative in tow. James Hamilton/Fox Searchlight Director Wes AndersonGenre ComedyRunning Time 91 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) Three battling brothers who havent spoken in the year since their fathers funeral flail and rail and bond on a trek across India in Wes Andersons latest comic oddity. Control-freak Francis (Owen Wilson) has brought along a secretary to provide them with daily itineraries while angsty Peter (Adrien Brody) is intent on running away from his wifes pregnancy. Perpetually barefoot Jack (co-scripter Jason Schwartzman) meanwhile is trying to turn a recently failed relationship into a short story. That relationship (with Natalie Portman) is depicted not in the film itself but in a Web flick (requires iTunes) that the filmmaker is urging everyone to see before they see Darjeeling Limited. Apart from having thus created the first road-picture homework assignment Anderson (Rushmore Royal Tennenbaums) isnt breaking new ground here. But he and his actors appear to be having a larkish good time -- while illuminating a message that amounts to ""Lifes easier when you get rid of your baggage.""

Its an Anderson movie from the off the sound of The Kinks and the Stones mixed with the music of Satyajit Ray; the marriage of colour costume and production-design to create a vivid but heightened impression of the real world; and of course the presence of Wilson and Bill Murray - even if Murray appears cryptically for only a few minutes as The Businessman (most probably a reflection of the brothers father). As ever with Andersons films the comic and the melancholic work together and while Darjeeling is lighter on its feet than The Life Aquatic because of its more speedy pace and the relative simplicity of its camerawork we still encounter the familiar sight of privileged but troubled young men struggling to find a place for themselves in the shadow of their family. Does it feel like Anderson is treading water? Yes sadly it often does- but an optimist could rightly claim that an Anderson-shaped pool is ten times better than most in Hollywood.Theres much in Darjeeling thats familiar from many other road movies stand-offs arguments fights apologies shared experiences lessons learnt and relationships strengthened. We discover more about each of the brothers as we go along but theres less of the intricate background and layering of Andersons other films particularly The Royal Tenenbaums which delighted in the complexity of its biographies. Instead much is left to the moment and the landscape Anderson sucks in the sights colours and oddities of India from the manner in which tickets are checked on the train to visits to a shoe-shiner and a holy temple. Theres a moving episode involving the funeral of a child who the brothers encounter which allows for one of Andersons trademark slow dolly-shots cut to the sound of The Kinks.As ever Andersons humour is rarely laugh-out-loud which occasionally feels awkward here the set-up with three depressed Americans travelling on a train in a foreign country at least superficially calls for comedy. Instead the effect of the film is subtle as it invites us to share in the characters slow transformation culminating in a late scene in a monastery where the boys encounter their mother played by Anjelica Houston. Structurally the film isnt entirely sound and the emotional depth of both The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore is never achieved. But The Darjeeling Limited has much charm is a sensitive piece is sometimes funny and further shows Anderson to be a storyteller with a touch for the visually and aurally hip that you imagine he couldnt shake if he tried.The film is preceded by a superb 12-minute short film by Anderson Hotel Chevalier which sketches some of the background to Schwartzmans character who we find in a grand Paris hotel room alone and sombre and listening to Peter Sarstedts Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? and later contemplating sex with his semi-estranged girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. This wistful film is sexy and romantic - an Anderson first - and is a beguiling short story. Arguably though its better than the feature that follows and fosters expectations of greatness that are never fulfilled by the main feature.

They get out of the train try to have a spiritual experience and get back in. The flim never corrects their clueless assumption that all you have to do is go to the right place and use the right feather and your life will be fixed. The only Indian that has more than one line is of course a pretty lady who serves as the token romance part. That India is merely a backdrop to the interaction between the brothers might be acceptable if I cared at all about their story or if any of it was funny.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2007DavidFeaturedBest movie I saw this year.

The leads were well acted the humour was dry and mildly amusing in places the film is quirky but nevertheless lacked something to make it into a great film. Typical of his earlier films though not as good as Rushmore it is worth seeing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 26 2007Rich DeBolonghiFeaturedSeeing the trailor I had concerns about this. But it really doesnt disapoint. I was concerned about the casting of Shawtzman but he was great. I am so pleased that the history of great film making has been respected here. With all the terrible films that have been coming there is no way that I can not give this film full marks. The humour is so well delivered and subtle. If your looking for an all out riot of comedy this is not the film lets say its not an over the top Ben Stiller picture thank god. All three of the leads were fantastic and I have to say that Owen Wilson pulls out an amazing performance that is obvioulsy pretty close to home for him. No doubt the director knows what hes doing and I have to say it is so pleasing that these great film makers from america are still loyal to quality which I feel is pretty much gone in Europe now especialy since the digital cameras have taken over to reduce bugets in this continent The film is shot so well and there is great use of the cramped location. If only there was some euro directors that can deliver subtle humour and quality like this.

Two hours of oh so arch symmetrical framings pointless swish pans overly fussy art direction and baroque pop music played over slow motion shots of kookily dressed people walking in profile. Anderson is a director who cares more about lampshades than characters. Anderson has cast Owen Wilson in most of his films. He obviously rates him highly. You can draw your own conclusions form that.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 9 2007Paul SFeaturedThis film has a similar subject matter and feel of Andersons other projects but the new characters and settings are fresh and entertaining. The short film with Natalie Portman and Jason Scwartzman ties in flawlessly into the feature and gives Jack a bigger background to base his character on.

Hes ""too cool."" Hes a ""fussy"" director. He favors ""style over substance."" Not true in any sense. I saw an advance screening of The Darjeeling Limited in NY and I found it wonderful and moving. The whole point of Andersons ""fussy"" style is to set up a hyper unhinged reality that removes his characters from the humdrum and places them in an almost fantasy setting in which their actions and emotions resonate clearly. That might sound like crap but it works (at least for me). Never has a director been able to combine such a sense of melancholy and humor within his characters. All the tiny little details that some critics find too contrived only heighten the experience in my view. Ive loved all his films and Darjeeling is no exception.

Photo 20th Century Fox The Darjeeling Limited 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Owen Wilsons personal demons are his business. The Darjeeling Limited does not stand or fall on the synergy between his psychologically hobbled character and himself. Depression like coincidences can strike like a bolt from the blue and neither should be held against his latest movie. Unfortunately the film has problems of its own. Before all you Wes Anderson enthusiasts lock and load your marshmallow pop guns let me clarify Im on your side. Im one of those freaks who consider The Royal Tenenbaums the singular unsung masterpiece of 2001. Directors who breathe the rare air of the wacky bourgeoisie are wide open for ridicule especially from viewers who mistake eccentricity for coldness. But until now Andersons damaged destructive characters never felt cold. Yet an unmistakable chill runs through The Darjeeling Limited which follows the three Whitman brothers (Wilsons Francis Jason Schwartzmans Jack Adrien Brodys Peter) as they wend their way through India by rail. Engineering this ``spiritual journey is Francis who bears the wounds of a traumatic crash and hopes to bond with his siblings. And so they bump along in their tidy compartment with their beautiful stewardess (Amara Karan) stopping off in towns for run-ins with the locals or (more likely) opportunities to excavate their navels with a backhoe. Francis is a control nut. Jack is on the rebound from a break-up. Peter keeps nicking things from their dead father whose funeral a year earlier provides the main Jungian impetus for their narcissism. We get a flashback. We also get a tragic parallel set in the Indian countryside that would break hearts if it werent dropped in the middle of an emotionally frigid movie. To top it all off mother (Angelica Houston) is a nun in the Himalayas. No wonder the poor boys feel rejected. But whether theyre kneeling in shrines or blowing on mystical peacock feathers they cant express much beyond those mewling telegrammatic revelations that confess to weakness (``I dont feel good about myself) while reveling in it. In Andersons screenplay (written with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) the whiny central troika never comes to life. His stylistic approach only makes matters worse. Enriched with the music of Satyajit Ray films and the vibrant colors of India (the golds the reds the brilliant aquas) the whole thing should glow with sub-continental warmth. But the opposite occurs Visually its the frostiest movie so far this year. The reason is Andersons decision to put everything in a box whether literal or figurative. A train compartment is a box of course and a hotel room is a box and the imaginary railway that passes through the movies end is a line of boxes too. I get it We travel in our own lonely compartments while life wings past the window. But even when these characters move beyond their boxcar walls they seem defined by the space between them. The camera zooms in annoyingly twirls woozily and pans from man to man with a technical dexterity that draws attention to itself not the story. Tiny supporting performances appear like Easter eggs (Bill Murray as a businessman Barbet Schroeder as a German mechanic) and a brief opening sequence - called ``Part I but its really a short - will wow or worry fans of Natalie Portman. Of the three leads Brody draws closest to humanity but I dont fault the others for coming up short. Its an affected film about disaffected people and no cast in the world could save it. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

"Darjeeling Express suits to a T -- for the most part - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Owen Wilson Darjeeling Express suits to a T -- for the most partmovies - reviewOctober 19 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticAside from its exotic Indian setting Darjeeling is as self-absorbed precious and magically shallow as everything else Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) has ever done.Three brothers children of wealth gather for a train trip across India. It has been a year since their dad died. Francis the oldest (Owen Wilson) wants ""us to become brothers again"" and arranges the trip despite being covered in bandages from a motorcycle accident.Peter (Adrien Brody) has shown up despite the fact that his wife is due to have a baby within weeks. And Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is here despite the fact that he seems ready to bolt the moment things turn real.Francis has decreed that they must ""seek the unknown"" and ""say yes to everything even if it is shocking and painful.""So the three pile aboard and create tiny bits of mayhem on the ride.Their quest involves sightseeing faux meditation a tragedy and a host who isnt expecting them at the end of what Francis keeps hoping will be ""a life-changing experience.""Anderson has his pointless-but-cute slow-motion music-video moments and long tracking shots capturing a panorama of India behind the trio. The movie does a great job of hurling us into a comic travel nightmare that anyone who was utterly ignorant of a culture they were visiting will recognize.Darjeeling is preceded by a pretty nothing of a prologue Andersons short film Hotel Chevalier which puts Jack in a French hotel ordering room service until ex-girlfriend Natalie Portman tracks him down and disrobes.The whimsy of it all does a passable job of covering the dull stretches and the actors (Bill Murray has a cameo Anjelica Huston shows up) make it watchable.And there is a message here captured in one lovely tracking/editing sequence as we see Peters pregnant wife the stewardess and assorted other peripheral players pass us as the train rattles by. Life is but a train ride with many unexpected stops. One way or another were all onboard The Darjeeling Limited.Leave it to Anderson to make his big statement long before the closing credits.

Directed by Wes Anderson from a screenplay by Anderson Schwartzman and Roman Coppola. 91 minutes. Rated R for language. Several theaters. Movie review The Onion recently nailed the director of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" with typical laser-surgical precision in this headline ""New Wes Anderson Film Features Deadpan Delivery Meticulous Art Direction Characters With Father Issues."" True the maker of ""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" isnt stretching much here. On the other hand nobody makes films the way he does. And once you settle into the whimsical meandering groove of this Healing Comedy -- like something youd find on a booze-soaked juvenile mens version of Lifetime -- youll find it hilarious and a little magical. The Characters With Father Issues are three brothers estranged since their pop got killed a year earlier. Controlling Francis (Owen Wilson) has roped heartbroken Jack (""Rushmore"" star Jason Schwartzman) and expectant father Peter (Adrien Brody) into a spiritual journey through India on the titular train so that they can reconnect. Francis has a ridiculously bandaged head from an attempted suicide-by-motorcycle -- which unfortunately puts Wilsons recent reported suicide attempt in mind but nothing further needs to be said of it. He keeps his brothers passports makes them agree to trip rules orders their food for them and has an assistant print and laminate their itinerary each day. Jack sporting a ridiculous porno mustache constantly checks his ex-girlfriends answering machine messages but has a fling with the trains lovely stewardess (Amara Karan). And along with being ambivalent about his new child and the chances for his relationship Peter constantly appropriates their dads old possessions to establish a greater connection with him than the other two have. They play off each other well as they bicker brawl -- Jack shouts ""Stop including me"" as he maces the other two chasing him through cars -- pray drink and otherwise self-medicate through the color-drenched scenery of India. Theres a fourth character with them a load of preposterous orange monogrammed luggage which belonged to their dad and is one of the movies running jokes. As wonderfully deadpan as Andersons humor may be his imagery isnt exactly subtle as the boys eventually become forced literally to let go of all their fathers baggage. Anderson regulars show up in smaller roles Bill Murray as a wordless businessman and Angelica Huston as the boys mom whose new home in an Indian convent is their ultimate (physical) goal. And if the mechanic at the Luftwaffe auto repair shop looks familiar its director Barbet Schroeder (""Reversal of Fortune""). Even if Anderson isnt reinventing himself ""Darjeeling"" has more nonironic emotion than his previous ones and a segment involving a river rescue and a boys funeral add depth that keep it from being a one-note or cliched experience. ""Experience"" is the operative word. Detractors might find Andersons work slightly precious and maybe even self-indulgent (the 13-minute ""Hotel Chevalier"" prologue available online being an example). But his oddball odyssey stuck with me well after the final long hypnotic shot of the magic train rolling through the Indian landscape.

Comments (2) The Darjeeling Limited Recommended Video Rated R  91 minutes  2007 In its story line this wacky tale (2007) from Wes Anderson (Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums) about estranged wealthy brothers (Owen Wilson Adrien Brody cowriter Jason Schwartzman) reunited for a strained spiritual journey through India is pretty unconvincing as character development. Every bit as precious as Andersons preceding features it differs this time from late Salinger only in the way that these spoiled neurotics are implicitly ridiculed as both ugly Americans in the third world and spiritual poseurs--unlike their more committed mother (Anjelica Huston). What this movie has going for itself in spite of its cloying pleas for indulgence is a playful and interesting narrative structure that precludes much development and comes to the fore only toward the end. The whole thing may drive you batty but as with Rushmore the melancholy aftertaste lingers. With Amara Karan and Bill Murray.

"Wilkes-Barre news sports obituaries and classifieds for Luzerne County and Scranton | The Times Leader Wilkes-Barre Scranton PA - www.timesleader.com <a href=""http//impressionsads.communityq.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a8a2c2dbamp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""></a> review ""The Darjeeling Limited"" the latest self-satisfied exercise in style over substance from writer-director Wes Anderson will amuse his cult followers -- as well as Anderson himself and his pals of course -- but probably nobody else. This time he has amassed old friends Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman along with Adrien Brody to play estranged brothers who bicker while barreling across India on a train supposedly on a spiritual journey. They havent spoken since their fathers funeral a year ago and their mother (Anderson regular Anjelica Huston) has abandoned them to become a nun in the Himalayas. But the brothers Whitman like the film itself end up running all over the place without ever going anywhere. As in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" Anderson seems more concerned with precious minutiae -- the quirky kitschy clutter surrounding his eccentric characters all of which he shoots head-on in wide angle -- than with developing people and scenarios that feel even vaguely real. (Anderson wrote the script with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola.) The bittersweet heart of 1998s ""Rushmore"" has long since left Andersons movies and all thats left is a heart-shaped box one thats obsessively detailed and exquisitely ornate -- not unlike the one-of-a-kind luggage set the brothers schlep around which Marc Jacobs designed for Louis Vuitton especially for the film. The suitcases literally and figuratively function as baggage for the Whitman brothers -- and how cute is that? -- pieces they inherited from their father that have become emblematic of their years of pent-up resentments. Now as grown men the three can agree on the need for cigarettes and cheap over-the-counter Indian painkillers and thats about it. Francis (Wilson) the eldest has organized this trip and meticulously planned every minute of it to include time for both bonding and sightseeing. To make sure they keep to the schedule hes brought along his personal assistant who prints out and laminates each days agendas (because hes traveling with a printer and laminating machine naturally) all of which seems like a tactic to avoid dealing with the motorcycle crash thats left him injured and may not have been an accident after all. (The sight of Wilson with his face and head covered in bandages his blue eyes swollen with bruises and tinged with sadness is an uncomfortable unfortunate reminder of the likable actors recent real-life emotional troubles.) Peter (Brody) in classic middle-child style seeks to draw attention to himself by wearing his deceased fathers sunglasses and insisting he was always the favorite son. In mere weeks hes also about to become a father for the first time himself with the wife hes pretty sure hell end up divorcing someday anyway -- a woman whom he inexplicably didnt bother to inform he was going on vacation to India. (Its these kinds of details which feel so false that make it hard to become truly immersed in Andersons films.) Finally theres Jack (Schwartzman) the youngest a writer whos still so obsessed with his ex-girlfriend he secretly checks the messages on her answering machine from wherever the brothers happen to stop along their journey. Jack can afford expensive tailored suits but he wears no shoes. Hes also selective in the songs he plays from his iPod to accentuate particular moments yet he has an impulsive bathroom romp with a sultry train attendant (Amara Karan) before he even knows her name. All these people are quirky constructs and none of them ever really evolves even after ""The Darjeeling Limited"" takes a jarring ill-advised serious turn. They sit side by side in cramped colorful quarters complaining in deadpan fashion and trying to keep secrets from each other. Every once in a while they get off the train and visit a marketplace which is packed with different kinds of stuff (slippers snakes electronics). But all that stuff however distracting and obvious it is as a device clearly required a ton of work for which production designer Mark Friedberg deserves praise. (Longtime Anderson collaborator Robert Yeoman returns as cinematographer.) And every once in a while ""The Darjeeling Limited"" does have some lovely moments of subtlety Peter running to catch the train in slow motion (always a favorite Anderson trick) or the brothers sitting around a campfire in the desert with Debussys ""Clair de lune"" playing in the background wondering whether theyd have been friends if they werent related. More intriguing than anything we see in ""Darjeeling"" though is the short film that precedes it starring Schwartzman and Natalie Portman which takes place in a Paris hotel room and includes some details that become factors later. The two play former lovers reuniting awkwardly for the first time. Of course it contains all of Andersons self-conscious visual flourishes but theres also a delicacy and intimacy about it and a pathetic sweetness in Schwartzmans forced bravado that make it instantly accessible and recognizable. But you wont see ""Hotel Chevalier"" as its called in all theaters. Its often playing before ""Darjeeling"" at film festivals and on DVD only -- Anderson wants you to seek it out for yourself on the Internet beforehand. And thats not nearly as clever as he thinks it is either. If you go What ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and ""The Hotel Chevalier"" Starring Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody Directed by Wes Anderson Rated R for language Running time 91 minutes ## <a href=""http//impressionsads.communityq.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a8a2c2dbamp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""></a>",http://archives.timesleader.com/2007_41/2007_10_26_Review_-tlguide.html,200,thedarjeelinglimited11,thedarjeelinglimited,timesleader

Individuals may be locked inside their private emotional compartments while the world whizzes past yet they are linked to others whether by fate joy blood - and in some cases a railcar hitch.Or by melancholy like the estranged Whitman brothers. A year after their father has passed on Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) the eldest organizes a railway trip across India so that he middle brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and baby Jack (Jason Schwartzman) can get to know one another as adults.The more Francis survivor of a near-death accident asks his brothers to say yes to new experiences the more they say no no no no no. The more Francis extends himself the more his siblings shrink from his grasping hugs. The more Francis micromanages the brothers spiritual quest the more the heavens (and the audience) laugh at his presumption. Imagine the Marx Brothers on a religious pilgrimage the Three Stooges slam-dancing to classic Kinks songs.I admit that prior to Darjeeling I have more admired than enjoyed Andersons films. Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic struck me as hermetically sealed excursions into the angst and milieus of privileged kids and their parents elegantly designed as rooms in a fancy dollhouse.Darjeeling cowritten by Anderson and cousins Schwartzman and Roman Coppola opens the window and lets in sun oxygen and the ""spicy"" smell that Peter identifies as Indias particular scent. Through the character of Francis Anderson control-freak director lets the unplanned and unmanaged tumble on the screen.The brothers travel across Rajasthan in Indias north with an Everest of luggage and a pharmacopeia of over-the-counter treatments. They self-medicate so as not to feel.Francis clearly has trouble (his ""accident"" may have been a botched suicide a plot development uncomfortably close to Wilsons recent real-life suicide attempt); his brothers have women troubles.As they hurtle past the spectacular Thar Desert they rub salt and masala too in wounds still raw from childhood and the fresher ones of Dads demise. Its the classic sibling drama The eldest bosses the others around; the middle one rebels and the youngest emotionally detaches.It takes some time before they get outside their own petty fights and see their dynamic mirrored in the life-and-death situation of three Indian boys brothers drowning in a river. When the competition of Dad-always-loved-me-best and I-have-Dads-belt stops something very moving happens.Finally Darjeeling is a movie about people who literally carry a lot of emotional baggage metaphorically unpack it and spiritually lighten their loads. By the end I felt lighter. Which is closer to enlightenment than most movies get.The Darjeeling Limited  (out of four stars) Directed by Wes Anderson.

"The Darjeeling Limited Rocky spiritual journey across India | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Darjeeling Limited Rocky spiritual journey across IndiaWes Anderson doesnt so much make movies as invite us to step inside his head to view the world beneath his perpetually arched eyebrows.Three brothers from left Jason Schwartzman Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson squabble their way through India in The Darjeeling Limited.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 5 2007 Starring Owen Wilson Adrian Brody Jason Schwartzman and Amara Karan. Directed by Wes Anderson. 91 minutes.At major theatres. Article Continued BelowWes Anderson doesnt so much make movies as invite us to step inside his head to view the world beneath his perpetually arched eyebrows. Saying ""yes"" to Wes means accepting strange things. Such as the peculiar way he introduces a key character in The Darjeeling Limited his latest hipster head shaker.He does it via a 13-minute short filmed in Paris titled Hotel Chevalier. It stars Jason Schwartzman as Jack Whitman the youngest of three brothers whose tangled family ties enliven The Darjeeling Limited.The short is awkwardly viewable only on the Internet (try www.madwell.com/flash/hotel.htm). Its a must-see if you want to fully understand where Anderson is going with his train movie in which the shallow and the deep share the same rails.Witness the peculiar alchemy when the lovelorn Jack holed up in a five-star Paris hotel hits the play button on his iPod. Peter Sarstedts 1969 faux-Dylan ditty Where Do You Go To (My Lovely) issues forth like a river of syrup but the treacle turns to gold. It captures absolutely the mood of Jacks fleeting - and somewhat mystifying - reconnection with his lost love played with sexy intrigue by Natalie Portman.It also leads in a way not immediately apparent to The Darjeeling Limited which shares a name with the luxury train Jack and his brothers Francis (Owen Wilson) and Peter (Adrien Brody) have booked passage on for a ""spiritual journey"" across India.The Whitman brothers each have matching sets of exquisitely ornate Louis Vuitton luggage items at once whimsical and symbolically freighted. The fact that the brothers are together at all is something of a marvel. Theyve been bitterly estranged since the unexpected death of their father a year earlier.Controlling older bro Francis - heavily bandaged from his own recent brush with mortality - has reunited them with instructions to ""say `yes to everything."" Peter barely makes the train sprinting to catch it just ahead of a slower and unsuccessful fellow traveller. The thwarted rider is Bill Murray an Anderson regular and title star of his previous film The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. The story in The Darjeeling Limited which Anderson co-wrote with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola is simple only on the surface. The Whitman Brothers are like the Marx Brothers or Three Stooges feigning affection while hurling daggers ""I love you too"" Jack yells at one point. ""But Im going to mace you in the face""They all have irritating tics and darker sides. Francis bosses with the assistance of a personal lackey yet his own life is unraveling. Peter flaunts his close ties with departed dad yet hes ambivalent about his own impending fatherhood. And Jack an erstwhile novelist and serial fornicator insists on reading aloud his romantic prose even though he seems immune to genuine emotion.The brothers are so busy squabbling and ingesting painkillers they barely notice the beauty of India unfolding through their train window (wonderfully captured by Robert Yeomans camera). Theyre not immune however to the charms of train hostess Rita (Amara Karan a find) who offers them sweet lime and other delights.The brothers are Philistines when it comes to the spiritual part of their journey. Kneeling together before a sacred shrine Francis becomes angered that Peter is wearing one of his expensive belts without permission. The argument cant wait until they return to the train.The Darjeeling Limited can be viewed on one level as a satire of Americans abroad. The Whitmans are the proverbial bulls in a china shop trampling everything in their path. They even manage to turn a rescue into a farce. Is it them or is it Andersons unwillingness or inability to deal with real drama?The movie runs deepest when the brothers finally deal with their baggage both real and metaphysical. No hints here about that or the actor who joins the fray. Except to say that Anderson ties up loose ends not only within the movie (never a sure thing with him) he also niftily reconnects with Hotel Chevalier. Something close to insight penetrates the psychic permafrost as one Whitman recognizes ""There are so many things we dont know about each other arent there?""True. But watching how all the brothers reach that same conclusion is an experience more profound than trivial.

HANDOUT PHOTO. Photo James Hamilton Review Darjeeling takes an empty spiritual ride through India 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Darjeeling Limited Comedy-drama. Starring Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody. Directed by Wes Anderson. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a frustrating movie a work of immaturity from a director who should be past the empty gestures and self-protective distance of his early work. Wes Anderson has attempted a film of strong emotion but entrapped in the self-imposed coolness of his style he has created a wistful decorative emptiness - with a handful of obligatory flailings in the direction of random meaning. The frustration is compounded by the fact that theres enough here to discern the movie Anderson might have made. Three brothers who havent seen one another in a year rediscover their connection while on a spiritual journey through India. Such a premise demanded a commitment to a real story leading to an emotional resolution. Instead Anderson tries to divert us with clever bits and self-contained incidents that go nowhere. The film delves no deeper than the consumer aspect of travel the nouveau colonialism in which spiritual shopping becomes a conversational accessory. Andersons use of music is all too telling. At key moments he pulls from the Kinks heavily as though Ray Davies (and in one case Dave Davies) could provide the purpose and emotion that the scenes are lacking. These are good songs but they mainly end up emphasizing the expressive limits of whats happening onscreen. The movie benefits from the performances of Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody as two of the brothers and it survives the casting of Jason Schwartzman as the youngest brother. The good news is that Wilson and Brody occasionally succeed in suggesting depths that are nowhere in the script. As for Schwartzman he doesnt make things worse but hes not capable of making them better. He co-wrote the screenplay and in ""Darjeeling Limited"" he seems in his element. Francis (Wilson) bandaged and recovering from an accident brings his younger brothers Peter (Brody) and Jack (Schwartzman) together for the journey. The intention is that they bond and begin to feel and act like brothers again. Things happen on the train but theyre nothing of importance just fey unrelated incidents. Eventually Anderson gets them off the train and tries to bring the movie to earth in some revelatory way. The brothers bond with people in an Indian village and although these scenes land as more signifier than significant you can feel the relief on the part of the actors - especially Brody - in being given less wispy fare. Brody finally gets to connect with the grief inside his character and for those minutes he lifts the movie. Wilson gets his moment of heavy lifting as well in a simple but haunting scene in which he takes off his bandages while looking at himself in the mirror with a thousand-yard stare. The face thats revealed is no longer that of a golden boy. Thats a man who has looked into the abyss. Its a visible clue to the internal disturbance that may have led to the actors recent suicide attempt. That Wilson allowed the camera the intimacy of that gaze is to his credit as an actor. Anderson is too talented to make a film without memorable moments. As a visual stylist alone his work is impossible to dismiss. Yet cut around the substantive bits in ""Darjeeling Limited"" and youd be left with 20 minutes of disparate unconnected scenes. The film is eye-popping and gorgeous but vacant a diversion and a deflection pointing to a meaning that never arrives. Enlightenment isnt a moment of realization but the product of commitment and spirituality is expressed in action - its not an acquisition. If a man throws away his suitcase in order to run fast and catch a train it doesnt mean that hes finally discovered his priorities. It probably means that hes got enough money to replace whatever was in the bag. Like the characters in ""Darjeeling Limited"" Anderson sets the bar too low for himself. The talent is there. Its undeniable and unmistakable. But a more frontal embrace of pain without the flattening detours will be Andersons entranceway to his next level as an artist. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and simulated sex.

"Darjeeling Limited The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; darjeeling-limited-the ) Darjeeling Limited The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli My reaction to The Darjeeling Limited is much the same as for most of Wes Andersons previous efforts its an easy movie to admire but more difficult to like. Technically and thematically theres a lot in The Darjeeling Limited to arrest the attention. Emotionally theres a void. Try as I might I could not connect with any of these characters. Anderson keeps them at arms length. Tragedies both big and small occur during the course of this offbeat road trip but the impact on the viewer is minimal. Some would argue that The Darjeeling Limited is a comedy. In a sense thats true and Andersons previous efforts - from Bottle Rocket to The Life Aquatic - have all fallen within the loosely defined boundaries of the genre. However this film is easily the most serious of Andersons efforts and seems more dramatic in both scope and intent. The ""comedy"" to the extent that it is present is not the kind that will cause audience members to break out in laughter. Its more of the wry cutting variety - the sort of thing that goes hand-in-hand with a screenplay that forces a reviewer to search for synonyms of ""quirky."" Francis (Owen Wilson) Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) are three grown brothers who havent seen each other since their fathers funeral. Now a year later theyre going on a trip with each other across India by train. Their stated goal is that theyre looking for spiritual enlightenment. In reality each is running from something. Francis has had a near-death experience. Peters significant other is pregnant with their first child. And Jack is coping with the collapse of a relationship. But things go awry on The Darjeeling Limited and they find themselves stranded in the desert having to discover another way to travel. At the end of their journey is their mother Patricia (Anjelica Huston) who as it turns out is as adept at running away as they are. Each of these characters has an odd and obvious physical trait. Franciss face is heavily bandaged (as a result of the car accident that nearly killed him). Jack spends the entire film barefoot (and never seems bothered by his lack of shoes). And Peter wears his fathers glasses even though they have a prescription that doesnt match his. Theres also the constant presence of 11 pieces of luggage - a legacy of their father with which they are unwilling to part. The luggage is colorful and decorated with animals and becomes one of the films most obvious visual touchstones. What happens to it at the end is a little too overtly symbolic. There is a prologue for The Darjeeling Limited - a 12-minute short called Hotel Chevalier. While this movie will play in tandem with its longer successor in film festivals it will not accompany the theatrical release. Instead Anderson intends to make it widely available (via the Internet) and recommends that everyone planning to see The Darjeeling Limited watch Hotel Chevalier first. The short provides useful background information about the relationship between Jack and his girlfriend (Natalie Portman whose only appearance in The Darjeeling Limited is a one-second blink-and-youll-miss-it clip) but it isnt mandatory. Its odd that the filmmakers decided not to attach this to prints of The Darjeeling Limited. Combined the movies still run well under two hours. The production covers a lot of ground both literally and figuratively. At its heart this is a tale of emotional healing yet its surprisingly dry for something that addresses such potent material. By the end Francis Peter and Jacks variety of experiences off the beaten path in India have allowed them to stop fleeing. The Darjeeling Limited also provides an interesting non-politicized view of cross-cultural interaction. The scenes in which Peter fails to save a young Indian boy from drowning then presents the body to his family are among those few instances when the film touches a chord of feeling. Visually The Darjeeling Limited is an interesting motion picture. Anderson displays a preference for longer takes than many directors. Its refreshing to experience a movie where cutting doesnt occur once every second or two. The film also makes use of a widely varied color palette. Such technical expertise also extends to the soundtrack - music from several of Satyajit Rays movies are utilized as well as obscure songs whose lyrics are applicable to the scenes in which they are played. Theres something a little odd about watching Owen Wilson in a somber introspective role in light of his real-life travails. Wilson is capable of serious acting - he has done it before - and his performance mostly hits the right notes but theres not a lot of charisma evident. Similar comments can be made about Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman - solid acting but the characters remain clinical and detached. Anjelica Huston injects some energy but she doesnt appear until the movies twilight. Bill Murray has a small role and Natalie Portman appears in a single scene (although her work in Hotel Chevalier is revealing). It would be fair to acknowledge that Andersons films are an acquired taste. I consider him to be a gifted filmmaker but the brilliance others have ascribed to him eludes me. The Darjeeling Limited is never boring - theres always something interesting going on - but I left the theater not caring much about the journey Anderson had taken me on. The characters exist simply to bathe in the films quirkiness; they never attain the three-dimensionality that would have made this more of a memorable undertaking than a passable diversion.

Throw brother from the train - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Throw brother from the train Cartoony Darjeeling gets sidetracked into real life By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 5 2007 For a while the most compelling thing about Wes Andersons latest diorama The Darjeeling Limited is the genius of the central casting. Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman play brothers the Whitmans. And if the genes uniting them seem less than believable you have to admire that someone thought itd be cool to assemble three of %the movies most fascinating noses for a %90-minute romp. (The idea gets funnier when it occurs to you Anjelica Huston is %the mother.)Most of The Darjeeling Limited is set aboard an eponymous Indian train where Peter and Jack (Brody and Schwartzman) discover theyve been lured into a fraternal reunion under false pretenses by Francis (Wilson) their older brother. They havent seen one another since their fathers funeral in New York a year ago and since Francis almost died in a motorcycle accident himself (his face is bruised his head bandaged) hes been feeling sentimental and wants to heal his broken family. The bickering and fisticuffs that follow as the train moseys down x the tracks are recognizable as vaguely human.But really were meant to appreciate the utter loveliness of Andersons designer cartoon -- how for instance Adrien Brody might be part man part TV antenna; or how dreamy the soundtrack music from Satyajit Rays movies is. The brothers carry their fathers set of butterscotch valises which have been painted with little animals -- theyre like a Louis Vuitton kid-safari collection.Courtesy of the unceasingly inspired costume designer Milena Canonero the Darjeelings train steward (Waris Ahluwalia) and his comely number two Rita (Amara Karan) wear an assortment of uniforms in degrees of aqua blue and green which together can seem yellow. Naturally they match the wallpaper in all of the trains imaginatively conceived cars. One sequence of revolving train-car tableaux recreating whats on the minds of the brothers and their mother is like looking through a living View-Master.Once you stop wondering how you might get your hands on a turban like the stewards you have to face the hard fact that Anderson has made a movie that could very much double as a catalog just like his hipster salute The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. The preciousness of this new enterprise like that of the previous one pollutes the human relationships until everything seems like a pose.Anderson wrote The Darjeeling Limited with Schwartzman and his cousin Roman Coppola a director himself and the son of Francis. Allegedly the Whitmans are a tribute to him Peter Bogdanovich and Jack Nicholson all of whom worked under Roger Corman in the 1960s. But the brothers emotional immaturity is a joke thats never funny. When Jack whos been trysting with Rita sees her wet face one night he asks Did you get maced? No she says Im crying. (Anderson shot a complementary short called Hotel Chevalier starring Schwartzman as Jack and Natalie Portman as a girlfriend who stalks him in his Paris hotel room. Its delicious-looking but the sex doesnt seem like a put-on and the sharp breakup talk between them seems truer than the cartoon patter of most of whats said in the feature.) Anderson is 38 and the older he gets the further he retreats from the human resonances of a movie like The Royal Tenenbaums a film about the familial swamps of depression and the necessary fight to be happy. That movie was not without its problems -- Anderson seemed to be too in love with his characters to sacrifice them but I thought he seemed ready to leave the hothouse he built with that film to introduce his world to ours. Instead Anderson recedes into his own Neverland. He goes all the way to India and spends half of the movie playing inside his dollhouse of a train.Just as you begin to consider how a man of Andersons visual sophistication can continue to wade in the psychological and emotional kiddie pool something amazing happens. The diorama tips over and the movie spills into life as it is actually lived -- and concluded. Suddenly we are thrust in between two funerals. One for the Whitmans father might as well be imaginary (we never attend it). The other is for a son and it feels momentously real.The Whitmans detrain (theyre evicted actually) and hole up in a colorful grief-stricken desert village. And Anderson in a kind of empathetic breakthrough drops his Richard Lester-Francois Truffaut impersonation to show anguish and pain. The post-facto news of Owen Wilsons recent personal torments only deepens the pictures sudden soul.The Darjeeling Limited is as much a coloring book as Andersons other movies are. But for several scenes the colors escape. This passage inspires a well of feeling not for the cotton-candy clouds and construction-paper sun that hover above so much of this movie but for the wailing and mournful flesh-and-blood men and women living beneath them. Anderson doesnt bother trying to forge any cultural understanding. At worst hes just testing out an homage to a welcome new forefather in Ray. At one point Rita tells Jack she has got to get off the Darjeeling. Shes speaking out of fatigue. But her wish works as film criticism too.

"Darjeeling a magical mystery trip - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIES | REVIEW Darjeeling a magical mystery tripThe film about three brothers in the wake of their dads death is a pleasurable journey to nowhere but its worth the ride.October 05 2007|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer Its hard to approach a new film by Wes Anderson without feeling like youve walked into an argument. Theres something about his dollhouse aesthetic his storybook formality his miniaturists attention to detail and his dogged belief in the power of objects to elicit the most oblique and recondite emotions that seriously sets people off. Why is a question for another paragraph but needless to say its exactly this staunch commitment to artificiality that makes his work what it is.Like all of Andersons movies ""The Darjeeling Limited"" takes place primarily in a single evocative location. In this case its a train although its not so much an actual train as it is a romantic amalgam of the Orient Express and just about every other fragment of cultural nostalgia Anderson can access. Shot beautifully in India by cinematographer Robert Yeoman ""The Darjeeling Limited"" was also written in country by Anderson Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman who collaborated on the screenplay as they traveled together.But to say its actually set there is a stretch. The India of the movie is more an idea than a reality a whimsical Western projection that combines elements from 1930s picture books films by Jean Renoir and Satyajit Ray the Beatles immersion in Eastern religion in the 60s and centuries of Orientalism. Exotic spiritual and according to Peter Whitman (Adrien Brody) ""spicy""-smelling its a magical mystery place where wayward foreigners can go to get their souls back on track.Or so Francis (Owen Wilson) thinks. After the death of his father the eldest son of the far-flung Whitman clan hustles his estranged younger brothers Peter (Brody) and Jack (Schwartzman) aboard the Darjeeling Limited hoping to embark on a spiritual journey across the Rajasthani desert. Francis has painstakingly mapped out the trip with the help of his assistant Brendan (Wally Wolodarsky) who has come along lugging a printer a laminator and a beleaguered attitude.Francis is determined to accomplish three things on the voyage bring his family closer reunite with their mother (who is living in India having become a nun) and discover the meaning or purpose of his life. Naturally the minute they step aboard the train long-term goals are waylaid by the usual short-term distractions and gratifications. Within what seems like moments theyre drinking smoking popping pills and chugging pain medication. Jack pursues Rita (Amara Karan) the pretty train stewardess and Francis obsesses over his possessions and the fact that Peter has helped himself to their dead fathers sunglasses.Wilson Brody and Schwartzman are like a contemporary depressive version of the Three Stooges and theres something inspired about Andersons decision to cast them as brothers. They are linked not only by their prodigious noses but also by their air of melancholy. And yet what do they have to be sad about? Like many of Andersons characters the Whitmans are privileged but this time the wealth becomes another source of absurdist humor. Francis wears a 6000 belt and 3000 loafers. Jack chooses a five-star Parisian hotel for his cant-get-out-of-bed nervous breakdown. They are by any measure ridiculous and yet you cant help but feel sorry for them theyre so trapped in their little self-absorbed self-mythologizing bubbles. Even when tragedy strikes joining their fates with the fates of three young Indian brothers they remain strangely like spectators experiencing it in a mediated prism that combines Renoirs film with the album cover of ""Abbey Road.""Theres something acquisitive even a little selfish about the Whitmans quest for meaning and transcendence. At their fathers funeral Peters wife assures the squabbling brothers that they are all experiencing an equal amount of grief. On hearing that her sons are in India mother Patricia (Anjelica Huston) sends word that nows not a good time to receive them why dont they come back in the spring? When they pop in at the convent unannounced anyway she defies maternal expectations. Is Patricias devotion to those less fortunate than her sons -- and everyone is less fortunate than her sons -- noble or self-aggrandizing? Thats the thing about spiritual quests it can be hard to tell.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOz trailer New look at Sam Raimis magical mystery tourNovember 14 2012Mena Suvari and the magical mystery dressJune 18 2012Magical Mystery TourFebruary 2 1997A Magical Mystery TourOctober 24 1996Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/05/entertainment/et-darjeeling5,200,thedarjeelinglimited19,thedarjeelinglimited,latimes
"A Road Trip to India On The Darjeeling Limited washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Road Trip to India On The Darjeeling Limited Band of brothers Jason Schwartzman left Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody discover India as they rediscover their fraternal bonds. (By James Hamilton -- Fox Searchlight Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 5 2007 In his 10-year career writer-director Wes Anderson has carved out a niche for himself as American cinemas most lyrically idiosyncratic poet of family dysfunction. Since his debut film ""Bottle Rocket"" up through ""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" hes plumbed the pains and pleasures of domestic life in crowded portraits of filial devotion and betrayal. Those themes are steeped in an intoxicating if somewhat thin brew of wit pathos and visual exuberance in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" a picaresque comedy about three brothers searching for spiritual meaning in India. By now Anderson is an accomplished enough filmmaker to have his own backlash When ""Bottle Rocket"" came out in 1996 he was hailed as a fresh voice but in the decade since some viewers have come to loathe his films for their preciousness studied irony and overweening erudition. But there are those filmgoers who are all too happy to plunge into Andersons esoteric world populated by a motley crew of savants stylistas and self-absorbed eccentrics. This latter group will no doubt enjoy the ride on ""The Darjeeling Limited"" which stars Jason Schwartzman Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson. They play Jack Peter and Francis Whitman respectively who havent seen one another since their fathers funeral a year earlier. Francis who like most of Andersons characters is inexplicably prosperous has organized the trip a journey through India aboard a shabbily elegant train to visit the countrys most sacred shrines and to re-bond with his brothers. Its against this extravagant backdrop of Indias deeply saturated palette and densely woven textures as well as that gorgeous hurtling train that the Whitmans try to find themselves -- and each other -- in a series of alternately wry and wrenching encounters. From lighthearted banter to all-out fisticuffs ""The Darjeeling Limited"" presents a portrait of sibling rivalry and alliance that for all the Whitmans weirdness feels authentic in large part because Schwartzman and Brody are so immediately believable as brothers. But its Wilson who steers ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and not only because his on-screen persona a man who has recently survived a near-death experience so eerily echoes his own off-screen life. He spends most of the movie hidden behind gauze and bandages; during a jarring scene when he quietly admits he needs more time to heal the poignancy is palpable. The controlling Francis who issues laminated itineraries every morning and constantly barks out directives is the chief goad and emotional core of the group whose mission in India changes when Francis belatedly reveals his heretofore hidden agenda. (""It was on the itinerary but I put it under TBD"" he deadpans.) When the trip veers off course the flip detached tone of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" takes a radical turn and the explanation of Franciss behavior becomes touchingly clear. (Anderson co-wrote the script with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola who are cousins.) ""Only connect"" E.M. Forster urged. Theyre trying these Whitman boys and they finally do in the most vagrant random sense of the phrase. ""The Darjeeling Limited"" isnt deep; its fey humor and obvious metaphors will surely provide ample fodder for Andersons detractors (and those on the fence). But its sweet and even if the filmmakers idea of representing emotional baggage with custom Louis Vuitton suitcases is a bit on-the-nose it still looks great as does a production design that is drenched in bold tones of turquoise red and saffron. With their foreheads anointed with crimson bindi dots at one point bedecked in bright metallic turbans the Whitman boys and by extension the audience traipse through crammed markets a sprawling desert a convent set atop a spectacular crag and most important the titular train which along with the Vuitton ensemble becomes a vivid beloved character in itself. Full of the visual and musical detail for which Anderson is known (the chief pop leitmotif is Peter Sarstedts ""Where Do You Go To My Lovely?"") ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a mere bagatelle but one that has its charms including but not limited to its dazzling setting its quiet jokes its carefully calibrated evocation of grief and its three lead actors. Even in the midst of Andersons most self-conscious humor and confected scenarios they evince with unforced ease the rueful bruised beauty of true brotherhood. The Darjeeling Limited (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity.

Damn him. And damn Hitchcock for his obsession with suspense. And whats with Scorsese and violence? My point is an artist can spend a satisfying lifetime developing personal themes and deepening their resonance. Sure they can trip up (see The Life Aquatic). But the Texas-born Anderson 38 has managed to absorb a vast number of influences from J.D. Salinger to Francois Truffaut and forge a style all his own. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The magically compelling Darjeeling Limited strikes me as the fullest blossoming yet of Andersons talents as a total filmmaker. To render the fable of the three estranged Whitman brothers on a spiritual journey to India Anderson -- himself the middle child of three brothers -- paints on a broad canvas. But his storybook brush strokes are unmistakable. Francis (Owen Wilson) the eldest has bullied his brothers into a train trip on the Darjeeling Limited as a bonding adventure. The boys havent spoken since their dad died in a Manhattan car crash a year ago. (Anderson regular Bill Murray hauntingly evokes the paternal spirit in a mute cameo.) Middle brother Peter (Adrien Brody) annoys Francis by claiming he was Dads favorite. Young Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is smarting over his ex-love but hes not above sampling the sweet lime of a hot train attendant (Amara Karan). Its a setup for knockabout farce as these privileged narcotized boys drag their cumbersome Louis Vuitton luggage from stop to stop oblivious to the wonders of the Rajasthan landscape vividly captured by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman. But this is an Anderson film meaning telling details have to be caught on the fly. Catch Peters wince when he reveals hes about to become a father. Or Jacks desperation when he hacks into his exs voicemails. Or Francis head bandages remnants of his attempt to off himself on his motorcycle. Its impossible not to draw parallels to the recent suicide attempt by Wilson who collaborated with college-buddy Anderson on the scripts of his first three movies. Wilson had no hand in the Darjeeling script; its the work of Anderson and their mutual friends Schwartzman and Roman Coppola but you cant miss the undercurrent of melancholy and pain. Im not saying that the Marx brothers turn into the Karamazovs. Andersons touch is too nuanced for that. Powered by evocative cuts from the Kinks the film uncovers layers of emotion as the brothers confront the mother (a dynamite Anjelica Huston) who abandoned them to become a nun in a Himalayan convent. All the acting is exemplary. Brody new to Wes World is revelatory as Peter. An intimate encounter with tragedy in a local village leaves him dumbstruck. And that moment of silent reflection about a world outside his own shifts this whirl of a movie into still waters. Wilson skillfully blends humor and heartbreak. And Schwartzman the iconic Max Fischer in Rushmore cuts to the bone as Jack wonders if the Whitmans would have been friends if they werent brothers. Another key to Jacks character can be found in Hotel Chevalier a thirteen-minute short (inexplicably available only online) that shows Jack and his girlfriend (a harsh never-hotter Natalie Portman) shacked up in Paris. Like Anderson Jack is a die-hard Francophile. He listens repeatedly to a Peter Sarstedt song about a lover who asks ""Tell me the thoughts that surround you/I want to look inside your head."" Anderson struggles hypnotically with the same impossible goal. In a final train shot of surpassing beauty and sadness characters hurtle down the same track but in separate cars still alone inside their heads.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 27 2007 553 PM Twee Time Wes Anderson goes to India in The Darjeeling Limited. By Dana Stevens Jason Schwartzman Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson in The Darjeeling Limited Wes Anderson is an ongoing source of bafflement especially for those of us who still have any patience for his films. Ever since Rushmore weve been waiting for him to realize his tremendous potential as a filmmaker. But if Anderson is J.D. Salinger--the writer whose presence hangs most palpably over his work-- Rushmore may be destined to be his Catcher in the Rye a note-perfect coming-of-age story whose status as an adolescent classic paralyzes its author for the rest of his career. His subsequent films have been more like Salingers Glass family stories. Theyre miniaturist studies of haute-bourgeois anomie that however deftly sketched ultimately shut down on themselves. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Like Andersons recent films the Glass stories have a rueful mood all their own and even the least successful among them are pleasurable objects to contemplate. But they feel like the work of a writer whos more interested in cataloging his private world than opening up to the world outside. In the end Salinger went all the way inside and retreated from his art. I hope Anderson doesnt follow the same path. Advertisement The Darjeeling Limited (Fox Searchlight) struggles to open out from the beautifulstiflingworld inside Andersons head. But like in his last movie The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou Anderson makes the mistake of keeping its protagonists trapped for too long aboard a means of conveyance. The niftily appointed boat has been replaced this time by a niftily appointed train wending its way from Rajasthan to the Himalayas. Occupying one compartment are three American brothers who havent spoken to one another in a year from oldest to youngest Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) Peter Whitman (Adrien Brody) and Jack Whitman (Jason Schwartzman). These brothers have some serious emotional baggage and its by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton. A set of leather trunks embossed with safari animals that once belonged to their now-dead father follows them everywhere lugged by porters or piled atop rickshaws as the boys bicker in Hindu temples smuggle a poisonous snake aboard and eventually get thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere. What happens next is to Andersons credit a truly shocking twist that takes both the Whitmans and the audience to a far more serious place. But whats not to his credit is what Anderson does once he gets there He uses the suffering of an Indian village (and a wonderful nearly wordless performance from Indian actor Irrfan Khan) as a backdrop for the brothers self-discovery. Jonah Weiner explores the directors queasy treatment of race at length (and with spoilers) on Slateso Ill keep it simple This part of the movie is Anderson at his worst self-serious aestheticizing and morally yucky. Things turn around again in the last third as the boys track down their mother (Anjelica Huston) in a Himalayan nunnery to ask why she didnt attend their fathers funeral. But the film wants to make emotional omelets without breaking aesthetic eggs. We cant really learn about the Whitmans motivations--the mothers ambivalence toward her family Peters irrational desire to desert his pregnant wife--while continuing to smile at their non sequiturs and to admire their neat pajamas. Huston and Adrien Brody are good enough actors to hint at the conflict beneath these cool surfaces but Schwartzman is perfectly attuned to the movies tone--and thus impenetrable. Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson unflappably cheery and casually nuts. He spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in gauze bandages an eerie foreshadowing of his recent real-life troubles. Hotel Chevalier a 13-minute short that may be shown before The Darjeeling Limited in theaters beginning next week (the studio is being coy but the short is available on iTunes) takes place two weeks before the events of the main movie and supplies a key element in Jacks backstory It seems that sometime between his fathers death and the brothers trip to India the youngest Whitman holed up in a Paris hotel room where he was visited by his manipulative ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) for a night of ill-advised relapse sex. Hotel Chevalier is a slight appealing amuse-bouche of a movie but both it and Darjeeling are haunted by Andersons oppressive good taste. The costumes by Milena Canonero (Marie Antoinette) are so exquisitely imagined as to provoke covetousness on the viewers part (I want a bright-orange gold-edged Rajasthani shawl). Brand names are everywhere some of them made up (the perfume Portman wears is called ""Voltaire 6"") others fetishistically nostalgic (in a recurring song the speaker compliments his lover ""All your clothes are by Balmain""). The suave soundtrack of Ravi Shankar ragas Kinks songs and vintage French pop makes you think not about the Whitmans spiritual journey but about the availability of the soundtrack album. Together these well-curated accoutrements conjure the feeling of visiting a friends impeccable apartment and wondering where to set down your glass. The surfaces shimmer but they dont invite you in. Maybe Anderson needs to shoot someone elses screenplay to get outside his own head for a while and into anothers sensibility. Its telling that his funniest and liveliest recent work was a commercial for American Express. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Wes Andersons latest melan-comedy The Darjeeling Limited three brothers on a ""spiritual journey"" across India have their strict hour-by-hour itinerary printed out for them each day on laminated paper. Is there a better metaphor for how Andersons movies work? It wouldnt be surprising to discover that a laminated itinerary--planned to the tiniest detail protected by hermetic seal--was used for a production call sheet too since it speaks to his impeccable artistry and his stubborn resistance to change. Hes a creative soul with obsessive-compulsive disorder and his limits become clearer slowly but surely with each film. Anderson relies on compact emotions communicated in very small moments that tend to resonate with repeat viewers so its possible that The Darjeeling Limited only seems minor now and may flower later. And yet its strong similarities to Andersons The Royal Tenenbaums which dealt so movingly with family bonds and fissures suggest that Darjeeling may be doomed to wilt in its shadow. Reunited for the first time since their fathers funeral a year earlier estranged brothers Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman board the titular train in the hopes of healing long-festering wounds. Each has a reason for melancholy Wilson hasnt recovered from a motorcycle accident thats left his head bandaged like a mummy Brody seems anxious to escape his imminent fatherhood and Schwartzman hasnt gotten over his relationship with an ex-girlfriend. (Schwartzmans problems are detailed in the fine 13-minute short ""Hotel Chevalier"" co-starring Natalie Portman which is available online and will be on the DVD.) The brothers also resent their mother (Anjelica Huston) who failed to show up for their fathers funeral. When their original plan goes awry they resolve instead to seek her out. The usual pleasures of Andersons work--the precise framing eclectic soundtrack and tiny marvels of production design; the offbeat humor; the well-proportioned efficiently told story--are all present in The Darjeeling Limited which creates a gorgeous palette out of local color. The second act includes a detour to an Indian village thats as vibrant and full of feeling as anything Andersons done. Yet the sum of the brothers wayward adventure adds up to curiously little in the end and save for Wilsons moving turn (made all the more heartbreaking by his real-life troubles) the men are fuzzily defined and the film feels incomplete. The devil may be in the details but for the first time Andersons obsession with them has caused him to lose sight of the bigger picture.

Thursday September 27 2007 400 AM The Darjeeling Limited Comedy about three brothers bonding during a trip through India. With Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman Adrien Brody. Director Wes Anderson (131). R Language. Friday night at Alice Tully Hall opens Saturday at AMC Lincoln Square Regal Union Square. Wes Andersons ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is an odd choice to open this years New York Film Festival Usually it starts with a good movie. In fact this very selective festival usually features only good movies. But its organizer the Film Society of Lincoln Center also has a history of supporting filmmakers whom it helps discover and Anderson became one of its faves with the genuine festival gems ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" ""The Darjeeling Limited"" a slapstick comedy about three brothers traveling through India (or is it Ishtar?) is marginally better than Andersons last film ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" but that hardly makes it opening-night fodder. In light of star Owen Wilsons apparent suicide attempt and the bandages covering facial injuries on his character that may have been self-inflicted it might have been prudent for the films distributor to withdraw it from the festival and delay its release. (It opens in theaters Saturday.) But here it is - distraction and all - with Wilson playing Francis who has called his younger brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) to India for a cross-country train ride a year after their fathers death and mothers disappearance. They get booted off the train for bad behavior and continue east by other means to meet with their mother (a wasted Anjelica Huston) who is now a sister in a Himalayan convent. Wilson Brody and Schwartzman have their charms but the script gives them little to work with. Anderson and his co-writers have come up with an ordinary road movie that is dependent on lame running jokes about Indian cough syrup pepper spray a store-bought cobra and the recurring visual non sequitur of Francis 11-piece Louis Vuitton luggage. An attempt at gravity is made mid-way when the brothers try to rescue some Indian children whove fallen into moving water. But in the context of this flat-lined comedy its more of a speed bump than a plot development. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its companion short ""Hotel Chevalier"" is darn near perfect. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Wes Andersons ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a focused attempt to make a heartfelt director-to-audience connection In an effort to regroup after their fathers death three brothers -- played by Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman -- board a train traveling through India. They swap drugs ogle the pretty and in the movies eyes ""exotic"" train attendant and squabble. In Wes Andersonville this is filial love and although ""The Darjeeling Limited"" mostly suffers from the same jejune quaintness that Andersons other movies do at least it shows flashes of raw feeling. The picture is just naked enough that you want to wrap a blanket around it. But not that naked. Andersons movies -- the static stilted ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" the eccentric-family quirkfest ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" -- have always left me cold. I remain unmoved even by the aggressively fey charms of ""Rushmore."" ""The Darjeeling Limited"" -- which opens the New York Film Festival this evening and opens elsewhere beginning tomorrow -- is the first of Andersons movies that has elicited even the mildest scrap of affection from me I feel warmly toward it although I reserve the right to remain wary of its aging-hipster gimcrackery. Its as if Anderson yesterdays next big thing heard the homemade coffee-can drumbeat of new young DIY filmmakers like Andrew Bujalski and Joe Swanberg and realized that what the kids are into these days is shambling sincere naturalism; his stock in trade whimsical deadpan irony all meticulously orchestrated from the master control center of his brain is starting to seem as outmoded as an old Mantovani record. Better inject some juice and attempt at least an approximation of spontaneity fast. Maybe all artists do their best work when theyre scared into it. ""The Life Aquatic"" met with a less-than-rapturous response even from many loyal Anderson admirers. And so to his credit Anderson tries to push into new territory with ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Francis (Owen Wilson) has arranged a cross-country Indian train trip for himself and his two younger brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) -- although ""arranged"" might be too casual a word. Hes planned the trip so carefully that hes even brought along a coordinator (played by Wally Wolodarsky) outfitted with a printer and a laminating machine His job includes making plastic-coated cards for each days itinerary including visits to shrines and stops at local markets to purchase sundries like decorated leather slippers and pepper spray. It turns out that Francis has suffered a terrible and unusual accident His face is a map of bruises and bandages; a strip of gauze frames the oval of his face Marleys Ghost-style. Peter and Jack feel sympathy and concern for him but its clear that his need to control and question their every movement drives them crazy. They rail at him; they roll their eyes at him; but eventually a tragedy in the Indian countryside ends up bringing them all closer and also leads to a reconciliation with their estranged mom (Anjelica Huston). As the brothers gradually thaw their way out of the grief thats frozen them and distanced them from one another theyre both endearing and wearying in an upper-crusty Three Stooges kind of way They clobber and pick at one another until they reach enlightenment. Schwartzman formerly just an annoying actor is finding ways to go deeper into characters that seem somewhat blank on the surface and his timing just keeps getting better He turns the intentionally awkward rhythms of the movies dialogue into comically graceful hippo-in-a-tutu pirouettes. Wilson the controlling sad sack in this meandering little fable -- with his neuroses and his need for absolute minute-by-minute orchestration might his character be a stand-in for Anderson himself? -- turns an aggressively alienating character into one we can feel some kinship with. Or maybe its just that his lazy drawl seduces us into liking him. Or it may be that its simply impossible not to feel protective toward Owen Wilson right now particularly since his character here shows the wounds and scars of what we can assume was a suicide attempt. Brody all Bambi eyelashes gets a scene midway through the movie -- actually its mostly a single line -- that stops the whole enterprise cold and sends it in a wholly different direction. Brody a reliably terrific actor carries the moment with both gravity and ease. Anderson also knows how to use Brodys matchstick frame to great effect Early in the movie he shows Peter running for the train in slow motion his windmilling arms and legs suggesting the manic energy of a cartoon spider in a rush. You Might Also Like ""The Darjeeling Limited"" -- filmed on location in India -- is gorgeous to look at. Cinematographer Robert Yeoman doesnt just turn the lens on the countryside; somehow he creates the illusion that the lens is actually drinking the landscape in. And the train itself a quaint-looking old-fashioned luxury affair decked out in vivid cobalt blues and warm sandy golds is a pleasing little visual fillip in itself. But in the end ""The Darjeeling Limited"" only leaves you wondering what it all adds up to. The script is by Anderson Schwartzman and Roman Coppola and it does a better job than any other Anderson movie at wrangling with ideas about how the very things that drive us crazy about our families are also the things that bind us to them. When the movie slows down and quiets down it drifts momentarily into a landscape of real feeling. (As usual Anderson does show a knack for using the right song in the right place -- in this case its the Rolling Stones ""Play With Fire"" used as a backdrop for the movies most resonant moment of reckoning.) But before long Anderson is up to his old tricks again His movies are more like Erector Set constructions than fluid narratives and because its easier to fill spaces with jokes and gags than with actual feeling thats what he does. Even when hes stretching toward warmth as he is here Anderson is still a maddeningly cool filmmaker. Hes remote from his characters which makes him remote from his movies. Theres also a way in which he uses race as a novelty suggesting an assertively white-kid view of the world. Jack flirts with that very pretty train attendant Rita (played by Amara Karan) and eventually acts on his amorous impulses. But Rita isnt really a character here; shes treated as a pretty face who also happens to be a part of the local scenery. Shes an outsider in the brothers world -- but that doesnt mean she has to be an outsider in the movie. The brothers deepest connection appears to be a set of very expensive and quite wonderful matched luggage passed down from their late father a passel of leather train cases and satchels each embossed with a design of monkeys palm trees and gazelles. (These beautiful lust-worthy props were created by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton -- one of the advantages of being a filmmaker with friends in high places.) But now that Ive alluded to the idea of baggage do we need a spoiler alert? Because you can bet Anderson isnt letting that luggage go to waste metaphorically speaking. ""The Darjeeling Limited"" has more heart than any other full-length Anderson movie. But Im afraid it pales in comparison with the short ""Hotel Chevalier"" that Anderson has made to be shown along with it. ""Hotel Chevalier"" is a sort of preface to ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Schwartzman as Jack is living in a hotel in Paris (out of a few of those fabulous suitcases) spending whatever money hes got (we can assume its considerable) ordering up grilled-cheese sandwiches from room service. (He gamely asks the person who takes his order for the French word for ""cheese."") A mysterious visitor comes to call a pixie-vixen in the form of Natalie Portman. She and Jack clearly have a history together -- we dont know exactly what it is. Theres awkwardness between them but they do find their way into bed. Somehow the untold story of ""Hotel Chevalier"" is 10 times more interesting and infinitely richer than the one told outright in ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Short films are exceedingly difficult to pull off but Anderson has made one thats very close to perfect. (It rivals even the craftsmanship and inventiveness of his terrific American Express commercial which is a mini-masterpiece.) Maybe thats because as a director Anderson tends to be a maker of models a builder of small things. The intimate scale of ""Hotel Chevalier"" suits him just fine and perhaps the fact that the movie takes place in a luxe hotel room -- the most temporary but also the most comfortable of homes -- frees him as well. Maybe Anderson will always be a tourist in his own movies. But in ""Hotel Chevalier"" among the shortest of all his films he unpacks his bags and stays a while. In this small movie he finally finds a home away from home. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor September 28 2007 Save for later Saved Wes Anderson doesnt make movies like anybody else which is sometimes a good thing and sometimes not. His latest ""The Darjeeling Limited"" combines whats best and worst about him.Its about three American brothers - Francis (Owen Wilson) Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) - who have not had occasion to speak in the year following their fathers funeral. Hoping to bond they board a train in India and embark on what they hope will be a spiritual journey.Cramped in the tight train compartment the brothers cannot suppress their rivalries and resentments. Francis the trios ringleader has arrived with his head bandaged because of a near-fatal motorcycle accident; Peter is about to become a father; Jack is rebounding from a bad relationship. (In the films prologue which will only be shown at the New York Film Festival and on the DVD version we observe him and his ex - played by Natalie Portman - reconnoiter in a Paris hotel room). [Editors note The original version of this paragraph failed to note that this prologue was not included in the films general theatrical release.] Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Anderson who co-wrote the film with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola has a funny idea here He wants to show us the folly of forcing a transcendent experience. The brothers are like superannuated hippies straining to sink into the mysteries of India. They barge into religious temples hoping to catch a whiff of exaltation; Peter buys a pet cobra; Jack the least ga-ga of the group finds momentary transcendence in a sexual escapade with a pretty Indian woman on the train. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Each brother in his own way is clueless and for a while their bumbling has a goofy postmodernist Three Stooges appeal. Andersons off-kilter camerawork - his high angles and extreme close-ups anatomize the action almost to the point of abstraction - is matched by the dialogue which is comically spare.And yet ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a spiritual journey undertaken by three men who are essentially though unintentionally cartoons. The ravishing Indian landscapes as well as the score which at times utilizes music once composed by the great Satyajit Ray for his movies prime us for an emotional experience that never happens. The journey which includes a wonderful cameo in the foothills of the Himalayas with Anjelica Huston as the boys mother is a series of dead ends that are meant to be destinations. But too often they just seem like dead ends.Anderson shows us the deep spirituality of India but the joke here is that the brothers surrounded by all this harrowing allure cant rise above their pettiness. Anderson cant quite rise above his own quirkiness. Its not that he cant respond to the beauty he places before us - he can - but his jokiness keeps undercutting his own best efforts. ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a transitional film for him Hes outgrown a comic style that can no longer accommodate his deeper feelings. Grade B Rated R for language.

His head outlandishly bandaged in contradiction with the insouciance of his surfer-blond hair Wilsons character is the one sibling among the three who has actively tried to hurt himself in response to family unhappiness Father is dead and a drifty self-absorbed mother (Anjelica Huston) ignores her sons while searching for her own bliss in a Himalayan nunnery. Now he is trying to reestablish kinship and hes up against resistance. Estranged from one another each son is a quirky piece of work in his own right; together on a train theyre a rolling family-therapy experiment. This is familiar psychological as well as stylistic territory for Anderson after Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. But theres a startling new maturity in Darjeeling a compassion for the larger world that busts the confines of the filmmakers miniaturist instincts. (A jolting unironic plot turn may even shock.) I dont know which came first -- inspiration provided by the beauty and complexity of India or an attraction to India because of a wiser heart. But either way foreign travel is a growth opportunity for these passengers. B+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

You know a film is in trouble if the most interesting thing in it is the luggage. Adrien Brody Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson are three brothers who take a train through India in search of an adventure that doesnt occur. If director Wes Anderson had actually sent these actors on a ramble through the subcontinent the result could not have failed to be more interesting than the script he wrote with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola. The story offers nothing except aimless quirk. Wilsons character Francis obnoxiously orders for everyone at mealtimes. Peter (Brody) talks about his pregnant wife while Jack (Schwartzman) frets over an ex who may or may not be the character played by Natalie Portman in a short introductory film that is only on the Web. Francis who is recovering from a near-fatal accident tries to create bonding experiences because the brothers havent spoken for a year. But as he urges them to seek revelations the movie becomes as shapeless as the Beatles movie ""Magical Mystery Tour."" The guys soak up the colorful India-ness while Jack flirts with a stewardess. Eventually they get kicked off the train for letting their lethal pet snake escape. More local color. Lots of drab attempts at arch whimsy and hip sweetness. Francis keeps asking about power adapters and gets one of his 3000 loafers stolen. Jack writes short stories while insisting his characters are fictional. Peter worries that hes heading for divorce because of ""the way we were raised."" The journey will reunite them with their mother (Anjelica Huston) who has entered a convent that is being menaced by a tiger. ""It ate one of the sisters brothers"" goes the laugh line. About the closest anyone comes to an insight is ""I love the way this country smells. Ill never forget it. Its kinda spicy."" Such gentle vapidity gently mocked is an Anderson staple. His films have always been mannered but the first three -""Bottle Rocket"" ""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" - whistled with vitality. Both ""The Life Aquatic"" and the new one are fussy. ""Darjeeling"" is a twee dollhouse in which the dolls get really swell luggage and we peek over Andersons shoulder as he shifts his playthings this way and that. Those suitcases might be the most prominently credited ones in film history (""Francois Voltaire suitcases by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton suitcase wildlife drawings by Eric Anderson"") and they say a lot about Anderson. Decorated with coloring-book-style renderings of fierce animals and fashioned of luscious leather theyre the toys of a precocious rich kid. At a stage in Andersons career when he should be moving on he is instead circling back. Andersons dramatic suitcase is all but empty It contains only a tired idea (boys wounded by their fathers absence a theme of all Andersons films) a taste (this time for the films of Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoirs glorious ""The River"") and a pose - that of the extravagantly bored preppy who fears above all being caught believing in anything much. kyle.smithnypost.com THE DARJEELING LIMIITEDNever leaves the station.Rated R (profanity).

Three estranged brothers bond and get rid of some literal and figurative baggage during a trip across India in Wes Andersons colorful and kinetic seriocomedy ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Breaking no new ground thematically pic comes closer to ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" than ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" but without achieving the poignance of ""Rushmore."" Inventively staged pic should satisfy the upscale youth and cult auds Anderson has developed though its unlikely to draw significantly better than his earlier work. Following its Venice and New York fest bows Fox Searchlight item will go into limited U.S. release on Sept. 29. Indias vibrant landscapes and varied modes of travel in particular the confined space of the locomotive prove extremely congenial to Andersons brand of visual humor and widescreen setups. Framing choreography and physical comedy reference classic train flicks ranging from ""Twentieth Century"" and ""A Night at the Opera"" to ""A Hard Days Night."" After a short prologue that neatly epitomizes Indias color and chaos -- and offers a cameo for Anderson regular Bill Murray -- pic settles into a first-class sleeping cabin aboard the Darjeeling Limited where the Whitman brothers have gathered. Francis ( frequent Anderson collaborator Owen Wilson) Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (co-scripter Jason Schwartzman) havent spoken since their fathers funeral one year earlier. Clearly the siblings all have some healing to do. Francis the eldest is swathed in mummy-like bandages resulting from a motorcycle accident (an image that could have unintended resonance for auds who have followed Wilsons recent personal crises). Middle child Peter cant come to terms with his wifes pregnancy. And Jack the youngest is so obsessed with his ex-girlfriend he continually eavesdrops on her answering machine. Armed with a supply of Indian pain relievers the brothers play catch-up and fall into familiar family patterns. Francis tries to impose his itineraries and menu decisions Peter flaunts their fathers possessions and implies he was the favorite child and Jack tries to avoid their quarreling through a whirlwind affair with comely train stewardess Rita (Amara Karan). After theyre ejected from the train for egregious rule-breaking Francis reveals an ulterior motive behind the trip He wants them to visit their mother (Anjelica Huston) whos now a nun in a Himalayan convent but she seems less than keen to see them. The convent scenes humorously establish the source of Francis most irritating mannerisms and pave the way for spiritual healing. Here as in his two prior outings Andersons arch highly artificial style gets in the way of character and emotional development rendering pic piquant rather than profound. Despite intense perfs by Wilson and Brody Francis and Peter come off as not particularly nice. Schwartzman and Huston fare best at humanizing their characters while newcomer Karan makes a strong impression as the sexy ""sweet lime"" girl. Script gets sibling dynamics down pat with oft-repeated lines accumulating meaning throughout pic. Tech credits are top-notch with particular kudos to Mark Friedbergs gorgeous intricate production design and Robert Yeomans nimble lensing. A specially designed numbered luggage set from Louis Vuitton plays a significant role. Music track effectively sets the mood with selections from Indian film scores alternating with choice rock tunes. In Venice pic screened with a nifty 13-minute short ""Hotel Chevalier"" identified in the end credits as ""Part 1 of The Darjeeling Limited. "" Completed in 2005 pic shows Jack and his ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) in the titular Parisian hotel. Short provides a potent prologue that further serves to make Jack the most sympathetic of the brothers and adds resonance to visual motifs that recur in the feature. Per Anderson ""Hotel Chevalier"" will not be shown in theaters but rather on the Internet at festivals and on DVD.
