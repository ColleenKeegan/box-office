Entertainment Everything That Made Daniel Craigs Bond Great Is Now Bringing Him Down Spectre shows the limits of the iconic spys gritty reinvention. Time for another reboot? Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Daniel Craig as James Bond in Spectre. Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ID 7282436 Daniel Craigs James Bond is my favorite James Bond because hes the first one to really strive to seem dead inside.Its something he pulls off while still doing everything a Bond should -- wearing the hell out of a suit and ordering his incorrectly made favorite cocktail and taking down bad guys and boinking his way around the globe. He still gets scolded by M (embodied first by Judi Dench and now by Ralph Fiennes) destroys millions of pounds worth of high-tech spy equipment from Q (Ben Whishaw) and is too important to the countrys security to ever face any permanent consequences for it.Hes still this hypermasculine fantasy of cool under pressure but its not a mantle Craig wears lightly -- his Bond visibly works at remaining unruffled. Theres a scene in Spectre in which he rights a careening helicopter just before it crashes into a plaza full of people and while hes impassive as he does it hes also glassy-eyed and covered in sweat. Its not the face of someone skimming unflappably through the international spy biz -- its the face of someone trying not to throw up. Behind the pale eyes and the battered face and the 21st-century muscle mass Craigs created the impression of a human being whos slowly being hollowed out. View this image > Craig in Spectre. Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ID 7284959 The genius of the Craig reboot of the character of which Spectre is the crushingly weakest entry is that it managed to pull Ian Flemings iconic but painfully dated agent into the present without significantly altering his character in any way. These films have just tilted the way Bond is framed a bit to suggest that someone who kills for his country (and for a living) and has no significant personal relationships or home life is either a sociopath or trying really hard to will himself into becoming one.Because until recent installments everything that has traditionally made Bond movies fun has also made them when looked on from farther away the big-screen action equivalents of an old-fashioned sitcom in which everything resets to status quo at the end of the episode. For a man whos meant to be the epitome of cool Bond sometimes also seems like a character trapped in a particularly glamorous ironic hellscape. He faces an endless supply of villains with baroque plans for world domination and ends stories in the triumphant embrace of love interests who arent mentioned again. He never gets old just reskinned. He got married once but he doesnt like to talk about it.Except that Craigs Bond was reset to freshly minted double-0 status and given both a soul to be chipped away at and more pointedly a history that kept accruing. He has actually been aware of the business of being Bond from those qualifying kills (""Made you feel it did he?"") and the proto-Bond girl heartbreak of Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to the weird soulfulness of Skyfall which excavated Bonds sad background. The showdown at his childhood home was a Bond finale turned personal M as a replacement mother figure and Silva (Javier Bardem) as the agents dark twin. It was this pop perfect convergence of Bond the concept and Bond the flesh-and-blood character Craig carved out. Monica Bellucci as Lucia. Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Ben Whishaw as Q Craig as Bond. Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ID 7284984 But everything that made Skyfall work so swimmingly well goes wrong in Spectre which shares the same director Sam Mendes and enough of the same ideas to feel like the franchise has already run itself aground again. Spectre sets Bond off on another unsanctioned revenge mission to Mexico City -- the movies first and best sequence is an elaborately filmed bit in which the character attempts to assassinate someone during the Day of the Dead celebration on the orders of the late M. And it pits him against another shadowy sibling played this time by Christoph Waltz an actor who was basically born to be a hammy Bond villain.He plays a doozy of one in Spectre heading up a secret organization in charge of a lot of societys ills. Hes saddled with motivations and an identity meant to place him in the tradition of the older Bond and to fit him into this newer more grounded one. But that reveal when it comes is meaningless -- a curiously petty backstory created for a character who never begged for one. Its as arbitrary as the characters insistence that hes been in charge the whole time and is the one behind everything bad thats happened to Bond. Spectre retroactively places everything from the previous three films into a larger conspiracy thats so maddeningly capricious that it even seems to give the spy pause. View this image > Christoph Waltz as Franz Oberhauser Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann. Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ID 7285033 The trouble with having a Bond who remembers is that even four installments into this new chronology Bonds life is already profoundly nuts and not up for the weight of any sustained psychology. When half the women Craigs Bond has slept with have gotten killed in front of him for instance its hard to invest as Spectre asks us to in his new relationship with Blue Is the Warmest Colors Lea Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann much less believe it would trigger the shift he makes on her behalf at the end. When the worlds baddest bad guy confesses to having set up multiple murders and adversaries and global feats of crime all to hurt Bonds feelings due to daddy issues its laughable.Spectre is sloppier than other recent Bonds but it also feels like its exhausted the idea that fueled the franchises relaunch -- darker and more realistic can only last so long when its paired with a rotating cast of Bond girls and supervillains. Its also exhausted Craig who told Time Out London hed ""rather break this glass and slash [his] wrists"" than do another Bond film though hes still got one more on his contract and the lucrative franchise is in no danger of stopping. His indifference shines through in the final act of Spectre which ends with an explosion and a whimper. The movie cant find a glimmer of logic in its final sparing of a life other than that it leaves room for an actor to return. Dead inside at last and not in a good way.

By Anthony Lane Monica Bellucci and Daniel Craig in the new Bond film directed by Sam Mendes.   Credit Illustration by Senor Salme When did you last hand over your white dinner jacket to be pressed? To be precise when did you last hand it over on a train to an obliging steward? That is not as far as I am aware a service that is regularly available on the 553 from Grand Central to Poughkeepsie. If you are James Bond (Daniel Craig) however such niceties come with the territory. His latest adventure ""Spectre"" finds him travelling on a Moroccan railroad from Tangier to the dusty middle of nowhere in the company of Dr. Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) his new best friend. They meet for dinner in the restaurant car where she rolls up sheathed in silver satin and orders a vodka Martini specifying that she wants it dirty. They never get to eat being rudely interrupted by the mountainous Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista) who tosses Bond around like a sack of potatoes. Once the battle is over Dr. Swann inquires ""What do we do now?"" To which the obvious answer is have sex. Such is the average day of 007. This is the fourth occasion on which Craig has strapped himself into the role transforming it into a strange amalgam of the savage and the fantastical a thug let loose in a daydream. Casting Craig in ""Casino Royale"" was a de-facto proclamation that the officer class need no longer apply for the job. Craig resembles a staff sergeant whos left the army nicked and scarred and found himself frustrated as veterans often are by the soft edges and the moral dithering of civilian life. Bond has always boozed but never has the drink seemed less of a pleasure and more of an urgent fix. As for that tux Craig looks deeply uncomfortable in it like someone who has been dragged to a wedding against his will and the most noticeable feature of the Tom Ford suits in ""Spectre"" is the compulsive extent to which Bond keeps them buttoned up. Thats cool enough at the start as he strolls along a lofty ledge in Mexico City toting an assassins rifle but by the time he attends a funeral in Rome boxed into a short dark and double-breasted coat you wonder what hes hiding apart from a gun and an armored heart and why the thought of hanging loose should fill him with such alarm. Bond films even at their most nonsensical tend to graze against political realities. Back in 1974 in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" Bond remarked to M that ""the energy crisis is still with us"" which suggested that he had at least glanced at a newspaper during the previous year. Likewise a thin gloss of topicality has been added to the story line of ""Spectre."" M (Ralph Fiennes) is under siege from a new superior C (Andrew Scott) who plans to merge MI5 and MI6 and to make common cause with eight other nations in a global intelligence network. (Scott is known to millions of TV viewers having played Moriarty in ""Sherlock""--too much baggage I think. Also he has a mean stare; we need someone more affable to keep us guessing.) Worse still 00-agents are to be scrapped in favor of digital surveillance. From now on one presumes Bond must perch in a cubicle and browse glumly through the Snapchats of major villains rather than do the decent thing and shoot them in the head. The reason for 007s presence in Mexico is a tipoff from Ms late predecessor--death being no excuse in spy stories for ceasing to contribute to the plot. Bond leaves the city in (a) a state of structural chaos (b) a helicopter having wisely discarded the pilot in midair and (c) possession of a super-special ring. As any Baggins could tell him the ring will lead him on a lengthy quest although his destination will be not Mordor but Spectre. This excellent organization whose name stands for Special Executive for Counter-intelligence Terrorism Revenge and Extortion is pretty much like the U.N. but with fewer vaccination programs. It was devised by Ian Fleming and made its first screen appearance in ""Dr. No"" in 1962. For decades however Spectre has been on sabbatical. Now it is back its tentacular reach indicated by the opening credits in which an octopus tries to molest a loaded firearm. For scholars of Bond all this may be too much to take in. None is more fanatical than Sam Mendes who directed ""Skyfall"" (2012) and now ""Spectre"" and who loves to rummage in the lore of 007 and to summon up remembrance of things past. The things include an Aston Martin with an ejector seat as in ""Goldfinger""; a boat emerging from MI6 headquarters onto the Thames as in ""The World Is Not Enough""; and a lunatics lair inside a crater as in ""You Only Live Twice."" Then there is Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) who squats at the heart of Spectre cocooned in shadow. ""Welcome James"" he says to our hero adding in a wounded tone ""What took you so long?"" In broad daylight he sports a collarless jacket the school uniform of megalomania in the Bondian wardrobe. All roads lead to Oberhauser. He is the baddies baddie and we spot images of his forerunners from the previous three films on a Moroccan wall. But you cant help asking Who will trump him in future installments? Must he swear allegiance in turn? Might we finally arrive at the hearts heart to find a flustered little crank behind a curtain meekly admitting that hes not a bad man at all just a very bad wizard? There is in short something hollowed out in ""Spectre""--a hint of something not quite there as wraithlike as the title suggests. The movie is long verging on two and a half hours yet determined not to drag. We find ourselves atop an Austrian peak in a clinic whose outer walls shine like mirrors where Bond is quizzed by Dr. Swann (""Do you consider your employment to be psychologically stressful?"") and from which he departs in haste using a twin-prop plane as a sled. Next stop is Tangier with no mention of the intervening trip. So remorselessly does 007 hare between countries and climates that half the audience will find the film too episodic for its own good--one damned thrill after another like loosely strung pearls. I regard it as a ravishing exercise in near-despair with Bond beset by the suspicion that were he to desist both his character and his cause would be unmasked as a void. Killing is his living and his proof of life. Looming over ""Spectre"" is ""Skyfall"" which felt as if it could and maybe should have marked the end of Bond. Half a century had passed since the franchise began; Judi Denchs M made her exit; and the action teemed with tropes of noble decline--quotations from Tennyson the British bulldog reduced to a china toy and a sad shot of 007 and Q gazing at Turners ""The Fighting Temeraire"" in which an old ship is towed away at sunset. When Dean Acheson declared on December 5 1962 that ""Great Britain has lost an Empire and not yet found a role"" he was in fact wrong by two months. ""Dr. No"" had come out on October 5th thus initiating a role--one immortal man to be enshrined by many actors--that would set off a series of idle jaunts rife with post-imperial delusion. ""Skyfall"" bid them goodbye and as a bonus encouraged 007 to mollify the trauma of his own origins. ""I always hated this place"" he said before blowing up his childhood home. How do you follow that? Not by hiring Sam Smith to sing your theme song thats for sure. His keening caterwaul sounds as if he had flicked the ejector switch but forgotten to undo his seat belt. On the other hand ""Spectre"" is a banquet for the eyes. Mendes is the first director to have posed a basic question Is there any reason that Bond films should not be beautiful? By custom they have been stacked with beautiful people and tricked out with beautiful objects but the outcome was often unlovely to behold with a gaucheness that ran far deeper than Roger Moores safari suit. Hence the crystalline shock of ""Skyfall"" and now less sharply etched the elegant haze of ""Spectre"" photographed by Hoyte Van Hoytema who conjures a smoky brownness in the Mexican air and elsewhere. It is as though 007 had just laid down a fine cigar to settle his nerves before the mayhem began. I can see no point in going to a Bond film unless there is a corner of your soul that is still eleven years old. Anyone who has tamped down that youthful yen for excitement should stay away. But the craving for grownup glamour however foolish demands equal satisfaction and ""Spectre"" in providing it acquires a throb of mystery that cannot be explained by mere plot. Hence the thrum of a Roman car chase along the brink of the Tiber and up into St. Peters Square; and preceding it the sight of a sumptuous and griefless widow (Monica Bellucci) framed by white marble columns and veiled in black. Bond comes to her by night with perils prowling her villa like cats and you long to know--a rarity in the rapacious history of 007--who is seducing whom. She says that if he doesnt leave now they will perish together. ""I can think of worse ways to go"" he replies. Me too. I nearly died.

The first is literal As the words fade the scene opens in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead.The streets throng with crowds of dapper skeletons and chthonian floats. The camera finds its way to one elegant couple--the mans skull mask only accentuates his air of intensity--and it follows them down the avenue. And into their hotel. And into the elevator. And into their room. And then following a not-entirely-unexpected reveal it follows the man out the window and onto the rooftops. Related Story Sam Smiths Radically Wimpy James Bond Theme Long tracking shots may be a tad oversold in the wake of Birdman and season one of True Detective but this one is a dazzler. Indeed the entire pre-title sequence of Spectre--which also includes fisticuffs in a wildly spiraling helicopter over a crowded square--is magnificent perhaps the best in the entire 24-film history of the franchise. At its conclusion I turned to the friend seated next to me and whispered ""I could leave the theater happy right now.""From there the movie leaps from London to Rome to the Austrian Alps to Tangier and the Sahara the plot trundling on along two parallel tracks which inevitably will bend to intersect. Abroad a rogue James Bond (Daniel Craig) is trying to track down information about a diabolic global crime syndicate Spectre and its mysterious leader (Christoph Waltz). Back home M (Ralph Fiennes) Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) must contend with a smarmy young bureaucrat whos overseeing the launch of a panoptically comprehensive new global surveillance system. About all you need to know about this character is that he is played by the actor Andrew Scott. I mean fine launch your dangerous new technology that will make all human privacy a thing of the past. But for Gods sake dont put Moriarty in charge of it. (And yes this is exactly the same plot as Captain America The Winter Soldier right down to many of the particulars including a snazzy Triskelion-ish intelligence HQ on the bank of the Thames.)Sam Mendes who directed the previous installment of the franchise Skyfall returns for an encore and once again gives the proceedings an upscale gloss. But while there are plenty of pleasures to be found scattered across Spectres exorbitant two-and-a-half-hour running time--this is after all a Bond film starring Daniel Craig--the movie loses momentum at each stop and is flagging by its conclusion. Moreover it makes a number of substantial narrative missteps falling into some old bad habits and developing a few new ones.Begin with the second meaning of ""the dead are alive"" which is advertised as early as the title sequence. There amid the customary naked ladies--here ickily accoutered in octopi--flash images of previous Bond villains Le Chiffre (Casino Royale) and Silva (Skyfall) along with Bonds deceased love Vesper Lynd and deceased boss the previous M (Judi Dench). In essence Spectre is an elaborate retcon job a bid to turn the Craig movies into a unified trilogy (yes technically a tetralogy; bear with me). This is achieved principally by revealing that Spectre was secretly (and rather murkily) behind all the evil plots that took place in the earlier films. Or as Waltzs character explains to Bond late in the movie ""Its always been me James the author of all your pain.""The backward references to previous films are almost innumerable and act as an accumulating drag on the current one. Dench even has a cameo in one of those ""watch this video only after my death"" scenes. Given the extent of the nostalgia-fest its amusing that the films producers seem eager to have us forget about Craigs less-successful second outing as Bond Quantum of Solace. Among the literally dozens of references to Le Chiffre Silva Mr. White Lynd and M they left in--perhaps accidentally?--just one glancing mention of ""Greene"" Quantums villain.This tying together of Craigs Bond oeuvre--by the end literally as in with string--is a decidedly poor idea and its logic doesnt hold up to even the most cursory scrutiny. But this is I fear a consequence of our current heyday of novel series serialized television and cinematic ""universes."" Its no longer sufficient for a movie to have a ""plot."" Now it must have an ""arc""--or rather multiple arcs both within and spanning sequential films and even interrelated series. I tremble for the day when some enterprising young exec has the bright idea of cross-pollinating Bond with fellow Sony property Spider-Man.Bond is best left a cypher beyond the realm of causal psychology.Related to this too-tidy interweaving of the last few films is the decision by Bonds custodians to give 007 an elaborate tragic-orphan backstory. This intent was suggested in Skyfall but Spectre takes it a great deal further. This movies villain is inserted into that tale too such that he is the author not only of Bonds spyhood pain but of his boyhood pain as well. Here I must voice a strenuous dissent Bond is not Batman; he does not need an origin story. Ian Fleming himself described 007 as ""an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a government department."" (Or as my friend and colleague James Parker memorably characterized him ""a bleak circuit of appetites sensations and prejudices driven by a mechanical imperative called duty."") He is in any case best left a cypher beyond the realm of causal psychology.Even as Spectre offers dubious new wrinkles to the franchise it unlearns some of the crucial lessons of its recent success. One of the chief delights of the Casino Royale reboot was how aggressively it pushed back at the tropes that had been weighing down Bond movies for decades the endless womanizing the gadget-laden cars the secret lairs. As Le Chiffre told 007 before smashing his groin with a knotted rope ""I never understood all these elaborate tortures."" Spectre backslides on virtually every one of these fronts the women the super-car the villains secret hideout in an arid crater () and his endless monologuing as he subjects Bond to the most elaborate torture since Auric Goldfinger threatened him with a Lasik circumcision.Are there enough good moments to make up for these lapses? Yes there are a dizzying car chase in Rome a Spectre meeting that falls just this side of camp (its like an Eyes Wide Shut party in which everyone keeps their clothes on) an alpine chase in an aircraft fuselage that astonishing opening sequence. Dave Bautista is a solid heir to the brotherhood of Bond heavies such as Oddjob Jaws and Robert Shaws underrated peroxide assassin Donald ""Red"" Grant. Fiennes does a creditable job of trying to fill Denchs fundamentally unfillable shoes. And Monica Bellucci is beguiling as a beautiful widow. (Her ""Cant you see Im grieving?"" Bond ""No."") By contrast the movies principal love interest played by Lea Seydoux alas makes almost no impression at all.But ultimately of course it all comes back to Craig himself. This is likely his last outing as Bond--part of the reason no doubt for all the wrapping-up--and the question of whether he or Sean Connery most owned the role can now begin to unfold in earnest. But regardless of who next buttons the tux and holsters the Walther the lesson of Spectre is a simple one Let Bond be Bond and the mission be the mission without the need for connective arcs and tragic backstories. Next time let the dead stay dead.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

(The personal and political are pretty much identical here and a spectre is of course a ghost -- the sort of things that refuses to die and instead haunts the living.) Its very much a continuation of 2012s Skyfall director Sam Mendes still knows his way around a grand-scale establishing shot info-terrorism is still the threat Mi6s allegedly outdated 00 program is still the issue and family of one sort or another is still at the heart of everything. There are signs of Bond bloat within many of the action sequences -- it must be hard to trim such extravagant footage -- but they are at least partly overcome by an increase in levity. Some funny bits are obvious landing on a couch after sliding off a building. Some are less so a woman falls asleep in her dress after threatening to kill Bond if he comes near her; when she awakens shes wearing a satin nightgown and her attitude is similarly changed. Most are welcome. Shockingly its the villain played by Christoph Waltz who disappoints. He lacks previous baddie Javier Bardems wicked relish and his aim is pretty lousy. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 6 2015 Save for later Saved About video ads Spectre trailer View Caption About video ads View Caption of Daniel Craig is reportedly ready to hang it up as James Bond and perhaps its all for the best. Not that hes bad in ""Spectre"" the 24th installment (depending on how you count them) of the 007 series. Its just that like all of his licensed-to-kill actor predecessors he looks played out as the series plays on. Especially compared with ""Skyfall"" Craigs last outing the film seems played out as well. Time I think for another reboot and another Bond. (My vote is for Idris Elba.)Sam Mendes directed this reputedly 250 million production but its difficult to determine where all that money went. Mostly what we see are the usual explosions and demolitions and high-speed chases aground and aloft. The locations including Mexico City (during the Day of the Dead festivities) Rome Morocco and the Austrian Alps are not especially well utilized - they could just as well be CGI backdrops. And too many characters and sequences from previous Bond films particularly from the Sean Connery/Roger Moore era are referenced without providing a fresh spin. For example a punch-out between Bond and a big lug on a train is a dim echo of the Connery-Robert Shaw slugfest in ""From Russia With Love."" The films attempt after ""Skyfall"" to extend Bonds psychological back story is sketchy at best. Bonds killer instincts apparently emanate from an unhappy childhood. Oh. Recommended James Bond How well do you know the movie series? His romantic scenes first with an underworld widow played by Monica Bellucci and later with the Proustianly named Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) are neither shaken nor stirring. Ralph Fiennes turns up as M ditto Ben Whishaw as Q to minimal effect. The Bond villain - who  wants to take over the world natch but in high-tech-style - is played by Christoph Waltz. He can play this part in his sleep but manages to be semi-aroused most of the time. Test your knowledge James Bond How well do you know the movie series? Monitor Movie Guide Even a subpar James Bond movie is worth seeing because well its James Bond. But if one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping its once again time to change the formula.

Review Bond uncovers worldwide conspiracy in Spectre Tom Long The Detroit News 1140 p.m. EST November 5 2015Daniel Craig again stars as spy James Bond who uncovers a vast conspiracy by a secretive organization in ""Spectre.""(Photo Jonathan Olley / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures)""Spectre"" plays out as a sort of greatest hits farewell tour for Daniel Craigs James Bond and for the most part its efficient-enough Bond fare -- overlong car chases beautiful women in eternal danger crazy stunts suave cool under fire. Nice fitting suits.But what about the bad guy? Bad guys are essential to Bond and this time around he has one of our best actors playing the villain Two-time Academy Award-winner Christoph Waltz. The problem? Aside from a couple of lines early on he doesnt show up until the films final 45 minutes.Instead the film uses mountainous Dave Bautista as a mostly wordless quasi-Odd Job stand-in for the first two thirds which works well enough action-wise but limits the witty repartee. Then again Craigs Bond has never been known for his wit but more for his tortured/convoluted psyche and background which are again on full display here.The premise The modern world has caught up with British intelligence and the 00 series of licensed assassins is about to be discontinued in favor of a massive surveillance program which will bind the information-gathering capabilities of nine major countries together. In other words Bond is about to be replaced by drones.So of course he goes off on his own starting in Mexico City to uncover a vast conspiracy (a minor conspiracy would never be enough for Bond) a secretive organization called Spectre that plans to tap into that surveillance program and ... do what? Nasty things assumedly. Rule the world that kind of stuff.While investigating Spectre Bond beds a woman he has just made a widow (Monica Belluci majestic if only briefly available) and then finds himself entrusted with the safety of a young doctor Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux from ""Blue is the Warmest Color"") who eventually becomes his sidekick and romantic interest.Daniel Craig is 47. Lea Seydoux is 30. Ah Hollywood.Its a Bond movie so of course the two go globe-hopping the Alps to Tangiers to our bad guys remote outpost in the desert then home to London. It would be unfair to give away the bad guys name -- a bit of Bond history -- but he turns out to have been a childhood acquaintance of young James in keeping with the recent tendency to tie things to Bonds beginnings.""Spectre"" is directed as previous Bond entry ""Skyfall"" was by the Oscar-winning prestige director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" ""Revolutionary Road"") and again he may be seeing more in the franchise than actually exists. The script has four authors yet includes innumerable clunky lines that channel absolute B-movie cheese while aspiring to some grand existential portrait of our assassin as a damaged child grown into a borderline sociopath.Remember when Bond used to be fun? Nobody here does but thats been Bonds path for the past decade (the darkness actually began setting in during Pierce Brosnans reign). Still even when hes oh-so-serious its a bit hard to take Bond seriously.On the other hand its also hard to ignore his cool. Craig starts the movie off casually walking along the edges of a series of high rooftops thoroughly unperturbed by the possibility of a misstep meaning instant death. Its not played up as shrill drama but as nonchalance. If ""Spectre"" is the swan song for Craigs Bond -- and it plays as if it is -- hes at least kept the character as above-it-all as hes always been.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongSpectreGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some disturbing images sensuality and languageRunning time 148 minutes 36 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDINEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1iGVP9g MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/11/05/movie-review-bond-uncovers-worldwide-conspiracy-spectre/75267748/,200,spectre5,spectre,detroitnews
"Spectre | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spectre ) Spectre (U.K./U.S. 2015) November 05 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Warning Oblique spoilers. An ""average"" James Bond movie can be described using three words ""satisfying but flawed."" To the extent thats true Spectre fills the mold. Overplotted and at least 20 minutes too long the film opens big slogs through its middle act and recovers for a rousing conclusion. The fourth (and possibly last) outing for Daniel Craig as 007 this continues the ""reboot"" process begun in 2006s Casino Royale. For the first time we see the producers masterplan not only to strip down and resurrect Bond (the character) for a new era but to meticulously re-introduce all the elements of his universe. Prior to its re-emergence here Spectre (an acronym for ""Special Executive for Counter-intelligence Terrorism Revenge and Extortion"") the nefarious shadow organization that plagued the Connery Bond has been absent for more than 40 years (largely because of copyright issues). By the end of Spectre the pieces are (almost) all in place for the Bond production team to start re-making the early classics. Can a new Dr. No be far off? Spectre is the most ""traditional"" of the Craig Bonds. Although a little light on gadgets it has everything else including (for the first time since Brosnans unfortunate final outing) the opening iris. As the film starts M (Ralph Fiennes) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) are in the office and Q (Ben Whishaw) is in his lab. 007 is in Mexico City tracking an assassin. His investigation spurred on by a tip from his former boss (a Judi Dench cameo) sends him in pursuit of a new global threat the organization Spectre headed by Franz Oberhauser (Chistoph Waltz). Oberhauser has a close connection to Bond and is nursing a grudge. As Ms group comes under fire as obsolete by a new British intelligence official C (Andrew Scott Sherlocks Moriarty) Bond must romance a couple of women (Monica Bellucci Lea Seydoux) face off against Oberhausers henchman Hinx (Dave Bautista) and uncover the truth about Oberhauser (which wont surprise any long-time Bond fans). If Spectre is disappointing its because Skyfall its immediate predecessor (also directed by Sam Mendes) was so good. In fact two of Craigs outings (Skyfall and Casino Royale) have represented the best Bond since Connery left. Spectre is more of a middling affair. Much of the London-based material with M battling C over the value of ""old-fashioned"" field agents belongs in a different movie. Its ultimately superfluous and serves primarily to fatten up an already bloated production. Also Bonds romance with Dr. Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) develops a little too slowly for an action thriller. Hinx played by Guardians of the Galaxys Dave Bautista is a pleasant addition to the 007 Rogues Gallery of Henchmen. Although not as memorable as Oddjob or Jaws he can stand on his own. His fight scene with Bond aboard a moving train is reminiscent of Connerys battle with Robert Shaws Grant in From Russia with Love - the similarities are undoubtedly intentional. As the man in the shadows Christoph Waltz is underused. His cool urbane approach is menacing but hes not as ferocious as Skyfalls Silva. Spectre continues the recent trend of transforming the serial womanizer into more of a romantic hero. Bonds relationship with Madeleine has a depth seen only twice previously in the series 53-year history (On Her Majestys Secret Service Casino Royale) and shows the producers to be cognizant that the concept of a ""love interest"" has to evolve from what it once was. Although Lea Seydoux gets the lions share of female screen time Monica Belluccis small role as the widow of a man killed by Bond allows her to become the first fifty-something ""Bond girl"" (assuming one doesnt count the original Miss Moneypenny Lois Maxwell). In terms of its pyrotechnics fight scenes and stunts Spectre outdoes anything attempted in Skyfall fulfilling director Sam Mendes self-imposed requirement that things needed to be more spectacular in the follow-up. Although the film doesnt reach the absurd heights of rival action franchises such as The Fast and the Furious and Mission Impossible there are times when it comes close. Composer Thomas Newman proves to be a better successor to John Barry than David Arnold who scored five of the last seven franchise entries. He is less reluctant and more able than Arnold to entwine the iconic Monty Norman theme into his work. (Sam Smiths title song however is unremarkable and a significant step down from Adeles ""Skyfall."") One point of curiosity about Spectre is how it would address the so-called ""Blofeld question."" Considering that Ernst Stavro Blofeld was Spectres 1 and became Bonds arch-rival during the Connery era it seemed odd that there was no mention of him in any of the publicity material related to Spectre. Rest assured the movie addresses this. I wont discuss the specifics or guess whether viewers will be satisfied with how its handled but Mendes and the screenwriters dont ignore the character. ""James Bond will return."" So promises the end credits (as they often do). Although Spectre is not top-flight 007 theres nothing here to damage the venerable franchise. It has the ingredients necessary to succeed at the box office and offers the kind of high-voltage action that todays movie-goers love. If theres too much plot and times when the pacing becomes sluggish and uneven those are easy traps for ambitious would-be epics to fall into In the end this solid Bond does justice to the characters long legacy while paying due diligence to what he has become under Daniel Craigs stewardship.

But it was a fascinating journey wasnt it? Instructive in all sorts of ways. In a world of ""franchises"" tentpoles"" ""reboots"" and ""universes"" (A world of universes? Indeed) the Craig Bonds are prime examples of what happens when brainy intensely self-conscious fans -- people who grew up with these series -- get hundreds of millions of dollars to engage in a dialogue with the past. Its fanboy culture on an undreamed-of scale.

Whereas the 007 of yore -- embodied by Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan -- arrived onscreen fully formed his license-to-kill exercised to the point of being casual his yen for women and martinis unshakable (though in the latter case shaken) this Bond was a stark newbie. In Casino Royale we witnessed his first awkward bloody kill. We saw him grieve over a lost love and deliver a signpost line responding to a bartender who asked him if he wanted his martini shaken or stirred ""Do I look as if I care?"" The classic Bond regarded the world as his oyster the license-to-kill the province of the ruling class -- especially in the face of foreign upstarts with frankly vulgar ideas about world domination. But here we had an outsider. In Spectre Craigs Bond has finally learned to mimic some of the ways of the Old Boys but youd never find him in a Mens Club. Partly of course thats because Mens Clubs dont flaunt their exclusivity as openly but mostly because this Bond was created by post-feminists with progressive sympathies who werent around for the Suez humiliation and never felt the stinging fear of the Cold War. He was born after Tony Blair in concert with George W. Bush cherry-picked intelligence to justify the catastrophic Middle East-destabilizing invasion of Iraq. This 007 must save the world not just from archvillains but also from the government -- either through incompetence or design -- enabling them. Bonds first mission in Spectre is undertaken on his own and causes an international incident. Its a pretty good pre-credits sequence. Director Sam Mendes executes a long hot-dog single shot that begins in the middle of a Mexico City Day of the Dead parade and ends on the roof of a building with Bond -- first seen in a traditional skull mask -- treading carefully along a ledge and taking aim with his big gun at another bogus reveler a terrorist plotting to blow up a stadium. The sequence is crackerjack until Bond and his adversary are pounding away at each other in a spinning helicopter. The editor Lee Smith (frequently allied with Christopher Nolan) lacks dash; he and Mendes dont deliver the nipping slightly syncopated rhythms of the best Bond films. The cuts dont make you laugh at the audacity -- and elegance -- of the stunts. Guy Ritchie out-Bonded Bond in his less earnest (and less plodding) The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which looked to me like an audition for the next Bond. After a laughably tacky credits sequence -- Sam Smiths nonstarter theme ""Writings on the Wall"" over a shirtless Craig molested by octopus tentacles --A Spectre settles into a decent detective story in which Bond is principally undermined by whats nominally his own side. ""M"" (Ralph Fiennes) is under siege by ""C"" a smarmy bureaucrat (Andrew Scott the giggly-freak Moriarty of Sherlock) whos set on eliminating the ""Double-O"" program and folding the tip-top-secret MI6 agency into the merely top-secret MI5. C is also going full speed ahead on an epic global-surveillance network that would drive Laura Poitras to Bellevue -- and puts the priggish M in the position of playing Glenn Greenwald. Better to use the Double-Os says M because they can decide when to kill and when not to kill -- unlike drones dispatched willy-nilly by the uncontrollable octopus of the state. In this new world aristocratic British assassins are our last best hope for good kills. Speaking of assassins 007 saves Monica Bellucci from the bad kind and then thrusts himself on her in a way that doesnt track with his un-brazen behavior in Casino Royale Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. Its not Craigs most convincing scene; he looks as if someone has a gun on him. I had a chance to interview him before Spectre started shooting when he was in rehearsals for the Broadway revival of Harold Pinters Betrayal and he admitted that his first three Bonds were on the grim side. ""Hopefully well reclaim some of the old irony"" he said of Spectre ""and make sure it doesnt become pastiche. I cant do shtick Im not very good at it ... I sometimes wish I hammed it up more but I just cant do it very well so I dont do it."" I think Craig is a superb actor (and I like his brusque honesty) but he doesnt reclaim much of that old irony. Its hard to be ironic and intense. Hes best in the scene where he trains his laser-blue eyes on his old adversary Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) now himself a hunted man and not long for the world and promises to protect Whites daughter Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) in return for another piece of the puzzle.A Christoph Waltz is the smiling archvillain who commands from the shadows but is characterized -- with a requisite shudder -- as being ""everywhere everywhere."" At his best Waltz makes an art of hammy clamminess and hes wonderful when his character Oberhauser is tauntingly cryptic. His eyes shine. The problem is that Mendes and the battery of writers (John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth) have a compulsion to psychoanalyze their villains and tie up the whole outlandish arc of Craigs Bond with a neat little Freudian bow. Javier Bardems Silva in Skyfall had mommy issues. Oberhauser has daddy ones. Instead of grand megalomaniacs like Dr. No and Goldfinger Mendes gives us vengeful nerds like the ones who write long manifestos about society rejecting them and then go out and mow down innocent bystanders. Its not that real psychos dont have their beefs with Mom and Dad. Its that supervillains should be made of more mythic stuff. The Greek gods gave it back to Zeus with style. Theres another related oddity about the Craig Bonds Theyre catharsis-free. None of the bad guys get the rousing send-off of Oddjob or Mr. Big in Live and Let Die. In Spectre theres a brutal fight aboard a train that echoes From Russia With Love but the assassin is dispatched like Wile E. Coyote in The Road Runner. The Bond movies need a touch of sadism. They began -- in the first scene of the first film Dr. NoA -- on a note of sudden shocking violence. Mendess Oscar-worthy humanism is misplaced. A I could carp about Spectre for a lot longer but I still enjoyed it more than most of the post-Connery Bonds. Its not -- as some critics have said -- the worst. Not even close. Seydoux -- best known for her lesbian gyrations in Blue Is the Warmest ColorA -- is appealingly self-possessed and Id have put her high in the Bond Girl pantheon if she didnt turn into one of those judgmental types who doesnt approve of the hero unceremoniously executing the bad guy. (Connery -- and even the campy Moore -- would have told her to put a sock in it.) Ben Whishaws bushy-haired hacker/inventor Q is a nice update on what was once an assistant-headmaster type. And hurrah for a Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) who fends off Bonds advances instead of being genially reminded that shes too old and frumpy for his embrace. Will Craig do another Bond? He has made his distaste plain and Spectre does round out his story -- though it leaves a dangling thread or two. But as it stands his four-film arc is a vivid mostly successful example of a new generation of artists trying to preserve the appeal of a pop-culture icon by bringing him into the present upending and deepening the basic ingredients. The result is fun even if its a mishmash leaving you shaken not stirred.

"Spectre the new James Bond movie starring Daniel Craig and directed by Sam Mendes reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Spectre Is Our Most Frustrating Example Yet of the Push to Remake James Bond as an Antihero Spectre Is Our Most Frustrating Example Yet of the Push to Remake James Bond as an Antihero Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 5 2015 534 PM Daniel Craig Is Right to Hate James Bond Spectre is our most frustrating example yet of the franchises push to remake its lead as an antihero. By Isaac Chotiner Still of Daniel Craig in Spectre. Photo by Jonathan Olley. Image courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. Danjaq LLC and Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. Whether you are a James Bond addict who knows all 24 films nearly by heart or a reluctant cinemagoer who wishes that the series would just mercifully end you will likely agree that Spectre starts promisingly enough. A long impressive tracking shot establishes 007 in Mexico City as he takes in a Day of the Dead Parade with a woman on his arm. He nimbly climbs over some rooftops assassinates several terrorists and finds himself in a helicopter that is spinning around like a fighter jet. Cue the opening titles and a visit to Ms office where it initially appears as if we may be returning to the old Bond formula ""minimovie"" teaser mission briefing mission. Isaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate contributor. But Spectre like Daniel Craigs other three Bond outings is more complicated than that. Over the course of the films 150 minutes it becomes clear that nearly everything we have witnessed in the previous trilogy was merely a lead-up to this latest adventure. Bonds personal history is explored in great detail; the doings of great nations and even greater terrorists depend upon old grievances; plans for world domination come second to settling scores. How did we find ourselves once again knee-deep in James Bonds backstory? Advertisement For much of the past two decades the creators of the James Bond films have been suffering a crisis of confidence. By the mid-1990s the Soviet Union had gone the way of the British Empire. Because Ian Fleming had originally envisaged the character combatting the former and upholding the latter the producers feared perhaps understandably that Bond was an irrelevant Manichean hero from another age unequipped for a politically correct post-imperial world. It didnt matter that none of the early filmic Bond adventures actually featured the Soviets as villains. Bond himself was still dismissed by his critics onscreen and off as ""a relic of the Cold War."" Indeed those words were spoken by Judi Denchs M in Goldeneye (1995) the first post-USSR Bond movie. When Dench in the same in-joke of a scene refers to Pierce Brosnans Bond as a ""misogynist dinosaur"" she was both echoing critiques of the series and trying to disarm them. The filmmakers were assuring the audience that they too partially disapproved of their hero. For those of us who want our escapism to provide an actual escape the Brosnan years were a slog marred by meta humor and increasingly slapdash directing. The Craig films that followed--the glorious Casino Royale the dreadful Quantum of Solace and the overrated Skyfall--made a different error They delved too deeply into Bonds psyche and backstory saddling the character with uninteresting baggage and like so many of our eras blockbusters confusing darkness for depth. If you are going to present modern audiences with a misogynistic violent hero you better make him a tortured soul. In an age obsessed with antiheroes it made sense that Bond would evolve in this direction. The attempts to humanize 007 have long felt inspired by Christopher Nolans Batman movies but it was the portentousness and self-seriousness of Nolan--and not the technical skill--that had leaked into the franchises filmmaking. Rather than a man without a past Bond became a man who could not outrun his past. If you are going to present modern audiences with a misogynistic violent hero you better make him a tortured soul. Advertisement Today 20 years after Goldeneye and nearly a decade after Craigs tenure began no one seems to doubt James Bonds relevance. The brand is stronger than it has been since the mid-1960s; box office grosses are astronomical; even critics who traditionally have greeted 007 with good-natured if wary shrugs have gushed over two of the previous three films. If ever the series could afford to settle back into its original groove--superb locations excellent stunts a sense of fun that overshadowed any unpleasantness--now would seem to be the time. This felt especially likely because Skyfall ended on a note of finality Bonds childhood had been detailed and its traumas seemingly transcended; his womanizing (partially) explained through a catastrophic loss; a new M (replacing the murdered--and avenged--Judi Dench) had taken residence in what appeared to be the office M occupied in the early films of the series; and Moneypenny had been introduced in such a way as to explain the flirtatiousness she and Bond would go on to exhibit throughout the series. Even those of us who had been disappointed in the trilogy found a small glimmer of hope that in the next film Bond would as M stated in Skyfalls penultimate line get back to work. But in Spectre Bond cant really get back to work As in the previous Craig films his office is still a mess. Bond is immediately dismissed from his job for his bad behavior in Mexico. At the same time M (Ralph Fiennes) must reckon with another bureaucrat in British intelligence who not only wants to end the double-0 program but who is intent on establishing a worldwide surveillance system clumsily referred to by Fiennes as ""George Orwells worst nightmare."" (Wasnt Orwells other nightmare cliched writing?) Meanwhile Bond sets off on an unofficial mission sparked by a final message from Denchs M with the help of only Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) Q (an excellent Ben Whishaw) and all the gadgets money can buy. After bedding Monica Bellucci in Rome Bond attends a meeting of mysterious international criminals that breaks up in shocking fashion. As the film unspools its clear that Bond has a secret he is keeping from everyone and that the villain (played by Christoph Waltz) has some sort of unexplained vendetta against 007. Eventually Bond meets up with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux impressive in an underwritten role) the daughter of a former adversary and the two of them soldier through an attempted kidnapping in snowy Austria a sojourn in Morocco and a superb fight scene on a train somewhere in North Africa. Advertisement Spectre is far from a disaster The locations are impressive the Bond-Q relationship works wonderfully well and the first two-thirds of the movie generally go down easily enough. But by the time Spectre reaches its conclusion the backstory has become so fraught the motives so unclear and the layers of scheming by the villains so convoluted that its exhausting. Bond and Swann arrive at Waltzs lair with absolutely no plan. Their eventual escape is nicely executed but rather than closing credits we get another half-hour in London with an unsurprising twist and several more plodding fun-free encounters between heroes and villains. The plot keeps bogging the characters down After trying to kill Bond for the entire film the villain reveals that he actually had planned to keep Bond alive for a final showdown. Did he fail to communicate this to all of his employees who spend the whole movie nearly killing Bond? (Dave Bautista playing a psychotic killer who in his dark outfits resembles an oval-shaped ball of steel memorably contributes to the series long history of grotesquely menacing henchmen.) More egregiously its revealed that Waltzs villain--yes its Bonds nemesis from the Connery era Ernst Stavro Blofeld--has been ""the author of all [Bonds] pain"" for the entire run of Craigs films and only because of a silly childhood vendetta that is woefully underexplained. Why was Blofeld aiming to kill Bond through the first three films if his ultimate goal was to confront him and reveal his identity? Sure the earlier films in the series had gaping lacks in logic many of which were gleefully exposed by Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies. (Anyone who can explain the plot of The Man With the Golden Gun is smarter than I am and Ive easily seen it 30 times.) But those films were not trying to be ""serious"" movies. Blofeld was always a camp figure but here he feels out of place. Even worse the film literally stops dead with several boring debates about the merits of drone warfare and NSA-like surveillance vs. good old-fashioned spying. The scripts idea of being pro-civil liberties is to romanticize the notion of British secret agents going around the world killing anyone they please. Advertisement Its more than a stones throw from earlier Bond adventures and even from Casino Royale--which despite being a weightier film than its predecessors is nonetheless full of lighthearted moments. If you compare the romantic train scenes in that film and in Spectre you will notice that Spectres is weighed down by an exchange in which Swann predictably asks Bond why he is an assassin. The last few Mission Impossible films have been superior to the last couple of Bond films not only because they have had superior action scenes but also because they dont seem to have any ambitions beyond exciting their audience. If Spectre has any saving grace its Craig who remains the best non-Connery Bond. It is not merely his physical presence which is formidable enough; he has a unique ability to make peevishness dramatically compelling. And the subtlety of his sense of humor is one of the better aspects of his 007. Top Comment You dont get bond at all.  Brosnan was a great bond second only to Connery.  More... -cardog Join In The tougher question is whether Craig is so good an actor that he has inadvertently hurt the series. Even in a cultural era obsessed with moral complexity its hard to imagine that the mood of the franchise would have gotten quite so dark or that there would have been quite so hard a push to make its protagonist more complicated if an actor of Brosnans limited abilities had stayed in the role. Craig has recently declared his annoyance at having to play Bond--the orneriness that he shows onscreen doesnt seem entirely a matter of acting--and so its possible that Spectre will be his last outing. Whenever people talk about who the next Bond will be the discussion tends to focus on Idris Elba. But that could be the problem for those of us who yearn for a James Bond film that recalls the more lighthearted Bond of our childhood rather than Bonds childhood trauma an actor with Elbas dramatic chops might be a mixed blessing. No one wants to see Vin Diesel grunt his way through ordering a martini but maybe an actor incapable of more complexity would force the filmmakers to return to their original mission of making purely entertaining movies.

Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in Spectre. Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Sony Pictures A million years ago in the 1960s the only mandate for each new James Bond film was that it be grander stranger and more exotic than the last. But in the hands of director Sam Mendes who made 2012s Skyfall and the new Spectre theres a troubling new mission requirement Each 007 adventure must be progressively more nostalgic and reverential too. His new movie pleads the case for the hard-drinking spys relevance in the era of drone assassinations and WikiLeaks even more loudly than Skyfall did (and with far less eloquence) while being paradoxically determined to reprise all of Bonds Greatest Hits. As with any aging rock band the set list overwhelmingly favors the enterprises first decade There are echoes of Bonds train fight with a hulking Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love his combat-optimized Aston Martin (and white dinner jacket) from Goldfinger the spectacularly designed villains lair from You Only Live Twice and the stunning Swiss alpine outpost from On Her Majestys Secret Service. There are also at least two too many callbacks to Casino Royale the excellent 2006 reboot wherein newly minted 007 Daniel Craig gave the character a vulnerability and dimension hed never had before -- and on the evidence of his granite-faced performance in Spectre will probably never have again. That friction between topicality and nostalgia makes for a gorgeous and dreamlike but ultimately frustrating Bond film. I blame Mendes. He did a great job with Skyfall juggling modernity and sentiment in a manner befitting the franchises 50th-anniversary installment. So potent was the nostalgia high it induced that not only did it become the series all-time top earner with 1.1 billion in receipts but no one seemed especially troubled by the fact that in it the bad guy won. Hey it had to happen sometime. Anyway now wouldve been a fine time to drop all that baggage and back story and just send Craigs definitive Bond on a fabulous globetrotting adventure. Any of the journeymen directors responsible for the majority of the 23 previous Eon Productions Bond pictures couldve handled this. (The ones who arent dead are long retired but you know what I mean.) But because Mendes is a fancy-pants artiste with an Oscar on his mantle (for the loathsome American Beauty) he feels obligated to proffer a sluggish metacommentary on the iconography of classic Bond. Its suffocating. Where Spectre does break from the past its only to conform to the rigid rules of 21st century film-franchise governance imposing a unconvincing and pointless interconnectedness onto the the events of the three previous Craig-era pictures. This insistence that all the varied trials his world-weary Bond has faced were the work of one man -- Christoph Waltz who may or may not be playing a certain oft-parodied international man of mystery who has long been absent from the series for exciting legal reasons -- strains our suspension of disbelief more than any orbiting death ray or submarine-car ever did. And while no series has seen more obligatory romantic pairings than this one Spectres coupling of Craig with the substantially younger French actor Lea Seydoux (following a much publicized interlude with Monica Bellucci that lasts all of two scenes) rings particularly hollow after the palpable chemistry he shared with Eva Green in Casino Royale. On the plus side the likable trio that Mendes recruited to play Bonds MI6 allies -- Ralph Fiennes M (Bonds boss) Naomie Harris Miss Moneypenny and Ben Wishaws Q -- are all back and given more to do than these characters ever have been. Mendes has borrowed a lot of tricks from the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight films for his Bonds; making the supporting cast more than just window dressing is one of the smarter ones. M is under pressure from a high-ranking official (Sherlocks Andrew Scott) to shut down the archaic double-0 section in favor of an omnipresent electronic surveillance regime. If this seems awfully similar to subplots in last years Captain America The Winter Soldier or this summers Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation (both more thrilling thrillers than Spectre it pains me to say) well chalk that up to audiences increasing discomfort at being asked to cheer for high-tech spy agencies with little oversight and limitless budgets. The cold open at least is pretty spectacular. Its the kind of bravura shot rarely seen in this series a Touch of Evil-inspired long steadicam take that follows a disguised 007 and his fetching plus-one through a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City. (That he doffs his skeleton costume for an impeccable Tom Ford suit before springing into action has nothing to do with tactics and everything to do with optics.) A melee in a helicopter careening dangerously above the bystander-packed Zocalo leaves Bond in a possession of a laughably conspicuous jewelry-clue (one that must have seemed pretty dumb even in Thunderball the 50-year-old Bond picture that spawned it). After a typically ornate title sequence combining Sam Smiths earsplitting theme song with CGI octopus tentacles were off to the races. Disobeying orders to stand down for the umpteenth time Bond lights out for Rome Austria and Tangier to follow a posthumous lead bequeathed to him by Judi Denchs M who was assassinated in Skyfall. A theater director by training Mendes mustve appreciated that 007 like Prince Hamlet is doing the bloody bidding of a ghost. These pictures have endured several cycles of decay and renewal in the 53 years since Dr. No. hit the screen. Craig is the fourth actor to to play James Bond a fourth time and Mission 004 in each 007s run is historically where the films begin to go slack 1965s Thunderball 1979s Moonraker and 2002s Die Another Day were all divisive fourth installments immediately followed by necessary course corrections. (Despite the moaning they inspired among diehards they were also huge hits -- indeed Thunderball stood for 47 years as the series most successful entry until Skyfall beat it.) However Spectre is received and regardless of whether Craig makes good on his threats to depart after this installment (for Bond actors to complain about the role is yet another well-established tradition) 007 should expect new orders after this. Its deep into the 148-minute move when the half-drunk sleepless secret agent trains his Walther PPK on a rodent thats scurried into his Moroccan bungalow. ""Who sent you?"" he asks softly. ""Who are you working for?"" It may seem like a silly question but to paraphrase another immortal son of the 1960s one Bob Dylan Everybodys gotta serve somebody.

Its everything Bond fans could want and then some. Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures James Bond (Daniel Craig) is back in Spectre. Its everything Bond fans could want and then some. Jonathan Olley/Courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Spectre opens in Mexico City -- a Day of the Dead festival in full swing -- streets crowded with partying skeletons and director Sam Mendes celebrating the dead in his own way with a nifty Orson Welles tribute A Touch of Evil-style tracking shot that has no obvious edits for at least five minutes as it follows Bond (Daniel Craig) and a gorgeous brunette (Stephanie Sigman) from the costumed parade route into a hotel up in a crowded elevator to a well-appointed room where she settles seductively on a bed -- only to watch him zip out onto a roof ledge with a quick shirt cuff adjustment and murder on his mind. At some point the director starts cutting as 007 dispatches bad guys collapses buildings and wrestles with a villain in a suddenly pilotless upside-down helicopter. As showoff-y starts go this one ranks with the best in the series. And if the prize Bond is after -- a ring with an octopus-y Spectre symbol -- seems kind of minor for all that mayhem it does lead nicely into the films titles Sam Smiths melody-challenged but suitably sultry ""Writings on the Wall"" backed by gorgeous women writhing with octopus tentacles bullets trailing inky jets. Its everything a Bond fan could wish and then some. Which seems to be the operating aesthetic this time out everything you could wish and then some for an epically overstuffed 2 hours and 28 minutes. Enough time to pack in a whole bunch of bad guys from pencil pushers to bodybuilders to Christoph Waltz an extravagance of exotic locales from Moroccan meteor craters to a Rome-the-eternal-city that feels like a racetrack with palazzos and -- of course -- a bevy of beauties who do what Bond beauties do. Monica Belluci whom Bond divests of widows weeds as hes introducing himself as ""Bond James Bond"" is easily the most compelling (though shes accorded the least screen time). Petulant obstreperous shrink Lea Seydoux may be the least compelling (perhaps because shes accorded the most screen time). We are not in other words tilling a lot of new ground in Spectre. In fact the screenplay is pretty consciously tilling old ground with shout-outs to all three of Craigs 007 movies and also to those of his predecessors including a compartment-smashing fistfight on a train that echoes camera angles and even a couple of Sean Connerys punches from From Russia With Love. (For more on the shout-outs to earlier 007 exploits check out my colleague Chris Klimeks ruminations.) There are hints that the filmmakers arent just going for nostalgia but would also like to be of the moment -- talk of ""smart blood"" drones and online surveillance to drive the plot -- but none of it feels especially urgent even when red digital readouts are counting down to imminent explosions. It might feel more urgent if the writing were tighter. But I suppose if you have lots of villains locales homages and explosions its only natural to have lots of words. Naomie Harris dutiful Miss Moneypenny for instance says early on ""Youve got a secret"" and should really leave it there. Instead she continues with ""something you cant tell anyone because you dont trust anyone"" an explanation so unnecessary you half expect Bond to call her on it. He however is too busy being tortured by Waltz dressed down by new ""M"" Ralph Fiennes dressed up by costumer Jany Temime in form-fitting formal wear and put through his sharply staged and shot action-hero paces by the director. They are familiar paces -- how could they not be the two-dozenth time -- updated for different cities different women different tuxes. And fans will doubtless find them pleasantly diverting though even the most rabid will have to concede theres been a falloff in emotional resonance since Bonds last outing. In that one this same director star and writing team (augmented here by writer Jez Butterworth) managed to outfit the action with all sorts of feeling -- feeling that made Skyfall feel more substantial than most Bond pictures. Which perhaps set expectations unreasonably high for this installment. It remains a decently robust and entertaining midlevel Bond movie -- just one thats haunted by the specter of its predecessor.

By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Nov. 6 2015 323 a.m. ET At one point in ""Spectre"" James Bond--played for the fourth and maybe the last time by Daniel Craig--finds himself strapped into a torture machine that drills little holes in his skull. Thats obviously not a good thing for Bond though the drilling seems to have no after-effects. And its not a good thing for the film that the machine resembles the goofy feeding contraption that goes berserk in Charlie Chaplins ""Modern Times."" Perhaps some of the goofiness was intentional--you cant always tell from this productions wavering tone--but ""Spectre"" is full of not-good things and some oppressively bad things that may...

(JONATHAN OLLEY / Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 07 2015What would happen if a James Bond movie didnt end in a countdown-to-doom conflagration? If squads of Uzi-spraying henchmen didnt go gunning for the famous 007? If the megalomaniacal villain bent on world domination world destruction or at the very least world discomfort shelved his superweapon and sought out a therapist instead?What if Bond and the glamorous Euro muse hes simultaneously protecting and putting in utmost jeopardy booked themselves into a sleepy Airbnb in the countryside and snuggled up with a few good books and a Scrabble board?Would the franchise survive if the producers jettisoned a formula that has been working for them since JFK was in the White House - and reading Ian Fleming in his PJs?Well have to wait and see.In Spectre its business as usual even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision ingeniously choreographed action and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth. The 24th official Bond caper (26th if you care to count the renegade 1967 farce Casino Royale and 1983s belated Sean Connery comeback Never Say Never Again) sticks to the template - and pays homage to it too.Daniel Craig the moody sinewy Brit who was handed his license to kill with 2006s Casino Royale is back - reportedly for the last time - as the MI6 spy. Trim terse and tough he has proved himself the perfect Bond for the millennium and he opens Spectre in virtuoso style snaking through Mexico City crowds in the midst of the Day of the Dead celebration in pursuit of a mysterious assassin.Craig takes to the rooftops with the nimbleness of Astaire and then takes his target down after a wild and woolly helicopter ride that sends thousands of Dia de Muertos revelers running for their lives beneath the gyring aircraft.As is tradition the propulsive prologue gives way to the main title sequence - in this case a ridiculous ballet featuring a giant groping octopus a naked Craig on fire and a bevy of Bond girls in silhouette over which Sam Smith sings ""The Writings on the Wall.""By the time the films climactic set piece comes around the song has proved itself shockinglyly literal Bond returns to London after visits to Rome Tangiers and the alpine precincts of Austria darting through the scorched remains of MI6s HQ (blown up in 2012s Skyfall) where he finds his name graffitied on the corridor walls an arrow pointing the way to. . . .Its hardly necessary to go into the labyrinthine and somewhat labored details of Spectres plot which comes from a screenplay with four names attached and which has been mounted with maestrolike dexterity by Sam Mendes.Suffice to say Bonds Mexico City assassin now has a widow back in Rome. She is played in black veil and a tear in her eye by Monica Bellucci who receives the man who killed her husband with harsh words - and the unzipping of her dress. (Bond has her up against a full-length mirror and Mendes last shot of the clinching couple is of Craigs back and broad shoulders. It looks as though the actor has pressed himself against the glass in a fit of narcissistic ecstasy. Whats Mendes trying to say?)Bond has gone rogue. Theres a move afoot to shut down the double-O program. Worse an unctuous ambitious official code name C (Andrew Scott) has plans to ally Her Majestys intelligence agency with counterparts from eight other nations - a kind of pool approach to espionage. M (Ralph Fiennes) is reluctantly going along with the plan while Q (Ben Whishaw) the agencys gizmo-and-gadget geek and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) Ms assistant are quietly helping Bond as best they can.And he needs help. Hes after the head of SPECTRE the many-tentacled criminal org of epic and evil design and Bond thinks he has found his supervillain in the form of Franz Oberhauser a man whose history it turns out dovetails with Bonds own. As portrayed in characteristic and increasingly caricaturish fashion by Christoph Waltz Oberhauser is seen later in the game sporting a Nehru jacket and stroking a white fluffy cat. Any similarities to Ernst Stavro Blofeld the ur-baddie introduced in 1963s From Russia with Love are purely intentional.At almost 21/2 hours Spectre can drag notably in scenes where it shouldnt such as the big face-off between 007 and Blofeld in an elaborate desert complex. Bond is strapped to a torture chair while his companion Dr. Madeleine Swan ( Blue Is the Warmest Colors LA(c)a Seydoux) looks on understandably unsettled. Shes a psychologist and the daughter of one of SPECTREs lapsed masterminds. (Any parallels between Spectres daughter-of-a-missing-genius-with-villainous-ties and Alicia Vikanders role in Guy Ritchies The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - yes daughter-of-a-missing-genius-with-villainous-ties - is purely um unfortunate.)Spectre gathers many of the strands from the previous three Bonds starring Craig making sense sort of of the nefarious doings of Mads Mikkelsens Le Chiffre in Casino Royale Mathieu Amalrics land-grabbing madman in Quantum of Solace and Javier Bardems cyberterrorist in Skyfall. Craig - if hes good to his word - can now walk away from the role happy in the knowledge that things have come full circle that all the car chases shoot-outs fireballs fierce hand-to-hand combats and amorous assignations have not been for naught.Theyve been for double naught and seven.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea Spectre  (Out of four stars) Directed by Sam Mendes.

Christoph Waltz sleepwalks through an underwritten part as the villain though hulking Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) is more imposing as the chief henchman; his encounters with Bond have an intensity lacking in much of the film.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 04 2015 114PM EST Last updated Thursday Nov. 05 2015 739PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Sam Mendes Written by John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade Jez Butterworth Starring Daniel Craig Christoph Waltz Lea Seydoux Ralph Fiennes Classification PG Year 2015 Country U.K./USA Language English Midway through Spectre the new James Bond movie theres a fight scene in the storeroom of a moving train. Bond has managed to wind a thick rope around the neck of the beefy villain who has been trying to push him out the boxcars open door and somehow that rope is attached to a series of metal beer kegs that are held together by a wire cable. As the opponents thrash about one of the barrels topples over and rolls out the door soon pulling the next one after it. And so a perfect domino effect unfolds until with satisfying inevitability the big bad guy is swept from the train. A detailed look at how Spectre was made (AP Video) A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard Spectre Daniel Craigs fourth outing as Bond and the second directed by Sam Mendes can be deemed a solid success not as darkly stylish as Skyfall but not as stupidly grim as Quantum of Solace either. Craig whose Bond-for-grown-ups has thoroughly reinvigorated the franchise brings a shade more softness to his suffering spy this time out while Mendes repeats much of what he achieved in Skyfall correctly balancing hoary old formula and contemporary updates - if also relying on a rather similar plot that once again turns on personal revenge and traitors inside British Intelligence.This time MI6 now run by Ralph Fienness increasingly downtrodden M is facing a hostile takeover by MI5. Its run by C (the suitably obnoxious Andrew Scott) a grasping young bureaucrat who is convinced that global digital surveillance from headquarters rather than the human agent in the field is the way of the future. Supported by the very welcome return of Ben Whishaws nerdy Q and Naomie Harriss bold Moneypenny Fiennes and the crew at headquarters have this contemporary angle nicely in hand.Over on the old-fashioned side Bond is busy fulfilling a posthumous assignment from the former M - youll remember that was Judi Dench; appearing briefly here on a video - assassinating an Italian crime boss in the movies brilliant opening sequence set in the middle of a garish Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City.C closes the 007 program and calls Bond back to headquarters but instead the agent goes off the radar (or in this instance gets Q to ignore the signals from a nifty new tracking device he can introduce directly into an agents blood). He follows the dead mans widow to Rome and the annual general meeting of an international crime syndicate - the Spectre of the title. That somehow leads him to a dying turncoat in Austria who sends him to his equally endangered daughter a doctor whose idea of a great hiding place is a ritzy private clinic located in a glass box on top of a mountain. When the bad guys follow Bond there a furious Alpine chase scene featuring a plane and several SUVs ensues.Of course Bond pairs off with the beautiful Dr. Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) and the two eventually confront the mastermind behind the crime syndicate in his hideaway reached by a train ride through the Sahara. Played with admirable restraint by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz he turns out to be a new and improved version of a character familiar to Bond fans and a man equally convinced that government surveillance will ensure security - or insecurity - the world over. But who needs Edward Snowden when you have Bond?None of this makes much sense and a backstory about the villains long personal connection to Bond is particularly weak but when did the global takeover plans of any megalomaniacal Bond enemy make sense? If Fienness grimly defeated M or Craigs subtly compassionate Bond hint at a deeper emotional universe the multiple writers credited on this script are largely unacquainted with its existence. Theres only so much updating you can do.On that score dont give Mendes much credit for casting the 51-year-old Monica Bellucci as the crime bosss widow; she may be an age-appropriate interest for Bond but she is only onscreen for a few minutes and his sexual approach to her as though the only way he can talk to any woman is with his lips but centimetres from hers comes across mainly as creepy. Neither Moneypenny - theres a boyfriend in her bed when Bond calls - nor Dr. Swann whose skepticism is strongly rendered by Seydoux are running to meet those lips which is a smarter way to bury the franchises notorious sexism.In the films final moments it appears that Bond is even ready to give up his licence to kill to keep this intriguing new love interest. Thats bad news for her if you consider that Craig is signed for a fifth Bond flick the good Dr. Swann will have to be disappeared some time between now and the first few minutes of the next movie.Bond retiring from MI6 to take up security consulting while raising a couple of kids with his doctor wife in a garden suburb? Thats not the way the barrels roll.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Well Mr. Bond we meet again. Youre looking pooped. Following the thrilling 50th-anniversary celebration of the James Bond saga in ""Skyfall"" Daniel Craig and director Sam Mendes reunite to advance the slam-bang secret agents escapades. Unfortunately this mission is a misfiring collection of drooping plot lines overworked action sequences and formulaic fan-service homages to 007 adventures gone by. Rather than delivering a thrilling deadly Bond ""Spectre"" leaves viewers shaken not stirred. ""Youre like a kite dancing in a hurricane Mr. Bond"" one of his adversaries declares. That sums up the film itself checking formulaic moments off the to-do list but never following a solid course of its own. The excellent production values and lavish cinematography dress up the film like Bonds impeccable white tuxedo but offer it nowhere to go. The story line follows the same path the series has walked since its audacious reboot 10 years ago when ""Casino Royale"" began moving it beyond juvenilia and toward serious maturity. As in its first three entries this new-age Bond is battling a cadre of international villains and personal demons side by side. It begins with a thrilling opening. A seemingly uncut long shot follows Craig through a surging surrealist Mexico City pageant celebrating the Day of the Dead. Arriving at the upper-level hotel bedroom of his lovely female companion he peels off his skeleton mask but has business in mind she was not expecting. Slipping out her window he races over the tops of nearby buildings at a fast casual pace and soon is battling terrorists through gunshots fisticuffs and a nonstop brawl aboard their getaway helicopter. ""Spectre"" delivers the sort of over-the-top excitement the franchise provides at its best as the chopper spirals through loop-the-loops over the skyline. Unfortunately it is just the beginning of the films tailspin descent plummeting to superficial stereotypes. There are some high cards in the films hand. The script digs into Bonds relevance in a world of post-Snowden computerized spycraft making a top antagonist of a tech-slick British bureaucrat (Andrew Smith ""Sherlocks"" arch enemy Moriarty) aiming to terminate the outmoded double-0 program that gave Bond his license to kill. Spectre 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some disturbing images sensuality and language. But through the 148-minute running time the four-man screenwriting teams collaborative efforts feel like the labyrinthine prose on a Mad Libs word game. Their man-on-a-mission story is rich enough in mayhem but short on focus. Characters appear and vanish without explanation as veterans of earlier installments return and the sublime Monica Bellucci (the most mature Bond lover ever seducing 007 at age 51) disappears in a mere cameo. Plot holes grow to the size of the meteorite chasm that houses the top villains luxurious secret headquarters. And who is the megalomaniac planet-strangling supervillain? Christoph Waltz so compelling as mustache-twirling evil personified in ""Inglourious Basterds."" But here his clutches are not too frightening. Waltz offers a performance so underplayed that it is forgettable scene by scene. While the usually magnetic Waltz can be brilliant in gentleman sadist roles his characters identity and motivations are so personal that goals of world domination seem like the wrong option. A course of emotion-focused therapy would better deal with his aggravating issues. Among the supporting cast only the romantic resonances of Lea Seydouxs bittersweet performance as Craigs beautiful feminine foil feels like more than a kiss-off. The films off-into-the-distance conclusion carries the sense of a swan song for the reboot that ""Casino Royale"" launched a decade ago. Its tone fits the recent public hints from Craig that he is done with playing Bond. Watching this extravagant collection of small wonders makes the stars wish to say farewell understandable. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Winds light and variable. Updated July 30 2016  153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Review Spectre doesnt reach heights of Skyfall By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Nov 5 2015 (...) James Bond (Daniel Craig) always has his priorities straight. So its not surprising when he cuts short a romantic moment in a hotel room to pursue his mission killing the latest in a series of bad guys.But things dont quite go according to plan and its not long before Bond is struggling to keep a helicopter aloft as it hovers over Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico City. Also in the chopper are his target whom he has yet to kill and the pilot. Both of course would love to terminate the British spy.Theres never much doubt that the resourceful 007 will find some way out of this dilemma. What matters is how he does it. His formidable skills however do not exempt him from the wrath of his immediate superior M (Ralph Fiennes). M is concerned about the future of their spy agency which is under the thumb of the untrustworthy Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott) also known as C.As usual Bond has no interest in bureaucratic matters. With the help of the reluctant Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) hes determined to save the world from yet another egotistical madman (Christoph Waltz).""Skyfall"" (2012) was so flat-out wonderful that expectations for ""Spectre"" were perhaps unreasonably high. Both films were directed by Sam Mendes (""Revolutionary Road"") who has a sure feel for the spy franchises requirements. Unfortunately despite its thrilling action and offhand wit ""Spectre"" is overlong and often mind-bogglingly illogical -- even by Bond-film standards. Craig who has gone public with his displeasure about playing 007 is still fun to watch. Ben Whishaw (as the ingenious Q) and Naomie Harris (as the pragmatic Moneypenny) make the most of their bolstered roles and Fiennes brings quiet authority to M.But two-time Oscar winner Waltz is oddly unmemorable. And Seydoux made more of an impression with less screen time in ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol."" ""Spectre"" isnt bad -- just slightly disappointing.What ""Spectre""  Three stars out of four  Run time 228  Rating PG-13  Content Intense action and violence disturbing images sensuality language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Hot List We rank the 7 greatest James Bond villains Nov 5 2015 (...)

Yet the bloat is forgivable and even hugely enjoyable.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 5 2015SpectreStarring Daniel Craig Ralph Fiennes Lea Seydoux Christoph Waltz Andrew Scott Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris. Directed by Sam Mendes. At GTA theatres. 148 minutes. PG""Time flies"" someone says in Spectre the 24th James Bond adventure but thats a debatable assertion.With a derivative plot a ho-hum villain and reveals that dont shock plus a franchise-record running time of 148 minutes the clock doesnt soar. An editor as ruthless as Daniel Craigs Bond was needed.Article Continued BelowYet the bloat is forgivable and even hugely enjoyable. This is Bond James Bond and everyone expects and wants the shaken-not-stirred rituals that Craig still does so well even as he hints this fourth time holding the licence to kill may be his last. Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in Spectre.  (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures/EON)  Spectre lacks the sinister grace of Skyfall his previous teaming with director Sam Mendes and also the novelty of Casino Royale his series debut. (Lets not talk about the unfortunate Quantum of Solace.)What it does have is more than enough action set pieces to satisfy thrill seekers as Bond once again zips across the globe like the planets coolest tourist. Hes seeking to finally suss the whos and whats of the SPECTRE terror group that 007 and MI6 have been chasing for half a century.The opening sequence set in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead celebrations wherein Bond simultaneously plans both an assassination and a conquest is one of the best in the canons history. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar) makes his tracking shot seem like a character unto itself. His mastery of light and lens is almost as good as Skyfalls Roger Deakins.Mendes and the Spectre writing team of John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth make callbacks not only to the other three Craig 007 films but to the 53-year-old series as a whole. Bond fans will enjoy playing spot the reference with shout-outs including the From Russia With Love train fight and an alpine chase from innumerable 007 pictures.Such blasts from the past risk comparisons to a cat-stroking Austin Powers parody. But its all done with great affection and a sense of humour often missing from the Craig episodes. Excellent use is also made of Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) M (Ralph Fiennes) and Q (Ben Whishaw) characters who normally are treated as little more than walk-ons. Everything comes together so well its hard not to get caught up in the moment as so many of Bonds women do. On that note let us count the ways of Bonds loves. Lea Seydoux makes for a fetching Dr. Madeleine Swann a psychologist with a plot-turning past who uses her brains as well as her charms to keep James on his toes. Monica Bellucci alas barely gets a chance to live up to her advance billing as an age-appropriate Bond Girl. She has minimal screen time in her role as a Roman mobsters widow turned bedroom informant.Theres similar good and bad news regarding the villains Dave Bautistas bone-snapping Hinx recalls the tenacity of Jaws a favourite Bond baddie; but Christoph Waltzs puppet master Oberhauser is one of the weakest creeps ever a rerun of the smirking sociopath hes been playing since Inglourious Basterds. Fortunately Andrew Scott from TVs Sherlock makes for one glorious bastard in the role of ""C"" the uber-bureaucrat who wants to dismantle the ""00"" program and retire Bond and M. He plans to turn global security over to a multinational surveillance system called ""Nine Eyes"" a yawn-worthy threat as dumb as it is dull.What pulls together the storys many tentacles is the unflappable Craig a less-is-more actor who has evolved his Bond from the ""blunt instrument"" of Casino Royale into the ""good man"" of Spectre.His 007 is a good guy indeed even if he still has serious issues with women authority and the bottle. If this really is Craigs last hurrah as Bond hes going out in grand style but I suspect his statements on this topic are more negotiation than declaration. Why should we believe an actor who is so good at making us embrace fantasy?Which 007 is 1?Read more about James BondThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It features Daniel Craig in his fourth performance as James Bond and tells the story of Bonds first encounter with the global criminal organization Spectre. (Columbia Pictures) Since the advent of modern-day action heroes Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt James Bonds most challenging assignment has been to stay relevant. ""Spectre"" the 24th film in the 53-year-old franchise finds the superannuated spy fighting that battle more strenuously than ever as British intelligence threatens to demolish the double-0 program in favor of a worldwide surveillance system powered by drones and Big Data. Daniel Craig -- who played Bond in the impressive ""Casino Royale"" the incomprehensible ""Quantum of Solace"" and the stylishly moody ""Skyfall"" -- pads through ""Spectre"" with his usual practiced nonchalance and petulant pooched-out pout. After a lavishly staged opening sequence -- featuring a bravura tracking shot snaking through a gorgeous Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City -- the film reverts to expected form with Bond outrunning obsolescence with unerring timing always-perfect aim and a flawlessly pressed dinner jacket that appears magically as needed. When the opening scene ultimately ends in a riot of gunfire an exploding building and a fistfight aboard a careening helicopter -- culminating in a risibly pseudo-sexy credit sequence featuring Sam Smith listening to himself far too attentively -- it seems clear that ""Spectre"" is going to dive into Bonds potential for high camp with all the macho wish fulfillment and winking innuendo it can muster. [Some of the greatest most important and silliest Bond cars] Daniel Craig stars as James Bond in the 24th installment of the 007 movie franchise. (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures) Christoph Waltz left plays down his usual over-eager persona as the man out to get James Bond while Lea Seydoux plays a psychologist -- and Bonds latest love interest. (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures) Sadly that promise of fun is quickly abandoned as soon as Bond sets off on a journey that will lead him from Mexico back to London where the new M (Ralph Fiennes) is squabbling with C (Andrew Scott) about MI6s coming merger with MI5. Bond is supposed to be on hiatus but he finagles some gadgetry from Q (Ben Whishaw) and is soon on his way to Rome Austria Tangier and beyond on the trail of a mysterious figure called the Pale King and ever-alert to possibilities for romance and looking cool under pressure. ""Spectre"" which has been directed by Sam Mendes from a script by several writers knows just what marks to hit but it obeys the conventions of the series so faithfully that it begins to feel rote. All of the psychological depth and austere visual beauty of ""Skyfall"" here has been over-processed into easily digestible chunks of story delivered by way of windy explanatory speeches clumsy foreshadowing and stunts that feel both perfunctory and increasingly absurd. What ""Spectre"" lacks in realism it makes up for in ugly digital photography (especially in low-light situations) and retrograde sexual politics. Lea Seydoux who plays Bonds love interest may want to consult with ""Mission Impossibles"" Rebecca Ferguson for tips on how to find scripts that bring a female supporting role into the 21st century without losing an ounce of seductive allure. (Let us pause to lament the absence of the great Judi Dench whose flinty intelligence was crucial to lending recent Bond films class they might not have otherwise deserved.) Craig has made public statements recently about not wanting to play Bond again and if ""Spectre"" is any indication he has already taken early retirement. He makes for a weirdly dyspeptic figure throughout the sloggy 2  1/2 -hour run time looking like a man going through the motions in an exceptionally smart wardrobe of bespoke outerwear. To his credit Christoph Waltz plays down his usual grinning over-eager bad-guy persona as the megalomaniacal cat to Bonds cagey resourceful mouse. But a late-game Big Reveal about his character feels desperate and alert viewers will see his ""secret"" henchman whistling down Main Street with a top hat cane and white carnation. This is a canon that has always danced a fine line between sophistication and playfulness a balance that ""Spectre"" strikes by affecting a strangely dour self-serious air. We dont expect a James Bond film to be deep but at least we should be dazzled by the seductive gloss of its surfaces. Aside from that stunning opening sequence this installment feels overcompensating and dutiful. By the time -- finally -- that 007 orchestrates a Grand Guignol climax that plays out like pre-ordained clockwork the viewer might be forgiven for thinking that this particular program cant be abolished soon enough. The most enduring blessing of the Bond franchise has always been its embrace of reinvention. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of action and violence some disturbing images sensuality and obscenity. 148 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Spectre the 24th installment in the interminable James Bond franchise is Im sorry to say one of the least interesting and most preposterous chapters in 007 history. Daniel Craig who joined the series in Casino Royale is back in the drivers seat of the old Aston-Martin and Sam Mendes takes up the directorial reigns again where his billion-dollar box office bonanza Skyfall left off promising new gimmicks girls glossy global locations exploding watches overhauled high-speed chases backbone-paralyzing overtime (almost two and a half hours) and mobs of sinister ruthless killers hell-bent on destroying the worlds most indestructible secret agent. The trouble is weve seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers. SPECTRE  (2/4 stars) Written by John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth Directed by Sam Mendes Starring Daniel Craig Christoph Waltz and Ralph Fiennes Running time 148 min. It opens during the lavish carnival celebrating the Day of the Dead in Mexico City with Bond stealing across roof tops above the street of skeletons while an entire building collapses beneath him killing everyone south of the border except the drug cartels. Bond escapes in a helicopter with no pilot but never fear--007 can do anything. He just takes over the controls and flies it himself. Next stop is Rome followed by the Austrian Alps Morocco and a satellite in the middle of a meteorite crater in the Sahara called ""Spectre"" (last encountered in Diamonds Are Forever) that is home to a criminal surveillance network dedicated to controlling the world in the digital age. Nothing in the cheesy plot makes any sense but it serves as an elaborate way to introduce a new psychopathic villain named Franz Oberhauser played with cunning relish by the great scene-stealer Christoph Walz. Stroking a white cat while his robot torture machine drives hypodermic needles through Bonds brain Mr. Walz as the latest in a lethal line of memorable wackos some of whom return for a second go-around here is a fawning visionary who commands the kind of questionable attention that distracts from Mr. Craigs stoicism. When he enters the picture the plot thickens and the momentum picks up but this doesnt happen until the last half-hour following too much tedium to stay awake. With none of Sean Connerys humorous dialogue or Roger Moores self-amused winks at the camera he remains poker faced from start to finish his beefcake days emerging from the surf in an X-rated black Speedo gone with the rest of the fun. Gone too is his bad-boy image leaving Daniel Craig looking as bored in the digital age as all of the other technology nerds you see everywhere these days stupidly thumbing their devices in the direction of oblivion. Judi Denchs M is dead robbing the series of badly needed emotional brio and Ralph Fiennes is a poor replacement. Ben Whishaw is wasted as the computer-savvy Q. Miss Moneypenny is now a pretty office worker (Naomie Harris) who resists the 007 charm without leaving her desk. The frisky Bond ladies no longer disrobe leaving luscious Monica Bellucci and brainy Lea Seydoux reduced to the status of walk-ons. Worst of all what is a James Bond film without a wrenching stirring and memorable theme song? This one features a rotten nightmare screeched in an ugly falsetto by Sam Smith called ""Writings On the Wall"" which might ironically if this series does not improve serve as a prediction of the future. In all fairness Mr. Mendes stages a few supersonic chases on water snow and in the empty streets of Rome where nothing moves resulting in a ""been there seen that"" effect. Rome without motorcycles and gas fumes should tell you something about how much Ian Flemings popular Bond stories have degenerated into little more than contrived formulaic fairy tales. The only thing pedestrian you see in Spectre is the script.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 748pm on Wednesday Nov. 04 2015 Wednesday Nov. 04 2015 Wednesday Nov. 04 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Shaken? Stirred? The trouble with Spectre the latest James Bond action extravaganza is that its neither. All the expected ingredients are there -- the exotic locales the beautiful women the revving sports cars the super villain the cool hero never breaking a sweat the ""Bond James Bond"" -- but they never distill into a whole greater than the sum of their predictable parts.Whereas such predecessors as Skyfall and Casino Royale could still make these elements dazzle the only occasionally entertaining Spectre feels inert by comparison.It doesnt start out that way. In fact the opening -- a tracking shot through a massive Day of the Dead festival in the heart of Mexico City where everyone is decked out in elaborate skeleton costumes -- is an immediately fascinating and dizzying gateway into the British spys latest adventure. That it culminates with mid-air fisticuffs in a careening helicopter threatening to crash land into the huge crowd gathered at Mexico Citys famous Zocalo public square isnt bad either. This is director Sam Mendes who also did Skyfall at his best. But as the story settles in Spectre becomes increasingly more routine even if its full of enough nods to previous Bond films to create a connected universe of sorts that will make the enthusiasts happy.This time around Bond (Daniel Craig) has gone off on his own without the permission of his superior M (Ralph Fiennes) to find who or what is behind a series of bombings. Theres also the little matter of the death of the original M (Judi Dench).Everything goes back to the evil global enterprise Spectre which Bond fans will recognize from previous incarnations of the franchise. As with contemporary comic-book blockbusters the 007 movies now have back story.Spectres overlord is Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) a re-imagined figure that longtime Bond fans will recognize a man who wants to crush everything that Bond holds dear.Meanwhile back at HQ the ""00"" spy program is being dismantled as a new head of British intelligence C (Andrew Scott) wants to merge all the spy programs under the guise of efficiency. So our hero may find himself being downsized out of the spy business.Bonds love interest is Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux Blue Is the Warmest Color) though theres actually more chemistry with the older Lucia (Monica Bellucci The Sorcerers Apprentice). Along the way Bond is assisted by his always loyal crew of Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris).Through it all are the requisite chases and techno high jinks but little of it feels fresh or inspired. In a world where the latest ""Mission Impossible"" movie can still pull off an action surprise Spectre -- which feels every one of its 148 minutes -- just seems late to the party. Most disappointing is Waltz a two-time Oscar winner who makes little impression as the bad guy and falls far short of what Javier Bardem was able to bring to his take on a villain in Skyfall. Craig who in interviews has made noises that hes through playing Bond still has his beefy physical presence but he just seems mostly apathetic.Then theres the forgettable Sam Smith theme song Writings on the Wall.Shaken or stirred?

"Spectre (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Spectre (PG-13) Daniel Craig returns in his fourth - and possibly last - outing as James Bond. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/4/2015 Editor rating 2 Spectre is stylish and sleek and a dud. The movie kicks off with the best (or at least the biggest) prologue of all the 007 pictures A fight aboard a helicopter doing barrel rolls above the crowd at a Day of the Dead procession in Mexico City. The sequence starts with a showstopping five-minute shot following James Bond (Daniel Craig) as he walks through the street and into a hotel climbs out a balcony and scampers along rooftops to carry out an assassination. Then the real craziness starts. The opening is exciting outrageous and a cheeky showcase of cinematic craftsmanship. So why is the rest of the movie so dull? Spectre which is rumored to be Craigs last outing as Bond (this is his fourth time playing the character and the weariness shows) has an aura of finality to it as well as a perfunctory lets-get-this-over-with feel. The story is tangled and complicated but not in a clever or revelatory way Its needlessly obtuse like a first draft in dire need of tightening. The opening credits which are accompanied by Sam Smiths alley-cat caterwauling feature visual callbacks to the previous three pictures (Casino Royale Quantum of Solace and Skyfall) the first indication that Spectre is going to tie into all of Craigs Bonds. But the connections turn out to be meaningless -- you could have excised them from the movie and not lost a thing. The first half of the bloated running time (148 minutes) is wasted on needlessly prolonged scenes and extraneous characters (Monica Bellucci pops up briefly as a widow whose name could have been Sultry Exposition). Here is a Bond movie that makes you long for the cheesy preposterous pleasures of the crummy Moonraker Yes it was stupid but it was also irreverent and fun two things Spectre is not. The movie has its moments. A brutal fistfight between Bond and a hulking baddie (pro wrestler Dave Bautista) aboard a speeding train is amusing and cleverly staged and a well-edited car chase through the streets of Rome conveys a sense of speed and a tactile realism that were absent in Furious 7. The chase embodies the kinetic appeal of action movies done right. After shooting Skyfall digitally returning director Sam Mendes opted to go back to 35mm film and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Interstellar Her) gives the images a beautiful warm amber glow. There is also a whopper of an explosion that flattens an entire facility with one big boom that once again proves CGI fireballs will never be as cool as the real thing. But even though Spectres technical aspects are impeccable theyre at the service of a tired movie that succumbs to the usual formulas which is particularly disappointing after Skyfalls shattering of the traditional 007 template. Were back to a Bond girl (Blue Is the Warmest Colors Lea Seydoux surprisingly drab here) who exists primarily to be rescued; a cackling maniacal villain hellbent on world domination (Christoph Waltz still channeling his Oscar-winning Inglourious Basterds shtick); a scene in which a captured Bond is tortured with an amusingly elaborate device that serves no other discernible purpose; and a random gadget courtesy of the genial Q (Ben Whishaw) that turns out to be exactly the thing Bond needs to get out of a predicament. Familiarity is not without its pleasures. But Spectre is so confused and inert that Craig cant even sell the signature ""Bond. James Bond"" and ""Shaken not stirred"" lines. Here they come across as obligations sops to the same hardcore fans who will savor the films shout-outs to previous entries in the franchise. By the time Spectre finally gets cooking with Bond and his team (which includes Ralph Fiennes as M and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny leaving the office to join him in the field) the movie has worn out its welcome and youre itching to go home. So apparently is Craig. Thanks for the memories. Now bring on the next 007. Cast Daniel Craig Lea Seydoux Christoph Waltz Naomie Harris Ben Whishaw Ralph Fiennes Monica Bellucci Dave Bautista.

"Review Spectre the best Daniel Craig Bond film since Casino Royale - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Spectre the best Daniel Craig Bond film since Casino RoyaleBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 11/04/2015 115756 AM PSTUpdated 11/04/2015 050207 PM PST Related StoriesNov 4How does James Bond franchise endure against all odds?""Spectre"" the best Daniel Craig Bond film since ""Casino Royale"" gives two strong hints as to whether Craig will return for a fifth turn as Ian Flemings British superspy.And of course the two hints directly contradict one another.The best evidence that Craig is done is the films storyline which ties up loose ends from the first three Craig movies and puts a nice bow on it at films end. We leave the theater knowing much more Bond background than we did going in including whats behind certain villains and events of the previous movies and why so much of what has happened is not just spy business but very personal to Bond. Daniel Craig as James Bond in Spectre. (Jonathan Olley/MGM/Danjaq LLC/Columbia Pictures) ( Jonathan Olley/MGM/Danjaq LLC/Co ) The equally solid evidence suggesting Craig will return is that ""Spectre"" leaves a big unresolved issue. Why would they do that if its time to reboot the series?Either way despite having the countenance of a wolf about to strike Craig finally looks like hes having fun this time -- and not in a Roger Moore self-spoofing kind of way. Director Sam Mendes gives him rein to indulge himself as the womanizing violent always-in-action quip-dropping Bond like never before. The story picks up not long after the events of ""Skyfall"" with Bond following a cryptic message seemingly from the grave to a Mexico City in full Day of the Dead celebratory mode -- the kind of exotic mood-setting atmosphere that should never be an underappreciated asset in a Bond film. Here Bond uncovers a massive terrorist plot and in the process manages to destroy a couple of square miles of buildings. Advertisement He eventually finds his way to Rome where he discovers Spectre a worldwide criminal undertaking headed by Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz in an understated performance thats a bit disappointing). He also discovers the beautiful Lucia (Monica Bellucci whose involvement is surprisingly brief) the widow of a top Spectre enforcer. Lucia is one of a few characters Mendes decided not to flesh out and she ends up being little more than an excuse for Bond to act like Bond. When Bond learns that the villainous Mr. White (Jesper Christensen from ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"") is connected to Spectre he tracks him to an icy cabin in Austria. That also leads him to Whites daughter the intelligent and beautiful (duh) Madeleine Swan (a magnetic Lea Seydoux) with whom he teams (of course) to find Oberhauser.Meanwhile back in London M (Ralph Fiennes) is losing his battle with Britains new head of national security Max Denbigh (a detestable Andrew Scott) who wants to dismantle the Double O spy program in favor of buying drones and spy satellites. He also wants to merge Britains intelligence gathering with eight other nations essentially creating one super agency keeping its collective eye on the world.You can imagine how Bond feels about that.The flip side to not spending more time with such intriguing characters as Lucia and Spectre enforcer Hinx (we barely got to know ya Dave Bautista) is enjoying expanded roles for Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) both of whom get out of the office and into the action as Bonds support team. Qs expanded role gives Craig a much-needed comic foil as well as fulfilling the 21st-century thriller requirement of having a computer hacker along just in case theres a doomsday countdown that needs averting.After a twist that wouldve been surprising had ""Spectre"" not dropped so many clues along the way Mendes still manages to deliver what many Bond films dont get an ending that feels like a real ending instead of a pause in the storyline.Whether Craig has another Bond chapter in him or producers are ready to move on with another actor one thing is clear The 007 franchise is in a much better place than when Craig first appeared as Bond in 2006.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.SPECTRE    Rating PG-13 (intense action and violence disturbing images sensuality and language)Cast Daniel Craig Christoph Waltz Ralph Fiennes Lea Seydoux Monica Bellucci Ben Whishaw Director Sam MendesRunning time 2 hours 30 minutesOpens In wide release Nov. 6Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Review The Spectre of burnout hovers over latest Bond film - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Spectre of burnout hovers over latest Bond film Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Its been 53 years since the first James Bond film ""Dr. No"" arrived in theaters and so many have followed in its wake that if you watched all of them back to back without a break it would take two full days of your life. So if ""Spectre"" the 24th and latest Bond extravaganza comes off as exhausted and uninspired -- and it does -- its not without cause.The Bond films canny masterminds at Eon Productions are well aware that this kind of burnout is a possibility with a series this venerable which is why there are frequent changes of both star (the current Bond Daniel Craig is the sixth theyve hired) and director. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story But like a baseball team leaving its starting pitcher in a World Series game too long (no names please) the folks at Eon went to the well once too often with both Craig (""Spectre"" is his fourth Bond) and director Sam Mendes doing his second.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Not even the addition of another writer (Jez Butterworth) to the team of John Logan plus Neal Purvis and Robert Wade which wrote the previous stronger ""Skyfall"" can shake the lassitude that hangs over a production with a budget thats been estimated in the 250-million to 300-million range.Yes some of the individual stunts and action set pieces temporarily hold our interest -- at that cost theyd better -- but the story itself is not convincing on its own terms playing like a series of boxes (Bond asking for a martini shaken not stirred) that need to be checked off and forgotten. Stephanie Sigman in Spectre 5 things to know about new Bond girl Oliver Gettell The name is Sigman Stephanie Sigman. Although she may not have the name recognition of a certain secret agent the 28-year-old Mexican actress certainly saw her profile raised Tuesday when the filmmakers behind the upcoming James Bond adventure ""Spectre"" announced her addition to the cast. Here... The name is Sigman Stephanie Sigman. Although she may not have the name recognition of a certain secret agent the 28-year-old Mexican actress certainly saw her profile raised Tuesday when the filmmakers behind the upcoming James Bond adventure ""Spectre"" announced her addition to the cast. Here... (Oliver Gettell) Part of the problem is that Craig a potent actor whose resume includes Steven Spielbergs ""Munich"" and playing the poet Ted Hughes in ""Sylvia"" seems to be feeling increasingly strait-jacketed as Bond. When an actor tells a journalist as Craig told Time Out London that hed rather ""break this glass and slash my wrists"" than play Bond one more time that is not a good sign.When Craig took on the role in 2006s ""Casino Royale"" his rougher-edged less-flippant Bond felt like a breath of fresh air but almost a decade later its gone stale. Craigs expression is so unchanging it might as well be chiseled out of stone and his emotionally uninvolved performance is similarly lacking in nuance. In theory director Mendes whose previous films include the Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" could have done something about this but he may have been too busy worrying about the fearsome logistics of an enormous production that went to Mexico City Rome Austria and Morocco as well as London to be able expend much time on anything else. Spectre trailer Watch the final trailer for ""Spectre."" Watch the final trailer for ""Spectre."" See more videos Mexico City is where ""Spectre"" opens on a Day of the Dead celebration so elaborate that it took 3 1/2 hours every shooting day to get the crowd of more than 1500 extras prepared.Though he turns out to be there unofficially Bond is busy in Mexico City stopping a terrorist plot avoiding getting crushed by a collapsing building commandeering a careening helicopter and most important getting hold of an important ring.That metal band with a symbol of a malignant-looking octopus on it turns out to be the key to the rest of the plot. Its the symbol for Spectre an organization that simply reeks of evil and must be stopped if humanity has any chance to survive and prosper.Back home in London Bond has other problems to deal with. His boss M (Ralph Fiennes) is irked at his Mexican adventure (""I was taking some overdue holiday"" is the agents cheeky reply) and Ms new boss Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott) the head of the Center for National Security and a worshiper at the altar of 24/7 surveillance has the temerity to suggest that the double-0 program may be obsolete.

Monday brought some notable news in the world of James Bond the kind that sends the blog world into a tizzy.

(Steven Zeitchik) Nothing daunted Bond calls on the help of old comrades Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) who using the inevitable ""cutting edge nano-technology"" injects Agent 007 with ""smart blood"" that means he can be tracked down anywhere should he get into trouble which is likely.Thus empowered on his quest to stop Spectre Bond encounters a number of folks including a not-so-grieving widow (Monica Bellucci) a fellow assassin (Jesper Christensen) and Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) a mysterious individual with unexpected links to Bonds past.Bond also meets up with the assassins stunning daughter Madeleine Swann (fine French actress Lea Seydoux). Though actual chemistry between the two actors is hard to see ""Spectre"" insists they fall madly in love.

Entertainment Spectre Review Daniel Craigs New James Bond Thriller ""Lands With a Thud"" Gets 2 Out of 4 Stars November 4 2015  310 PM By Mara Reinstein Daniel Craigs latest James Bond action thriller Spectre ""lands with a thud"" writes Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein Credit Jonathan Olley/Columbia Pictures In theaters Friday Nov. 6 2 stars (out of 4 stars) James Bond isnt just a name. Since 1962 its been a primo luxury brand that signifies world-class glamour cheeky British humor and spectacular thrills. Theres a difference between a female love interest and a Bond Girl; same for a soundtrack song versus a Bond Theme. The assembly parts may change but the connotations do not. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Alas you wont find much of the above in an installment that disappoints by virtue of its total roteness. Not nearly as exhilarating as 2012s Skyfall or as horrid as 2008s Quantum of Solace it just sort of hangs there. Like a License to Chill. And though the film is poised to rake at the box office it wont leave you shaken or stirred. It starts off with such promise too. In a high-flying opener that takes place during the Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico City dashing Agent 007 (Daniel Craig) effortlessly glides off a crumbling roof and maneuvers a crashing helicopter without tearing a single hole in his tailored suit. After a sensual title sequence (set to Sam Smiths unmemorable ""Writings On the Wall"") the convoluted narrative lands with a thud. PHOTOS Stars rewear iconic costumes Bond is now on the outs with his organization. But he sneaks off from London to Rome anyway -- via a state-of-the-art Aston Martin -- to track down the origins of a man he killed during the Day of the Dead. The mans widow (Monica Bellucci in a throwaway role) tips him off to a meeting of a shady crime syndicate called Spectre. Or maybe its SPECTRE. Either way these bad guys want to launch a surveillance network and all its members wear a ring engraved with an octopus. He soon encounters lead foe Franz Oberhauser (sinister villain extraordinaire Christoph Waltz) who spends his downtime in a meteor crater and rueing about a lost childhood. It gets weirder After the two finally have their tete-a-tete Franz straps Bond in a chair thats hooked up to an elaborate machine and drills into his brain to remove his memories. Its a peculiar scene ripe for spoofing in a future Austin Powers movie. (Speaking of Powers Franzs true identity -- this is a mild spoiler -- is Dr. Evil-esque.) Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux in Spectre Jonathan Olley/Columbia Pictures PHOTOS Movie hunks Wheres the freshness here? Even the No. 2 plot about the double-0 agency is a leftover from this summers Mission Impossible film. Once again a bigwig (Agent C in this case) wants to dismantle the organization because of its expensive headache-inducing overhead. Drones can do the same job and they dont crash expensive cars in the river. Ben Whishaws delightful Q is the equivalent of Simon Peggs Benji as both lanky British characters provide covert technical assistance to the gone-rogue hero as well as much-needed comic relief. Yes were in the information age. The threat of drone warfare is timely blah blah. But in a James Bond movie technological power does not make for an intriguing enemy. The idea of it lacks vitality not to mention any sort of emotional heft. PHOTOS Hot Brits The dry story might pass muster if the franchises hallmarks went down as smooth as a martini. Yet the action sequences are uninspired and too familiar. We know the flashy car chase is inevitable and sure enough Bond and Franzs henchman ride through the empty streets of Rome. Theres an endless shoot-out on a train (shades of Skyfall). And while the opening crashing-helicopter scene is a knockout director Sam Mendes tests his audiences goodwill with a second helicopter-in-peril sequence two hours later Meanwhile Bonds cipher of a romantic foil (Lea Seydoux) the daughter of an assassin shares scant chemistry with the hero. When she tells him that shes not interested in a liaison you believe her. This couple may both possess impressively high cheekbones and Euro-coolness but they dont bring the heat. Maybe she can sense the weariness behind those blue eyes In Craigs fourth outing his restlessness in the role is evident. Hes never been more stoic or dry -- a waiter that serves him a protein enzyme-enhanced drink pisses him off If he wants out hes not doing an impressive job of hiding it. Blah. Very blah.

USA TODAYDaniel Craig stars as James Bond in Spectre.(Photo Jonathan Olley)The cliched ghosts of James Bond past haunt Spectre an action adventure whose biggest failure is looking back on 007s own success.Never coming close to the style or substance of 2012s previous installment Skyfall Daniel Craigs fourth turn as the superspy isnt his worst -- Quantum of Solace still has that ignominious lowlight -- and he and director Sam Mendes remain a dynamic duo for the franchise. As much as Spectre (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday nationwide) flirts with breaking from tradition though it leans heavily to its detriment on large-scale set pieces with vehicles and explosions aplenty gorgeous women and dastardly villains hardcore Bond fans expect.Mendes carries over the drama of Skyfall right from the start of Spectre with Bond on a rogue mission to Mexico to track down an assassin. His boss M (Ralph Fiennes) is none too pleased with him creating an international incident since a government bureaucrat (Andrew Scott) is trying to shut down the ""double-0"" program of secret agents in favor of a nifty intelligence collective using drones and surveillance.Bond however doesnt have time for those shenanigans. He finds that his own past is connected to a mysterious ring with a small octopus symbol on it and in Rome he discovers the secretive roundtable of terrorists known as SPECTRE. Christoph Waltz turns the evil up to 11 for Franz Oberhauser the groups leader who has a surprise in store for Bond at his Moroccan headquarters -- but only after 007 meets Austrian doctor Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) a love interest and traveling companion who hangs with the suave spy while Bond takes out baddies in the Alps on a train and back in jolly old England before the explosive climax.USA TODAYOld Bond meets new in SpectreMendes again brings bona fide skill and confidence to the Bond director chair. And because of that the Spectre visuals are a sumptuous lot from the trippy opening credits (always a Bond highlight but these are some of the best) to 007 doing business in Day of the Dead wear to the ruined London government building where his fate is seemingly written on the wall.Similarly Craig continues his fine take on the legendary icon of books and movies. His Bond lacks the polish of Roger Moores and Pierce Brosnans versions and for the better. Seydouxs Swann is a strong female counterpoint to his bruising ways but their romantic chemistry just never comes together.Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman are wasted in small parts that exist only to move the plot forward. That Bellucci -- an Italian actress from the same Bond-ready mold as Ursula Andress Honor Blackman and Maud Adams -- is finally cast in a 007 movie and amounts to a quick blip is downright criminal.USA TODAYDave Bautista Awesome Spectre villain iffy speed demonAs SPECTREs Mr. Hinx Dave Bautista doesnt get to use the acting chops he showed in Guardians of the Galaxy yet turns in an inspired performance for a role that nicely lives alongside past henchmen such as Jaws and Oddjob. And Ben Whishaw is a rock-solid younger version of Q Bonds tech guy who goes above and beyond in Spectre to keep 007 safe from himself.The addition of Bonds new support staff from Skyfall plus glimpses at a far-reaching mythology for the character power much of the first half of Spectre which at 148 minutes is about a half-hour too long. Yet instead of creating something new and different the movie recycles bits of the past -- theres a lot of recognizable throwback stuff for Sean Connery lovers -- and defaults to whats come before by the time its end game rolls around.Its an odd decision considering how successful the prior movie was with experimenting with the norm as well as having to compete in pop culture post-Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. Rehashing old James Bond material 50 years later isnt likely to shake or stir anyone nowadays. 880 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 43 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1MzWhy6",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/04/spectre-james-bond-daniel-craig-review/75109090/,200,spectre27,spectre,usatoday

All Stories >> Related James Bond Movie Theme Songs Ranked Worst to Best From A-Ha to Adele breaking down the franchises legendary (and legendarily bad) opening numbers Non-freaks still have Daniel Craig to feast on. In a photo finish with Sean Connery as the best of the six movie Bonds Craig comes out blazing. Hes a blunt instrument in a creamy Tom Ford tux alive with danger and sexual swagger. This is Craigs fourth time as 007. After the abysmal Quantum of Solace he rallied with Skyfall the biggest boffo Bond (1.1 billion worldwide). Craigs stated goal was to make Spectre ""better than Skyfall."" Not quite. Casino Royale Craigs first go-round remains his peak the film that caught Bond in the act of inventing himself. Spectre carries on Craigs reinvention of Bond blowing a reported 250 million budget on spectacular action without losing whats personal. Skyfall director Sam Mendes is back to keep things real but the plot cooked up by John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth is a 148-minute minefield of distractions. Ah but what distractions. Apologies to The Spy Who Loved Me but the Bond series has never had a more drop-dead dazzler of an opener than this one set in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead. With Bond leaping across rooftops to take out the evil Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona) and winding up in a dizzying chopper battle above the crowds in Zocolo Square the scene is a visual triumph for Dutch camera whiz Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar Her) and a new peak in the art of eye-popping. Then Bond is off to Rome chasing bad guys in a custom Aston Martin DB10 and having sex with Sciarras widow (Monica Bellucci still wowza at 51). The widow is Bonds entree to Spectre a secret society of global terrorists led by Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) a mystery man from Bonds orphan past. ""Im the author of all your pain"" says Franz whose ID is easy to guess. No spoilers except to say that Waltz purring with lethal charm is perfection. Back at MI6 Bond and the new M (Ralph Fiennes) face a new enemy C short for Max Denbigh (a smarmy Andrew Scott). Hes a bureaucrat who wants to refit British intelligence for the digital era drones in place of agents and the end of the 00 program which made spycraft hands-on. So its Bond M Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and gadget-master Q (a wonderful Ben Whisaw) against the cyber-Nazis on one side Spectre on the other. Related Hear Sam Smiths Elegant James Bond Theme Song for Spectre ""Writings on the Wall"" marks first British male singer to sing theme since 1965 Spectre even offers a fresh take on the Bond girl. Shes Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) a French doctor with a name out of Proust and no patience for Bonds swinging macho lifestyle. She puts the randy spy in touch with his feminist side and just maybe lasting love. Not buying it? Too candy-ass? I see your point. But Bonds train fight with a hulk called Hinx (Dave Bautista) recalls the brutal choo-choo classic in From Russia With Love. Craig puts heat and heart into Spectre as if hes taken Bond as far he can. The movie is a fever dream of all the Bond villains and all of Bonds efforts to see a life past them. An exhausted Craig has said hed rather ""slash my wrists"" than play Bond again. Theres still one more film in his contract but to quote Sam Smiths Bond song ""The writings on the wall."" If so Spectre is a stirring way-cool valedictory. Craig does himself proud.

Jonathan Olley/EON Productions via AP Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Spectre straddles real world tension and superspy fantasy with mixed results (B) Nov. 3 2015 228pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Hes still Bond of course. James Bond. But the remarkably durable British superspy franchise now finds itself in the midst of an identity crisis  with a mandate to please two different audiences.There are the true believers seeking the comfort food of gadgets bon mots and bodacious babes and a generation raised on the thornier Bourne movies and their more modern world view.You can feel a bit of the strain in Spectre the 26th Bond movie and the fourth starring Daniel Craig. Determined to drill home the dangers of living in a surveillance state personified by the deliciously malevolent Christoph Waltz Spectre plants one foot firmly in the real world a realm in which the majority of Bond films showed little interest. That leaves the other foot to have a little fun push the pedal to the metal and saunter up to the bar for a martini or two. Spectre faces the unenviable task of following Skyfall to my mind the one Bond movie that broke free from tradition and threw some convincing shadows into the formula. Skyfalls gravity felt unforced a reflection of the geopolitical times in which it was made. Now we increasingly take those times for granted.When M (Ralph Fiennes) assesses the new mega-surveillance system looming over Spectre as ""George Orwells worst nightmare"" the line feels unnecessary and redundant. It also underlines the movies need to remind us were dealing with some serious stuff here folks. Message received and then some.Theres a lot to like in Spectre starting with the delicious opening tracking shot through Mexico Citys sprawling ZA3calo area pulsating with sensual Day of the Dead festivities. Director Sam Mendes back for his second round with Bond never leaves a doubt theres a confident craftsman in charge. This sequence also features Craigs signature moment Sliding feet-first down the roof of a collapsing building he somehow lands softly on a couch a vaguely perturbed look flashing across his face. Mayhem so inconvenient.Spectres quest for seriousness yields mixed results. One big plus the pedigreed cast from world-class actors including Waltz and Fiennes to the bit players to the rising French star LA(c)a Seydoux who still gets saddled with some unfortunate Bond Girl lines.One big demerit the excessive running time. If theres a reason why a James Bond movie needs to last 148 minutes Spectre does not provide it. A big dry narrative lull rests at the movies core which lifts only when Waltz makes his grand entry with about an hour left purring evil as only he can.Spectre wants to operate as both a grim post-9/11 thriller and a throwback spy yarn and it succeeds often enough. Theres something audacious about positing a massive security and civil liberties threat right in the heart of central government.If thats the direction Bond wants to take Im on board. But Spectres balance is a little off. Its hard to be both pithy and grave slick and bloated. The end result feels shaken but not sufficiently stirred. Spectre (B)Directed by Sam Mendes. PG-13 (intense sequences of action and violence some disturbing images sensuality and language).  148 mins.  In wide release. Goes Well With...

The two films in between were fine and yet something was missing ""Quantum of Solace"" had lots of action but no introspection; and ""Skyfall"" was a moody entry without much in the way of glamour. But ""Spectre"" has everything anyone could possibly want in a James Bond movie. It has virtuoso action sequences imaginatively crafted and meticulously filmed. It has two beautiful Bond women -- ever since Eva Green there are no Bond girls. It has an international conspiracy that taps into the current paranoia just as the Cold War Bond movies did in the 1960s. And it has a villain who immediately enters the pantheon both for the way the role is written and for the way its played -- in the latter case by the remarkable Christoph Waltz. The movies first sequence puts the audience on notice that Bond is back. In a continuous shot Bond meets a woman at the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City where everyone is wearing grotesque masks. She invites him up to her room where she lies on the bed and he excuses himself for just a minute. He steps out of her window walks briskly across a ledge -- it really does look as if Craig is up there -- and arrives at the corner of a rooftop just in time to assassinate three people and blow up a building.

Why James Bonds Spectre Should Fear Snoopys Bite at Box Office Secret Service the forgotten James Bond All 24 James Bond theme songs ranked from worst to best Hes just getting started. I havent even mentioned the escape from a collapsing building or the fight he has on a helicopter trying to kill the pilot without causing a crash. In the course of a year there are hundreds of movies and countless action sequences. Each one makes it harder to raise an audiences pulse. But within five minutes ""Spectre"" has everyone sitting with their eyes wide and their mouths half open. As we soon find out Bond has gone rogue. The Mexico adventure was the result of an order from M (Judi Dench) delivered by way of a video that arrived after her death. Like the hard unsentimental Mommy figure she is/was she appears onscreen and gives him the name of some Italian assassin. ""Kill him"" she says. Talk about tough. Shes so unworried about the afterlife that shes ordering hits from the grave. At the start of ""Spectre"" two pressures are converging. The government is considering eliminating the Double-0 spy program just as Bond has a lead on something really dire as in really big as in a threat to life as we know it. After a brief romantic interlude with an Italian widow (Monica Bellucci) he infiltrates a secret meeting in Rome where we see just who is running the world. Its the stuff of everyones most paranoid fantasy. At an enormous table in an ornate church-like hall the evil powerful people sit hearing reports on things like the 160000 women theyve forcibly recruited into the ""leisure sector"" -- in other words sexual slavery. At the head of the table in the shadows is the boss the secret author of untold human misery. Then he turns his head to the light and we see that the polite yet menacing voice belongs to Christoph Waltz. Any charismatic flamboyant actor can play a memorable villain but Waltz is in a category beyond that. He is fascinating to watch because his surface is appealing almost endearing and yet his characters inner life of which were never in doubt is horrible and sick. Everything he says even when the character is loquacious (as his usually are) seems like just an external manifestation of some vast inner turbulence. At one point Bond asks him a question and he answers ""No."" And just that one word is invested with unknowable and unsettling meaning. As for Craig he can wear a white tuxedo as well as Roger Moore and he can fall off a building without ever unbuttoning his suit jacket and its good that we see that side of him here -- the imperturbable self-satisfied Bond. But with Craig theres always something serious going on too something pained inside thats in search of remedy. This is why there are no Bond girls only Bond women in the Craig installments because this Bond despite the suave facade is not just out for fun. He is actually -- though no one would ever quite put it this way -- looking for a girlfriend. ""What You Missed"" The new James Bond film ""Spectre"" is set to open this weekend so Jimmy Kimmel got his buddy Yehya to review the movie. While Yehya doesnt reveal too much about the film his unique review is definitely worth watching. You ca Media Hearstdigitalstudios.com One of the great satisfactions of ""Spectre"" is that in addition to all the stirring action and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyones personal information we get to believe in Bond as a person. And when he meets Lea Seydoux who plays a psychoanalyst who gets caught up in his life we recognize what he recognizes that this is the first woman since Eva Green -- or rather ""Vesper Lynd"" -- to understand him. We just hope it works out for them. ""Spectre"" has only one drawback an unmistakable yet localized problem that matters little in the end. It has the worst opening song in memory a ghastly concoction sung by Sam Smith called ""Writings on the Wall."" It should have been called ""Nobody Does It Worse.""

Daniel Craig on the brawl that shut down Spectre Judging from Daniel Craigs over-it-all statements it certainly feels like Spectre is his final outing as James Bond even if hes contracted to do one more. So before unpacking his new film lets pay our respects. Beginning with 2006s Casino Royale the actor single-handedly rescued the character from Austin Powers parody and gave it a brooding bruised-knuckle intensity. He made you feel the toll that so much killing takes on a man leaving the franchise in a far better place than he found it. If he does end up saying ""never again"" (as his most famous predecessor once did) then the question becomes is Spectre a worthy swan song? RELATED See Decades of Bond Girls Then and Now Like all of Craigs turns in the tux Spectre is a blast of bespoke escapism full of globetrotting action and thousand-thread-count opulence. But compared with 2012s stellar Skyfall it feels both overstuffed and undercooked. Spectre aspires to be the culmination of Craigs four-film cycle connecting all his onscreen adversaries in one nefarious web of villainy but it sets up a this-is-what-it-all-means revelation that never quite pays off. Picking up on the heels of Skyfall which offed Judi Denchs M and introduced a new generation of MI6 accomplices (Naomie Harris Moneypenny Ben Whishaws Q Ralph Fiennes M lite) Spectre opens with Bond in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead on a mission to kill an Italian terrorist which leads to a dizzying helicopter scrum that makes the one in For Your Eyes Only look like a tickle fight. RELATED 25 of the Best Pop Culture Spies Acting on beyond-the-grave intel from Dench Bond discovers a tentacled criminal organization called SPECTRE. Meanwhile a new head of British intelligence (the delightfully smarmy Andrew Scott) threatens to eighty-six the double-0 program. Ping-ponging from Rome (where he has a steamy encounter with Monica Bellucci) to the Austrian Alps and Tangier (where he literally butts heads with a Jaws-like goon played by Dave Bautista) Bond hunts for Franz Oberhauser the sponsor of his past foes (Le Chiffre Mr. White Silva). Played by Christoph Waltz with his creepy singsong accent and a Dr. No Nehru jacket Oberhauser turns out to be - SPOILER ALERT - someone who should be familiar to longtime Bond aficionados. So why do both he and his endgame feel so thinly sketched? Director Sam Mendes and his writers couldve had a field day with Oberhausers place in the 007 canon. Instead he feels like just another fey baddie bent on Freudian score-settling. The stakes are surprisingly low considering how high were told they are. Bond is given a love interest (Lea Seydoux) and while its nice to see a female lead whos more than a damsel in distress she seems like a plot device. Its possible that Skyfall created expectations that were too high for Spectre to match. But with all hes done for the franchise Craig deserves to go out with a bigger smarter bang.

USA TODAYDirector Sam Mendes lightens up a bit as James Bond (Daniel Craig) tries to stop an evil organization from carrying out the usual global threats. Its fun but not as deep as the previous James Bonds.Daniel Craig as James Bond in ""Spectre."" the new film is entertaining but doesnt break any new ground.(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars out of 5Director Sam Mendes takes a lighter touch than he has previouslyDaniel Craig is quite good again but has little interaction with Christoph Waltz playing the villainThe best way to enjoy your favorite band isnt through a greatest-hits collection but a really good stand-alone album.""Spectre"" the latest film in the James Bond franchise is more the former than the latter. You certainly wont go lacking for 007-ish behavior which includes killing people bedding women and a bravura set piece to open the film that leads into the pop star of the moment crooning the theme song (Sam Smith this time around).But when a series of films has been around this long you cant watch the new one in a vacuum. When Daniel Craig took over the role of bond with ""Casino Royale"" in 2006 he brought gravity to the franchise and played down the camp. The most obvious parallel is what Christopher Nolan did when he took over the Batman movies. Darkness gave both franchises more heft and audiences more satisfaction.With ""Spectre"" director Sam Mendes (who also directed ""Skyfall"") eases up. Its not quite like Nolan taking Batman back to the high camp of the Adam West television series -- there are many nods to Bond history that serve to make things seem more serious -- but its a step toward the light.AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Its all relative of course. ""Spectre"" is still fun the cast is top-flight. And had it been the first Bond film with Craig in the title role the reaction likely would be ""wow"" This is some good stuff way deeper than the silly Bonds. But with history behind us it feels a little slight.Bond is still recovering from the events of ""Skyfall"" most notably the death of M (Judi Dench). Hes on vacation in Mexico City where he and a woman are taking part in a massive Day of the Dead celebration. But of course Bond is never really on vacation and the next thing you know after a truly impressive chase scene that involves the parade a collapsing building and an out-of-control helicopter (Bond breaks a literal sweat) the international incident he causes has enraged the current M (Ralph Fiennes).Bond looks debonair while making an escape as per usual. (Photo Columbia Pictures)The 00 program is under scrutiny as C (Andrew Scott so snively) seeks to bring together all intelligence under one massive umbrella. This will make M Bond and their peers obsolete C assures. If we know what everyone is doing everywhere all the time crime will be much easier to stop.Civil rights and privacy take a beating but to C thats a small price to pay.Bond is caught up chasing leads from the late M and with the surreptitious help of Q (Ben Whisaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) -- and later with Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux) the daughter of an old acquaintance -- he stumbles into an evil group with nefarious plans for the world.As one does.AZCENTRALBest James Bond Themes John Barry WingsA mysterious man named Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) leads the bunch. As the mysteries around him are revealed it will come as no surprise that some lead back to Bond. He really gets around.Heres one place the movie falls short. The back and forth between Bond and the villain are a hallmark of the films. Watching Craig and Javier Bardem banter in ""Skyfall"" was the best part of the movie. But theres surprisingly little interaction between Bond and Oberhauser. Too bad as Waltz is really good at this type of thing. (Remember the opening of ""Inglorious Basterds"" when he shook down the farmer hiding Jews?).AZCENTRALSpectre (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsMendes and the group of writers responsible for the script include Oberhauser in relatively few scenes actually. Theres something to be said for leaving an audience wanting more but this takes that to extremes. (The same goes for Monica Bellucci as a here-and-gone conquest/plot accelerator.)The movie is too long -- at one point Bond says ""Its not over yet"" and hes not kidding -- but the cast is terrific and the acting uniformly good. There are callbacks to practically every Bond movie (and one to ""Jaws"") so whether you laugh smile or wince when you see a white cat belonging to a bad guy will say a lot about how much youll enjoy ""Spectre.""And you should. Its a good time at the movies. Just dont expect much more.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres an unexpected undercurrent of tragedy to the recent James Bond movies the ones starring narrow-faced blue-eyed brute Daniel Craig. Looked at one way and in succession theyre as bleak as Breaking Bad in their depiction of evaporating humanity Across the sublime spy games of Casino Royale the Bourne-biting action of Quantum Of Solace and the sleekly seductive spectacle of Skyfall a tortured wrecking ball of British intelligence loses his true love his mentor and his ability to feel. Each new movie inches him closer to Ian Flemings original conception of the ladykiller with a license to kill--which is to say further away from the comparably compassionate superspy that Craig embodied in his first outing. The more he resembles the Bond of legend the further gone he looks.Thats perhaps more pathology than one could have reasonably expected from cinemas longest-running espionage series so its no great travesty that Spectre Craigs fourth and maybe final turn in the tux doesnt take the character in any brave new directions or double down on his melancholy. Though it technically picks up where Skyfall left off continuing the extended origin story of the previous three installments the film feels more like a back-to-basics exercise--a throwback pastiche stretched out to an overlong 148 minutes with some revisionist pop psychology thrown in for good measure. For those who have been waiting patiently for Bond to stop brooding so heavily Spectre is about as close as the Craig version of the character is probably going to get to the quipping unflappable 007 of yore--though hes still more likely to burst through a wall than to sweet talk his way into the room on the other side of it.Bond himself may be fully formed but that doesnt mean--in this age of perpetual prequels--that theres no more backstory to disclose. Spectre reboots another pillar of the franchise mythology the titular terror organization a global network of supervillains last seen in 1971s Diamonds Are Forever. This criminal syndicate which holds secret meetings led by a shadow-drenched puppet master (Christoph Waltz) isnt Bonds only problem. He has also to contend with a new automated global security program run by a smug tyrant (Andrew Scott) with plans to shut down M (Ralph Fiennes) and his outdated analog approach to national crises. Besides allowing for another round of winks at the obsolescence of the Bond brand this particular plot point permits Spectre to draw some curious ideological lines condemning drone warfare and government surveillance while waxing nostalgic about the good ol days of Cold War assassination plots.For all its international wanderings the Bond series has never been about geopolitics. Its about cars and clothes guns and girls--and to those ends Sam Mendes remains an ideal handler for this 21st-century iteration of the character. Probably the most acclaimed and high-profile director the franchise has ever landed Mendes remains valuable perhaps chiefly for his refined taste in collaborators. (Theres an argument to be made that his Oscar-winning first feature American Beauty is more a ""film by Thomas Newman and Conrad Hall."") Spectre like his earlier Skyfall is flush with cosmetic pleasures from its fleet of modern and vintage vehicles to its grand wardrobe of suits to the spectacular range of scenic backdrops. The showroom sheen applies to the casting too To match Craigs chiseled appeal--his is surely the most camera-ogled Bond body of them all--Mendes casts two of the most beautiful actresses in the world though Monica Bellucci has much less to do than Lea Seydoux whose gun-proficient doctor proves a marginally more proactive Bond girl. (Marginally because Rebecca Ferguson raised that bar higher in this summers Mission Impossible sequel.)Mendes fares well with the set pieces too. The Mexico City prologue finds a costumed Craig winding his way through a teeming Day Of The Dead parade accompanying some random knockout to her chambers and then casually finding a view to a kill from the balconies outside--all in one winding sustained take. Spectre never tops this spectacular cold open but it makes a couple of valiant efforts Theres a playful high-speed pursuit down the narrow allies of nighttime Rome Bond testing his custom ride while long-distance flirting with Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and a knock-down drag-out fist fight with a Jaws-like henchman (Dave Bautista of Guardians Of The Galaxy fame) aboard a speeding train. At times Mendes just seems to be playing the 007 hits sending Bond through an Olympics of familiar scenarios.What Spectre lacks is the sinister magnetic pull of Skyfall a Bond movie with real stakes and attitude and distinctive flavor not to mention more mesmeric images than one can usually expect from this workmanlike blockbuster franchise. (Roger Deakins is a tough act to follow even for a cinematographer as accomplished as Interstellar shooter Hoyte Van Hoytema.) The movie bends over backwards to connect itself to the unofficial trilogy it follows teasing a sequel-uniting retcon in the passable opening credits sequence. But those films even the clunky Quantum had a more palpable sense of danger. For all the talk of its scary global reach Spectre itself comes across as just another collective of disposable goons. And despite having been born to play a Bond villain Waltz never comes within striking distance of the volcanic menace of Javier Bardems Skyfall heavy; perhaps the former has done the false-civility thing too many times for it to land anymore. Like most of Spectre hes not quite old not quite new and not quite distinct enough to shake (or stir) this sequel out of second-tier Bond lethargy.

"Spectre review James Bond vs. Big Brother - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Spectre review James Bond vs. Big Brother Spectre movie review Daniel Craig in ""Spectre."" (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures/EON Productions) Daniel Craig in ""Spectre."" (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures/EON Productions) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Casting Christoph Waltz as James Bonds insidious opposition in ""Spectre"" makes almost too much sense. ""Spectre"" cost nearly 300 million to make and I suppose it was worth it. Its a good Bond movie which will be good enough for many millions of fans. Its also the longest Bond movie in existence clocking in at just under 2 1/2 decadent carefree flamboyantly destructive hours.This time Ian Flemings well-dressed assassin changes clothes from Mexico City to Rome from London to the Austrian mountains from Tangier back to London where terrorists-entrepreneurs carrying the familiar handle of Spectre are doing dirty work on a large scale. Of the Daniel Craig 007s director Sam Mendes follow-up to ""Skyfall"" is not quite up to ""Skyfall"" or my favorite ""Casino Royale."" But its a considerably better evil-quelling instruction manual than ""Quantum of Solace"" a movie Craig himself admitted went before the cameras in rough shape racing against time and the most frightening of cinematic adversaries a writers strike. Here the ""Skyfall"" scribes John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are joined by Jez Butterworth and the results reference nearly every previous Bond outing. Throw in a certain facially scarred cat-stroker whose origin story becomes a part of ""Spectres"" narrative and you have a hugely expensive hunk of nostalgia more travelogue than thriller more sunglasses-modeling session than acting opportunity. And yet it works; its satisfying; in other words Guy Ritchie didnt direct it.The opening sequence is a pip. Bonds in Mexico City just in time for the Day of the Dead celebrations putting his license to kill to effective if unauthorized use. His target an Italian crime lord mixed up in Spectre the venerable world-domination collective familiar from six previous official Bond movies. Then to Rome and to bed with Monica Bellucci (seen briefly as the gangsters widow). In exchange for a brief scowly sexual encounter she provides Bond with a tip about a meeting of Spectre infiltrated by 007 because he has purloined an evil-insignia ring. There he and we meet the shadowy puppetmaster known as Oberhauser though he really goes by the name of ... Uber-spoiler Mendes was a peculiar if successful directorial choice for ""Skyfall""; his brand of action lacks a distinct visual attack but hes smart about pacing and rhythm and an astute judge of when to go for the joke (in ""Spectre"" theres a clever sight gag involving a well-placed sofa) and how to let his actors run the show as opposed to the show -- the explosions and murders and such -- flattening the actors. Ralph Fiennes (M) Naomie Harris (Moneypenny) and Ben Wishaw (gadgetmeister Q) return from ""Skyfall"" which is lovely news. Spectre trailer Watch the final trailer for ""Spectre.""

Imperious yet almost immediately imperiled atop her Austrian mountaintop clinic Dr. Swann swears Bond will never ever ever get anywhere with her. Yet soon theyre on a train chugging across the Sahara and the wine is excellent and after one protracted slugfest involving a near-mute bruiser who clearly studied for his assignment by watching ""From Russia With Love"" its clear these two emotional cripples speak the international language of love.Casting Christoph Waltz as Bonds insidious opposition makes almost too much sense given Waltzs comfort level with this sort of fellow. Yet the actor evinces a swell throwback quality (hes like Mountain Dew Eurotrash division) thats strangely comforting. ""Spectre"" pretends to stand up against unchecked surveillance and data-gathering tactics which is also comforting though theres a moment when Fiennes old-guard spymaster scolds an inferior that a license to kill is ""also a license not to."" Well yes of course though good luck with making a Bond film when that actually becomes a plot point. Quiz Is your bond with Bond formidable? Darcel Rockett Chicago Tribune Darcel Rockett Chicago Tribune For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters ""Spectre"" works best when everyones on the ground doing his or her job driving expensive fast cars heedlessly detonating the occasional wisecrack enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes. The signature title sequence for the record is dominated by Sam Smith giving his all to a nothing of a song titled ""Writings on the Wall"" already a chart-topper in the U.K. ""Im not going to ask you to change"" Seydoux deadpans at one point to Craig in her minimalist-smitten state.

If this new James Bond thriller really is the exclamation mark on the Daniel Craig era as 007 he goes out with an adrenaline rush of action insight drama pathos brutality humility humanity and even the occasional whisper of mischievous comedy. The movie does labour through a few minor failings. Some are structural thanks to the Bond template; some are embedded in the plot-heavy storyline because Spectre tries to tidy up a lot of loose ends. A few of those including one startling revelation date back to the 1960s. A lot more emerge specifically from the three previous Bonds that starred Craig Casino Royale Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. But this problem of familiarity and even repetition of subplot is no surprise because genre movies in a franchise as long-lived and overwrought as the 53-year-old Bond series are always trapped in their own traditions to some extent. The beauty of this Bond movie -- which instantly leaps into my Top 10 of all time and will probably make it into the top three when I digest its true impact -- is that it does all the Bondian things we expect so extremely well. For example the opening pre-title sequence is absolutely classic and is guaranteed to leave viewers with hearts racing blood pounding and voices ready to shout out approval. The sequence is staged on location in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead (Dia de Muertos) holiday and parade. Bond going rogue from what his bosses at MI6 expect back in London is snooping around looking for bad guys he suspects are up to no good. By the time 007 exits from Mexico City a big chunk of the city has blown up some bad guys are dead a low-altitude helicopter chase has freaked out thousands of revellers and Bond has abandoned a hot babe waiting for him on a bed. And of course he gets grounded by M (Ralph Fiennes) when he reports back. The core part of the movie picks up where the Mexico City antics left off and 007 is soon doing his spy thing in Morocco Italy Austria and England. Rarely in ways that his spy bosses approve of of course although he does have friends in next-to-high places. Among them are the always impressive Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and the ever-fretting Q (Ben Whishaw). Even M will come around as he faces a bureaucratic squeeze from above as a mandarin whom Bond nicknames C (Andrew Scott) brings new-age surveillance techniques into operation while he deems the double-0 agents as brutish dinosaurs of the past spy wars. Mobile users please view the Spectre trailer here. That tension makes Spectre one of the most subtle daring Bonds ever. The past is heavily referenced especially in the case of Sean Connerys Goldfinger (1964) and the methodology of the spy assassin is questioned. Craigs Bond even questions himself in yet another touch of the fragility that he has brought to the iconic role since taking over in 2006. Craigs Bond has always been tough grim-faced and capable of ruthless violence. Yet he is simultaneously vulnerable flawed and utterly human as he wrestles with his demons and his memories of his own youth. Another critical part of this Bond movie is the legacy of death that has touched Craigs Bond since Casino Royale. From Eva Greens sensuous Vesper Lynd to Judi Denchs monumental turn as the M before Fiennes got the job people closely associated with Bond have died in the pursuit of truth or love or honour. Spectre also has some great stuff from new characters. Wrestler-turned-actor Dave Bautista (who played Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy) takes another intriguing detour. As Mr. Hinx Bautista is a near-silent henchman to Christoph Waltzs tyrannical villain. Baustista has one word of dialogue but makes his silent work count almost as much as Waltz does with his talk-heavy performance. Also making a brief yet memorable appearance is Monica Bellucci as a mature Bond Girl with a bad attitude and a hot body. Lea Seydoux gets a lot more screen time as the young Bond Girl who insinuates herself into 007s brain and heart with a surprising series of twists. Throughout Sam Mendes directs Spectre as a drama not just a movie with a skein of special effects driven stunts. Multiple writers worked on the story and script but the ""spectre"" of original novelist Ian Fleming hovers above this movie. I suspect he would approve of what his franchise has become so many decades later. Twitter Bruce_Kirkland bruce.kirklandsunmedia.ca Spectre premiere 2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.

But does the world still need James Bond to save it? Although the last film ""Skyfall"" was a huge hit the venerable spy franchise was chased out of the summer blockbuster season long ago. And the ""Mission Impossible"" series has surpassed it in stunts (and even more appealingly in strong female characters). So whats left for Bond? Well judging by ""Spectre"" to get back to a few basics and indulge in a fun bit of nostalgia. Its not the best Bond youve ever seen but on a scale of 1 to 10 its a solid 008. Although it includes fistfights gun battles and chases by foot car plane and helicopter theres nothing flagrantly unbelievable here. The jokiness is toned down and the grown-up elegance - mostly courtesy of a guest appearance by Monica Bellucci - is heightened. And for Bond loyalists in the audience there are plenty of familiar elements - a car with an ejector seat a hand-to-hand battle on a luxury train and that shadowy villainous organization of the title - guaranteed to revive memories of films past. Spectre - remember that? - is back it seems and once again up to something involving terrorist bombings. And once again Bond goes rogue chasing them from Mexico City to Morocco with additional stops in Rome and the Swiss Alps. Daniel Craig remains the surliest of bonds - next to him Timothy Dalton was practically Noel Coward - but he wears clothes well and can throw a punch always two 007 essentials. Naomie Harris Moneypenny is wasted but at least Ralph Fiennes M gets more to do. And although Lea Seydoux is fairly forgettable as the heroine thats mostly because Belluccis turn as a mysterious widow makes such an impression in and out of her mourning clothes. (An age-appropriate love interest for Bond - imagine) Good too is sly Christoph Waltz as the current (and Im guessing future) Bond villain. Dave Bautista makes a fine nearly indestructible henchman on the order of Oddjob or at least Jaws and director Sam Mendes keeps things visually interesting starting things off with a long unbroken shot following Bond over some Mexico City rooftops. The film has its problems including a slow middle where it tries - unsuccessfully - to suddenly recap plot points and resolve character motivations from the first three Craig films. (You remember Mr. White? Me neither.) It also has - rare for a Bond movie - a terrible theme song and a ridiculous credit sequence starring amorous octopi. That might account for some of the negative reviews the film has already been getting. (Another possible reason? Critics have to make up for overpraising ""Skyfall"" which had an equally overcomplicated plot and an over-the-top performance from Javier Bardem.) Some reviewers are even saying Bond is finished. Well Craig may be finished (and honestly if he leaves after this film as hes hinted its final scene gives him a ""The Dark Knight Rises"" sense of closure). But even if the world no longer needs 007 several generations of fans still do. Welcome back Mr. Bond. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual situations and brief strong language. Spectre (PG-13) Columbia/MGM (148 min.) Directed by Sam Mendes. With Daniel Craig Monica Bellucci Christoph Waltz. Opens Thursday in New Jersey.

Wednesdays show is sold out at Regal Cinemas Deer Park. Wider release on Long Island including in IMAX theaters begins Thursday Nov. 5 2015 according to Fandango. Photo Credit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT James Bond infiltrates the shadowy organization that has haunted him all his life. Rated PG-13 (violence and mild sexuality). BOTTOM LINE An uneven mix of eye-popping action and superhero-style origin story. CAST Daniel Craig Lea Seydoux Christoph Waltz LENGTH 228 The Marvel-ization of James Bond continues with ""Spectre"" the fourth film in the rebooted series with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. In this installment eye-popping action shares space with backstory as Bonds traditionally unexplored history comes to light old ghosts are resurrected and plotlines are left conveniently dangling to make room for further developments. Initially ""Spectre"" holds great promise as a Bond film in the old-fashioned mode. Directed by Sam Mendes (""Skyfall"") with a reportedly whopping 300 million budget ""Spectre"" opens with a magnificent sequence in Mexico City that follows Bond in a single tracking shot through a street-crowd of thousands into a top-floor hotel room (with a woman naturally) and onto an adjoining rooftop that becomes the setting for some spectacular property damage. In a franchise famous for its opening gambits this may be the topper. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? For its first two-thirds this epic-length action film continues apace. StoryEvery James Bond theme song ranked As Bond hops the globe and butts heads with his bosses (Ralph Fiennes replaces Judi Dench as M while Andrew Scott plays a questionable new bureaucrat dubbed C) ""Spectre"" moves at crackling speed but with all the costumed finery and gorgeous sets of a Hollywood musical. Its nice to see that Bond and his new companion -- Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann the good-hearted daughter of an old villain -- brought their evening wear while fleeing on a train from Austria to Tangier. Alas when Christoph Waltz steps out of the shadows and into his role as Oberhauser head of the surveillance-obsessed network known as Spectre the movie flags. advertisement | advertise on newsday Oberhauser is revealed to be a familiar figure in the Bond universe -- no spoilers here but you can Google it -- and Waltz usually a wonderful scenery-chewer seems weighed down by all the narrative history. Add to that an overlong climax full of cliches (Ben Whishaw as Q helms the laptop in a race against time) and youve got a Bond film that feels caught between its roots as a mindlessly enjoyable action-franchise and its new mandate to deliver the operatic emotions and sudsy plot lines of todays superhero properties.

With Spectre -- the twenty-fourth James Bond picture and the fourth and probably final one to feature Daniel Craig as 007 -- director Sam Mendes takes a tip perhaps unwittingly from Hitchcock as well as from Orson Welless Touch of Evil The picture opens in Mexico City with a regal ambitious Wellesian tracking shot that begins in the midst of a Day of the Dead parade and eventually finds its way to Craigs Bond standing in the crowd.Hes wearing a holiday-appropriate costume a sexy-threatening skull mask and a black topcoat with a silkscreened skeletons spine winding up the back. Theres a masked beauty on his arm but whos looking at her? The camera trails the couple as they trek through the reveling masses and its impossible to take your eyes off that spine a sensuous rippling imaginary x-ray of the man beneath. Why oh why dont real 3-D glasses -- the ones advertised in the backs of comic books and sold to young boys hoping to see through womens clothes -- actually exist?Film Details Spectre RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time148 min. More Info Trailer We dont really need to see through Daniel Craigs clothes because eventually he does take at least some of them off. But dressed or un- hes the chief pleasure to be had in Spectre along with the joys of gazing at the feral-flower beauty of Lea Seydoux (as Madeleine Swann the headstrong psychologist Bond falls for) Monica Bellucci (who appears only briefly as an Italian widow in a merry widow) and the radiant charmer Naomie Harris (who again plays MI6 administrative assistant Miss Moneypenny although like most administrative assistants shes sorely underappreciated and given only unimportant things to do).Spectre on the whole is gorgeous shot -- by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema -- in a bevy of locales including sandy-gold Morocco glowing gray-marble Rome the winter-white Austrian Alps and of course dazzling polychrome Mexico City. Every action sequence is beautifully staged and edited clearly Theres a rough-and-tumble dustup set in a trains dining car and a breathtaking midair scuffle in which the two principals dangle precariously from a flying helicopter. Mendes and his screenwriters (John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth) give us multiple villains to thrill to and hate one played by appealing muscleman Dave Bautista another by Christoph Waltz whos perfectly fine if youre not yet tired of his trademark deaths-head grin. This isnt your average James Bond movie; its more of a SuperBond packed with all sorts of things you didnt know you wanted -- but also with things you dont really need.Because in the end Spectre is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought theres little grace majesty or romance in the way the pieces are connected. The whole is bumpy and inelegant -- entertaining for sure but hard to love. Its easy to see how all this aggressive splendor could fall flat Both Mendes and Craig have said in interviews that they were nervous about being able to top the over-the-topness of 2012s rich resonant Skyfall Mendess first film in the franchise; Craig has also said that hes ""done"" with James Bond and though that could be exhaustion speaking its easy to see how the excesses of Spectre might cause anyone to say Enough.The shaky plot mechanics dont help Acting on a tip from his late and beloved boss M (Judi Dench who appears here only in a small moving snippet of video) Bond goes rogue to root out the mysterious head of bad-guy syndicate SPECTRE. In the process he flagrantly disobeys his new boss (played with bespoke tastefulness by Ralph Fiennes) and messes up the beautiful Aston Martin DB10 hes stolen from fidgety gadget mastermind Q (an adorable Ben Whishaw dressed in a series of amazing jackets in plum tweeds and dark-blue windowpane-checks). Meanwhile an evil new boss (Andrew Scott of Sherlock) has taken over MI6 with plans to dissolve it. Theres enough plot here for six movies and Spectre groans under the weight. Mendes has dropped in some lovely details that nearly get lost Not surprisingly Bonds underfurnished bachelor-spy apartment is lacking in tchotchkes but we do get a glimpse of a miniature bulldog figurine its back adorned with a Union Jack that in the old days used to sit on Ms desk.Touches like that personalize a living space and they help humanize Bond too. If this really is Craigs last go-round in a 007 dinner jacket and bow tie lets make the most of it by objectifying his beauty to the max. Lets drink in the sight of him standing alone in the window of his apartment gazing at the twilight London view beyond -- hes in his shirtsleeves his gun holster still strapped across his back. We cant see his face but we know hes brooding. This is how Craigs Bond unwinds when he unwinds which is hardly ever. In those pre-Spectre interviews Craig expressed boredom with the 007 character but if thats the case hes a good enough actor that his ennui serves the performance. When Bond scowls we see a man dissatisfied with himself; when he strokes Madeleines cheek hes shutting off if only for a few moments the almost relentless macho current that drives him. This scrappy bulldog Bond is tired but hes also capable of tenderness. And no matter how frustrating or exhausting Spectre may be theres nothing but sadness to be felt in watching him walk away.Spectre Directed by Sam Mendes Sony Pictures Opens November 6 Directed by Sam Mendes.

EntertainmentMovies Spectre Its all about the look of Bond James Bond Originally published November 2 2015 at 630 pm Updated November 4 2015 at 1036 am Daniel Craig is back as James Bond in ""Spectre."" (Jonathan Olley) Movie review of ""Spectre"" The latest addition to the James Bond franchise is all about iconography with Daniel Craig displayed as the embodied image of assured masculinity. Rating. 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer In the title song sequence of ""Spectre"" Daniel Craig appears as a shirtless bronze icon. Its a harbinger of things to come. The latest and highly anticipated addition to the James Bond franchise which opens late Thursday Nov. 5 is all about iconography. Whether hes seen in profile broodingly thoughtful or photographed in the middle distance in full-figure postures of coiled alertness the Craig-as-icon look is repeatedly emphasized. Oddly his features seem somehow to have coarsened from his previous outings in the role. Craigs Bond now has the aspect of a brute who kills with little conscience. Its as if all those killings have eroded his humanity. Movie Review 1/2   Spectre with Daniel Craig Christoph Waltz Lea Seydoux Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Sam Mendes from a screenplay by John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth. 148 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some disturbing images sensuality and language. Opens late Thursday Nov. 5 at several theaters. The screenplay seeks to humanize Bond by casting him in the role of protector of a much-menaced blonde played by Lea Seydoux. This results in a ridiculous last-minute save-the-damsel chase scene and an improbable denouement that is wildly out of character for a man with a license to kill.

The razor-sharp tailoring of Bonds suits is so pronounced the clothes are practically characters in their own right. Sharper still are the cars. Much is made of two in particular an Aston-Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75 sleek sharks on four wheels both worth staggering amounts of money. When theyre involved in a big car chase its ever so carefully staged. The sharks race through the night streets of Rome where oddly there is no traffic no untidiness. If ever a car chase could be called ""pristine"" the ""Spectre"" chase is it. Its like watching a commercial. Because the sense of image for its own pure sake so predominates the visuals it seems like ""Spectre"" is standing back regarding itself with unabashed admiration and inviting the audience to do the same. The action sequences are spectacular as expected (lots of chases) but theyre so carefully choreographed theyre curiously lifeless. And the intervals between them are so long that the picture repeatedly loses significant momentum in those in-between spaces. This reinforces the impression the filmmakers were so taken with these scenes that they simply wanted to display them rather than integrate them organically into the story. With a running time of nearly 21/2 hours the movie would have benefited from a lot of tightening. In a number of key scenes ""Spectre"" re-creates classic moments from past Bonds. Think of them as James Bonds Greatest Hits. Think of them also as signs Mendes and his writers have run out of fresh ideas. The brutal train fight between Sean Connerys Bond and Robert Shaws Red Grant in ""From Russia with Love"" is echoed by a scenery-smashing train fight between Craig and a bad guy played by David Bautista. The ""Goldfinger"" scene of evildoers arrayed around a huge conference table where evil is done to one of them is mimicked. Theres even a nod to Bonds signature silver Aston-Martin DB5. Yes it was blown up in ""Skyfall."" But in the movies its often the case that no death even of a car is truly forever. In the role of the chief villain Christoph Waltz seems to be recycling his Nazi Col. Hans Landa from ""Inglorious Basterds"" only much de-energized. Hes genially smiling. Hes quietly chatty delivering acres of exposition that ties all of Craigs previous Bond movies together into a kind of unified field theory of 007. Hes also badly lacking in oomph. The same sadly is true of ""Spectre."" Soren Andersen 206-464-2358 or sandersenseattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

The 24th installment of the 007 series kicks off with a bravura tracking shot that swoops and weaves through Mexico Citys throngs during the Day of the Dead celebrations. The camera picks out a white-suited man with his hair scraped back into a disreputable bun before joining a couple as they walk purposefully through the crowds. They both wear masks. But its clear from her bearing that she is beautiful. And its clear from his tailoring that he is James Bond. We follow them upstairs to a bedroom where the masks are shed. But then Bond slips out of the open window leaving his companion unfulfilled and disappointed. And for all the dizzying impact of this extended pre-titles action sequence -- with its building surfing and helicopter wrangling -- ultimately she is the character with whom we end up identifying. The thrills here are empty. ""Spectre"" is a frustratingly unsatisfying experience. See Video Daniel Craig Wants to Kill Christoph Waltz in Final Spectre Trailer Almost from the moment that the title sequence ends the pictures shortcomings are laid bare. Whereas ""Skyfall"" explored the emotional backstory of the worlds most famous secret agent and served up unexpected pathos along with the action ""Spectre"" is all about the set pieces. Character development and dialogue both come in at a distant joint second place. An encounter with M (Ralph Fiennes) is a cold stilted affair that seems more about ticking off plot points -- namely Bonds suspension and the introduction of C (Andrew Scott) the new head of the joint security service -- than it is with creating a flowing scene. Despite being grounded -- Q (Ben Whishaw) has injected Bond with something called ""smart blood"" an intravenous tracking device which allows the powers that be to know his movements at all times -- Bond manages to steal a multi-million dollar Aston Martin prototype and smuggle it to Rome before anybody notices. Here he encounters Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci) the not-so-grieving widow of the man he killed in Mexico. Its a throwaway role offering little other than plot point delivery and joylessly routine seduction and Bellucci handles it more with resignation than any great conviction. Also Read Daniel Craig on Reprising James Bond Role Id Rather Slash My Wrists But Lucia gives Bond a vital clue which sends him to a meeting of the shady organization that turns out to be SPECTRE. There he first encounters his ultimate foe softly spoken sociopath Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) alias ... well lets just say he has a penchant for white Persian cats. We are also introduced to this episodes formidable evil henchman Mr. Jinx (Dave Bautista) who demonstrates his fitness for the position by thumbing his rivals eyeballs out of their sockets during the interview. Its an auspicious start to the job but like so much else in this film Mr. Jinx invites us to reference past Bond movies only to end up lesser by comparison. He lacks the amiable relentlessness of Jaws or the stylish efficiency of Oddjob. In fairness there was not much Bautista could do to flesh out the role. He only gets one word of dialogue. See Video Sam Smith Praises Spectre Theme Song Its The Most Timeless Classiest Thingyou Mr. Jinx does get to pursue Bond through the streets of Rome at night in a car chase which is notable for the fact that the streets are eerily deserted. This Bond film is empty both emotionally and literally. Theres a later encounter on a luxury train which seems to have only three passengers all of whom are trying to kill each other. In what may or may not be his final outing in the role Craig remains one of the series main assets. His Bond is permanently pissed off. His reaction to anything -- shrapnel heavy traffic sexual attraction -- is a grimace of irritation. He is paired with Lea Seydouxs Madeleine Swann the daughter of an assassin. Its a photogenic match but it lacks the screen-melting chemistry he shared with Eva Green in ""Casino Royale."" Also Read Daniel Craig David Oyelowo to Star Off Broadway in Othello Perhaps its unavoidable since there have been so many double-O outings before this one but ""Spectre"" frequently feels as though it is picking over the corpses of the films that came before. The Day of the Dead opener for example evokes the New Orleans funeral parade at the start of ""Live And Let Die."" And a needlessly complicated brain-drilling contraption that Bond finds himself strapped into is every bit as inefficient as Auric Goldfingers laser castration device. Fittingly it is information rather than some genocidal superweapon which is the threat to humanity in this installment. A global surveillance network is about to be launched -- and the film rather quaintly suggests that a global surveillance network is something you can just switch off by fiddling around on a laptop for a few minutes but that aside the idea is timely and perhaps not too far removed from the truth. ""Spectre"" is strongest is when it explores the central theme What is the point of men like Bond in an era where information is power and drones can do his job without racking up an eye-watering bar tab and dry cleaning bill? Is he an outmoded relic of a bygone age? While the characters relevance may still be subject for debate the franchise doesnt do its best work at justifying its continued existence this time around.

TWITTER Sam Mendes returns to direct Daniel Craig again in the latest James Bond adventure picking up the story after their billon-dollar franchise reboot Skyfall.A Empires collapse stock markets crash dynasties die out but James Bond endures as one of cinemas longest-running and most lucrative franchises for over half a century. The 24th installment in the official 007 canon Spectre is the sequel to Skyfall which gave the seminal spy-thriller series a pleasingly smart and sophisticated makeover after the dismal Quantum of Solace. This classy upgrade paid off with box office receipts of 1.1 billion the most profitable Bond vehicle to date. So it is no surprise that Spectre reunites the same core creative team including director Sam Mendes and screenwriters John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade with additional work by the award-winning British stage dramatist Jez Butterworth. Skyfall lightly gentrified the Bond property refreshing its peeling paintwork with arty touches and dramatic gravitas rebooting 007s origin story much like Christopher Nolan did for Batman -- indeed Nolan was reportedly a front-runner to direct this latest chapter before Mendes agreed to return. Read more Daniel Craig Id Rather ""Slash My Wrists"" Than Return as James Bond Spectre is the most expensive 007 movie to date with a budget rumored to be well north of 250 million. At 148 minutes it is also the longest which becomes evident in the bloated second half. But Mendes kicks off in the same impressive mode as Skyfall deepening Bonds back story while self-consciously borrowing from the franchises classic Sixties heritage. The first act is great full of dark portent and bravura film-making flourishes. However the final hour disappoints with too many off-the-peg plot twists and too many characters conforming to type. While its commercial prospects seem bulletproof Spectre ultimately feels like a lesser film than Skyfall falling back on cliche and convention. Filmed in downtown Mexico City during the riotous Day of the Dead festivities the stupendous pre-credits sequence opens with an extended tracking shot that would make Orson Welles jealous. After a spectacular demolition and helicopter fight leaves a trail of carnage James Bond (Daniel Craig) is grounded by his jittery bosses. But he defies their orders as he races to Rome the Austrian Alps and the Moroccan desert in search of Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) the shadowy mastermind behind an all-powerful criminal cartel called Spectre reviving an iconic piece of 007 folklore dating back to the Sean Connery era. Meanwhile back in London M (Ralph Fiennes) Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) are fighting for survival against an ambitious government mandarin called C (Andrew Scott) with plans to shut down the 00 agent program and replace it with his own sinister high-tech surveillance network. If all this sounds a little familiar it is pretty much the same plot as the latest Mission Impossible movie Rogue Nation right down to using Morocco and Austria as exotic locations. But at least Spectre boasts a little more visual finesse courtesy of Interstellar cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Read more How Sony Could Lose James Bond After Bloated Spectre (Analysis) Contracted for five films but reportedly sick of the role this is Craigs fourth outing playing the ruthless imperial assassin that even author Ian Fleming called ""ironical brutal and cold."" With his chiseled physique and icy intensity Craig arguably embodies that image of a sociopathic sadist more than any previous 007. He is a tuxedo-clad Terminator a weapon of mass seduction the pathological narcissist who came in from the cold. But during Craigs stewardship of the role Bond has also acquired an emotional hinterland that saved the character from being just an anachronistic misogynistic Cold Warrior. Skyfall added intriguing psychological depths to his character hinting at deep childhood wounds and hidden homoerotic leanings. His close attachment to Judi Denchs matriarchal spymaster M also pointed to major unresolved Mummy Issues the ultimate military-industrial Oedipus complex. The names Freud. Sigmund Freud. Spectre adds a few more shades of post-Freudian angst to Bonds psyche dropping some teasing clues about family traumas and ancient grudges. Cleverly referencing events and reviving characters from all three of Craigs previous 007 films the script initially riffs on notions of memory and nostalgia. The character played by French female lead Lea Seydoux is even called Madeleine Swann a name whose Proustian double resonance can only be deliberate. Read more Daniel Craig My Bond ""Not As Sexist and Misogynistic"" As Previous Versions But Craigs lack of humor or warmth remains problematic. His two main seduction scenes first with a fleetingly featured Monica Bellucci then with Seydoux have a forced and jarring quality. The ingrained chauvinism of the Bond universe is a given of course and can be enjoyed in an ironic Austin Powers manner. But Spectre seems confused in its token nods to feminism with Madeleine initially scorning Bonds irresistible charms only to melt helplessly into his arms a few scenes later. Still at least no women are callously murdered purely as punishment for sleeping with James Bond as happened in all three of Craigs previous 007 films. We can normally measure a Bond film by the quality of its villain and Austrian double Oscar-winner Waltz certainly gives good evil spritzing up Oberhauser with a light fizz of mirth and mischief. But he is hampered by a script which fails to make his long-standing grudge against Bond plausible and provides zero motives for his power-hungry schemes. His big revelation in the final half hour will come as no great shock to anyone even vaguely familiar with the early 007 films. It feels like the filmmakers have been bluffing a great poker hand for two hours before throwing down a pair of threes. In pure action adventure terms Spectre delivers the goods with plenty of revved-up supercar porn and several kinetic high-speed chase sequences on road river and snowy mountain slope. Thomas Newmans busy score amps up the pulse-racing bombast smartly invoking operatic melodrama in Rome and sinewy Arabic folk music in Morocco. Sam Smiths flimsy theme song is a weak entry in the canon of 007 classics but admittedly it sounds better blasting out of huge cinematic speakers as Daniel Kleinmans gorgeous gothic title credits billow across the screen. Spectre contains enough dazzle and derring-do to keep the Bond brand afloat but not enough to make it a game-changing reboot in the manner of Skyfall. Two steps forward one step back.

""The dead are alive"" are the very first words printed onscreen in ""Spectre"" the 24th and far-from-last James Bond adventure. Its a statement that could be viewed as a pre-emptive spoiler a sly double-bluff or a swaggering boast from a death-defying franchise that following the soaring success of ""Skyfall"" couldnt be in ruder health. Sam Mendes second consecutive Bond outing again passes its physical with flying colors Ricocheting from London to Rome to Morocco across action sequences of deliriously daft extravagance the pic accumulates a veritable Pompeii of mighty crumbling structures. Whats missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of ""Skyfall"" as the film sustains its predecessors nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent. A wealth of iconography -- both incidental and integral -- from the series founding chapters is revived here making ""Spectre"" a particular treat for 007 nerds and a businesslike blast for everyone else. Spectre-cular B.O. awaits though it remains to be seen whether the ""Skyfall"" is the limit. The series-crowning crossover success of ""Skyfall"" three years ago -- yielding not just 1 billion worldwide but breathless reviews two Oscars and even a BAFTA for best British film -- places ""Spectre"" in a tricky returning position. The franchise may have been a consistent performer over 53 years but never before has it been saddled with the prestige-pic expectations that the new film is now notionally expected to meet. With Mendes tony cachet once more in place (minus the co-piloting of revered d.p. Roger Deakins) and a hefty (if not entirely justified) runtime of 148 minutes ""Spectre"" outwardly appears to be shooting for equivalently grandiose status. Yet even before the opening credits are cued up (accompanied by Sam Smiths dreary melody-averse theme song thankfully the least propulsive thing here) one senses that Mendes and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have somewhat paradoxically set out to surprise by resetting the status quo -- albeit with a few administrative complications. The death of Judi Denchs M at the climax of ""Skyfall"" raised the personal stakes for the usually impermeable Bond in a fashion that cant be automatically repeated one installment later. The indefatigable agents solution and in turn the films is to get stoically back to work almost as if if nothing had happened and let the baggage emerge where it may. And while Daniel Craigs reputation as the series sternest Bond stands intact when the ride -- rumored to be his last -- is over his half-smile count is higher than usual. A handful of wily quips meanwhile point to the addition of rough-and-tumble Brit playwright Jez Butterworth to the sturdy ""Skyfall"" writing team of John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Consequently theres a little more room in ""Spectre"" for Bonds customary hobbies -- globe-trotting red-blooded lady-killing and cold-blooded not-lady-killing -- than in the comparatively contemplative ""Skyfall."" The tone is set by an enthrallingly expensively ludicrous opening sequence set in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead that ranks among the great 007 intros. Weaving through the jubilant masses Hoyte van Hoytemas dust-veiled camera alights on Bond in masked skeleton costume luring a local bombshell (""Miss Balas"" Stephanie Sigman) back to his hotel room before the quickest of quick changes finds him suited booted and planting a hit on venal Italian mafioso Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona) from the rooftop. Cue explosions architectural carnage and vertigo-inducing physical combat in a helicopter careering perilously over the citys crowded Zocalo square. The narrative takeaway from all this eye-popping activity turns out to be rather puny In winning the fistfight Bond secures his opponents ring engraved with a telling insignia. Its a typically circuitous outcome in a film that certainly in its MacGuffin-stacked opening hour feels somewhat underplotted Large expanses of ""Spectre"" play as diverting but diversionary action travelogue as one transitory character in an exotic locale leads our hero to another in pursuit of opponents who dont really get to bare their teeth until the halfway mark. Back in London Bond is grounded for his unauthorized Mexican hijinks by Ralph Fiennes exasperated replacement M. The new bosss crankiness is forgivable given other professional worries on his plate -- most of them involving Brylcreem-slick new MI5 boss Max Denbigh (a splendid Andrew Scott) codenamed C who is spearheading a reorganization of Britains intelligence departments that could see the entire 00 program shut down. Bond considerately stays out of his hair by flagrantly disregarding his orders jetting off to Rome and professional that he is promptly seducing Sciarras not-so-grieving widow (an underused Monica Bellucci). While there he also gains access to a secret meeting of a shady global cooperative presided over with calmly lethal authority by the mysterious Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz). With the assistance of his authority-flouting MI6 underlings Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) and via a brief catch-up with ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" antagonist White (Jesper Christensen) Bond ultimately makes contact in Austria with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) a young doctor with a dark past who identifies Oberhausers operation as the powerful terrorism-inclined SPECTRE. That confirms the titles promised resurrection of a collective enemy that has featured in six previous 007 romps though none since 1971s ""Diamonds Are Forever."" (Bond buffs meanwhile will have been counting the visual nods of SPECTREs signature octopus logo up to this point most of them in the tentacular credit sequence.) Any further plot revelations would be hazardous. Suffice to say that the unveiling of SPECTRE cues a modern-day rewrite of classic Bond mythos teasing the audience with wry winks to series-affiliated imagery and gimmickry dating back to the Sean Connery era from white cats to ejector seats. (The 1960s revival isnt even kept strictly inhouse One of several breakneck car chases pays passing tribute to ""The Italian Job."") The film finally hits fifth gear when Waltzs louche villain emerges from the shadows though hes not as eerily vivid or playful an opposing presence as Javier Bardems Silva in ""Skyfall."" The Austrian actor brings his familiar streak of fruity menace to the role though like much else in ""Spectre"" hes working to match comforting series archetypes rather than transcend them. That goes equally for the pics unsurprisingly superb craft contributions which admirably demonstrate how the franchises technical bar has been raised in the last decade without sweating much blood on the innovation front. The honey-hued widescreen lensing doesnt quite aim for the crystalline beauty of Deakins ""Skyfall"" images but its immersive all the same -- sometimes recalling the oily deep-contrast shadows of van Hoytemas work on last years ""Interstellar."" Despite switching to 35mm from the previous films all-digital lensing ""Spectre"" often looks the less refined harder-textured work in keeping with its protagonists restless on-the-fly work ethic. Dennis Gassners production design represents the pics rather old-fashioned good-versus-evil stance by contrasting oaky Olde English veneer with glassier 60s-leaning modernism; Jany Temimes costume design is largely pragmatic though an ivory Tom Ford tuxedo gives Craig what should be his most enduring Bond look across the four films give or take a certain pair of snug swimming trunks. Robust sound design and effects work all keep the pic rattling along without drawing overt attention to themselves; Thomas Newmans score on the other hand could probably stand a little more bombast. Lee Smiths cutting while taking some blame for the films initial narrative stalling is crisp and fluid on a scene-to-scene basis. As for the ensemble relieved by the script of any impulse to reinvent everyone on board appears to be having a good time -- enjoyment infectious enough to make auds overlook the relative workaday nature of Bonds final quest. (Bonds working days are more exciting than most of ours granted.) Given notably expanded duties this time is Whishaws Q (sadly not renamed In-Spectre Gadget for the purposes of this episode) who gets to venture beyond the equipment room with plucky good humor while reminding the errant agent that not everyone can afford his recklessness ""I have a mortgage and two cats to feed"" he chides sensibly. With Harris and Fiennes also settling amiably into their new MI6 positions the office seems in safe hands with or without Craigs anchoring steel.

Rollie says December 11 2015 at 831 pm Ok image quality of this one of the most expensive movies of all time. It want just me or a few here but a worldwide phenomenon - very poor image quality in theatres. It seems the multiplex houses dim the bulb on features to extend the life of the bulb 10 minutes of feckin commercials and a dim bulb Buh bye Reply Chinyere says December 11 2015 at 747 am lm hankering to see another black villain in James Bond movies. The last one appeared aeons ago in JBs Live and Let Die. Why the fixation on white guys anyway? Id like to see this usually powerful menacing larger than life character cast as Denzel Washington Delroy Lindo Samuel Jackson Ving Thames or even 50 cent. JB crew please could you spice things up a notch Reply Reggie says November 25 2015 at 604 pm I am a true JB fan But I would have to say that this iteration was horrible. I had a sinking feeling about the film when the opening action scene left me dissatisfied. It was too slow to develop and I actually left the film out of sheer boredom. This should never happen when watching a 007 movie. Definite let down in the aftermath of Skyfall Quantum and Casino Royale. Reply steven kovacs says November 24 2015 at 919 am As much as I enjoyed Spectre overall it is a let-down if compared to the sublime Skyfall and it seemed Craig was a bit bored maybe in this? Or distracted from various injuries on set? The big letdown is this Why do you get an incredible actor who is a double-Oscar winner in Christoph Waltz to play the villain and reduce his part to a near cameo?? Compared to Skyfall where Bardem carried the plot all the way through I think the leaked Sony emails about the issues with the script were more true than not as it is lacking clarity and depth of story. Stephanie Sigman and Monica Bellucci only in one-scene roles? Pity Reply lee954 says November 22 2015 at 211 pm It was okay nothing special though some terrible casting by the way.; far better than Craigs previous three Bond films which were awful especially the dreadful and dreary Skyfall. Reply rolloff says November 19 2015 at 1124 pm It looked really low res in the theatre I saw it in. Umatic blown up to 35 - ghastly Reply jay says November 17 2015 at 431 pm This was a really wordy and ""difficult read"" review - Id suggest you dont quite the day job or actually go look for one. Reply nick says November 11 2015 at 844 pm i dont know if most are bond enthusiasts or not... i read comments about craigs bond movies being boring but obviously bond had to come from somewhere so it was important to develop the character... he was rough dark hurt and haunted...i suspect that moving forward (if they decide to make more) that it will hark back to the days of Connery.. stylish slick smooth. Reply charlesbeale says November 8 2015 at 510 pm The bond between reality and the Hollywood movie industry has never been more bizarre or thinner. This most up to date version of Bond is predictable and trite in its calculations and screen presence.The film industry is now bankrupt of ideas and the latest Bond is no exception.

Like not buying another GM product because your 05 Chevy was a disappointment Reply H.M. says October 22 2015 at 1102 pm The last Mission Impossible film was so unexpectedly good to me and Sean Harris was so fabulous as the villain in it that I felt I had been in a pseudo Bond universe from it and was quite satisfied already. And honestly the Spectre trailer nor Christopher Waltz exposed scenes in it thrilled me. I still enjoyed Craigs first Bond the most. Skyfall 2nd and Quantum a boring mess made too quickly amp; haphazardly to reap the prior films bold launch.

My life now has meaning. Reply GoldenBalls says October 21 2015 at 659 pm Skyfall was the peak no need to reinvent. More of the same hopefully. Worries me the addition of more Moore-ish humour. Bond purists should try and celebrate the Bond of the books instead of the Octopussy Diamonds are Forever rubbish. Reply Daniel says October 22 2015 at 1011 am Diamonds Are Forever was Connerys last. But I understand your remake about the need for groan-worthy quips. The one from the trailer when Bond quips about needing an overdue holiday when asked by an infuriated M what he was doing in Mexico is hopefully the kind of humour kept to a minimum.

Daniel Craig has been slippery and circumspect when asked if Spectre will be his final outing as James Bond. From both the tone and content of Spectre wed guess this could be his swansong this is a film that gathers all the great - and some of the not-so-great - things about the three previous films in the Craig-as-Bond cycle into one rousing spectacular scattershot and somewhat overextended victory lap. It works - until it doesnt. We find Bond in Mexico City - its the Day of the Dead the perfect excuse for rampaging masked crowds unexpected explosions and a swooping supercharged helicopter sequence thatll have you choking on your popcorn. Then its back to London for some very bad news MI6s Double-0 program is under threat thanks to the machinations of creepy surveillance agent C (Andrew Scott) leaving old warhorses like M (Ralph Fiennes) Q (Ben Whishaw) and Bond himself facing the scrapheap. Which of course doesnt stop our James from speeding off to Rome Austria and north Africa on the trail of the titular band of assassins terrorists and all-round global troublemakers run by the literally shadowy Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz). So far so sleek and spellbinding director Sam Mendes exercises complete control over his material Craigs bruised bulldog charm is in full effect and the visuals by crack cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema are rich and ravishing. But somewhere between the introduction of Lea Seydouxs snappy but underwritten Madeleine Swann and some antics in the Sahara that unpleasantly (and wed assume unintentionally) recall the climax of Quantum of Solace the wheels come rattling off this Aston Martin. One major problem is a ridiculously unconvincing villain the script attempts to shoehorn a spot of Skyfall-style backstory between Bond and his enemy which sadly leaves the character looking more laughable than terrifying despite Waltzs best efforts. And this is reflective of Spectre as a whole in trying to do too much the focus becomes lost. As the second half unfolds the absence of an emotional core becomes ever more glaring hopping from one action beat to the next without ever asking us to care - or at times understand - whats going on. The result is an unbalanced but never less than entertaining film enthralling and deflating in roughly equal measure and studded with moments of true old-school glory. If this is Craigs farewell to the tux hes going out with a whole string of very loud bangs. Read our interview with Daniel Craig to find out what he thought about the film.

Despite being to long and at times too implausible even for Bond this production does succeed in what seemed like an impossible task hence the 4 stars. The final scene suggests that this is the last of Mendes/Craig Bonds and if so a very good way to end.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 5 20151 of 1 found helpfulChesca RTastemakerFeaturedThis movie gives you everything you need and want from a James Bond movie gadgets sexy bits tense moments and a super duper villain. There are not many surprises as the format is pretty classic but some of the stunts are very impressive. Bond is looking a little weary and its not surprising its been a busy time of late that said Daniel Craig does a magnificent job. The opening sequence is incredible and throughout the movie the scenery and settings are beautiful. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 4 20151 of 1 found helpfulNeil KTastemakerFeaturedIt was always going to be tough with Skyfall as its predecessor this film has a lot to live up to. While in many ways it does and is certainly a glossy stylised magazine of a movie I felt the tone was just that little bit too dark for Bond and as such it lacks the feel good factor of Skyfall which ends on a sunny London high. It is however blessed with an incredible opening sequence in Mexico City and possibly the best fight sequence on a train ever filmed which will have you on the edge of your seat and travels and cars galore. While it ticks all the bond boxes it feels a little forced at times and isnt the direction I was expecting this film to take at all but on the basis that I would thoroughly recommend you see it if you havent already then I guess I cant really knock it. However I wouldnt recommend it to a Bond virgin as the first Bond film to watch; of late that would be Casino Royale.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 4 20151 of 1 found helpfulLouise HTastemakerFeaturedI have watched the majority of the Bond films and although I like the slick new style with Daniel Craig I do miss the cheesy puns and humour of the Pierce Brosnan years. Spectre is no exception. Craigs Bond is ice cool with barely a flicker of emotion even as we delve into his troubled past. The opening sequence in Mexico is fantastic and probably the best bit of the film but it feels like a hard act to follow. There are the car chases the beautiful woman and the evil baddie trying to kill Bond but at the end it felt like it lacked something. Still a very good film howeverHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 4 20151 of 1 found helpfulRichard NTastemakerFeaturedIts my first Bond film (sacrilege I know) but I knew enough about the history to get by. Its a very fun film that brings viewers on a wild ride around the world. Some portions of the film definitely fell a little flat especially the villain and it sort of went into a messy spiral towards the end. Nevertheless some beautifully shot scenes here (the opening sequence truly draws you into the film) and I enjoyed it. If its Daniel Craigs last Bond film its a pity because he truly makes a fantastic 007. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 3 20151 of 1 found helpfulNicky GTastemakerFeaturedBond fans wont be disappointed. Car chases Bond girls and glamour - even if it doesnt quite beat Skyfall (at least for me) this is up there in the most spectacular and intense Bond films of all franchise.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 3 20151 of 1 found helpfulVicky TFeaturedBond fans youre in for a treat The much anticipated sequel of the franchise has everything that was expected action a few good fights (Craig is more fit than ever) cool spy gadgets and hideouts humour a bit of romance and amazing scene locations. On the downside it may not add a lot to what weve seen from Bond until now but its definitely closer to the classics than ever -which is what makes it stand out. While the feeling of closure is quite apparent trying to tie loose ends and explain the connection between everything that has happened until now it kind of creates a promise for a new beginning. The length of the movie makes the action scenes seem quite short but the fact that we get more of M Q and Moneypenny makes up for it Unfortunately the female characters remain secondary as always but that is something we have learnt to ignore. A must see for the fans and some light entertainment for everyone else- why miss it? Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 1 20151 of 1 found helpfulSarah GTastemakerFeaturedI love the glitz amp; glamour of Bond alongside the stunning locations amp; high octane action. In my view the current Bond slant is taking us too much down his emotions amp; losing the gloss I love. Call me shallow I think its time for a new chapter amp; so look forward to the next Bond being castHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 1 20151 of 1 found helpfulAlexandra LTastemakerFeaturedLets start of by admitting what we all know to be true; a meh Bond film is still a million stylish suited amp; booted miles ahead of most other films so you know youre always going to have a good time. The action will be punchy the cars will be fast the women will be gorgeous and the affably charming Q will ignite a full on geek-inspired crush...and its true that Spectre delivers all of those things and more...its just that well it feels like something is missing.Now maybe the fact that Skyfall was a spectacular Bond film means that the face of the franchise has been forever altered and as such there needs to be a new way of approaching them going forward or maybe it just couldnt fill the enormous boots of its powerful moving amp; beautifully shot predecessor but while Spectre ticked every Bond box there is I found myself willing it to be good and frankly if this is ever the case with a movie the battle is already lost.Dont get me wrong there are some outstanding moments; the Day of the Dead parade has me booking my tickets to Mexico City for next year already Lea Seydoux was the perfect blend of sexy amp; strong with a real girl vulnerability I enjoyed watching and the Famous Five vibe coming from M Q Moneypenny and Tanner as they scuttled around a sharply cut and moodily lit London was brilliant. All credit to Daniel Craig too who has elevated Bond from being a one track minded man of the underworld to someone who has actually grown and changed over the course of four films - when a chance appears for Bond to actually be happy and dare I say it perhaps laugh love amp; live life as it should be done you yearn for him to take it. However there were some wasted characters in the form of Andrew Scott whose Max Denbighe was woefully underwritten resulting in a sadly restrained and quite dull performance from a man whose Moriarty in Sherlock is mesmerising whenever hes on the screen and even worse from Christophe Waltz who was understated to the point of absurdity. Theres no denying the man can act - usually he effortlessly knocks everyone else off the screen - but here he had nothing to work with looked a tad bored at certain times and was frankly about as menacing as a jar of Marshmallow Fluff...so disappointing. By all means go and see this because youll certainly get a kick out of some of it...but if you were as in love with Skyfall as a piece of film-making and as a piece of Bond history prepare yourself to watch a film in Spectre that is altogether lighter and frothier.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 31 20151 of 1 found helpfulPopcorn PigFeaturedCasino Royale remains my favourite but SPECTRE definitely delivered everything I want and hope to see in a 007 film - apart from a memorable theme song.

Some of the cinematography was gorgeous though at times it also made me want to throw up (I dont do handicap/fast action shots well). I was SO happy to finally see a woman in Bonds age bracket in the film and for that woman to be Monica Bellucci well I mean it was just perfect. Naturally Bond was the usual debonair charmer though it felt even less believable in this film. The storyline relied quite a bit on the past Craig films though my companion said he didnt feel left out not having watched them. The saving grace for me was Christoph Waltz. He could act in a paper bag and Id pay to watch it. All in all its worth a watch but save your high expectations for something else.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 28 20151 of 1 found helpfulnicknicknTastemakerFeaturedThe Vogue photo-shoot BondSPECTRE is all about image. It is beautiful to watch; fantastic scene setting and great views right from the start. Everybody in it is good-looking and handsomely dressed. It is full of smart suits tuxedos suede and linen. Daniel Craigs accent is noticeably more clipped and RP than in previous films. The special effects and explosions are elegantly choreographed for drama and beauty. It has good one liners and it is nicely self referential. Lots of lovely shots of London.Is it a classic Bond movie?

Great set pieces and adrenaline-fuelled scenes. Daniel Craig is the deepest (and darkest) of all Bonds and he is so great at it. I found the film a bit long and some plot confusion here and there.

That said Casino Royale (2006) lived up to the hype and was a good story.  But ... to start Spectre with the day of the dead was far too similar in theme to Live and Let Die especially as skulls/death/etc were then the theme in the opening credits.  I dont think this repeated theme worked at all well.  Is this really the best the graphics dept/scriptwriters could come up with in the 3 years since Skyfall (equally bad with ""M"" - the head of MI5 - managing to get herself killed as she drew attention to herself while walking across a bleak dark highland with a lantern)?.I thought the opening scene in Mexico was okay but by no stretch as good as some action movies.  The ""Fast amp; Furious"" movies are better than Bond at car chases etc.  From then on Spectre should have been heavily edited.  2.5hrs for any movie is long especially when preceded by 30 mins of trailers.  Albert R Broccoli Productions need to revisit their business model as a wafer thin long story and borrowed themes do not make for good viewing.  I endured this movie for 1.5hrs but was bored rigid by a predictable story a good deal of which could have been cut and left a better movie.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Kemi OFeaturedLets be honest this was never going to be as good as Skyfall... so with that understanding in mind I was able to really enjoy Spectre Id heard a lot of negative reviews prior to watching but I think thats because there were unrealistic expectations attached to this movie. Im not a huge fan of Daniel Craig but I think his rigid aloof style conveyed Bond really well Action packed from beginning to end with beautiful backdrops that captured my attention throughout. Not the best Bond film but still worth a watchHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Alex PlimmoderatorStaff WriterFeaturedThis isnt a bad Bond film. Its just not one of the best Bond films - and thats what weve come to expect from the folks who gave us Skyfall and Casino Royale. It must be difficult to have a budget the size of Spectres and make a film that isnt entertaining - this movie has helicopters doing barrel rolls building blowing up in the desert and a punch-up on a train all of which is very fun to watch. But it doesnt quite connect in the same way the previous film did.There were some laughable moments when the film felt a little unbelievable even for Bond and it certainly felt like there was a lightness that was missing from Skyfall but there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours in a cinema.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 30 2015jutneyTastemakerFeaturedAmazingly horrible Im not a 007 fan (this was the first I saw with Daniel Craig in the role) but still I wasnt prepared for that They are not even trying to make it somewhat believable in any way. Or not even one scene that wasnt a cliche... I know I wouldnt watch an example of feminist film but (seriously?) in 2015 still with the guy thing the car obsession the insubordination/stubbornness (that of course is irresistibly charming) the age inappropriate girls...[The older Bond girl (beautiful Monica Bellucci) is there for 5 seconds in a completely pointless role.] The film is just disappointing in every way.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 29 2015Tara PTastemakerFeaturedAlthough there were some beautiful locations and exciting action sequences (the Rome car chase being my personal favourite) the Bond brand is beginning to feel old tired and a tad too misogynistic for my tastes.

When a phone that takes pictures and has an in-built map was an advanced gadget only available to secret agents and not an everyday reality. The cold war threat the silver screen glamour and sophistication (before men other than cowboys wore jeans). When secret agents regularly traveled to the far the corners of the world before it became accessible to everyone via low budget airlines. When MI6 was a secret organisation that didnt officially exist (before a google search would turn up images of the actual head of MI6) Wouldnt that make a fantastic backdrop to Bond?

Essentially theyre action flicks with a cheesy far-fetched plot. Doesnt sound like the makings of a decent movie. However the combo of Mendes amp; Craig has produced some of the best Bond in recent memory. Spectre definitely feels like the end of the road though. A spectacular Day of the Dead opening is followed up by a drawn out plot with tenuous links to Bonds gone by. Craig deserves a lot of credit for the amount of actual stunt work carried out himself but the rest of the casting feels a little too popular rather than right for the character. Andrew Scott in particular as the evil head of a worldwide security service doesnt look old enough to be convincing. Nowhere near as good as Skyfall and basically a half-arsed attempt to bring to an end Craigs tenure.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 9 2015Julie RTastemakerFeaturedIt does what it says on the tin.Im not really into James Bond films having only seen about one or two previously but having a Cineworld unlimited card I thought I should go and see the big films of the year.It has all the ingredients that you would expect from a Bond film.  I think it looked like there may have been several references to previous films in it which would have been lost on me apart from one reference which I recognised more from Austin Powers than James Bond.The film was OK but went on a bit too long.

Its a sleek stylish film which ticks all the Bond boxes. Loving Miss Moneypenny amp; Q and Andrew Scott was a welcome addition as C. I really enjoyed this amp; the time flew.

This bloated tuxedo has a lot more in common (if faring slightly better in terms of pace and snappy title) with its ill fated predecessor Quantum of Solace. Sure theres explosions car chases and increasingly improbable love scenes (who doesnt jump straight into some rumpy pumpy after brutally beating up thugs?) but it feels a lot more formulaic  than previous installments as if director Sam Mendes was given a formula to make the perfect Bond but forgot to put some soul in amongst the blatant watch and car advertisements.

It ticks all the Bond boxes 5 countries over 3 continents huge fight scenes every kind of vehicle sexy ladies and a bit of an actual narrative. But Skyfall and Casino Royal did the emotional storytelling better. The opening scene in Mexico City is fantastic and it almost keeps up the momentum through the rest of the film.

The film and Bond became almost a parody of old Bond with corny one liners and a sketchy story line.  I was excited when I heard Waltz had been cast as the baddie but he didnt have any chance to shine the plot was flimsy and his character was light weight not even close to Bardem in Skyfall.

I chose not to over think the plot (whats the point its so far fetched) covered my eyes wimpishly at the gruesome eye-ball squeezing scene and rolled my eyes and tutted as Monica Bellucci falls gratefully into Bonds arms post rescue (in 2015??)But enjoy it I did. It is pure out and out entertainment. A great spectacle delivering fast punchy scenes with amazing cinematography clever CGI and chase scenes that are trademark Bond. Every male fantasy cliche was featured in the film from gorgeous women and a beautiful car to a watch that doubles up as a weapon and easy available sex. But if you dont take it too seriously (and I dont) then just sit back tune into your inner macho and enjoy the ride - especially spectacular London scenes.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 2 20150 of 1 found helpfulKishma STastemakerFeaturedThis is Bond by numbers. Gadgets check. Villain in villainous liar check. Hot girl you get the picture. This definitely feels like Craigs farewell to Bond all loose ends are nicely tied off which I found distracting in its obviousness. Spectre is entertaining thats for sure but the installment of Bond didnt offer anything new or exciting.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 30 20150 of 1 found helpfulBabs - Working Girl LondonTastemakerFeaturedIf you love James Bond then Spectre is a great film As a standalone film its average but still enjoyable. The film is very topical with big brother information society being at the centre of it. The villain is played excellently by Christoph Waltz and Sherlocks Moriarty did well to make me see him as C and not Moriarty by the end of the film. There is some stunning scenery and the usual explosions but not quite as much action and mind blowing gadgets as I expected. The movie is definitely worth seeing (isnt every Bond movie?) but not as good as Skyfall in my opinion.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 30 20150 of 2 found helpfulGeorge PFeaturedYou can usually tell how bad a film is when you see the production team clearly dont know how to end itA half-decent movie up to the middle (Tangiers) goes downhill fast from then on..Poor plot predictable and slow painfully bad to watch towards the end..Easily the worst among Daniel Craigs Bond films and a good candidate for the worst Bond film ever..It was sad to watch how the writer/director were unable to use the brilliant Christoph Waltz.An actor with the potential to be the best Bond villain ever was made to look harmless/colourless.One star for cinematography/costumes/car chases. We need a new Bond film fast Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/spectre,200,spectre45,spectre,timeout
