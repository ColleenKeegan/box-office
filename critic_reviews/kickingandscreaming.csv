At 26 he already has a rare gift for lines that sound casual and spontaneous yet spin and glimmer on screen like so many verbal pinwheels. Kicking and Screaming charts the wayward routines of four brainy young slackers who move in together the fall semester after college graduation. That may sound like a contradiction (people who graduate dont have fall semesters) but the fact that these guys insist on carrying on exactly as if they were students is half the joke. The other half is that on a level theyll scarcely acknowledge theyre deeply embarrassed by their predicament. And so they shroud their aimlessness in thickets of wit triviality and confessional asides most of which go by so quickly that youll do a double take before you see how revealing they are. ""Are you wearing mascara?"" inquires the heartlessly observant Max (Chris Eigeman) of his housemate the lumbering insecure Otis (Carlos Jacott). ""No [Pause. Stricken look. Quiet voice.] Yes."" The ironies are delivered with straight-faced aplomb and the rare honest comment is tossed off as if it were a meaningless jape. The hairline between facetiousness and frankness creates an oddball suspense Its never clear beneath their polished mockery just when these jokers are going to tip their hands. The performers interlock with a dexterity that at times rivals that of the Seinfeld ensemble. Eigeman as always is a hilarious cold fish Jacott is a one-man study in self-justifying paralysis (the funniest scene in the movie is his quivering interview for a video-store job) and Jason Wiles is nicely blitzed as a guy who appears to bathe in his own hormones. What distinguishes Baumbach from a raised-eyebrow prankster like Metropolitans Whit Stillman is that his cleverness conceals a ruefully romantic temperament. Grover (Josh Hamilton) the most pensive of the four spends his days meditating on his lost girlfriend (Olivia dAbo) who left him to go to Prague. Any suspicion that this is one more rote story of horny young men is dispelled by the flashbacks between these two. DAbos Jane with her gopherish grin and halting rhythms is a character who sneaks up on you -- a blues traveler caught in a postfeminist two-step between shyness and aggression. The final affirmation of this romance is really an affirmation of Baumbachs talent that a young filmmaker fixated on the solipsistic rituals of guyhood understands the hearts of women too.

"Kicking and Screaming (R) Kicking and Screaming (R) By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer November 17 1995 In ""Kicking and Screaming"" Noah Baumbachs hilariously insightful comedy about a group of college graduates preparing to enter the ""real world"" the characters may be the future leaders of America but they arent exactly rushing out to seize the day. Their heads are jammed with all sorts of knowledge but instead of applying it usefully they idle away their days playing games testing each others acumen with periodic challenges. ""Name five movies with monkeys in the title."" Or should that prove too easy ""Name five empiricist philosophers."" Set in an unnamed college town somewhere in the Northeast the movie centers on four friendsGrover (Josh Hamilton) Max (Chris Eigeman) Otis (Carlos Jacott) and Skippy (Jason Wiles). Groverwho is based partly on Baumbach himselfis the unofficial leader of this bratty alienated pack and the main focus of the movie but that doesnt mean he has a clue as to what to do with his life. A nice chunk of the film is devoted to Grover and his relationship with Jane (Olivia DAbo) a quick-witted writing student with whom he has fallen in love. At the party just after graduation though Jane tells him she is leaving to study abroad in Prague. ""Really"" he replies. ""And just how would that work with us living in Brooklyn?"" The news doesnt send Grover into a funk; hes already there. All of these guys are in fact. Instead of enjoying their youth these perplexed friends seem eager to have lifes adventures behind themto be old even before theyve lived. Most days Max sits around the house doing crossword puzzles while Otis (whom Jacott turns into a hilarious comic screw-up) attempts unsuccessfully to leave town for graduate school. Baumbach approaches his topic of generational angst as a modern coming-of-age story and in both style and spirit he is closer to Rohmer and Truffaut than the creators of most recent ""twentysomething"" films. As a writer Baumbach loves smart glib talk and he has a sharp ear for fast-paced overlapping dialogue; as a director though he prefers long takes that allow his characters to work out their feelings. At the same time the movie barrels through its story with the brisk efficiency of a 30s screwball comedy. Though the characters chatter endlessly they seem to use conversation almost as a tactic for avoiding the real issues confronting them. In a flashback of their first meeting the more serious Jane criticizes one of Grovers stories because of his characters absorption in such trivial issues as the sexiest model in the Victorias Secret catalogue. Grover of course doesnt see it that way. (""There were some really fantastic models in this issue."") Jane on the other hand sees the expenditure of all that brainpower on such nonsense as a depressing waste. As a rule the women in the film are more mature more directed than their male counterparts. (Parker Posey is particularly strong in a small role.) Most of the men are like Jacotts Otis a fully grown giant of a man who thinks of himself as shrunken and scared. (""Im too small to do what the bigger boys can do"" he says.) As Jane DAbo is something of a revelation. A former ""Bond girl"" DAbo gives her character an anxious high-strung appeal; shes both neurasthenic and strong. (I loved the way she uses Janes retainer popping it in and out for dramatic emphasis.) As Grover Hamilton is more recessive but he also shows a nice light touch for comedy particularly in scenes like the one in which he forbids his hapless father (a sublimely depressed Elliot Gould) to reveal the more intimate details of his sex life. Such scenes underline the shifting relationships between parents and children as vividly as any in recent memory. In general Baumbachs eye for generational detail is impeccablehe knows whats on these kids minds and has found a language to express it. Hes savvy enough to know for example that Prague has become a cliche. Hes also aware that growing up is a matter of tiny steps. By the end of the picture the characters havent progressed much but they do seem to have gotten started. And that at least is something. Kicking and Screaming is rated R.

At 26 he already has a rare gift for lines that sound casual and spontaneous yet spin and glimmer on screen like so many verbal pinwheels. Kicking and Screaming charts the wayward routines of four brainy young slackers who move in together the fall semester after college graduation. That may sound like a contradiction (people who graduate dont have fall semesters) but the fact that these guys insist on carrying on exactly as if they were students is half the joke. The other half is that on a level theyll scarcely acknowledge theyre deeply embarrassed by their predicament. And so they shroud their aimlessness in thickets of wit triviality and confessional asides most of which go by so quickly that youll do a double take before you see how revealing they are. ""Are you wearing mascara?"" inquires the heartlessly observant Max (Chris Eigeman) of his housemate the lumbering insecure Otis (Carlos Jacott). ""No [Pause. Stricken look. Quiet voice.] Yes."" The ironies are delivered with straight-faced aplomb and the rare honest comment is tossed off as if it were a meaningless jape. The hairline between facetiousness and frankness creates an oddball suspense Its never clear beneath their polished mockery just when these jokers are going to tip their hands. The performers interlock with a dexterity that at times rivals that of the Seinfeld ensemble. Eigeman as always is a hilarious cold fish Jacott is a one-man study in self-justifying paralysis (the funniest scene in the movie is his quivering interview for a video-store job) and Jason Wiles is nicely blitzed as a guy who appears to bathe in his own hormones. What distinguishes Baumbach from a raised-eyebrow prankster like Metropolitans Whit Stillman is that his cleverness conceals a ruefully romantic temperament. Grover (Josh Hamilton) the most pensive of the four spends his days meditating on his lost girlfriend (Olivia dAbo) who left him to go to Prague. Any suspicion that this is one more rote story of horny young men is dispelled by the flashbacks between these two. DAbos Jane with her gopherish grin and halting rhythms is a character who sneaks up on you -- a blues traveler caught in a postfeminist two-step between shyness and aggression. The final affirmation of this romance is really an affirmation of Baumbachs talent that a young filmmaker fixated on the solipsistic rituals of guyhood understands the hearts of women too.
