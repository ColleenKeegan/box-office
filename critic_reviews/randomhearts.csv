The general public that demonstrated its tolerant indifference to agonizing over adultery re ""Eyes Wide Shut"" not to mention the Clinton-Lewinsky affair will get a chance to do so again with ""Random Hearts."" An ideal rainy-day matinee attraction for well-to-do ladies of a certain age Sydney Pollacks immaculately crafted anachronism hearkens back in its relative restraint and civility to the likes of ""Brief Encounter."" Harrison Fords drawing power will no doubt generate a measure of initial B.O. but pics somber sobriety and deliberate pace combined with an utter lack of allure for anyone under about 40 spells a short theatrical visit for such a major star-director vehicle. In fact the story based on a 1984 novel by Warren Adler is about the retroactive discovery of adultery but its a realization that haunts the protagonists throughout the films protracted running time. The reluctant but eventual lovers are the opposite of star-crossed two people uncomfortably thrust together solely because their respective spouses are killed in a plane crash on their way to an illicit rendezvous. Carefully decked out with detailed exposition yarn takes 45 minutes to bring its leading characters together. Sgt. Dutch Van Den Broeck (Ford) of the Internal Affairs division of the Washington D.C. police force lives in exceedingly pleasant suburban comfort with a beautiful wife who on the fateful day initiates some morning hanky-panky before they each head for work. When Dutch hears of the crash of a Miami-bound airliner into Chesapeake Bay he thinks nothing of it. Similarly Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) a patrician congresswoman from New Hampshire has no idea that her husband was headed for Florida believing that he was flying to New York. In scenes that reveal far more than any viewer will ever want to learn firsthand about how airlines deal with the aftermath of a catastrophe Dutch and Kay react very differently to the news of their spouses deaths Dutch with deep grief cut through with quickly growing certainty that his wife was having an affair Kay with emotional denial and the pragmatic calculation of a born politician. Intent upon learning the full truth as a way of absorbing and eventually coming to terms with his loss Dutch hits a brick wall in his initial approaches to Kay who finds that her tragedy appears to be helping her bid for reelection. But when Kay joins Dutch in a quick visit to Miami to observe the seductive setting for what theyve learned was a long-term affair between their mutual mates the media picks up the scent spelling PR trouble for Kay. ""Sooner or later everybody knows everything"" Dutch gravely and rather truthfully warns Kay before they lunge at each other in a car in an assaultively amorous physical display that is both convincingly urgent as an explosion of pent-up feeling and borderline embarrassing in its abruptness and desperation. Concerned about how the news and inevitable media storm will affect her teenage daughter (an appealingly mature and nuanced Kate Mara) Kay vacillates about continuing her election campaign as well as about deepening her involvement with her earnest policeman who has become professionally preoccupied with some rather murky and dramatically lame goings-on with the forces undercover cops in the inner city. This being the 90s the dual climaxes involve sex and then gunplay the former handled in a plausibly understated way the latter in a manner melodramatically out of keeping with the rest of the drama. As written by frequent Pollack collaborator Kurt Luedtke (""adaptation"" is credited to Darryl Ponicsan) its all very adult very serious and very legitimate in regard to honestly projecting responses to the adverse circumstances the characters have to deal with. In its reserved way the film also seems deeply felt in the manner it keeps thrashing through the correct responses to the situation. But its also laborious remote and strangely uninvolving for the audience despite the fact that sudden personal loss is something everyone can fear and presumably identify with. There is a hushed quality to the enterprise a sensitivity that feels more intellectual than emotional an effort to withhold that is meant ultimately to pay off in a surge of feeling that never happens. This impression is reinforced by the lead performances. Much in the manner of Pollacks longtime leading man Robert Redford an ear-studded Ford keeps an iron grip on what his heart is going through delivering all his lines with a flat stoicism through which deep emotion is meant gradually to seep. Ford knows what hes doing in this regard but it doesnt really work this time. Redfords most recent leading lady Scott Thomas sporting an American accent is aggravatingly and intentionally off-putting through the early going and while she softens nicely in the intimate interludes it isnt enough. Final airport scene between the two crucially lacks the intended poignant resonance. Pics impeccable craftsmanship offers its own rewards. Philippe Rousselots pastel-dominated cinematography is beautifully shaded the Eastern seaboard locations are evocatively diverse Barbara Lings production design pinpoints the characters milieu with precision and Dave Grusins attractive jazz score is conducive to emotional contemplation. Supporting turns are vivid but limited with the director giving himself a good role as Kays often exasperated media consultant.

Ford is a Washington D.C. police sergeant and Scott Thomas a New Hampshire congresswoman up for re-election whose spouses die in a plane crash. Ford discovers that the departed spouses were secret lovers and becomes obsessed with uncovering the details of their adulterous affair boorishly dragging Scott Thomas into his search for the awful truth. The film assumes that we will find his quest interesting. It isnt. Even less gripping is a jerry-built subplot about Fords pursuit of a crooked cop. It takes forever for this portentous drama to get to the inevitable moment when the chilly congresswoman melts in the dogged cops arms and when it does the heat generated by these two attractive stars barely rises above room temperature.

Answer Learning she was on her way to a weekend rendezvous with her lover. Harrison Ford sporting one of his worst haircuts and (for some reason) an earring spends the film looking as if he wants to cry and strangle stray pedestrians at the same time. He falls in love with his fellow spouse-in-mourning (Kristin Scott Thomas) and the movie turns into a ponderous piece of bereavement porn.

Starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. Directed by Sydney Pollack. Written by Kurt Luedtke. (R. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Random Hearts"" the Harrison Ford movie that opens today is Hollywood hit-making at its efficient formulaic worst. Technically theres not much to fault -- and yet its so familiar so predictable and so interchangeable with dozens of other other overbudgeted carefully packaged star vehicles that one might as well watch the trailer and fill in the blanks. Harrison Ford is perfectly fine as Dutch Van Den Broeck a sergeant in the Internal Affairs branch of the Washington D.C. police. Hes no less dynamic and appealing than he has ever been but if he keeps making movies like ""Random Hearts"" or ""Sabrina"" also directed by Sydney Pollack his fans are likely to bail on him en masse. ""Random Hearts"" is pablum a piece of boilerplate cinema with no ambition but to sedate and pacify us. Theres nothing new here just the same plot the same romantic pattern (""I hate you get lost -- I love you dont go"") that we keep seeing over and over. Unlike the bracing imaginative ""The Limey"" which also opens today and probably cost a fraction of this films budget ""Random Hearts"" plays like the result of a computer program that crunches marketing data and box-office trends and spits out safe unchallenging eyewash. Written by Kurt Luedtke who also penned ""Absence of Malice"" and ""Out of Africa"" for Pollack ""Random Hearts"" is about two people who have to improvise new lives when their spouses die in the crash of a Miami-bound jetliner. When Ford discovers that his young fashionable wife (Susanna Thompson) was sitting next to the husband (Peter Coyote) of a Republican congresswoman (Kristin Scott Thomas) he pursues the politi cian and learns that the dead pair were secret lovers. True to form in Hollywood ""product"" like this Ford and Scott Thomas clash at first -- she doesnt want her husbands dirty laundry aired especially since shes running for re-election -- but eventually tumble into bed. Im not revealing anything that isnt trumpeted in the trailer for ""Random Hearts"" or isnt obvious as soon as this mismatched pair meet. Hollywood movies often transcend this kind of material by matching up charismatic stars but Scott Thomas the British actress who played Ralph Fiennes lover in ""The English Patient"" and Robert Redfords interest in ""The Horse Whisperer"" is a huge liability. Her character is supposed to be frosty at first -- a shrewd careerist protecting her turf and her 15-year-old daughter -- but even in the scenes where her ice is supposed to melt shes weirdly detached. Scott Thomas manages a semi- convincing American accent and shes obviously got talent but her innate coldness and formality are guaranteed scene-killers. That same thing happened in ""The English Patient"" which was so hobbled by Scott Thomas and Fiennes lack of chemistry that the focus fell by default to the Juliet Binoche-Naveen Andrews romance. When the big thaw occurs and Ford and Scott Thomas go for the clinch in a parked car their passion looks weird unearned and Hollywood-preposterous. It comes out of nowhere and it drew several unintended laughs at a recent preview screening. More chortles erupted when Scott Thomas waxed philosophical ""You know those drugstore kits that tell you when youre pregnant? They should have one that tells you when youre sane."" (Or when youre dull?) A supporting cast bravely tries to prop up the sagging ""Random Hearts."" Charles S. Dutton is Fords internal-affairs colleague and Bonnie Hunt is Scott Thomas campaign worker a tart Eve Arden type who hides her own secret beneath a cheery always-the-bridesmaid persona. Kudos to both of them to Ford and to Dave Grusins nice understated jazz score. They do good work but its done in service to a hopelessly bland piece of machinery -- a movie thats desperate to please but bereft of ideas. ..
