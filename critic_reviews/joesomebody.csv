Cleverly positioned just two days after ""The Lord of the Rings"" opening this benign PG-rated venture should serve as ideal counter-programming for parents of younger children and families seeking to avoid long ""Rings"" lines. The team of thesp Tim Allen and helmer John Pasquin reunite for a third round of box office alchemy in the pleasant ""Joe Somebody."" Cleverly positioned just two days after ""The Lord of the Rings"" opening this benign PG-rated venture should serve as ideal counter-programming for parents of younger children and families seeking to avoid long ""Rings"" lines. While the sheer glut of holiday product seems sure to keep ""Joes"" grosses closer to those of 1997s ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" than to 1994s ""The Santa Clause"" (which remains Allens highest-grossing live action pic) Fox can expect a comfortable ride through the holiday season with this agreeably commercial attraction. Allens Joe Scheffer is a divorced middle-management shlub stuck in a dead-end job at a large pharmaceuticals company making corporate videos promoting the latest wonder drugs (with a heart-stopping list of side-effects). Its one of those unsatisfying drone-type jobs and the joke is that Joe is so far enmeshed in this Orwellian anonymity he barely has time to feel sorry for himself. But when a bully co-worker (Patrick Warburton) humiliates Joe in front of his own daughter (Hayden Panettiere) Joe becomes a man on a mission to kick butt. Joe enlists the aid of a stoned karate sensei (a very funny Jim Belushi eerily resembling Oliver Stone). After the obligatory montages of Joe ""getting tough"" the people in Joes life start to see him differently and he becomes something of a star at the office. Actually theyre seeing him for the first time with the exception of Joes daughter and his beautiful co-worker Meg (Julie Bowen) who didnt much mind him the way that he was. On its own John Scott Shepherds script is pretty formulaic stuff bland self-empowerment tinged with warm fuzzies in all the right places. But what makes this ""Somebody"" something is Pasquins deft touch and understanding with the material. The director really ""gets"" middlebrow-ness setting his ""Joe Somebody"" against an antiseptic suburbia in which everything from the sprawling Microsoft-esque ""campus"" where Joe works to the fortress-like middle school his daughter attends is an icy prefabrication trying to seem homey. He understands Joes desire to be ""just one of the guys"" and hes sharp on showing how the earliest schoolyard distinctions between the cool and uncool kids carry over into the business world. Playing squash at the company gym and singing karaoke in a popular bar benefit Joe both professionally and personally because in this environment where most everyone strives to be like everyone else the more you aspire to be average the more successful you are. In another movie Joe would ultimately have to choose between his two selves. The point would be that while playing the popular jock was fun for a while thats just not who he is. And to satisfy the fairy-tale schematic Joe would finally put on his unproduced play or get back together with his ex (Kelly Lynch) who suddenly finds him sexy again because he proved he could be everything he wasnt when they were together. Thankfully Pasquin is smarter and world-wearier than that keeping things grounded in reality and asking us to make up our own minds about whats right for Joe Scheffer. He also gets the best out of Allen whose lazy summery presence is pics winningest asset. As in ""The Santa Clause"" Allen seems to personify ""relaxing into character""; watching him puts you at ease. Ultimately Pasquin switches to autopilot mode. He rolls out the expected pacifist message about how fighting doesnt solve anything and how Joe can now assert himself without raising his fists (though he does tussle in one scene because the movie wants to have its cake and eat it too). And in the final needlessly sentimental moments George S. Clintons score swells into such a treacly torrent you have to hold on to your seat to avoid being washed away. But by this point not unlike its own protagonist ""Joe Somebody"" has briefly risen above the crowd in a way we had no reason to expect.

Starring Eduardo Noriega and Marisa Paredes. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro. (Rated R. 106 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Gothic horror lingering fascism and a childs bravery come together in ""The Devils Backbone"" an entertaining ghost yarn from Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro (""Mimic""). Throw in intergenerational sex a stash of gold ingots and a few jars of deformed fetuses and youve got the makings of an exotic brew. Young Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is the hero a bookish lad sent to an isolated desert orphanage where he meets a bully (Inigo Garces) an evil caretaker (Eduardo Noriega) and the embittered one-legged widow (Marisa Paredes) of a leftist poet. This material is actually subdued for Del Toro who also made ""Cronos"" but its wicked fun nonetheless. Being a receptive child Carlos hears and sees the ravaged lonely ghost thats taken up residence in the orphanage basement. Through pluck and purity of thought he triumphs over the nasty caretaker and brings out a greater humanity in the one-legged widow and a kindly old science professor (Federico Luppi). Del Toro creates tension with taut pacing and a spooky soundtrack reminiscent of David Lynch that mixes gurgling a ghouls cries and the screech of mechanical gears. He has fun with the widows prosthetic leg and takes us into the professors lab where fetuses swim in a ""limbo water"" solution of spices and rum. ""I sell it in town"" the professor says of the solution ""and the money keeps the school going."" Partly a childs empowerment fantasy partly an allegory about war and justice ""The Devils Backbone"" allows Del Toro to combine horror idioms with his own brand of gothic humor. The film doesnt explore the nature of ghosts as it promises to initially but its fun to watch Del Toro confront death and fear with such energy and humor. Advisory This film contains violence raw language and sexual situations. -- Edward Guthmann JIMMY NEUTRON BOY GENIUS Animation. Starring the voices of Debi Derryberry Rob Paulsen and Patrick Stewart. Directed by John A. Davis. (G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" is an inventive and intermittently amusing animated movie about a boy genius who without trying manages to get every adult in his neighborhood abducted by space aliens. The picture avoids a pitfall common to modern animated films It doesnt cast enormously famous actors in the lead roles and permit them to infect the soundtrack with a torrent of shrill unfunny shtick designed to showcase their personalities at the expense of the story. ""Jimmy Neutron"" plays it fairly straight casting talented voice-over artists in the lead roles -- Debi Derryberry as Jimmy and Rob Paulsen as his best friend Carl -- and using Patrick Stewart Martin Short and comedian Andrea Martin for much smaller character parts. In the first scene of the movie Jimmy launches a space probe which attracts the attention of a malevolent race of egglike creatures from a distant galaxy who like to eat human beings. Most of the movie is about what Jimmy and his friends do to rescue their parents in the aftermath of the alien abduction. The jokes clearly scripted -- not improvised -- are often clever and the soundtrack made up in large part of New Wave classics -- the Ramones ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" the Go-Gos ""We Got the Beat"" and a cover of Kim Wildes ""Kids in America"" -- is unexpected and welcome. The movies main flaw a common one among animated features is that it takes an hour and a half to do in an ultimately tiresome way what it might have done brilliantly in 30 minutes. ""Jimmy Neutron"" just doesnt have enough power to sustain itself to feature length though children -- the movies real audience -- may be so dazzled by the spectacle of Jimmy flying through space with his robot dog that they wont notice. -- Mick LaSalle JOE SOMEBODY Comedy. Starring Tim Allen James Belushi. Directed by John Pasquin. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Boy does Tim Allen take some beatings in ""Joe Somebody."" First hes smacked by an office bully then by a groin-seeking missile of a squash ball and then in scenes of agonizing repetition for both Allens character and the audience by his beery self-defense instructor (James Belushi). These cheap shots account for a few cheap laughs in a movie that really has more serious concerns. ""Joe Somebody"" is an odd picture a rumination on depression and self-discovery thats couched as an office comedy. While never truly funny or insightful the movie works intermittently by digging a little deeper than you might expect. Allen whos always had a bit of the sad clown about him evokes sympathy as a middle-aged guy jolted into action after a life of quiet desperation. He plays Joe Scheffer a recent divorce and devoted dad with little to show for his years of service to a pharmaceutical company besides a spot in the parking lot. When the office creep -- played by the wonderfully impassive Patrick Warburton from ""Seinfeld"" -- invades that space Joe challenges him. The bully responds by slapping Joe around in front of his daughter and co- workers. The humiliation sends Joe into a tailspin. Director John Pasquin (""The Santa Clause"") uses a cinematic cheat sheet of stubble beer cans and pizza boxes to depict Joes breakdown but Allen gives the scenes emotional weight. His slack face and downcast eyes show the guys slumped spirit. To get out of his funk Joe sets up a rematch with the bully a move that wins him new friends at work. He also starts dressing better and slicking back his hair. Though these improvements are obviously ephemeral seeing Allen puff with newfound pride has an irresistible underdog tug. Belushi gets some fun moments as a washed-up Steven Seagal-like action hero whos been reduced to training regular jerks like Joe. He tells Joe he read about the parking-lot scuffle in ""The News of the Wuss"" a line thats dumb enough and delivered well enough to draw one of the pictures few genuine laughs. But their ""Karate Kid"" bits soon become tiresome and flat. Pathos and humor can be combined effectively but the humor has to be more incisive than a guy getting kicked in the privates. Advisory This film contains raw language violence. -- Carla Meyer HOW HIGH Comedy. Starring Method Man and Redman. Directed by Jesse Dylan. (R. At Bay Area theaters. 96 minutes.) ""How High"" doesnt look like a movie somebody made. It looks like a movie somebody hallucinated and put up on the screen. It is a complete goof-off apparently in the making and certainly in the viewing. Along the way it nonetheless manages to prompt a couple of decent laughs and a bunch of half-decent ones too. I ask you who wouldnt laugh at the body of John Q. Adams dug up from his grave? Hip-hop artists Method Man (of the Wu-Tang Clan) and Redman play a couple of Staten Island stoners made Harvard material by some super grass. Make that supernatural grass because it comes from beyond the grave along with one of their old buddies who went up in smoke so to speak. Man and Redman proceed to turn the tables and educate Harvard. The zonked- out buddies come across a snooty black dean (Obba Babatunde) who looks down on them the gorgeous daughter (Essence Atkins) of the U.S. vice president (Jeffrey Jones) and someone called Baby Powder (Mike Epps) who goes around slapping people in the face with baby powder. Jones (""Amadeus"") isnt the only reasonably well-known face who seems to wander into this picture almost by accident. Others include Fred Willard Hector Elizondo and Spalding Gray. It seems like a project that everybody involved went into with good faith and high spirits but about halfway through said ah the hell with it. Sex jokes gross-out jokes doper jokes snob jokes and the like all bounce off each other hit or miss until the movie abruptly stops. It doesnt end; it just stops. Who dealt this mess? Danny DeVito is one of the producers. Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time. Advisory This film contains raw language pervasive drug use. -- Bob Graham  THE TURANDOT PROJECT  Documentary. Featuring Zubin Mehta and Zhang Yimou. Directed by Allan Miller. (Not rated. 84 minutes. In English Italian and Chinese with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In 1997 conductor Zubin Mehta and film director Zhang Yimou (""Raise the Red Lantern"") began collaborating on a production of Puccinis ""Turandot"" that was performed the next year in the Forbidden City of Beijing. Presumably theres an interesting yarn buried in the project but Allan Millers drab diffuse documentary never quite locates it. Instead Miller -- who made the Oscar-winning documentaries ""Bolero"" and ""From Mao to Mozart"" -- pieces together plenty of footage without conveying what the story is meant to be. Is it about Mehtas foolish quest to produce an ""authentic"" (i.e. Chinese) version of ""Turandot""? Or Zhangs nervous efforts to stage a difficult production in a genre about which he clearly knows very little? At times ""The Turandot Project"" plays like the most generic of backstage reportage. We see a rainstorm delay the final rehearsal the stagehands muff their cues seamstresses sew the incredibly opulent costumes and a soprano (Sharon Sweet) throw a mild diva fit over some headgear shes supposed to wear. These things arent uninteresting -- watching an opera production take shape always has a certain fascination -- but the narrative is shapeless and ungainly. Miller does throw in a few delicious touches particularly a sly glimpse of the Chinese soldiers who serve as supers proving unable to heed their superiors command to ""pay no attention to the ballet girls."" The most exciting drama though comes from Guido Levi the articulate truculent and charming lighting designer who goes head to head with Zhang (though not eye to eye -- the two squabble through an interpreter without ever looking at each other). More of him and less of the American singers shopping for food in Beijings markets wouldve helped this movie enormously. -- Joshua Kosman Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

Its plot is not only stale its been stale for decades. The lonely nerd who gets a makeover then gains new confidence in himself resulting in acceptance from his peers then through a series of contrived plot devices hes faced with a moral dilemma and must risk losing that newfound acceptance in order to be true to his real self and thereby ""do the right thing"" -- sound familiar? It should its been done ad nauseum. Allen plays said nerd Joe Scheffer. Hes the Rodney Dangerfield of the pharmaceutical company he works for in the all-American city of Minneapolis Minnesota. He gets no respect kicked around by his ex-wife his boss and his co-workers. The only living human being who understands him is his pre-teen daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere last seen in ""Remember the Titans"").

Unless youre a jerk. In which case be somebody else."" Now here comes Joe Somebody to refute the sermon. This standard-transmission vehicle teaches that being yourself is always better than being somebody else. Because even if youre a jerk--assuming youre a Tim Allen kind of jerk which is to say an attractively imperfect middle-aged white guy--its better to be authentic than to fake it. Here Allen plays Joe Scheffer a mild-mannered divorced video specialist at a Minnesota pharmaceuticals company whose losing encounter with an office bully (Patrick Warburton) inspires him to beef up his personality with input from a strip-mall martial-arts teacher (Jim Belushi). It turns out that at least two chicks liked the old Joe better his overly wise 12-year-old daughter (Hayden Panettiere) and a sunshiny colleague (Eds Julie Bowen) who being single and successful naturally has miseries of her own including a lecherous boss (Greg Germann). It turns out that Joe ends up liking the old Joe better too. Who just so happens to be the kind of average-Joe character that continues to make Allen such a tidy non-Joe bundle.
