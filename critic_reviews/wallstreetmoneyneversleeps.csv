Its a similar tale of real and surrogate fathers of greed and charity against the backdrop of the recent banking crises. Echoing Charlie Sheens Bud Fox in the original Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a smart young trader at a New York bank where he has the mentorship of an old-school boss (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing cash into an eco-business. But theres a market crash and an aggressive takeover by rival boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin all cigars and motorbikes) which deliver Jacob into Brettons more mercenary hands. The other hitch is that Jacobs leftie girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan mirroring the conscience of Martin Sheen in the original) shes the estranged daughter of the now-legendary disgraced and repentant Gordon (Michael Douglas) whos out of jail but not necessarily reformed.When Gekko walks out of prison carrying an oversized 1980s mobile you know this is more panto than polemic. The films style is so brash and its tone so comfy that its hard to take seriously any attempt to capture the zeitgeist and nail the culture of greed. Brolins banker is especially wide he owns a Goya and you half-expect him to grow horns and cackle wildly in front of it in the shadows. LaBeouf is fine if a bit bland as our morally wobbly tour guide around the world of finance and Douglas relishes resurrecting his slick villain. A series of cosy cameos removes us further from reality Charlie Sheen pops up as Fox; Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter plays himself; and Stone rears his head twice. Mulligan has no room to shine her character is a sourpuss and though were meant to like her the film sidelines her as being too dull preferring to indulge shots of the shimmering city. This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring hollow.

But hey it was an enjoyable 120 mins; albeit dragged on at times with views of xeon numbers scrolling down the screen - but how else do ya make money look sexy - buy me some new shoes thats how The shots of NY from the air are great and with the digital kit in the West End the film was crystal and energetic. The potential Gecko son in law was a limp rag and Geckos estranged daughter is so pixie like you always expected to see her perched on a mushroom. Mike and Josh saved the movie for me; OK Mikes got a bit scraggy on the neck line but still acts like hell - whilst Josh B. looked great in bikers leathers. Then then the old JA banker Julio had a lovely line in birdsong - watch it - its more fun than a dirty mop.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 10 2010scrumpyjackFeaturedI really dont know about this. Never a fan of the first I had low expectations so perhaps that helped (?) Panto (T.O) is a good description but a damn good panto it sure is....Plenty of ""Boo....Hiss"" here. Douglas is superb Le Beouf is good. watch it in the right frame of mind you will enjoy but to have REAL bite (SPOILER) Gekko should have ripped off his daughter amp; (soon to be) son in law when the story switched to London and (perhaps) sent them the 100 (and a 10 for them selves) and cut all ties. Then we would have a ending.

You bet I did. It had energy and captured the spirit of the time. But 20 years on I wonder if a sequel needed to be made. Sure Oliver Stone was never going to call me up and ask my advice on that one. But youd have to have been living on another planet to have not noticed how the markets went into meltdown on this planet. And thats the problem here - the storylines nothing special - youve heard it played out on the news countless times in recent years. Likewise the technology of 25 years ago was exciting and new - today its old news - who doesnt have one or more mobiles who doesnt work with one or more computer screens? . The brief appearance of Bud Fox (Sheen) could have been more cleverly and tightly woven into this story especially as Gordon was back looking and for revenge. It was also great to see Buds ""realator"" still in business and both these appearances got cheers from a clearly devoted audience. But perhaps these two cameo appearances could have been properly scripted in rather than being guest appearances and being minor distractions. . About 90 minutes in this film gets a bit dull and predictable. Two people left the cinema around this point - never a good sign. I began to wonder how the story would wind up and wasnt too far wrong. Gordons still a st but is just developing a conscience - just. Worthy of two stars but no more. A harsher critic would say this was a made for TV movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 7 2010GortFeaturedOK heres my review. Movie is not that bad it should be called ""Wall Street Money Brings People Together"" if you dont have it you better get some if you take it all you suck but if you share it then youre OK. It portrays Wall Street as place where honest and good people reside. Sure there are few bad apples that get hold on a big helm and make all those good people look bad but they get punished at the end and if they dont they get reminded that theyll be grandpas so they come to their senses. At times movie looks lost and not about people but numbers and then it turns to what is supposed to be heart wrenching story and peoples so at the end it looks more like one of those Manhattan comedy dramas if not like a softened Woody Allens movie. And thats where the movies problem is its too small for the stuff that has been happening in Wall Street for the past few years. Maybe they should of hired David Mamet to make it more about betrayal and mistrust which comes with greed and how places like Wall Street usually are.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 6 2010Justin BerkoviFeaturedWhilst the original film was an 80s celebration of excess the present day eschews the failure of the markets but were right in this situation at present...so not much to celebrate. Unfortunately much like the subject matter Stones film isnt all that good and meanders around different plots and storylines without really delivering the oomph or drama of the first film. LeBoeuf is a good actor and has a enjoyable screen presence...hes a bit wasted here though as the film is a bit boring and doesnt really go anywhere.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/88247/wall-street-money-never-sleeps.html,200,wallstreetmoneyneversleeps0,wallstreetmoneyneversleeps,timeout

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wall-street-money-never-sleeps ) Wall Street Money Never Sleeps (United States 2010) September 24 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are times when iconic characters should be left alone to bask in the glory of a single appearance and unfortunately thats the case with Gordon Gekko. The supremely charismatic magnetically villainous central figure from Oliver Stones 1987 examination of 80s financial corruption Wall Street has returned to the scene of his crimes some two decades later and the magic is gone. The problem with an inferior sequel which Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is is that it runs the risk of diminishing a great character. Too often during this second installment Gekko is on the sidelines as the confused rambling storyline focuses on other less interesting individuals or takes lengthy detours into a pseudo-documentary exhumation of the 2008 stock market blowout that led to the bailout package. Money Never Sleeps is engaging enough when Gekko is on screen but at least until the final 20 minutes thats too little and not often enough. Money Never Sleeps opens with a brief scene in 2001 that shows the release of Gekko (Michael Douglas) from prison then skips ahead seven years into the height of the stock market crisis. An up-and-coming broker Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) who is engaged to Gekkos daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) decides to meet his future father-in-law. Their conversation is cordial but it is clear each wants something from the other and this will not be their final encounter. Meanwhile Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) the head of the firm for which Jake works finds himself in increasingly dire straits because of the massive number of toxic mortgages on his books. After being browbeaten and given an ultimatum by rival Bretton James (Josh Brolin) he decides on a Shakespearean way out. Jake blames Bretton for Zabels suicide and vows revenge. Gekko who has a score to settle with Bretton offers his help if Jake can affect a reunion between him and Winnie. It will come as no surprise that Gekko even as watered-down as he is after a term in prison is by far the most interesting character in the movie. When hes on screen we pay attention. However there are lengthy periods (some as long as 15-20 minutes) when hes absent and no one else is capable of filling the void. Jake played generically by Shia LaBeouf is dull and bland. For a while we think Jake might be in the mold of a Bud Fox (who as played by Charlie Sheen has a delicious cameo) but he turns out to be a little more ethically grounded. As a result his Wall Street shenanigans lack a certain flair. Carey Mulligan suffers from having been given a one-dimensional personality although she does the best she can with it. Winnie can be summed up in one sentence a liberal with serious Daddy issues who cries in about 50% of her scenes. Her romance with Jake is lifeless; not only do the actors lack chemistry but their dialogue is routine and pedestrian. Susan Sarandon makes a couple of token appearances as Jakes mom a real estate investor whos in over her head in a bad market. Frank Langella has some nice moments but hes not around for very long. And despite having shown the ability to be a truly nasty bad guy in the past Josh Brolin is unimpressive in this instance. Is Gekko a hero or a villain? Not even Stone seems to know. At times he fills both roles the watchdog barking out warnings about the imminent implosion of the financial sector and the opportunist who takes advantage of an opening when presented with it. Gekko is more amoral than immoral which is a step up from where he was in Wall Street. But having become afflicted with something resembling a conscience he becomes less enjoyable although not necessarily more complex. Its fascinating to see how Stone and Douglas view Gekko 20 years later when no one knows his name and he has been largely forgotten. Still for my money the pseudo-Gekko played by Douglas in Solitary Man was more engaging. At 134 minutes Money Never Sleeps runs too long and has a lot of space in which to ramble. By mixing fact fiction and speculation (something in which Stone has always dabbled) the filmmakers are given an opportunity to offer ideas and opinions about what might have happened behind closed doors leading to the bailout. Unfortunately the scope of the narrative is too scattershot to hold together with three distinct storylines vying for contention Gekkos return Jakes turbulent personal and professional life and the back-room wheeling and dealing accompanying the 2008 crash. Its almost as if three different scripts were written then inelegantly forced together. There are some nice moments and interesting scenes but the production as a whole is a disappointment. For this film to have worked Stone needed to make Jake as interesting as Gekko and he never comes close. Returning to Wall Street 23 years after his first visit Oliver Stone has discovered that the more things change the more they stay the same. His sequel is redundant and lacking in energy. Wall Street remains a fascinating time capsule of 80s greed. The follow-up will cannot be said to offer the same perspective of where a similar vein of greed took the economy two decades later.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 23 2010 Save for later Saved Actors (l.-r.) Shia LeBeouf Josh Brolin and Michael Douglas are shown in a scene from Director Oliver Stones film Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Barry Wetcher/20th Century Fox/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When Oliver Stones ""Wall Street"" came out in 1987 it was intended as a cautionary tale for the greed-is-good crowd. Or was it? Despite its heavy-duty moralizing about the wages of sin the film was really about how greed is sexy. A new generation of traders and brokers and moneymen made ""Wall Street"" their bible.""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" brings us up to speed on Michael Douglass Gordon Gekko the former Mr. Insider who was put away for eight years in federal prison for corporate malfeasance and now in 2008 semi-forgotten is - what else? - hawking a book called ""Is Greed Good?"" about his transgressions. Casting himself as seer he spits out doom-laden scenarios for the financial meltdown that - ta-da - arrives on schedule.Framed once again as a cautionary tale - or more accurately perhaps as an I-told-you-so tale - ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" like its predecessor is far more enthralled than repelled by greed. The despicable dealings of corporate sharks have all the juices in this film. The gleam of Manhattans moneyscapes - the lavish fundraising banquets the mansions the clothes - have an Arabian Nights allure. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Compare this with the wimpy goody-goodness of Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who despite the fact that she lives with a hotshot broker Shia LaBeoufs Jake despises the money culture so much that she heads up a nonprofit ""lefty"" blog site and cares deeply about the environment. If there is a way to make virtue more commanding than vice Stone and his screenwriters Alan Loeb and Stephen Schiff have not found it. (Thats OK - neither could Charles Dickens.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Money Never Sleeps"" seems both up to the minute and behind the times. Real world events have upstaged it. The economic fallout from Gekko-style malfeasance isnt merely grist for melodrama its a scary constant in our lives. Even Gekko one of the great antiheroes of modern movies has been supplanted by Bernie Madoff and all the rest. Reality thankfully has a greater pull than fiction.In some ways because it is a fiction ""Money Never Sleeps"" is a comfort. Instead of recoiling from real-life skulduggery we get a chance to wax sentimental about a golden oldie like Gekko. He may want to make peace with his daughter but she knows him for what he is. ""Hell hurt us"" she says to Jake while we in the audience wait eagerly for the hurts to arrive on cue.Gekko knows his daughter better than she knows herself. When he asks Jake why she is engaged to a high-powered broker if she hates her father so much he flashes a wicked smile. (If the film had pursued the Freudian implications of this question Winnies role might have perked up.)Douglas is once again marvelous as Gekko. His hawklike profile has never seemed more severe but theres a weariness too. You can believe this man spent eight years in prison. Although the filmmakers push for his redemption in a singularly phony denouement Gekkos real redemption comes a bit earlier when the malfeaser in him once again rises to the occasion. Compared with Gekko the films other designated bad guy billionaire vulture Bretton James (sleekly played by Josh Brolin) is a waxwork.If one were to take this entertainingly uneven film altogether seriously it might be worth pointing out that the good old days of Wall Street shenanigans were never all that good - or that old either. Stone imparts a rosy glow to the old guard in ""Money Never Sleeps"" - particularly Jakes mentor played by Frank Langella and another honcho played by Eli Wallach who is so ancient he lived through the Great Depression. Stone has Gekko say things like ""While I was away greed got greedier"" or ""Its not about the money its about the game.""Meanwhile Gekko is using the money to ambush everything in sight including his own child. Some game. ""Money Never Sleeps"" doesnt get inside the sociopathology of the money culture. In a sense it is a product an expression of that culture. Maybe thats why its so disagreeably agreeable.

Alas theres no Joliet Jake here no Elwood waiting in a retired police cruiser no anticipatory thrum of ""She Caught the Katy."" As the title suggests this sequel is a nostalgia trip through a different economic bracket altogether. The felon in question is corporate raider Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas) last seen as the embodiment of amok capitalism in Stones 1987 film Wall Street. But prison has apparently reprogrammed Gekko who returns Schwarzenegger-like as a ""good"" high-finance Terminator promising to help a young hero (Shia LaBeouf) combat the rise of the newer sleeker model (Josh Brolin). Gekko has retired his iconic catchphrase ""Greed is good"" and he will spend the remainder of the movie crisscrossing the econo-moral spectrum in search of a new one (""when I was away it seems greed got greedier""; ""moneys the bitch that never sleeps""; ""a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar""; ""its not about the money its about the game""). Between test-driving such mottos he gives speeches decrying the destructive and unsustainable nature of American banking to bait-breathed financial aspirants. One such is Jacob Moore (LaBeouf) a young trader teetering between idealism (his fiancee calls him ""Mr. Green Energy"") and avarice (""the only green is money"" he retorts). Fans of the first Wall Street will recall that this is precisely the narrative role filled by Charlie Sheen last time around. (Yes the fact that concepts such as ""Charlie Sheen"" and ""innocence"" might ever have coexisted is a sad reminder of times passage.) Though Sheen will appear in a brief this-is-your-life cameo later in the film he is otherwise absent detained by his fractional obligations as two-fifths of Two and a Half Men. The year is 2008 just before the Fall (in both senses). Jacob works for a small investment firm run by an old-school banker Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella) who is befuddled by the changes in his profession. (At one point he asks adorably ""How do you make money on losses?"") The firm is in trouble though it is initially unclear--at least to those who have never seen an Oliver Stone movie--whether its misfortune is due to negligence bad luck or Evil Forces Lurking in the Background. In any case the firm soon collapses and is snatched up by predatory banker Bretton James (Brolin). Shortly thereafter Zabel himself exits the film after enjoying the most morally freighted bag of potato chips I believe Ive ever seen. (That the paradigm of paternal decency and restraint embodied by Martin Sheens blue-collar airline worker in the original Wall Street is now represented by a multimillionaire banker is perhaps the films most pointed commentary on our times.) Jacob believes that his firms failure was deliberately engineered by Bretton--the mans name after all is ""Bretton"" which in a film like this might as well be horns--and he swears revenge. But when he springs his trap Bretton impressed by the boys chutzpah offers him a job. (Note to impressionable young moviegoers in job-application circles swindling a potential employer out of hundreds of millions of dollars is not typically considered a good way to get yourself ""noticed."") As it happens Jacob is also engaged to Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) and he begins meeting with his potential father-in-law behind his fiancees back. At first the intent of these encounters is to arrange a family rapprochement. But over time their purpose shifts as Jacob seeks to profit from the old wheeler-dealers accumulated wisdom and festering antipathy toward Bretton. The requisite political boxes are all dutifully penciled in a mom (Susan Sarandon in her most thankless role since Elizabethtown) who gave up ""making a difference"" as a nurse in order to become an over-extended real estate speculator? Check. Winnies job managing a muckraking lefty blog? Check. Credit default swaps ""too big to fail"" the complicit mainstream media? Check check check. If this all sounds unerringly silly well thats because it is. Yet against all probability Money Never Sleeps is a watchable enough movie for its first hour or so. The leads are all sharp and well within their characterological comfort zones. Stones showy array of directorial gimmicks--split screens every time someone makes a phone call Tron-like images of financial data charging through three-dimensional space stop-motion segues of the Manhattan sky and rivers--contribute to an air of childish whimsy whether or not that was his intent. And the accompanying songs by David Byrne and Brian Eno (more 80s nostalgia) though incongruous are nevertheless catchy. But as the financial bubble pops so too does the cinematic one. Gloomy portents notwithstanding it was easily enough for the movie to breeze along with the gust of capitalist excess at its back. But around the midpoint it begins flagging and not even an exceptionally pointless motorcycle race between Jacob and Bretton can rouse it from its doldrums. There are tears and recriminations to come innumerable invocations of the phrase ""moral hazard"" a not-at-all-unforeseeable betrayal and a risibly feeble bid for redemption. (Lets just say that any film in which investing 100 million in a for-profit nuclear fusion company is described without irony as the ""most charitable"" act to which a person could aspire is a film that has succumbed to some moral hazards of its own.) By chance or design Stone grants final word on the financial collapse to no fewer than two characters Winnie whose tiny liberal website brings the titans of Wall Street to their knees; and an elderly banker played by Eli Wallach who bids the era adieu with an odd kind of a tootling birdcall. In both cases the message seems the same This is how the economic world ends not with a bang but a tweet.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

What would the 19th-century scribe possibly make of the way weve repurposed his rags-to-riches tales? In the upcoming ""The Social Network"" a kind of class resentment reigns at Harvard as a well-off Jewish kid from New York upstages some blue bloods on his way to creating one of the most powerful inventions of the decade Facebook. In Oliver Stones entertaining if contradictory drama ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" Shia LaBeouf plays Jake Moore. Once a caddie he parlayed his golf-course relationship with the head of a trading company to nicely lucrative heights. Jake lives with girlfriend Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan) in a sleek glass aviary above Manhattans bustling streets. Its a good life -- about to experience a setback. Director Stone and writers Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff have returned to the financial district just in time for the elevator to plunge in 2008. Images of trading-floor angst and then-there-were-none parades of departing employees carrying cartons take us back to the events that led to the bailouts. If the name Gekko rings a bell thats because those of us around for the merger-happy martini-swigging cigar-puffing 80s remember Gordon Gekko. Michael Douglas slithery character famously said in the original ""Wall Street"" (1987) ""Greed is good."" Good -- but not good enough -- at greed Gekko was sent to the penitentiary for insider trading. As the long-time-coming sequel opens its 2001 and the jailbird is flying the federal coop. Chastised or so we hope he appears to be a lonesome man. Even the gangbanger released at the same time has a woman and kids shouting happily. No ones there for Gordon. Not his son -- he cant be. Not daughter Winnie. She chose not to be. Douglas is that rare talent who doesnt mind being the antihero. Its a role he excelled at and embraced again and again in the 80s and 90s in movies including Stones as well as ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Falling Down"" and ""Disclosure."" He also does well playing smart appealing leading men. Think ""The American President."" So his role here teases those two personas. Does he deserve another shot at a life with a loving daughter? Or is he a nesting viper? ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" is a family and cultural drama about good and ill. Love of money and the power that comes from having it (or having your way with other peoples wealth) collide with but also fuel more noble aspirations. Jake wants to fund a cutting- edge green-energy company. Winnie is founder of a progressive website. Mulligan who proved with her fine debut ""An Education"" that she is capable of breathing great depth into a well-conceived character isnt as vivid here. Just how far Winnie has turned her back on her father and his ill-gotten gains is a matter for Freud. Ditto Jakes relationship to his Realtor mom played with wheeling dealing wheedling desperation by Susan Sarandon. Given the demographics of Wall Street this is a tale of men and money. Frank Langella is sympathetic as an old-school money man and Jakes mentor Louis Zabel. As Jules Steinhardt emeritus of a rival investment firm Eli Wallach sits in a boardroom as Zabels company buckles. He looks like a wee and wise demon. Josh Brolin portrays his minion and protege Bretton James. Will the cultured shark Bretton become Jakes new mentor? Will Gordon and Jake continue their dangerous quid pro quo behind Winnies back? There are all manner of strategic alliances forged in ""Money Never Sleeps."" So many Fausts. So many ethically dodgy bargains to be made. So many hells. Yet the most bedeviling bargain of all may be the one director Stone makes at the end of the movie. Earlier Gekko tells Jake with a glint in his eye that our affection for triumphal money tales comes because ""we love a good bedtime story."" But the story of Jake Winnie and Gordon makes us wonder if there is any other bedtime story so lulling so disarming as moviedoms falsely wrought ""happily ever after.""

Comments (2) Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Video Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2010 Bringing back the dastardly Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) to preside over the 2008 economic meltdown sounded like a great idea for a sequel but the setup for this Oliver Stone drama keeps its iconic villain so far removed from the financial action that he seems like a dog tied up outside a restaurant. Paroled from prison Gekko reinvents himself as an economic Cassandra hawking his memoir at Borders and inveighing against our over-leveraged society. (""Greed is good"" his zeitgeist-defining pronouncement from the 1987 Wall Street is replaced by the Oprah-ready ""Buy my book Production and profits work"") Screenwriters Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff dutifully re-create the first movies mentor-protege dynamic by having Gekko slither up to an ambitious young trader (Shia LaBeouf) whos engaged to Gekkos estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan).

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 24 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English When Oliver Stone made Wall Street way back in the boom decade of the eighties his ostensible villain became an iconic hero. For a generation of Manhattan money men eager to look and talk like Gordon Gekko life imitated the movies. They aped his suits and his swagger and his pompadour and his mantra inflating ""Greed is good"" into ""Greedier is better."" Eventually of course the overblown market collapsed and the Greediest stooped to collecting their government bailouts. Once again in corporate America profits stayed privatized while losses got socialized. So yes a sequel was definitely in order and the second coming of Wall Street subtitled Money Never Sleeps should be a welcome sight. Alas not so. Maybe money doesnt sleep but through 2 hours and 15 minutes of meandering and pontificating Im afraid you might. If hubris hypocrisy untold billions and unpunished guilt are the stuff of drama then theres a great film to be made about the economys meltdown. Already some very good documentaries have excavated the tawdry facts. By contrast this is just tedious fiction. It starts with Gekko (Michael Douglas again) having done his slammer time and shuffling out of jail. Ill-dressed with no one to greet him the guy looks as bare and unaccommodated as Lear on the heath. Happily he has an option unavailable to ruined Celtic kings - yep the tell-all book. Cut to 2008 when thanks to his tome Gekko is back not on the top but at least on the tube prophesizing about the darkness to come ""the mother of all evil - its systemic malignant and global."" On TV or off thats our Gordon He doesnt so much speak as spout spraying aphorisms every which way. The wonder is that Douglas keeps him almost entertaining. Meanwhile his daughter Winnie (the beguiling Carey Mulligan) is willfully estranged from Daddy and contentedly engaged to Jake (a lightweight Shia LaBeouf). Young and driven Jake is a Wall Streeter with a conscience - specifically his investment skills are focused on alternative-energy companies. In other words the kid may be filthy rich but he does put his greenbacks to green use. Yet conscience is a luxury which gets severely taxed whens Jakes firm headed by his beloved mentor goes belly up. Right quick the mentor jumps in front of an onrushing subway train while were faced with the oncoming villain. That would be Bretton James (Josh Brolin) a ruthless banker and todays greedier Gekko. But dont expect life to imitate him unless youre one of lifes overactors in which case Brolins scenery-chewing turn should prove inspiring indeed. From there the thin plot ventures off on thinner tangents where the questions multiply even as the answers procrastinate. Will Jake lose his fiancees love? Will Daddy regain his daughters love? Will the good Gordon revert to the bad Gekko? Will the dialogue stop making speeches and actually talk? Well as the finish line nears and someone (Im not saying who) splutters ""Im your Dad and to the day I die youre my gal"" we finally know the answer to at least one of those questions. Saddled with this hollow script Stone pads with elaborate set pieces. Theres the lavish charity ball at the Metropolitan Museum the sort of hyperbolic scene that adds little to a film but a lot to its budget. Theres the gratuitous action sequence that has Jake and the Baddie racing their speedy motorcycles to no apparent point. And theres not one but two big tableaus at the Federal Reserve Bank where around a board table filled with financial heavyweights Eli Wallach pops up as a wizened sage old enough to remember the Crash of 29. Poor Eli - aged and tiny he sits among the titans like a weathered garden gnome steadfastly mute before breaking his silence with this burst of foreshadowing ""Its going to be the end of the world."" Instead its just the end of our patience. Perhaps sensing that Money Never Sleeps wakes up long enough to tack on a contrived resolution with unseemly haste. At that point one of Gekkos aphorisms begins to sound like a warning ""Money isnt the prime asset in life - time is."" If so waste both at your peril.

That probably explains why there are multiple shots of children blowing bubbles in Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. The bubbles float high impossibly big against the bright blue sky. Just when you think the bubble might float forever - pop Subtlety has never been Stones strong suit but few filmmakers pick at our rawest societal scabs with quite as much brio and determination. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps a sequel to Stones 1987 melodrama Wall Street zeroes in on the turmoil of the late summer and early fall of 2008 when the high-flying world economy went hurtling over a cliff.Like Wall Street the story here is little more than half-baked Greek tragedy a tale of fathers and their surrogate sons and the boundless greed that unites them. Yet this movie displays an urgency and rage that makes it feel alive. Stone discovers that even after a cataclysmic financial meltdown few of us seem capable of curing our addiction to excess.The movie begins with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) being sprung from prison after an eight-year stint for assorted financial crimes. Hes written a memoir and can still draw a crowd to his book signings but most people seem to regard him as yesterdays news.The Gekko character a much more straightforward bad guy in the original film takes on an intriguing new arc here; hes the beaten-down gambler desperate to get back in on the action. Douglas who won an Oscar for the first film and who just keeps getting better with age locates an unexpectedly touching weariness in Gekko. Its weariness that the actor perhaps knows all too well himself. (In Hollywood and on Wall Street you cant go on being a star forever.)He never loses sight of Gekkos core of slime Heres a guy forever on the hunt for a potential double-deal; he understands that the details of the game might have changed but the game is still rigged.The original film pitted Gekko against Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) an ambitious if easily manipulated young stockbroker. Sheen makes a cameo here but the star is Shia LaBeouf playing Jake Moore yet another ambitious and easily manipulated young trader who also happens to be dating Gekkos long-estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan).The family melodrama that unfolds is decidedly creaky Eager to develop a relationship with the notorious Gekko Jake plots to reunite father and daughter. Poor Mulligan is left on the sidelines of the story and for too long the movie seems to be marking time When is Gekko going to drop the nice-guy act and re-emerge as the devil we know him to be?Where the movie comes alive is with its spot-on portrait of the chaos of American life on the brink of financial apocalypse. Everyone in the movie is overextended and desperately anxious. That includes Jakes mother (Susan Sarandon) who earns money flipping houses in Long Island.Stone saves his bitterest vitriol for Bretton James (Josh Brolin) a high-ranking executive at a powerful investment bank who also wants to take young Jake under his wing. In one especially powerful sequence James and his boss Jules Steinhardt (Eli Wallach) make the decision to let the bank where Jake works fail. Stone hammers home a point that even two years after the market meltdown still seems to go widely unacknowledged Our collective financial fates are in the hands of just a few petty people.You could lodge any number of fair complaints against Money Never Sleeps It goes on too long; Brolins villain is too one-dimensional; the neat-and-happy bow Stone and screenwriters Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff tie around the proceedings is ridiculous.That misses the larger more provocative point which is to take the pulse of a society that doesnt seem to have learned its lesson. Stones classic JFK famously ends with Kevin Costner literally pointing his finger at the audience demanding that we ask questions of our leaders and pay more careful attention to history. The ending of this new film is no less caustic. The bubbles are still being blown much too big still floating into the seemingly boundless sky.And theyre still on the verge of bursting.Directed by Oliver StoneStarring Michael Douglas Shia LaBeouf Carey Mulligan and Josh BrolinRun time 133 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (brief strong language and thematic elements) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Barry Wetcher) Wall Street Stone re-examines economy in entertaining Wall Street sequel BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Sep 24 2010 (...) Barry Wetcher In this film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox Shia LaBeouf left and Carey Mulligan are shown in a scene from ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Barry Wetcher) In the original ""Wall Street"" when rogue investor Gordon Gekko declared that ""Greed is good"" it defined the go-go 80s and propelled Michael Douglas to an Academy Award as best actor. Twenty-three years later Gekko Douglas and director Oliver Stone are back to reappraise the state of the global economy in ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps."" Its a wholly successful sequel -- audacious entertaining and bracingly pertinent.The 2008 inferno that fried your nest egg illuminates this multilevel melodrama. Gekko out of prison and penniless has written an (almost) apologetic memoir decrying the madness of the markets where investments in tangible assets have been replaced by a rigged shell game. After a rabble-rousing speech Gekko meets Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf typically petulant) an ambitious but principled young trader who is living with Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan mostly marginalized).Jake seeks Gekkos help in shooting down a high-flying investment banker named Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who used the financial panic and his pals at the Federal Reserve to ruin Jakes gentlemanly mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). Like Zabel Gekko advises Jake to savor the one irreplaceable commodity in life time. But eventually Gekko agrees to help Jake if their scheme serves a useful purpose (investment in renewable energy) and facilitates a truce with Winnie. Jake finagles a job with James firm and as in the original ""Wall Street"" Stone conveys the seductive allure of life in the fast lane from the jewelry boutique where Jake buys Winnie an engagement ring to the back roads where he and James race prototype motorcycles.Stone thrives in this milieu and hes playfully in control of his camera swooping through the canyons of Manhattan to jauntily ironic tunes by David Byrne. But Stone like Jake keeps his eye on the real prize of payback. Although theres a nasty but not unexpected twist after Gekko returns to the big leagues Stone balances the cynicism with some iffy sentiment. A scene of a titan toggling between a balance sheet and a sonogram foreshadows a Hollywood ending -- and raises the question whether the real ending will include the acutely human but seriously ill Douglas accepting another Oscar.

"Review Wall Street sequel needs to cut the bull - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Wall Street sequel needs to cut the bullBy Randy MyersBay Area News GroupPosted 09/23/2010 120000 AM PDTUpdated 09/27/2010 120342 PM PDTClick photo to enlargeIllustration by Chris Stratch/Mercury News <<1234>>Americas recent economic meltdown is a topic teeming with high drama and hard lessons. Sign on the right director and screenwriters and the result should be scintillating. On paper ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" appears to be a perfect union between filmmaker and material.It was Oliver Stone after all who conceived the original a profound and significant object lesson about the rise and fall of dirty insider trader Gordon Gekko an icon whose name is now synonymous with 80s greed.But that bristlingly smart 1987 film merely serves to magnify the disappointments of Stones wobbly sequel set roughly 20 years later. Movie showtimes info Buried Catfish Howl Jack Goes Boating Last Train Home The Legend of the Guardians Never Let Me Go The Romantics You Again Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Whiz Kids Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Blame rests not on the cast which is terrific but on Stone and screenwriters Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff whose stock as convincing storytellers takes a tumble here. This time around the team does show occasional flourishes of the originals snap and urgency. However its nearly impossible to stay invested in a narrative stuffed with pliable characters whose actions fail to stay true to their natures. Thats particularly glaring in a climax that ties everything up with a hunky-doryness that should have been liquidated faster than a risky hedge fund.Advertisement ""Money Never Sleeps"" shows tremendous promise out of the gate with slick Gekko played with a seemingly flaccid sense of resignation by Michael Douglas reprising his Oscar-winning role re-emerging to a strange new world of financial nefariousness. His exit from prison -- where he landed thanks to prodigy Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen given a weak cameo later) -- is razor-sharp. Gordons realization that times have changed are nicely illustrated as he picks up his clunky mobile phone and watches a new type of criminal being greeted with the stretch limo and champagne. Our expectations immediately soar. Our hopes however soon burst like the tortured bubble metaphor Stone clubs us over the head with. Children blow bubbles in a park that slowly rise in the sky. People talk about bubbles. Even a tulip becomes a metaphor. Enough""Money Never Sleeps"" set largely in October 2008 stays on course when it peers into the dark-wooded boardrooms posh social parties and shaky financial institutions -- all of which ring with authoritative realism. But Stone and the script shortchange the characters forcing them to do things that seem phony and having them recite lines that sound stilted and overly didactic. We see this when for example hotshot trader Jake (a solid Shia LaBeouf) persuades principled girlfriend Winnie (Carey Mulligan) into a reconciliation dinner with her estranged daddy dearest Gekko. Other characters suffer from PowerPoint-like characterization especially the potentially interesting relationship between Jake and his financially strapped realtor mom (Susan Sarandon in one of her strongest recent parts). The plot strand shown the most care is Jakes mission to avenge the downfall of his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella who gives the strongest and most movingly tragic performance). Jake enlists Gekkos aid after attending a lecture -- astutely and keenly written -- at Fordham University where hes promoting his book ""Is Greed Good?"" Douglas is marvelously charismatic and riveting at the podium mirroring his ""greed"" speech in the original. The film bursts into life as Gekko explains the intricacies of financial vehicles and global markets that even he cant understand. Nothing that follows can match it.The target of Jakes rage is morally bankrupt investment banker Churchill Schwartz (Josh Brolin going full-bore with the macho posturing) a conniving piece of work who admires the pluck of ambitious Jake and offers him a job.All these performances consistently outshine the story although halfway through Mulligan (""An Education"") is reduced to playing a sprung leak at the tear duct factory.To be fair it is an audacious task to explain what drove the world economy so suddenly to the edge of near financial collapse and this sequel demonstrates just how much more complex -- and nasty -- the financial world has become since the first ""Wall Street"" screened. And while Stones story does shine some light on the players in that world and how they and the varying financial factors intersect its never enough to fully illuminate the issues.But its Stone-as-filmmaker who most disappoints. He makes bad directorial choices opting for split screens that rudely take us out of the moment of the film and later superimposing the image of a dead character to make a heavy-handed point. All of that cinematic bluster is unnecessary. If he had cut the bull and focused on the bullishness he might have had a sequel worthy of its original.""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps""C+RATING PG-13 (brief strong language and thematic elements)CAST Michael Douglas Shia LaBeouf Carey Mulligan Josh Brolin Susan Sarandon Frank LangellaDIRECTOR Oliver StoneRUNNING TIME 2 hours 13 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Starring Shia LaBeouf Javier Bardem Michael Douglas Carey Mulligan Charlie Sheen Susan Sarandon Josh Brolin Vanessa Ferlito Frank Langella Natalie Morales Director Oliver Stone Running time 207 Release Opened Sep 24 2010  Editorial Review Greed is very very good (again)By Ann HornadayFriday September 24 2010Michael Douglas makes a triumphant return to form as one of American cinemas great villains in ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" the 23-years-later sequel to the movie that captured the go-go 80s. In its own giddy glib way ""Money Never Sleeps"" evinces just as strong a hold on its times when terms like ""subprime"" and ""credit default swaps"" -- which would have been virtually meaningless two decades ago -- are the lingua franca of the financial realm. The crimes that Gekko went to jail for in Oliver Stones original film now seem like childs play compared with the shady deals his spiritual heirs have been confecting during his years in prison. Now that he has been released during a very funny scene in which he reclaims a mobile phone the size of a shoebox Gekko has renounced his past life of avarice and (what else?) published a book. Its called ""Is Greed Good?"" a clever turnabout on his most famous line from the first ""Wall Street."" Thats just one of many in-jokes that Stone lands throughout his sequel which often exceeds its predecessor in sheer verve and visual style. Using an ingeniously layered visual design split screens and sinuous mobile cameras that move through scenes like the human sharks who inhabit them Stone here proves that hes still a director of bold muscularity. If some of his references hit too squarely on the nose -- the shot of a childs soap bubble standing in for the metaphoric financial version for example or the vaguely fascist corporate insignia of a malign CEO played by Josh Brolin -- Stone has a knack for pacing detail and atmosphere that manages to feel authentic and fancifully allegorical at the same time. In large part much of that entertainment value derives from Douglas who tucks into Gekko with gleeful relish his physical gusto made all the more gratifying given the unwelcome recent news that the actor is fighting throat cancer. His famous hair now gray and less slick his suits dressed down but still bespoke Gekko presents the perfect antihero a deliciously amoral bad guy on a quest for redemption (or maybe just a piece of the new action). The ally he has chosen for the journey is a young entrepreneur named Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) who just happens to be engaged to Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan). Disgusted with her father Winnie writes for an investigative blog while Jake invests in alternative energy technology and speaks fluent Mandarin. In other words Jake and Winnie personify the future that Gekko who speaks witheringly of those crazy kids with their derivatives either cant or wont grasp -- or maybe hes just too busy seeing around corners to beat them at their own game. The wily suspense of ""Money Never Sleeps"" lies in how deep Gekkos reptilian instincts go a question plumbed in the course of a peripatetic tour through New Yorks most decadently gilded precincts with a stop along the way at the Federal Reserve. ""Money Never Sleeps"" may belong to Douglass Gekko but Mulligan and LaBeouf provide attractive believable foils to his slippery sleights of hand; veterans Frank Langella and Eli Wallach in roles reminiscent of Hal Holbrooks in the original offer words of bygone wisdom echoed by the image of a buffalo seen in one aging characters office. Set to music by David Byrne Brian Eno and Craig Armstrong ""Money Never Sleeps"" possesses the lift acceleration and speed of the very bubble it seeks to puncture. Stone has managed to wring unlikely entertainment value from what we now know was the longest recession since World War II. With style wry humor and a healthy dose of cautionary polemic hes made some of our most troubling recent history great fun to watch.Contains brief strong profanity and thematic elements.

Did we really see those clunkers as cutting-edge technology? Yes and we were right; they may have been clumsy but they got the job done. The same was true of Mr. Stones 1987 original. Few accused it of excessive grace but its antihero was a memorable scoundrel and his greed-is-good credo cut to the cultures quick. Mr. Douglass performance in the sequel measures up to Gekkos rep but the rest of the movie is pumped up to the bursting point with gasbag caricatures overblown sermons and a semicoherent swirl of events surrounding the economys recent meltdown. The story certainly holds your attention but its a dramatic bubble about a financial bubble. At a talk at Lincoln Center ""Wall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps"" director Oliver Stone tells Speakeasy editor Christopher Farley that the heated political climate in America has always existed. Although the action starts in 2001 the time frame soon shifts to 2008 and a superheated economic climate that even Gekko could not have envisioned. Theres a nice irony in the veteran conniver coming on during public appearances as a cross between Cassandra and a common scold--he rails against speculation as the mother of all evils and denounces leveraged debt. More A New Wall Street Power Look Photos The Look of Wall Street Speakeasy Wall Street Money Never Sleeps- The Afterparty But his preachments sound awfully familiar at this juncture and theyre played against a crisis that unfolds much too slowly to capture the frenzy of the September 2008 meltdown. In a fictionalized version of those events an old-line investment bank with a strong resemblance to Lehman Brothers goes belly up and all hell threatens to break loose in the media surround--Jim Cramer in full cry Warren Buffett likening derivates to WMDs. Yet the fall of other dominoes is delayed while the scatterbrained script by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff takes time out for Gekkos warnings and plunges into the turgid complexities of a morality melodrama that involves the next Gordon Gekko--a provisionally idealistic young trader who falls under the old mans malign spell while making plans to marry his estranged daughter. ENLARGE Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf in Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Associated Press Shia LaBeouf plays the trader Jake; hes effective within the limits of Mr. Stones ham-fisted direction. (Jakes idealism is signaled by his ardent belief in the green promise of fusion energy.) Carey Mulligan is Jakes beloved Winnie a thinly written role that consigns this extraordinary actress to looking either pensive or distressed. Josh Brolin doesnt fare much better as a predatory banker named Bretton James; since Bretton is a heavy the director banishes all lightness from his benighted soul. Only Mr. Douglas sustains a sense of nasty fun as the former snake with the lizardly name who--surprise surprise--remains a snake despite having shed several skins. The script makes an unconvincing stab at Gekkos spiritual regeneration a process supposedly set in motion by a scene--its about a sonogram--thats inherently illogical and emotionally inert. Its much more satisfying though to imagine the movies greatest toxic asset slithering and scheming from now unto the next meltdown and beyond. ENLARGE Geoffrey Canada standing with students in Waiting for ""Superman""  Paramount Pictures Waiting for ""Superman""  The enormous power of Davis Guggenheims documentary flows from the multiplication of a single choice. ""Waiting for Superman"" puts five tender young faces on a national scandal that is all too often described with dispiriting statistics--the state of public education in the U.S. These are kids who are eager to learn and have solid support at home. (Another choice and a wise one was to exclude the children of flagrantly dysfunctional families since their needs transcend schooling.) The films subjects--five co-stars really with the charisma of eager innocence--differ in age race and family circumstances yet theyre all stuck in schools that may break their spirits and maybe their hearts. Watch a clip from the documentary ""Waiting For Superman"" featuring Geoffrey Canada. In this film director David Guggenheim examines the U.S. educational system. The title comes from a story told by one of its adult stars Geoffrey Canada a widely celebrated education reformer and the firebrand founder of the Harlem Childrens Zone. When he was little he says he believed in Superman and was later dismayed to discover that ""there was no one coming with the power to save us."" Mr. Canada contends that the power to save our schools already exists. Like other activists who appear on camera he finds the main instrument of salvation in publicly funded charter schools. As if that werent controversial enough ""Waiting for Superman"" fingers teachers unions as the main obstacle to reform and paints Randi Weingarten the former head of the United Federation of Teachers as a pedagogic Darth Vader. The filmmaker Mr. Guggenheim is no stranger to controversy he won an Oscar for his previous film ""An Inconvenient Truth"" an expansion with elegant visual aids of Al Gores lecture on global warming. This is a time when urgent issues are often explored in polemic documentaries as well as a fateful moment when the future of public education is being debated with unprecedented intensity. ""Waiting for Superman"" makes an invaluable addition to the debate. The film keeps its advocacy in plain view Mr. Guggenheim doesnt pretend to be a Superman surrogate with simple solutions to save the day. Audiences will argue the merits of his approach which creates a stunningly scornful metaphor--educational opportunity in America conducted like a game show--out of the lotteries around the country that are currently used to give children a shot at entering desirable charter schools. (In purely dramatic terms the films structure is shrewd and its climax devastating.) Yet theres no arguing the urgent import of those sweet faces. One of the five Anthony a Washington D.C. fifth grader who lost his father to drugs has been entered in the lottery for a boarding school with 24 spaces for 61 applicants. Anthony is anxious about the prospect of leaving home for an environment of academic rigor--""its bittersweet to me if I get in""--but if he does get in his life will change dramatically for the better and he knows it. Daisy an eager fifth grader in Los Angeles wants to be a doctor a nurse or a vet but she may never get the chance because shes headed for a middle school where only 13% of students are proficient in math. The status quo can be changed Bill Gates says in an interview ""but it takes a lot of outrage and good examples."" The film delivers on both counts. ENLARGE Freida Pinto and Josh Brolin in You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Sony Pictures Classics You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger Watch a clip from Woody Allens movie ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" featuring Antonio Banderas and Naomi Watts. Courtesy Sony Pictures Classic. Coming after the big and bountiful delights of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona""--lets forget the implacable bleakness of ""Whatever Works""--Woody Allens new film set in London plays like a chamber piece for a cockeyed quartet. Thats not bad. To the contrary ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is good and very pleasurable provided you know what youre getting into which is a comic roundelay of amorous ambitions and delusions--punctuated by wistful old ballads like ""If I Had You""--that lead mostly but not entirely to disaster. More Woody Willis and the Web Speakeasy Are Artists Born or Made? Woody Allen Has the Answer The cast of characters is small and largely screwy. One couple Alfie and Helena is played by Anthony Hopkins and the enchanting Gemma Jones; the other Sally and Roy by Naomi Watts and Josh Brolin. The aging Helena seeks solace from a fake fortune teller--thus the title--because her husband Alfie has left her for a floozy played broadly to say the least by Lucy Punch. Helenas daughter Sally has a crush on the gallery owner she works for--hes played by Antonio Banderas--while her husband Roy a blocked novelist lusts for a gorgeous guitarist who practices Boccherini at her window across a courtyard. (Her name is Dia shes played by Freida Pinto from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and thats all the plot explication you get even though you may be slavering for more.) Within the confines of this familiar structure--who can count the man-and-woman hours that Woody Allen characters have spent on planning or reporting their dalliances--the filmmaker treats the pervasive folly with bemused affection as if to say its a cosmic joke on a domestic scale. Then whats the meaning of it all? There isnt any according to the line from Macbeth that opens and closes the film ""A tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" Indeed the tall dark stranger of the title may also refer to the Grim Reaper--its hard to imagine a Reaper whos short--and Mr. Allens nihilism may be deeper-dyed than we know. Nevertheless its terribly touching as well as entertaining to watch everyones struggles and instructive to discover that the screwiest people on screen are the only ones who find true happiness. DVD FOCUS Nixon (1995) ENLARGE Anthony Hopkins shines darkly in Oliver Stones bizarre bloated and often fascinating psychobiography of our 37th president. This fictional lovelorn Nixon is a prisoner of his own history. And since Mr. Stone is a prisoner of his penchant for pop-psychologizing on a grandiose scale his movie which runs more than three hours has the effect--the astonishing effect given what we once thought we knew about the directors left-wing politics--of absolving President Nixon of personal guilt for his crimes and misdeeds without bothering to explain what he did wrong. Pat is played bleakly by Joan Allen. High School (1968) ENLARGE ""Waiting for Superman"" claims that American schools were the best in the world until the 1970s but Frederick Wisemans film calls that claim into question. Shot in a large urban high school in Philadelphia this pioneering cinema-verite documentary shows bright young bloomers wilting in a climate of dreary authoritarianism. Still the dreariness isnt unrelieved. Caring teachers exist and the camera finds them. Copies of the film are hard to find through the usual outlets though some libraries may have it on loan. For sales or rentals the place to start is Zipporah Films the filmmakers website at Zipporah.com. Everyone Says I Love You (1996) ENLARGE Just about everyone gets to sing great old songs in Woody Allens first musical--demimusical really; most of the actors use their own modest voices--and many of the songs open up into equally modest and beguiling dance numbers. (My favorite is a chorus line of Harry Winston jewelry salesmen doing ""My Baby Just Cares for Me."") The genial cast includes Goldie Hawn Alan Alda Edward Norton Drew Barrymore Tim Roth as a malevolent con man and Julia Roberts as a WASP princess. Ms. Hawns Steffi is the movies heart but Mr. Allens Joe her ex-husband is the storys nervous stomach and tortured soul.

"Michael Douglas is still a power player on Wall Street - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Michael Douglas is still a power player on Wall Street Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Barry Wetcher 20th Century Fox Ceding the spotlight Michael Douglas again plays Gordon Gekko but hes not the films main focus. ABOUT THE MOVIEWall Street Money Never Sleeps  1/2 (out of four)Stars Shia LaBeouf Michael Douglas Josh Brolin Carey MulliganDirector Oliver StoneDistributor 20th Century FoxRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesRating PG-13 for brief strong language and thematic elementsOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY The last time we saw Gordon Gekko greed was good his cellphone was the size of a pay phone and the Wall Street shark had a quarter to spend in the joint. Now 23 years later hes back in Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. And despite director Oliver Stones sermons Michael Douglas is just enough to make the trip worth the money. Sure Gekko (Douglas) has a worldview that seems almost quaint now. ""I once said greed is good"" he proclaims at one point. ""Now it seems its legal."" But Douglas reprises his role with such relish its hard to resist. TRAILER Get awakened to Money Never Sleeps To the films benefit Sleeps doesnt try to live up to the 1987 original which won Douglas the Academy Award. Instead it makes Douglas release a side note and focuses instead on star Shia LaBeouf. Its a risky move one that doesnt entirely pay off. While it has been nearly 30 years since the iconic drama its hard not to draw comparisons between LaBeouf and Charlie Sheen who played the wide-eyed Bud Fox in the original. Bud is long gone but anti-corporate sentiment remains. The film opens with wisecracks about Gekkos phone and the limousine that he assumes is there for him. But he becomes a subplot. Sleeps centers instead on the pre-2008 housing bubble. Young motorcycle-zipping trader Jake Moore (LaBeouf) has Bud Foxs youth but not his killer instinct. Jake is caught unawares when his investment banking firm crumbles after a government bailout doesnt happen. The meltdown puts Jake on a collision course with unscrupulous investor Bretton James (Josh Brolin in a nicely sleazy role). Jake also catches a lecture by Gekko whose daughter (Carey Mulligan) he plans to marry. There are plenty of strong performances and LaBeouf does a nice job of becoming the tough-skinned pragmatist. Mulligan is as earnest as ever and Susan Sarandon and particularly Frank Langella make strong cameos. But the star of any Oliver Stone film is Oliver Stone. The director must be satisfied with Wall Street which became a prescient film given the financial spiral. But here Stone cant help but preach. The screenplay is filled with references to Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Do we really need another lesson on the risks of government deregulation? But Douglas gives Money Never Sleeps what it needs most a defiant face to the corruption. Greed may be good but Douglas is better.

""I represent the Wall Street community"" he said as if hed been elected in a vote of downtown billionaires. ""We have felt like a pinata. Maybe you dont feel like youre whackin us with a stick but we certainly feel like weve been whacked with a stick. When are we [meaning the U.S. government] gonna stop whackin the Wall Street pinata?"" Aside from the entertainment value of an overeducated way-too-rich money manager talking like Christopher Moltisanti on The Sopranos Scaramuccis plaint had an unintended poignancy often found among the morally myopic. What the federal government did Mr. Scaramucci was give you and your pals a billion-dollar bailout after you gamed the world financial system close to bankruptcy. Then ""the Wall Street community"" went on doing business the same rapacious way making risky bets and refusing loans to people who needed them. You were the guys with the stick; its Americas investors and homeowners who got whacked. (See 25 people to blame for the financial crisis.) Say this for Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Oliver Stones sequel to his 1987 fable of institutionalized greed none of the sharks in this pool whine over a little spilled blood. They bend the rules knead the dough and shiv one another with the competitive grin or grimace of filthy-rich 25-year-olds at a lunchtime racquetball session. Scoring on Wall Street and in both Wall Street movies is as the films predator-in-chief Gordon Gekko says ""not about the money. Its about the game."" Think of the financial-services industry as the NFL -- a hard-contact sport -- except that its the folks in the stands not the players who can get their heads knocked off. (See the top 10 worst movie-sequel titles.) At the beginning of Money Never Sleeps Gekko (Michael Douglas again) leaves prison where hed been sent for mischief committed in the original film just in time to see his spiritual offspring manipulate world currency with a toxic grandeur Gekko only dreamed of. And again he has a slightly more principled young striver -- Shia LaBeouf the next-generation Charlie Sheen -- primed for a masters instruction and destruction. Moving as fast and recklessly as a trillion-dollar fat-finger stock-market transaction the film has the drive luxe and sarcastic wit of the snazziest Hollywood movies for most of its two-hours-plus running time. Only at the end does it go soft and sweet like the candy inside a pinata. (See how Americans are spending now.) Set mostly in 2008 just before the autumn stock-market crash and its revelation of industry-wide felonies Money Never Sleeps is also a parable of sons trying to learn from the triumphs and sins of their fathers. That makes it personal to the three gents at the core of both movies to Stone who dedicated the original film to his stockbroker father Lou; to producer Edward Pressman whose stepfather was a Manhattan banker; and to Douglas whose career can be seen as a struggle to balance the legacy of his movie-icon dad the majestically feral Kirk with his own more modulated top-dog persona. (See the top 10 crooked CEOs.) Stones original expose of the financial world lucked into a historical moment it opened two months after the Black Monday stock-market crash. But it might have quickly faded from notoriety to anonymity if the director and writer Stanley Weiser hadnt invented that black knight of finance Gordon Gekko -- and if Douglas borrowing some of the pile-driving charm from his dads early gangster roles hadnt invested the character with such reptilian brio such pleasure in playing the game and gaming the system. Strutting his boardroom machismo he expectorated such lasting aphorisms as ""Lunch is for wimps"" ""Whats worth doing is worth doing for money"" ""If you need a friend get a dog"" and ""Greed ... is good greed is right greed works."" Gekko was a monster out of Jacobean satire yet he connived with so much gusto that the creature became a role model for financial go-getting. If the investment sector needed a patron saint of killer rapacity as it clawed its way to record profits and stranglehold power in the middle years of the past decade Gekko was it.

Joe Neumaier Monday September 20 2010 400 AM Title Wall Street Money Never Sleeps In ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" Gordon Gekko is introduced slowly and deceptively casually. Hovering around like a banished king waiting to prosper the onetime Master of the Universe is flinty his suits a summery olive his hair wavy.But when you see that slick combed-back style from 23 years ago watch out - because both Gekko and this great movie are playing to win.Everyone involved with Oliver Stones sterling sequel to his 87 classic brings their A-game.Costumer Ellen Mirojnick puts heroes in morally ambiguous gray and Josh Brolins villain in demonic red.Rodrigo Prietos cinematography makes the city a character with the Manhattan skyline eerily transparent.On the street characters sink low or have reconciliations on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum.Thats where Gekko and his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) connect after Gekko who mellowed serving seven years in prison starts mentoring Winnies fiance Jake (Shia LaBeouf). Its mid-2008 and as the recession looms Jake is looking for answers to why his investment firm collapsed.Gekko may be shady but Bretton James (Brolin) is pure evil - hes Gekko 2.0. James a kingpin with SEC connections has his dirty hands in a lot of pies and he also wants Jake as his protege. As the housing bubble bursts Jake must choose which devil hell trust more.The biggest difference between the original ""Wall Street"" and this film isnt Gekkos possible evolution to human being; its the sense of dread Stone adds to almost every scene.Working from Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiffs astute script Stone holds us all accountable for not caring as our economy barreled toward catastrophe.In ""Money Never Sleeps"" greed is a constant high with everyone chasing the dragon.Brolin as a memorable villain charges through his scenes as if hell-bent on destruction while LaBeouf plays Jake as if he can smell success just around the corner. Mulligan Susan Sarandon and Frank Langella add excellent support and even Charlie Sheen shows up as Bud Fox the wanna-be who helped put his mentor Gekko behind bars.But Douglas is the nexus. He won a Best Actor Oscar the first time around and this time gives Gekko uncounted layers as he fakes deals and fuels fires. Stone makes Gekko the speaker of hard truths and Douglas makes that investment pay off - big-time.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Michael Douglas return as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up Michael Douglas return as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street 2. Michael Douglas return as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 23 2010 546 PM Gekko Never Sleeps Michael Douglas returns in Wall Street 2. By Dana Stevens See these Magnum Photos  Wall Street  galleries. Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and Shia LaBeouf as Jake Moore inWall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps Never let it be said that Oliver Stone doesnt take advantage of a newsy opportunity. His last two films World Trade Center and W re-imagined recent events from American political history--the first as sentimental humanist drama the second (more effectively for this viewer) as satire. For Stone to have left the financial crisis of 2008 cinematically unplumbed would be like Gordon Gekko neglecting to exploit an insider tip on a failing company. So with the uncynical opportunism and merry lack of subtlety thats his wont Stone has brought Gekko the greed-extolling villain of his 1987 smash hit Wall Street back to life. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Twenty-five years into his directorial career audiences know that we dont go to Oliver Stone for nuance. We go to him for big brash sweeping morality tales and firebrand conspiracy theories for entertainment and catharsis. And for all of the weaknesses of Wall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps(20th Century Fox) as a stand-alone movie--its narratively overstuffed clumsily paced and ultimately unsure of how to present the charming moral monster at its center--the movie provides entertainment and catharsis in lavish dollops. Advertisement Though its dialogue and storytelling are often conventional this movie never creaks. It snaps beginning with a buoyant opening title sequence that superimposes the zigzagging graph of a fluctuating market onto the skyline of New York City. In a prologue we see Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas--has the parenthetical identification of an actor ever been more unnecessary?) being released from jail in 2001 after serving an eight-year term for insider trading and other misdeeds. He retrieves his property--an empty gold money clip a comically outdated cell phone--and heads out into the world broke and alone. Flash-forward to 2008 with Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) in the Charlie Sheen role of a brash young stock trader. Unlike Sheens character the struggling schmo Bud Fox Jacob lives high on the hog from the beginning sharing a palatial penthouse with his girlfriend the left-leaning blogger Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who also happens to be Gekkos estranged daughter. Out of concern for the audiences 21st-century sensibilities Jacob is also given a cause He wants to master the stock market not merely for the purposes of snorting cocaine and shacking up with Daryl Hannah but in order to fund a company thats developing a revolutionary clean-energy technology. Gekko effectuates his comeback by writing a book Is Greed Good? that appears to be at least in part a renunciation of his Reagan-era philosophy of rapaciousness. At a lecture and book signing Jacob introduces himself to Gekko as his daughters intended and the two of them enter into an underhanded arrangement In exchange for market tips from Gekko Jacob will try to intercede on his behalf for reconciliation with Winnie. (The scene in which they negotiate this agreement is one of the movies best with Douglas taking his old unctuous malice out for a spin and LaBeouf rising to the occasion with believably conflicted loyalties.) Jostling for space with this family drama is a plotline that for the sake of moral clarity and dramatic expedience compresses the entire financial crisis of fall 2008 into a standoff between two investment banks Keller Zabel directed by Jacobs mentor Lou Zabel (a magisterial Frank Langella) and Churchill Schwarz an equally troubled but less honestly run bank under the command of Bretton James (Josh Brolin). Gekko knows James from way back having competed with him for the spoils of corporate raids in the 80s. As Lou proudly refuses to sell out the firm he spent a lifetime building for pennies on the dollar Gekko warns Jacob that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. Throughout the film the frame pops with split-screen effects iris-outs graphs and charts and visual doodads. This style can seem gimmicky but its suited to the story. In the 21st century cable-TV screens and stock tickers have entered into our cultural bloodstream in a way they hadnt in 1987 and the movies visual hypermania illustrates that. New York looks lush and delectable especially in a gala ball sequence at the Metropolitan Museum that skewers consumer excess while reveling in its sparkle. Stone could be blamed for overlooking the real victims of the crisis--we never see a homeowner evicted from an overleveraged house though Susan Sarandon gets a fun walk-on as a real-estate agent in way over her head. But I appreciated that Stone spared us a sanctimonious social-realist subplot about the ""little people."" The first Wall Street was an almost Shakespearean fable about kingly succession and this one carries on that tradition. The movies punch-drunk energy cant quite make up for what without giving away any plot points I can only describe as a third-act lapse into maudlin sentimentality. By the films last frame Gordon Gekko has gone from evil to sympathetic to ambiguous so many times that we no longer trust any twist involving him. But thanks in no small part to Michael Douglas evident joy in playing the role Gekko has now become one of those characters like The Big Lebowskis Dude who no longer needs a movie to sustain him. Oliver Stones account of the events of 2008 is as unsubtle in its charms as Gordon Gekko himself. But like Gekko the film also feels urgent and strangely necessary. Like Slate on Facebook.

"Movie review Wall Street Money Never Sleeps - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Wall StreetMovie review Wall Street Money Never SleepsMichael Douglas Josh Brolin and Eli Wallach are wickedly good. Its too bad that so much time is spent with Shia LaBeouf.September 24 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic Greed may be good as Gordon Gekko insisted once upon a time but evil pays the bills at least as far as ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" is concerned. The best parts of this unfocused erratic downright messy sequel are the moments when the bad people take center stage. So lets hear it for Josh Brolins Bretton (dont even think of calling him Bret) James an investment banker with ""an ego the size of Antarctica."" And some applause for the fearless 94-year-old Eli Wallachs Julie Steinhardt terrifying when he makes eccentric bird noises and talks about the crash of 29 and the end of the world. And we cant forget Michael Douglas as Gekko Redux at least in those moments when the film allows him to be as bad as he ought to be. For this version of ""Wall Street"" cant make up its mind if Gekko is the bad-to-the-bone Lizard King he once was or someone whos seen the light thank you very much and is on the road to redemption. Or maybe hes both. The trouble is this is not an involving enough enterprise for us to work up the energy to care. As directed by a returning Oliver Stone and written by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff ""Wall Street"" similarly cant decide if its a revenge melodrama an attack on aberrant Wall Street financial practices an infomercial for hydrogen fusion or that true Oliver Stone rarity a touching romance. The film has more moving parts than a pricey Rolex and they are not all in sync. The nominal excuse for this sequel is a chance to deal with the factors that caused the recent global meltdown. But though the characters glibly throw around terms like ""credit default swaps"" and ""toxic sub-prime debt"" the words are just window dressing to give this pulpy venture an air of relevance it really doesnt have. Though it doesnt always know how to use him ""Wall Streets"" biggest asset as always is Douglas Gekko reintroduced getting out of prison in 2001 and getting reacquainted with an old mobile phone the size of a cinder block. Times have changed Mr. G get with the program or be left behind. Looking grizzled as well as charismatic like a street person turned nightclub impresario Douglas is always fun to watch and he brings considerable brio to the film as Gekko tries to reinvent himself as of all things a celebrity writer and all-around prophet of fiscal doom. Unfortunately Gekko is gone from the screen for big chunks of this ""Wall Street"" and has to share billing and face time with his co-protagonists a young hotshot trader named Jake Moore played by Shia LaBeouf who just happens to live with GGs estranged daughter played by Carey Mulligan. Director Stone has said that La Beouf reminds him of a young Tom Cruise but it is unlikely anyone else will see the resemblance. Though the film is at pains to paint his character as one tough hombre complete with motorcycle-riding chops Jake comes off more like a striving pipsqueak than a presence to be respected. That central weakness creates a black hole in the film that sucks a lot of energy out of the proceedings. Especially hampered is Carey Mulligan so luminous in ""Never Let Me Go"" and so altered here. Yes it cant be much fun to be both the Gekksters daughter and the head of a liberal website but its too bad the film seems to mandate that Winnie Gekko almost never has a nice day. ""Wall Streets"" plot such as it is has young Jake seeking out Gekko as a mentor after his original father figure an old-school investment banker named Louis Zabel (a pleasantly energetic performance from Frank Langella) meets an unfortunate end that Jake wants to avenge. Gekko agrees but like every devil he has his price He wants Jake to clandestinely help him engineer a rapprochement with the glum Winnie who has written her dad out of her life and has no interest in letting him back in. As if that wasnt enough to keep our young man busy hes also trying to keep afloat both a hydrogen fusion enterprise headed by the worried Dr. Masters (a miscast Austin Pendleton) and his own spendthrift mother (a badly used Susan Sarandon) who has wandered unwisely into real estate speculation. So many crises so little charisma. If the bad guys didnt reappear with welcome regularity ""Money Never Sleeps"" would be even more of a snooze than it already is. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCommentary Gordon Gekko may be a problem for Mitt RomneyApril 15 2012Michael Douglas says Gordon Gekko was wrong -- greed is not...February 27 2012Wall Street insiders open up for Money Never SleepsSeptember 24 2010MOVIE REVIEWS  Wall Street Lays an EggDecember 11 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTWall StreetEntertainmentGordon GekkoCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-wallstreet-20100924,0,1970778.story",200,wallstreetmoneyneversleeps20,wallstreetmoneyneversleeps,latimes

But times have definitely changed. By Tom Horgen Star Tribune September 23 2010 -- 247pm 20th Century Fox Star Tribune Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf in ""Wall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Twenty-three years ago Michael Douglas melted beautifully into the role of Gordon Gekko the reptilian bad boy who ruled Oliver Stones ""Wall Street."" It was the 1980s -- the age of excess -- and Gekko was the ultimate player stalking the financial markets like a big-game hunter. Douglas was almost hypnotic in the role delivering his lines like full-blown sermons. ""Greed ... is good"" he declared. You couldnt keep your eyes off this villain in a necktie. And his menace was rewarded with an Oscar for best actor. That was 1987. Apparently Hollywood has no statute of limitations on sequels. Which brings us to ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps."" When we left Gekko at the close of the 1980s his former protege (played by Charlie Sheen) had given him up to the feds on insider trading charges. Stones sequel takes place in 2008. Gekko is out of prison but stripped of everything that made him a Wall Street tycoon. His hair has turned a shiny silver wrinkles surround his eyes like fault lines and he has no money. But he has the fortitude to write a book with a title that questions his very being -- ""Is Greed Good?"" This reformed Gekko is an antihero of sorts to the young financial minions who dot the new Wall Street landscape particularly Shia LaBeoufs Jacob an energy trader for a large investment firm. Stone tells the story of the financial collapse through the eyes of Gekko and Jacob. Jacobs firm is based on Bear Stearns the investment giant that was one of the first to burn in the financial systems meltdown. In the opening of ""Money Never Sleeps"" Jacobs mentor and boss (Frank Langella) commits suicide rather than face the impending cataclysm. Jacob blames his death and the crumbling of their company on a rival banker played with slithery glee by Josh Brolin. WALL STREET 2 MONEY NEVER SLEEPS  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and thematic elements. Like some fairy godfather of the financial market Gekko agrees to aid Jacob in his revenge plot. In exchange the old master wants to be reunited with his estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who is engaged to Jacob. Douglas who will turn 66 this week has a lot of fun stepping back into Gekkos shoes but the characters comedic tone seems to suggest parody rather than grizzled wisdom. An aging big-hearted Gordon Gekko isnt the only thing different about this overlong ""Wall Street."" Stone is a different filmmaker than he was two decades ago. The director was at the peak of his powers back then. He had just made ""Platoon"" and was flirting with a more frenetic (yet measured) visual style that would be fully realized in movies like ""JFK."" ""Wall Street"" was simply an exhilarating piece of 1980s filmmaking. Stones portrait of that eras corporate raiding was exciting fun and morally ambiguous. Here however his visual tricks are tired and random. He employs split-screen sequences without rhyme or reason. The ghost of Langella shows up in a truly laughable sequence. And then theres the music. Much of ""Money Never Sleeps"" is set to overripe elevator music. Where the movie would have benefited from a score that evoked a foreboding mood Stone employs a soundtrack that could be interchanged with Katherine Heigls next romantic-comedy. Its that off-putting. Or maybe its intentional. Eventually Stone allows the squishy love story between Jacob and Winnie to take center stage. Its a mistake. The dramatic overplay of their relationship ends up taking the rest of the movie down with it. This ""Wall Street"" needed less coddling and more cutthroat.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Wall Street Money Never Sleeps amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Waiting for Superman Let Me In >> Wall Street Money Never Sleeps After nearly a decade in prison guards have given Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) back his gold watch his gold ring his gold money clip and his freedom. Watch out world. Flash-forward seven years to 2008 and Gekkos written a book Is Greed Good? and become the hero of the lecture circuit with his fanged tirades about a financial system gone bonkers. Hes still a wolf in wolfs clothing. The question is How big is his hunger? Gekkos the predator circling Oliver Stones sequel. The stars--or prey--are his estranged daughter Carey Mulligan and her live-in boyfriend Shia LaBeouf an idealistic trader trying to scare up money for alternative energy. Stones two major themes (three if you count the nods to his 1987 original) are bubbles and extinction two ways Wall Street could have--and should have?--collapsed that fall of 08 when Americans learned wed double-mortgaged the foundation of our country. The first half of the film is as fine a movie as youll see all year. Stone humanizes ticker tape. Frank Langella is the face of old-style trading Josh Brolin is the new-style villain and their confrontations with other suits have the frisson of powerful deals and the pleasure of a pack of hunters fighting over a kill. Theyre in it because money is glory and glory is fun--and the bloodier the better. But Stone needs Hollywood hyenas; our stock market schadenfreude demands a satisfying ending. Only how can he give us one when we know the bad guys won?

The film whipsaws between hyperbolic character study and preachy account of the recent financial meltdown. The two story lines are not well-integrated. Rather than seem to explain the financial meltdown of two years ago Money Never Sleeps uses the 2008 banking crisis as decor.Mostly I just sat back and enjoyed the actors. No one is better than Douglas at slipping into the skin of a human snake. As Douglas slithers LaBeouf zags unexpectedly good at playing the youth caught between social idealism and corporate pragmatism.Jake wants to invest in green energy. For the paycheck he works for Bretton James (Josh Brolin) a vulture who possesses even more money and arrogance than Gekko in his heyday. James holds the Securities and Exchange Commission in his oily grip and his Morgan Stanley-like company has acquired Jakes failing brokerage.The motif of Stone films diverse as Platoon Wall Street Any Given Sunday and Alexander is a young mans search for the ideal father or father figure whether it be his parent sergeant boss football coach or tutor. Money Never Sleeps in which Jake loses a mentor and looks for a replacement fits this mold.In the films early sequences Jake loses his boss Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) principal of a Bear Stearns-like brokerage on the brink of collapse and taken over by Bretton James.Hungry for a new mentor Jake seeks revenge against the man feasting on Zabels carcass. As if by magnetic force (or cosmic coincidence) Jake gravitates to Gekko newly released from prison in the hopes that his future father-in-law can help him take down James. If Gekko does Jake will broker a reconciliation with him and his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan fetching and underutilized).Onto Jakes revenge scenario screenwriters Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff graft the macro story of how the banks and SEC sucker-punched America. The operation doesnt take. The bankers manipulations are the weakest element of Stones Black Monday of a movie where the dizzying array of split-screens and graphs looks like a PowerPoint in search of a thesis.Much as I enjoyed watching Douglas and LaBeouf dance their verbal tango I cringed whenever Brolin ordinarily an actor of some subtlety peacocked across the screen declaiming his lines.As a demonstration of two actors working near the top of their game Money Never Sleeps is diverting enough. But as a cautionary tale of personal and business ethics the film has all the urgency of snail mail.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickey phillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps finds Oliver Stone in an ebullient I-told-you-so mood. Set just before and after the 2008 financial meltdown the new movie is an enjoyably frisky mess with the camera dashing into boardrooms and bedrooms and characters coming at each other from all sides. The films lack of focus is almost criminal but schadenfreude energizes Stone. Everyone here is dancing on a bubble and no one has the guts to admit the bubble is about to pop.Does the director really have to illustrate that with a scene of schoolchildren blowing actual bubbles into the Central Park sky? Of course he does; otherwise he wouldnt be Oliver Stone. After a decade-plus of contentiously received documentaries (""Comandante) box office bombs (""Alexander) and retread Stone-isms (""W.) the sequel to 1987s ""Wall Street lets the director tap into the filmmaking brio if not the social indignation of his younger self.The most telling difference this time is that Michael Douglass Gordon Gekko is no longer a villain as slimy as his namesake but a grand old alter ego -- the devil at twilight. ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is supposedly the story of one Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) an ambitious young trader who sets out to avenge his mentor (Frank Langella) and ends up playing the big boys for his soul. Whatever; Douglas steals every scene hes in.Released from prison early in the film -- no ones there to greet him; the waiting limo is for a gangbanger -- Gekko haunts the edges of the movie and slowly smilingly burrows inward until once again its all about him. To bide his time he writes a tell-all book and gives seminars that ask ""Is Greed Good? as if he ever doubted the answer.If Gekko is the jester on the sidelines cackling as he predicts imminent financial collapse Jake is in there pitching as fast as he can. His pet company is a high-tech fusion start-up manned by sweet old Austin Pendleton but when the film opens Jakes investment firm -- a frank stand-in for Bear Stearns -- is going under. Langella plays Lew Zabel the head of Keller-Zabel as tough and avuncular rather than frosty and patrician; hes a street fighter who has gotten slow and hes something to see as he rages at ice-cold rival Bretton James (Josh Brolin) of Churchill Schwartz (a.k.a. JPMorgan and/or Goldman Sachs). The scene is a boardroom at the Fed but the vibe is Shakespearean complete with Eli Wallach -- now officially older than God -- stirring the caldron in the corner.""Wall Street plays roman a clef with the players and companies of the 2008 subprime lending crisis and Stones too busy racing around to hand you a scorecard. The movies biggest liability is the financial doubletalk that comes off the screen in great loopy waves; if you try to make sense of it rather than listen to it like jazz youll miss the point. The point is that everyone was listening to it like jazz.The movies second biggest liability is that its hero is a skunk. Jake is engaged to Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) a political writer for a small lefty blog; her character is meant to represent all the decent people out there that Stone isnt terribly interested in this time around. Its never clear what these two are doing together since Jake spends most of his time courting her father enlisting the exiles advice for his showdown with Bretton James. There are small deceptions that build to bigger lies and then a whopper of a betrayal and LaBeouf doesnt have the charm to keep us in his corner for the long haul. He holds the screen but he doesnt do enough with it.So Stone keeps the edges of ""Money Never Sleeps humming to take your mind off the hole at its middle. Mulligan is impossible to not adore even if her characters a drip; Susan Sarandon goes amusingly Lawn Guyland as Jakes mom a former nurse now desperately overleveraged in the housing market; Gekko goes to a fund-raiser and up pops Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) the young idealistic hero of ""Wall Street gone fat and complacent. No ones innocent anymore.Douglas though is the films ace in the hole. At this stage in his career the actors a silkier more seductive version of his father Kirk; he buries the teeth-gritting Douglas intensity behind charm but its there. Gekko is this films Savonarola preaching against the mendacity of the new millennial fat cats -- ""the mother of all evils is speculation -- but what really gets his goat isnt their greed. Greed is good remember? Stupid greed the kind that infected the lowliest investor and the US government alike is just pathetic. In ""Money Never Sleeps Gekko and his creator have a good hard laugh at all our expenses.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Oliver Stones Wall Street felt like a film willed into being by its times. A capstone to the anything-goes economy of the Reagan 80s it arrived on the heels of a 1987 stock-market crash and amid a flurry of stories of illegal behavior inspired by the notion that as Michael Douglas uber-trader Gordon Gekko so memorably put it ""greed is good."" Though guilty of the same overstatement that characterizes well all of Stones films its at heart a sturdy morality tale the story of a kid who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for money and stainless-steel kitchen appliances then tries to snatch it back before its too late. With the economy still reeling from the 2008 collapse the time would seem to be right for a return trip to the world of Wall Street and the opening stretch of its sequel Wall Street Money Never Sleeps suggests Stone had the right idea when he decided to revisit it. Directing with a sweeping muscularity--abetted by the superstar Steadicam work of cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto--Stone opens by showing the collapse of a Lehman Brothers-like investment house from the viewpoint of a scrappy young trader (Shia LaBeouf) still idealistic enough to channel time and money into funding an alternative-energy research project. Aghast LaBeouf watches as the institution crumbles taking mentor Frank Langella with it. Clearly he needs another role model if hes to survive in the world of high finance. Enter Douglas Gekko whos conveniently also the estranged father of LaBeoufs girlfriend (Carey Mulligan). Having served time for the crimes of the 80s hes reinvented himself as a cautionary tale writing a book called Is Greed Good? and delivering anti-motivational lectures to college kids explaining the dimness of their financial future. After LaBeouf introduces himself following one of these appearances he and Douglas initiate a series of trades in which Douglas provides information about the truth behind the collapse of Langellas firm--particularly the role played by the sharkish Josh Brolin--in return for an opportunity to reunite with Mulligan. The first scenes between LaBeouf and Douglas feel electric as Douglas casually tosses off backhanded compliments about his new friends interest in green energy--""Its the next bubble""--while LaBeouf sups on the wisdom of a man whos seen it all. Now if only the film knew what it wanted to do with that relationship--or any relationship really. Once the unrepentant demon of the financial district Gekko shifts personalities from scene to scene. Thats partly because the film plays coy about his real motives but it mostly seems to be a part of the general aimlessness that eventually plagues the film. Still Douglas creates some striking moments in spite of the confusion particularly in a monologue about a drug-addicted son thats close to autobiography. Stone mixes familiar moments of corporate intrigue with terms from the recent financial meltdown that never get properly explained. (Theres no missing the significance of Stones repeated use of falling-domino imagery or the barely metaphorical shots of bursting bubbles.) The films urgency evaporates the deeper it gets into the plot and the more concerned it grows with finger-pointing particularly in a subplot involving Susan Sarandon as LaBeoufs real-estate-investing mom. The first time around Wall Street felt like a warning about the perils of excess just as excess started to exact its toll. This ones little more than a reminder that we all got and remain screwed.

"Wall Street Money Never Sleeps shows softer side of 80s villain - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Wall Street Money Never Sleeps shows softer side of 80s villainWall Street Money Never Sleeps a 2A1/2 starsSeptember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticIts a pleasure to have Gordon Gekko slithering among his lesser capitalists once again and Michael Douglas -- one of those rare movie stars who with each film in his recent career phase have grown more and more interesting -- turns the domestication of a very famous greedmonger into a source of amusement pathos and genial duplicity. The movie itself just OK. But ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" director Oliver Stones sequel to his 1987 melodrama has its satisfactions thanks mainly to a cast skillful enough to finesse what is effectively two films sharing the same screen. One concerns Gekkos comeback after doing time for securities fraud and related crimes. The other is a romance involving a hotshot Wall Street trader played by Shia LaBeouf and his ""lefty Web site"" lover and fiancee Gekkos estranged daughter played by the formidable British actress Carey Mulligan. For more than two decades Stone has professed astonishment at how the original ""Wall Street"" turned Gekko into a sleek pop culture symbol beloved imitated one-upped in real life by young bucks messing with other peoples money everywhere. How much of Bud Fox (the originals Charlie Sheen character who appears briefly here) do we remember from that film really? He was little more than a narrative conduit to a seductively oily world. Gekko thanks to Douglas Oscar-winning turn ruled that world sucking skulls (or threatening to) all the livelong day. The mood is different more rueful in ""Wall Street 2."" The script by Allan Loeb rewritten from earlier drafts turned in by Stephen Schiff begins in October 2001 with Gekkos release from the pen. No ones there to pick him up after he collects his effects which include ""one gold money clip with no money in it."" But he has a gleam in his eye and money-making skills in his bones. His new book ""Is Greed Good?"" makes amends for his former rapaciousness. After a university lecture one day Jake (LaBeouf) introduces himself as the legendary Gekkos future son-in-law. Gekko strings him along feeding Jake valuable dangerous information regarding enemies of Jakes mentor the embattled scion played by Frank Langella. In return Jake paves the way for Gekkos reunion with his daughter. Josh Brolin is the snakelike rival investment house guru one of Gekkos old adversaries. In ""Platoon"" terms ""Wall Street 2"" presents Jake with a good father figure (Langella) a bad one (Brolin) and the in-betweener with the name like a lizard. Winnie oversees her progressive muckraking Web site (""Frozen Truth"") which is alleged to be a ""shoestring"" organization although when Stone gives us the establishing shot of the palatial loft filled with extras its like the rebirth of journalism. Why is she hanging around with a Wall Street slicko like Jake? Because hes an idealist who believes in alternative energy sources and the money they can generate. And he rides a motorbike. And theres something of her own slippery father in him. This being a Stone picture when someone sees something on television she doesnt like seeing she doesnt merely turn off the TV via remote. She throws the remote across the room. Seasoned performers such as Langella and as Jakes financially strapped real estate agent mother Susan Sarandon tear into their respective scenery-chewing stereotypes as though they havent eaten in days. Yet theres an old-fashioned slightly cheesy swagger to the picture that carries it to the two-thirds point at which time the two competing pictures start having serious trouble being in the same frame. Its success or failure in the marketplace I suppose will depend on how audiences will take this new more ""approachable"" Gekko. Certainly audiences should respond to the quality of Douglas work. He overplays not a single moment or look or zinger. Douglas has been in the news lately for his battle with cancer and that off-camera fact has a way of informing Douglas on-camera achievement. I wish the film hadnt turned Gekko into such a sweetie; the script goes dangerously soft on its most valuable commodity. But a valuable commodity in this market can never be underestimated. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for brief strong language and thematic elements) Cast Michael Douglas (Gordon Gekko); Shia LaBeouf (Jake Moore); Carey Mulligan (Winnie Gekko); Josh Brolin (Bretton James); Frank Langella (Louis Zabel); Susan Sarandon (Sylvia) Credits Directed by Oliver Stone; written by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff; produced by Edward R.

Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Fair to Good Director Oliver Stone. Cast Michael Douglas Shia LaBeouf Josh Brolin. Rating Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and thematic elements. Qamp;A Director Oliver Stone Michael Douglas attends NYC Wall Street premiere That kind of passion rarely lasts for the balance of a career; trying to maintain it all the time would burn anyone out. So while its no great surprise that ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" is not as searing as the original film Stone directed 23 years ago it is satisfying to see that its still a worthwhile entry in the Stone canon a technically fascinating film thats best when its angry less good when romance rears its head. Another way of putting it is that when Michael Douglas is on-screen in a reprisal of his Oscar-winning role of greed-is-good icon Gordon Gekko the movie is compelling entertaining and a lot of fun. The same goes for the appearances by Josh Brolin who plays Bretton James a sort-of successor to Gekko but someone who takes the whole game further a crazy man who along with those of his ilk helped bring down the U.S. economy. Alas theres more. Shia LaBeouf the wonders of whose talent have so far largely escaped me is on hand as a young Wall Street trader a true believer in the system before it went bust but a believer with a twist His pet project is channeling money into green energy as sure a sign that we are to take him as a good guy as a white hat in an old Western. A tragedy involving his mentor (Frank Langella in a small but impactful role) leads Jake LaBeoufs character on a different path one that involves revenge as well as teaming up with Gekko now out of prison and hawking a book on the economy all over cable television in a funny aside. A further complication Jake is in love with Winnie (Carey Mulligan) Gekkos estranged daughter. Mulligan is a luminous talent but here shes basically the wounded party little more raising red flags of warning when she learns that Jake is growing close with her father. Stone is on surer footing when hes slamming the system taking us behind the scenes as the barons of Wall Street try to negotiate their way out of trouble with little regard for the people whose money has made them titans. Here he has something to say something to rail against. Greed is good? Hmm. Howd that work out? As Gekko points out in one of his speaking engagements apparently now its legal too. Stone is a great technical director and he uses his skill to excellent effect here. He loads the screen with information - montages of cable-news reports stock listings more more more. We live in an information age of course; Stone shows us that information overload is one of the consequences. Douglas is so comfortable in his role that you sort of like the guy even when his behavior is appalling. Its nice to see him and Stone reunited. ""Money Never Sleeps"" is not a great movie not the shock to the system that the first film was. But its an effective commentary on what greed cost us all of us. No one is unaffected by the most-recent financial meltdown which means that everyone can relate - and react - to what Stone is presenting us with here a look at how it all went wrong.

""Greed...is good"" he famously declared the mans material lust embodied with Oscar-winning polish by Michael Douglas in Oliver Stones 1987 portrait of a go-go gone-gone era. Gekko stalked and pounced in a stratosphere measured by leveraged buyouts and timed by gold Rolex watches. His fate? At the end of Wall Street he turned in his fancy timepiece for a stint in the slammer. Now in Stones made-for-the-moment sequel Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Gekkos out of prison -- and its not at all clear what he wants. In the beginning hes released from the federal pen in (pre-9/11) 2001 with no one to meet him at the prison gate. Then with a leap its 2008 on the eve of what we know with rueful hindsight is an American financial crisis that reverberates still. The new blood on the Street is represented by Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) a nimble trader at a big Bear Stearns-like firm who swears filial allegiance to his old mentor (Frank Langella) capitalist fidelity to the possibilities of alternative energy and romantic loyalty to his sweetheart Winnie (Carey Mulligan). Winnie is a crusading Internet journalist who hates Wall Street maybe because her father is Gordon Gekko. A lot of Money Never Sleeps -- too much -- is about Gekko peres desire to reconnect with his very angry daughter and about Jakes mostly noble but sometimes conveniently self-serving attempts to broker a reconciliation. And some of the movie is about Jakes mostly noble but sometimes conveniently self-serving attempts to avenge what befalls his old mentor as the ground begins to shake with the first tremors of a financial earthquake. In this LaBeoufs crisp approach serves him well. Hes a grown-up in a grown-up part. Mulligan brings nuance to the role of a young woman who has paid a steep price for being a child of wealth. Josh Brolin has fun playing an outright conscienceless avaricious villain just so we can boo him. Hes an easy effigy figure made for burning. But Gordon Gekko? Hes unreadable to the end -- victim (an odd word to apply to GG) of the filmmakers conflicting desires. Temperamentally Oliver Stone loves to throw himself into the macho bloodiness of a cinematic fray. Thats his strength. But here he also wants to murmur a trite and pious lullaby about how children-are-our-real-wealth la la la. Its clear Stone loves the power and poshness of the boom-boom celebrities who swan through his picture including Jim Cramer and Maria Bartiromo as well as Charlie Sheen reprising his role as Gekkos protege-turned-nemesis Bud Fox. But the director seems uncharacteristically preachy in a square Our Dumb Nation way as if wringing his hands with fatherly worry that some heedless pup or other will go home and practice Gekkovian speeches in front of a mirror. Hence the patronizing lesson Greed is not good.

"Wall Street Money Never Sleeps (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Wall Street Money Never Sleeps (PG-13) A kinder gentler Oliver Stone revisits Wall Street Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald9/22/2010 Editor rating 2.5 At the start of Wall Street Money Never Sleeps the once-fearsome tycoon Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving an eight-year sentence for insider trading and other illegal corporate maneuverings. His massive fortune has been reduced to a state-issued check for 1800. His belongings consist of a wristwatch and an amusingly large obsolete cellphone. When he walks outside the gates no one waits to pick him up. The man who became an iconic anti-hero for the give-me-more 1980s in Wall Street is now a penniless nobody - a fallen titan. Fallen perhaps but not broken as hell prove seven years later in 2008 when a storm of pain in the form of a crippling recession begins to rain down on the banking and investment industry. The hotshot young trader Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is making a name for himself in Wall Street corridors. Hes also in a serious relationship with Winnie (Carey Mulligan) Gekkos estranged daughter who despises her father so much she bristles at the mention of his name. Jacobs boss and mentor investment banker Louis (Frank Langella) is generous and fatherly to his disciple. But Louis loses his nerve and permanently checks out of the game after a corporate rival (a snaky Josh Brolin) manipulates the market against him and ruins his company. Shaken and confused Jacob seeks out the advice of Gordon who has apparently reformed and written a bestselling book about the perils of greed. But does Gordon really believe the philosophy hes spouting? Has this cagey old leopard really managed to change his spots? Much like its clunky subtitle Wall Street Money Never Sleeps feels somewhat superfluous - a sequel born of a creative whim that director Oliver Stone decided to turn into film. The movie elegantly shot by Rodrigo Prieto is sleek and brisk using split-screens and graphics to help uninformed viewers grasp the basics of the corporate shenanigans the characters pull on each other. The film also offers a luxurious plunge into the world of the rich and privileged where a million dollars is tantamount to pocket change and priceless paintings are hung on walls to match the rooms decor. But unlike Wall Street in which watching Gekko take over and then dismantle an airline for profit was engrossing and informative the sequels financial plotline is just a generic gloss over the economic crisis - a compendium of scenes involving boardroom meetings and shady phone calls. What does work well in Wall Street Money Never Sleeps which has a surprisingly bouncy and effervescent tone considering its subject matter are the characters. Douglas who remains off-screen for surprisingly large chunks plays Gekko close to the vest As with the other people in the film were not quite sure if we should trust him. ""When I was away it seems like greed got greedier with a little bit of envy mixed in he says with just the right touch of ambivalence. Is he being critical of that envy or is he feeling some himself? LaBeouf the films true protagonist continues to prove hes a natural movie star more than holding his own against Douglas and making palpable Jacobs angst and growing suspicion that he might be making a terrible mistake. In a small role as his mother Susan Sarandon embodies the spirit of real-estate investors who thought they could get rich quick by flipping properties - until the market crashed taking their dreams with it. There are several amusing cameos (including a great unexpected one and a highly distracting recurring one by Stone) plus a third-act twist that briefly recalls the savage take-no-prisoners edge of the original film. But Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is ultimately a gentler more sentimental and conventional movie - the undeniably polished and professional work of a once-iconoclastic filmmaker who appears to be mellowing with age. I liked him better when he was ruthless. Cast Michael Douglas Shia LaBeouf Carey Mulligan Josh Brolin Frank Langella Eli Wallach Susan Sarandon. Director Oliver Stone. Screenwriters Allan Loeb Stephen Schiff. Producers Edward R. Pressman Eric Kopeloff. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 132 minutes. Vulgar language adult themes.

Wall Street Money Never Sleeps doesnt have the clean fable-like arc of its predecessor the tale of the Fox and the Gekko (Charlie Sheens upstart broker Bud Michael Douglass Wall Street player Gordon). Only the buccaneer charisma of Douglass signature role obscured the ""Clean business clean soul"" moral of Wall Street released two months after 1987s Black Monday. But everything is so much murkier now. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Business pages have begun decoding Wall Street 2 Electric Boogaloo with pieces in the Times and the Observer linking the films creations to real-life models The white-shoe ""Keller-Zabel"" firm for example is a Bear Stearns/Lehman Brothers amalgam.They employ whiz-kid proprietary trader Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) a specialist in alternative energy whose story begins in oblivious pre-crash 2008 as he sights a gathering storm in the gray lost expression of Lew Zabel (Frank Langella) managing partner and his father figure. Foundered by rumored toxic subprime debt Lew goes before the Federal Reserve Board a three-ton conference table of the old the white and the ugly including Eli Wallach as a relic who predates the income tax ending every proclamation with a fluttering bird call. Hope of clemency is cut off when Mephistophelean hedge-fund manager Bretton James (Josh Brolin) of Churchill Schwartz leans into frame ""Your valuations are no longer believable"" are the words that drop like a guillotine.Negotiating a humiliating fire sale in payback for a grudge from the dot-com bubble burst James leaves Zabel for dead--and Jake goes looking for revenge and a new mentor. One possibility is the estranged father of the girl hes going to marry Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan pure chloroform). Coming out of Sing Sing in the films prologue Dad Douglass aquiline profile could belong to a hungover Founding Father. Made an example of by the S.E.C. and spurned by his only relation Gekko has become a prophet in the wilderness of financial doomsday hawking his book ""Is Greed Good?"" on the lecture circuit. ""Youre the NINJA generation--no income no job no assets"" he tells a crowd of twentysomethings including Jake who starts meeting with Gekko behind Winnies back pumping the guru for advice in exchange for facilitating a family reunion. Jakes other role model is his new boss--James himself. Impressed by the kids sabotage attempts James keeps his enemy closer at Churchill Schwartz.LaBeouf whose wholly inexplicable celebrity suggests he has compromising photos of God is tasked with reflecting the films subtler dilemmas such as whether Zabels honest incompetence is nobler than Jamess wicked efficiency. But projecting ambition through a pert frown and intent gum-chewing hes flat and dull where he needs to gleam from both sides of a divided loyalty. Theres no sense of moral suspense in Jake and Jamess uneasy partnership and when master and pupil face off after taking a foreplay motorcycle-race through the woods bantamweight Jake looks lost in his leather biker togs. Tellingly LaBeouf is most convincing opposite Susan Sarandon playing his McMansion-flipping mother.""Its very hard to do a financial movie to make stocks and bonds sexy and interesting"" Stone told Fortune on Wall Streets 20th anniversary before a bull market for white-collar wickedness greenlit a follow-up. He does his utmost In addition to his beloved stop-motion scudding clouds we have eccentric cell-phone split-screens and Bloomberg terminal readouts superimposed over images. The Dow Jones arches and plunges along downtowns skyline; a spiraling crane shot rises alongside Philip Johnsons Lipstick Building. And while the sequel subtitle suggests 24-hour enmeshed world markets new internationalism is limited to a second-unit trip to London (Gekko models smashing Savile Row suits) and a visit from some Chinese investors that prompts a hoary cliche as Jake--surprise--whips Mandarin fluency out of his back pocket.The ""stocks and bonds"" story moves along nicely in fact all headlines and hambone pissing contests and Brolin demolishing his office with an old master canvas. Its Jakes the personal-is-professional merger with the Gekko family that shows a tendency to melodrama unredeemed by wit. Working in the good-guy field of ""saltwater fusion"" hes no idealist. ""The only green is money honey"" he tells the fiancee whose pretty Swiss bank account hell sweet-talk his way into while clandestinely meeting with Gekko whos working angles all his own.""Were all mixed bags"" is the conclusion of unwieldy mixed bag Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. If barely prosecuted the real players in our last crash face a long pop-culture pillorying. That is not however how Stone works; regarding power his conclusions are best summed up by the hippie chick at the Lincoln Memorial in Nixon ""You cant stop it can you? Even if you wanted to. Its not you. Its the system."" Floating off on a faux-naive happy ending this time one takes the lesson that there are no villains--or that villains are all there are.1 Douglas looking more like his father every dayBarry Wetcher Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Old Greed New Greed Gordon Gekko updates his portfolio. Plus Waiting for Superman takes flight. _ By David Edelstein Published Sep 20 2010 ShareThis (Photo Barry Wetcher/Courtesy of 20th Century Fox) The best thing in Oliver Stones Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is a brief overture in which Michael Douglass Gordon Gekkohis face obscured until the last second to build anticipationemerges from prison after eight years to find no one waiting. Douglas registers the emptiness breathes in and out takes in the space. Then a look comes into his eyes calculating predatory. It says that Gekkos will is intact that what he does now will be worth watching. Vain hope. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps might be the movie-TV crossover point wherein the sequel to an influential eighties motion picture is so loaded with characters and crosscurrents that we wonder why it isnt a thirteen-hour cable mini-series instead of an impacted two-hour mess. The film is like my portfolio full of promise with minuscule returns. And yet this is the rare sequel that has a good reason to exist. In Wall Street (1987) Stone came up with a brilliant trick putting lefty critiques of capitalism into the mouth of his Uber-capitalist villainas boasts. And lo impressionable young people loved Gekkos ease with his vast wealth his lack of shame. Stone and Douglas were reportedly surprised theyd created not just a monster but a role model. So bringing Gekko back makes all kinds of sense Lets see what he makes of an even more evolved more insidious breed of predators. Will he fight them or join them or find some other path to the mother lode? Its damn hard to diagram. After the overture Gekko stays offscreen for most of the first act in which we meet the clean-cut male ingenue Jacob (Shia LaBeouf). Hes engaged to Gekkos estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who runs an investigative website. More than that hes out for revenge. He worked for a venerable firm modeled on Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothersin other words it went down hard. So did its director Jacobs mentor a dolorous Care Bear played with incomparable gravity by Frank Langella. It was the wicked Churchill Schwartz (read Goldman Sachs) partner Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who circulated rumors about the firm starting the panicand then finished the old man off before the Federal Reserve Board. Jacob wants blood and if he has to be counseled by Gordon Gekko well to whom did Clarice Starling go for help? In prospect its all so enticing the Machiavellian stratagems; the tumultuous father-daughter reunions; the financial collapse of 2008; a cameo by Charlie Sheen. Apart from the stray bubble drifting past the camera to reinforce the idea that this is you know a bubble economy there are no unintentional laughs and the cast is ready to go for broke. Eli Wallach is around as an ancient gnome whos the black shriveled heart of Wall Street and Brolin lit from below pitches his voice somewhere between street thug and silky satanic overlord. He sneers at Gekkos insider-trading conviction Nobody needs inside information anymore to get rich. But even before the air goes out of the movie (about halfway through) there are off notes. Gekko gives a speech about greed and students drink in his now-conventional wisdom about the overextension of credit and an economy built on moving money around in circles. Jacob rebukes his mother (Susan Sarandon) for giving up nursing to sell real estate a scene that needs more buildup or follow-through or something. By the time Bretton challenges Jacob to a motorcycle race on the day the market plunges the film is on life support. The revenge plot falls by the wayside; Gekko pulls a fast one; Jacob and Winnie hit the skids; Jacob mopes. Does Stone believe that Lehman Brothers fell because of rumors started by a rival? Whats behind the alternative-energy company that Jacob labors to keep alive? Gekko asks Jacob if he wonders why Winnie hooked up with a Wall Street guy when she despises her dadand its a great question (Stone must think he has done his job merely by raising it.) The movie has about five endings the last one the corniest. As with many recent Stone projects its hard to tell what the focus is supposed to be. Stone has said he wanted to prove definitively that Gekkos greed is good speech was wrong but Douglas is nowhere near as devilish (or as vivid) this time around. Compounding the confusion is the Sheen cameo He approaches Gekko at a party with a gorgeous woman on each arm having gone on to make a fortune. The scene is a joke on Sheens persona and its wonderful in all kinds of waysexcept the one that matters. In Wall Street Bud sacrificed his own career for an ideal. And then he became rich sleazy Charlie Sheen? For all Stones vaunted political commitment does he believe in anything beside the infinite corruptibility of humankind? 1 2 Next Share this story...

""Is greed good?"" muses Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" and one cant help but wonder in return Has Gordon Gekko gone soft? The answer is sort of -- a development that takes some of the bite out of Oliver Stones shrewdly opportunistic glibly entertaining sequel which offers another surface-skimming peek inside the power corridors of global finance this time during the 2008 economic crisis. Still the chance to see Douglas reprise his seminal role is sure to stimulate interest among the originals many fans giving Foxs Sept. 24 release a shot at bullish returns in most markets. Intended as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed Stones 1987 original instead had the effect of turning Douglas hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon -- an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set such a terrible example. But the intervening years particularly the past decade have given us no shortage of real-life wake-up calls -- from Enron and Bernie Madoff to the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression -- and Stone to his credit takes a less finger-wagging approach this time around trusting audiences to feel sufficiently chastened going in. Stone also seems well aware that the last thing most moviegoers want is a depressing dramatization or comprehensive overview of what has become a grim everyday reality. Thus one tycoons suicide by subway train notwithstanding the overall mood is brisk light even playful. Scribes Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff have taken care to distill complex economic concepts into terms a non-finance major can keep up with (illustrated by a few too many zippy graphics split-screen montages and shots of the Gotham skyline) all the while supplying Gekko with a steady stream of barbed aphorisms to chew on and spit out for his and the viewers delectation. The opening scene finds Gekko being released from federal prison having served eight years for corporate malfeasance. Unshaven and virtually penniless the dispirited icon disappears for the first half-hour as the film leaps forward seven years to introduce whip-smart Manhattan go-getter Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). Unlike Charlie Sheens Bud Fox Jake has already made his first million as a trader for Keller Zabel Investments run by his gruffly affectionate mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). But Jake the film takes pains to note is a good liberal at heart; his real passion is alternative energy and he has a steady relationship with left-leaning blogger Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who conveniently happens to be Gekkos daughter. Casually dropping terms such as ""speculation"" and ""leveraged debt"" along with frequent references to the plummeting housing market the film establishes the initial signs of unrest as Keller Zabel whose stock price has plunged amid rumors of massive debt is swiftly taken over by Zabels bitter rival billionaire raider Bretton James (Josh Brolin). Devastated and yearning for payback Jake gets his shot when Bretton seeing the young mans talent potential offers him a job at his firm whose partners include Julie Steinhardt (Eli Wallach) a fount of wisdom old enough to have lived through the Depression. To leverage his position Jake does some personal insider trading of his own with Gekko who gives Jake crafty advice in return for access to Winnie who has never forgiven her fathers crimes. Its a setup for a keen investigation of what happens when the professional gets in bed with the personal -- a new definition of ""moral hazard"" -- and Jake finds himself in over his head as he exploits both the market and the media in the interests of petty revenge. LaBeouf (who between this and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" seems to be the new poster boy for franchise renewals) looks even more boyish than Sheen did and while he talks a good line hes less assured when called upon to shed earnest tears which is often. Mulligan does better bringing solid reserves of emotion to a role that at times threatens to tip over into sanctimony and her eventual heart-to-heart with Douglas breaking years of angry silence is surprisingly wrenching stuff. Like the first film ""Money Never Sleeps"" deploys Douglas sparingly which has the desired effect -- when hes not onscreen you wish he were -- but also keeps the actor from giving the sort of fully rounded characterization he did in the recent indie ""Solitary Man"" in which he also played a smooth talker in search of redemption. Older grayer and perhaps a touch less snakelike Douglas is still insinuatingly good and his performance lays the groundwork for the films one spectacularly cynical twist -- one that proves too much for the films crowd-pleasing instincts to bear. Suffice it to say that in dramatic terms Stone winds up bailing out his characters. Still after his attempts to branch out slightly with ""World Trade Center"" and ""W."" ""Money Never Sleeps"" finds Stone at ease in a way he hasnt been in years his camera moving assuredly from high-powered charity banquets to the Federal Reserve Boards inner chambers to de rigueur shots of the trading-room floor. Tech package is polished all around although the editing -- mixing in fades dissolves iris shots and other retro transitions -- seems a bit over-caffeinated. In a nod to the 1987 film songs by David Byrne and Brian Eno fill out the soundtrack. Wall Street Money Never SleepsProductionA 20th Century Fox release of an Edward R.
