Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Final Destination 3"" with Mary Elizabeth Winstead Ryan Merriman Kris Lemche. Directed by James Wong from a screenplay by Wong and Glen Morgan. 92 minutes. Rated R for strong horror violence/gore language and some nudity. Several theaters. There must be an infinite number of ways that teenagers can be killed off in grisly spectacular fashion so fans of the ""Final Destination"" movies can rest assured that this popular horror franchise could continue indefinitely. That wouldnt be such a bad thing if future sequels are as perversely entertaining as ""Final Destination 3."" Judging from the raucous enthusiasm of a preview audience ill-fated teens are still worth their weight in box-office gold. After letting others do the honors on ""Final Destination 2"" franchise creators and former ""X-Files"" writers James Wong and Glen Morgan have returned with another morbid menu of mayhem this time involving seven high-school graduates who luckily escape a roller-coaster disaster only to discover that their own deaths have been only temporarily avoided. Generically cute Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead whos got the panic-and-dread thing down pat) spots clues of impending doom in digital photos of her soon-to-be-expiring classmates. An ill wind follows her everywhere suggesting a supernatural force that makes her a catalyst for gory events as each of her friends is dispatched in the order they were meant to die. Connoisseurs of shock-movie contrivance will be delighted to learn that Wong and Morgan have made bloody-good use of that staple of movie violence the hydraulic nail gun. The fan blades of a car engine a pair of short-circuited tanning beds and malfunctioning gym equipment also factor into the escalating body count. Rube Goldberg would be impressed by the elaborate cause-and-effect sequences that turn this film into a giddy showcase for the kind of messy mortality that makes people vomit or laugh out loud depending on their appetite for cathartic carnage. Wong directs with a knack for humorous suspense cueing up the Ohio Players 1975 hit ""Love Roller Coaster"" to tweak our fascination with gruesome urban legends. The ""Final Destination"" movies may be pointless and crass but they play on that fascination with malicious efficiency and ""3"" is no exception.

New Line Cinema photo by Shane Harvey Ryan Merriman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are in for a ride. New Line Cinema photo by Shane Harvey Death traps snap into action in Final Destination 3 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Final Destination 3 Drama. Starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead Ryan Merriman Amanda Crews Kris Lemche and Texas Battle . Directed by James Wong. (Rated R 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Final Destination 3"" writer/director James Wong is clearly an extremely ambitious man. In his new movie hes managed to film a single scene -- involving a roller-coaster crash -- that violates every major rule of physics in less than 45 seconds. That unbelievable introduction turns out to be a good thing. Because in taking the viewer away from reality from the beginning fans of cheap thrills can enjoy ""FD3"" for what it is A ridiculous teen horror movie that piles on more than enough dry humor and freshly moistened gore to satisfy its lowbrow audience. If your idea of a good horror movie is something cerebral such as ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Rosemarys Baby"" then you should run screaming from ""Final Destination 3."" If youve rented ""Sleepaway Camp"" more than once then by all means run-dont-walk to see this movie. The third ""Final Destination"" is a clone of the first picture which Wong also directed. Several students narrowly escape death and death comes back for them one by one in the order that they should have been slaughtered in the first place. As control-freak Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and nice-guy Kevin (Ryan Merriman) try to solve the mystery people start dying in strange coincidental ways that usually end with some kind of massive head wound. Each creative killing is like watching that old childrens game Mousetrap except on a much larger scale and with more decapitations. The deaths are telegraphed -- sometimes the way a person gets slaughtered becomes obvious five or 10 minutes before the accident happens -- but most have a fun little unexpected twist at the end. Wong and Glen Morgan are listed as the scribes of ""Final Destination 3"" but after watching the film youll swear the co-screenwriters were Rube Goldberg and the Zodiac killer. As fun as that may sound there are several small flaws with the film. Wendy has only two speeds whiny and sniveling and her downer attitude may remind you of your most annoying girlfriend. Several of the actors playing teens are clearly in their late 20s. The best killing is the third one making the high point of the film over after roughly 40 minutes. And while there is some excellent nudity early in ""Final Destination 3"" the hottest actress in the film (Amanda Crew) remains frustratingly clothed throughout the film. Theres also a level of extreme improbability that will bother people employed in the amusement park industry at tanning salons at Home Depot in fireworks construction and display at BART and other mass transit agencies at fast-food franchises that have drive-through windows and people who work out in weight rooms. If the idea that a rat chewing on a candy bar might cause a multiple fatality commuter accident is just too much for you by all means skip ""Final Destination 3."" But Wong shows a dedication to giving the audience what it wants at the most primal level and thats admirable. Unlike the remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"" in theaters now there are no slow parts in ""FD3"" longer than five minutes. Most of the carnage is well-lit and filmed full-frame and the movie isnt afraid to follow a horrific scene of mayhem with a stupid-yet-funny throw-away joke. ""Final Destination 3"" is a roller-coaster ride of preposterousness thats somehow still worth the price of admission. (Matinee price at least.) -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence and a level of gore that falls somewhere between the first ""Robocop"" and the second ""Faces of Death"" video. Two attractive young women get naked in the film then they get burnt beyond recognition which is even more reason why your 12-year-old should see ""Nanny McPhee"" instead.

"Final Destination 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; final-destination-3 ) Final Destination 3 (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli With each new outing the Final Destination movies are getting better. At this rate by the fifth or sixth entry in the series one of them will finish the year in my Top 10. Or maybe the films relentless pursuit of creative mayhem and murder is wearing me down. Things that make the third installment more easily digested than its predecessors the best opening sequence of the series actors for whom acting school is not uniformly recommended dialogue that is sometimes not laughable and an ending that (finally) doesnt cheat. Then of course there are the deaths which are a delicious mixture of red herrings and Rube Goldberg deviousness. The fun with these isnt figuring out who is going to get it but how theyre going to get it. Director James Wong approaches the moment of maximum bloodletting with a macabre sense of humor. Final Destination 3 replaces the unintentional chortles of its predecessors with intentional humor and thats to its benefit. Death - the ultimate serial killer - is on another rampage. Hes even got a theme song (no its not ""Here Comes the Reaper""). But the poor guy needs to practice more with his scythe. Hes got bad aim and fails in his bid to kill a bunch of people in a roller coaster ride accident so now he has to go to the trouble of offing them one-by-one. Admittedly this allows for more variety and creativity but think of the other dastardly things he could be plotting insteada| There are ten unexpected survivors for Death to take down one-by-one. A tanning machine accident (supplying plenty of nudity) a fast food drive-in accident (advancing the argument that theres better service inside) a workout gone awry a mishap with a nail gun and so ona| Our heroine Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and hero Kevin (Ryan Merriman) figure out what Death is up to. And they do it without any help from a babbling Tony Todd the Candyman who showed up in the other two Final Destination films. But can they stop him? Let me put it this way do you think youll stand much success against a tall guy in a black robe wielding a really sharp sword? Theres enough creativity in the manner by which characters are dispatched that the movie keeps the viewers interest until late in the proceedings when the deaths come more quickly are set up with less elegance and are routine. I enjoyed the opening 15 minutes which introduce the characters with economy and generate suspense before and during the doomed roller coaster ride. This is not a movie to see the day before visiting a Six Flags amusement park. The crash sequence is well executed (emphasis on the last word). As the movie journeys into its plot-intensive phase it becomes as dumb and improbable as Final Destination and Final Destination 2 but the killings keep coming to the very end. No one from the other Final Destination movies makes an appearance here although there are references to the events in both. Death is the only returning character and He doesnt require an actor or a costume. The plucky Wendy is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who does as competent a job as one could expect in these dire circumstances. In case she looks familiar she played the vixen in Sky High. It never hurts to have a good-looking girl get most of the screen time. Her male cohort is Ryan Merriman who has an extensive list of TV credits. Hes a generic good looking young male actor whose talent limits are not tested by what the screenplay requires of him. No one else leaves much of an impression - theyre bodies waiting to be bagged. Final Destination 3 gripped me more than the earlier films. It is put together with a modicum of skill. More of an attempt is made at character development and identification. The dialogue doesnt read like a compilation of clichA(c)s and howlers (although no one is going to compare it to Shakespeare or even Jacqueline Suzanne for that matter). And theres legitimate tension during some of the pre-death scenes. Sure theres a formula associated with how they develop but the fun lies in deciphering the way in which the specifics play out. In addition theres a minimal reliance on ""Boo"" moments. Thats a sign the director has confidence in his material. Compare Wongs work here to what he did in Final Destination and it will become apparent that he has grown (although I wont claim to know how much - he still has Jet Lis horrible The One to answer for). The recommendation for this film is as easy as they come. If youre a Final Destination fan its unlikely that 3 will disappoint. If you like horror/thrillers with plenty of cartoonish blood and gore this will hit the spot. If youre looking for a portrait of Death akin to the one in The Seventh Seal exit the theater as soon as you recognize what youve stumbled into. Based on the box office tallies of the first two pictures and the expected gross of this one its unlikely that this is the last Final Destination. Unless Death takes an extended vacation were likely to get another one of these in a couple of years. Time will tell if that one makes a run at the Top 10.

"A roller coaster of death -- and hilarious fun - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A roller coaster of death -- and hilarious fun By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 10 2006 Every weekend horror films lure in millions of kids and usually send them home bummed Thats it? As the end credits rolled after a public showing of last weeks moneymaker When a Stranger Calls"" the audience made catcalls. But the filmmakers and the studios dont seem to care -- a big opening weekend at the box office is preordained.The horror film has been getting away with murder. Crazy but true Final Destination 3"" has come to the rescue. Week in and week out horror movies cheat us so its wonderfully cathartic to watch a bunch of kids cheat death in what turns out to be the best installment yet in the Final Destination"" franchise. If you missed the previous two chapters the series is about fates inexorable will. Or something like that. A teen has a premonition that he or she will perish on a plane (the first movie) or on the interstate (the nasty sequel) with his or her peers. The teen warns of doom no one listens and nearly everyone dies. Those who escape harm are chased and killed until the embattled clairvoyant manages to show death the door.In Final Destination 3"" an amusement park roller coaster is the disaster site of choice. Sitting in a car of Devils Flight Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a vision that it will send its riders hurtling off the tracks. And what a vision it is A dozen people harness themselves in and after one passengers video camera falls onto the rails (in a sly diss to digital filmmaking) kids are hanging on for dear life and being dumped out when the ride stops at the crest of a loop. Its every thrill junkies nightmare and not long after Wendy opens her eyes and demands to be let out it comes true.She loses her boyfriend and her best friend but does have her best friends boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman) to turn to. As death makes house calls they study the photos Wendy took before the disaster desperate for clues about how the survivors will die.They track down potential victims and are treated like Cassandras which allows the movies wicked streak to show. After two dingbats fry in their twin tanning beds the film lovingly cuts to a pair of matching coffins. (Before they sizzle they bop to Ohio Players Love Rollercoaster."") A lot of the murders are caused by hilarious elaborately rigged accidents."" Waiting for the grisly punch line is like watching a spark race down a long winding fuse in an especially sick Wile E. Coyote cartoon. The mishaps could be like Olympic events for which you should feel free to hold up a judges score card.James Wong the maker of the first edition directed and co-wrote this third installment with an abundance of humor. Even better this is the rare recent horror movie that seems to care about suspense (will Wendys sister bite the dust?) and is still able to chuckle at itself without exploding into heartlessness the way Final Destination 2"" did. The deaths here are warnings. Beware amusement park rides tanning beds fast food drive-throughs nail guns and the crossed sabers that hang above your gym equipment.Wendy and Kevin grow surprisingly sympathetic but the victims are laughable high-school stereotypes (the jock the goth the skirt-chasing creep who graduated years ago but wont go away). For the most part their demises are a consequence of how vapid they are. Death dont like stupid. It does not mind however entertaining the stuffing out of us.

(Related stories Screening minor leaguers) Mary Elizabeth Winstead is stuck on a nightmarish roller coaster ride. New Line Cinema Its nighttime were on the carnival midway and the heroine of Final Destination 3 has a premonition of impending disaster in keeping with the story hook of this chillers un-final screen predecessors. About the movie Final Destination 3   Stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead Ryan Merriman Texas Battle Gina Holden Dustin Milligan Director James Wong Distributor New Line Rating R for strong horror violence/gore language and some nudity Running time 1 hour 35 minutes Opens today nationwide Whats more we can see that this pending high school grad (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is straight unflighty and to be trusted. Why? Because shes on the yearbook staff and her name is Wendy. Anti-cipating a roller-coaster tragedy that indeed ensues Wendy and a handful of survivors bolt off the carny ride just before mass doom. But wait Moments before that weve seen her with a cellphone camera snapping classmate ""color"" for the yearbook. Included are two senior-class slatterns who say ""totally"" a lot. As in say ""Your thong is so totally Wal-Mart"" or ""Im so totally not into Silas Marner."" Turns out these photos offer subtle hints and more premonitions of supernaturally ritualistic deaths to come all targeting survivors bang-bang-bang. At its heart this second sequel is standard slasher stuff though director James Wong does rise (or maybe sink) to the occasion with grisly staging. Of course when a classmate has been portrayed as gauche or stupid you know his or her days are numbered. So when the ""Totally"" Twins lie down in one of those tanning salon troughs and take off their tops look out. Movies of this genre dont often engage fresh concepts but you have to give Wong major points for dreaming up ""tan-line flambe.""

Final Destination 3 Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/final-destination-3-2006,200,finaldestination312,finaldestination3,rogerebert
"Final Destination 3 Doomed to Repeat Itself washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Final Destination 3 Doomed to Repeat Itself Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday February 10 2006 Like the previous movies in the series ""Final Destination 3"" underscores how inevitably death comes to those who are well in the cast. Just as shes about to embark on a roller coaster with her high school friends Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets a horrifying premonition that this will be a death ride for all. She gets off before it starts and so do most of her friends. But the event is just a precursor of the grisly calamities that will soon visit everyone -- clues to their respective demises can be found in the digital photos Wendy happens to have taken of all of them. Despite the attempts of Wendy and her friend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman) to warn everyone the decapitations and gorings claim their buddies one by one. With a premise as cavalier as this perhaps director and co-writer James Wong could have found a tone more original than post-Wes Craven cynicism. Instead he panders to viewers allowing them to take gleeful comfort in the destruction of the stupid and doomed. -- Desson Thomson Final Destination 3 R 92 minutes Contains gory violence nudity and profanity.

These enjoyably ridiculous movies are premised on a lunatic determinism having survived a spectacular accident thanks to the intervention of a precognitive hottie the characters find themselves hunted down by Death. This death force is evidently a major control freak who doesnt care to have his ""design"" messed with. Judging from the preposterously complex accidents he devises to finish his work the guy would seem to be a fan of Rube Goldberg and the chain-reaction classic ""The Way Things Go"" or maybe just bored.In the original ""Final Destination"" the inciting accident was a plane crash and demise arrived via leaky toilet speeding bus and for one poor woman a combination of microwave shrapnel vodka-fueled fire knife in the chest and the explosion of her kitchen. The sequel considerably upped the ante starting with an outrageous freeway pileup directed with maniacal elan.In ""Final Destination 3"" -- the destination continues -- the bad mojo spirals out from a rollercoaster gone off its tracks. In light of the shoddy computer effects in this underwhelming under-lighted set piece the franchise might be having the same problem. Directed by James Wong with utter indifference to everything but the mechanics of death the third installment lacks the novelty of the first the panache of the second and the twisted sense of humor that gives the series its participatory sense of fun.The movie does scratch the dead teenager itch inventing nifty terrors in a tanning salon a weight room a drive-through restaurant and a home-improvement megastore. The climax includes fireworks and a berserk horse and the requisite shock ending will give New Yorkers pause next time they see one of those obnoxious subway notices declaring ""Sometimes you have to go backward to go forward.""""Final Destination 3"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

With the voices of Drew Barrymore WIll Ferrell David Cross. (86 min.)Because almost all animated films now are computer generated the 2-D animated ""Curious George"" has the not-unpleasant patina of an antique. The classic childrens books by Margret and H.A. Rey have never before been animated and director Matthew OCallaghan and his team have done a respectable job of making something that the kiddies will enjoy and their parents wont sleep through. We get to see how the little monkey meets the Man With the Yellow Hat during an archeological dig in Africa. Their reunion in New York is the films comic centerpiece. Will Ferrell is the Man and veteran voice actor Frank Walker is credited with the cute monkey sounds. They sounded very real to me. Has anyone actually met this ""Frank Walker""? Grade B- Peter RainerFinal Destination 3 (R)Director James Wong. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead Ryan Merriman. (115 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Not having seen ""Final Destination"" (1 or 2) I am perhaps not in the best position to judge ""Final Destination 3."" On the other hand I know a stinker when I see one. This is a raucously gory teen thriller about a high school graduation celebration at a local amusement park that goes demonically awry. There was a time when schlock horror movies were the entryway for young talent who had no other way of getting into the business. But theres nothing fresh or off-beat in ""Final Destination 3"" no talent that is struggling to get out. The only thing struggling to get out was me from the theater. Grade F- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in releaseWhen a Stranger CallsDirector Simon West. With Camilla Belle Tommy Flanagan. (83 min.)In this remake of the 1979 thriller teenager Jill Johnson (Belle) baby-sitting at a remote Colorado mansion receives ever more disquieting phone calls. They are from a serial killer who taunts his victims before doing them in. Creepy moments and considerable restraint somewhat balance the paucity of originality. Grade C-- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity None. Violence 12 instances. Language 1 strong expression 6 mild. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 2 instances of drinkingImagine Me amp; YouDirector Ol Parker. With Piper Perabo Lena Headey. (94 min.)As Rachel (Perabo) marches down the wedding aisle she and the florist (Headey) first glimpse each other and its love at first sight. Rachel goes through with the marriage but soon leaves hubby for the florist. Writer-director Parker wants this romantic comedy to simulate the blinding flash of love he felt on first meeting his wife (theyve been together 10 years). But this parable suggests that finding a soul mate is an excuse to break nuptial vows and it makes adultery (in whatever form) seem positively wholesome. Grade C- M.K.T.Sex/Nudity 14 instances of innuendo 2 scenes of implied or overhead sex. Violence None. Profanity 31 instances 4 of them strong. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 6 scenes of drinking and/or smoking. Next up Lena Headey Eva Green star in 300 Rise of an Empire - is it worth seeing?

Not as long as this durably gimmicky series admittedly one of the wittier horror franchises in recent years continues to dispense sadistic Rube Goldberg death traps with all the dramatic import of a kid frying ants under a magnifying glass. As yet another gaggle of clueless teens runs around trying to postpone their appointments with Death the question inevitably arises Will there ever be a final ""Final Destination""? Not as long as this durably gimmicky series admittedly one of the wittier horror franchises in recent years continues to dispense sadistic Rube Goldberg death traps with all the dramatic import of a kid frying ants under a magnifying glass. First two installments grossed more than 50 million and 40 million respectively and New Line should anticipate marginally lower returns from this slapdash sequel before it reaches a more lucrative destination on homevideo. In the original ""Final Destination"" (whose director James Wong is back for this third round) a group of high schoolers narrowly avoided a fatal plane crash only to find that Death doesnt stay cheated for long. Here the pre-empted tragedy is a freak roller-coaster accident which Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) somehow foresees and manages to escape though not in time to save sweetheart Jason (Jesse Moss) and pal Carrie (Gina Holden). Now Wendy has to put aside her differences with Carries boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman last seen in the prologue to ""The Ring Two"") as they try to stop the chain of fatalities that inevitably will befall them and the other survivors -- an incredulous group that includes a jock (Texas Battle) a sneering goth couple (Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson) and Wendys bratty younger sister Julie (Amanda Crew). First to go are the requisite dumb hotties Ashlyn (Crystal Lowe) and Ashley (Chelan Simmons) who walk into a tanning salon and dont come out alive. Elaborately worked out scene is milked for mean-spirited comedy rather than suspense and culminates in a sight gag so savagely inspired it leaves one chortling at least a minute into the obligatory funeral sequence. Subsequent killings are even more horrifically baroque as once again Death proves to be a highly resourceful if somewhat geekily detail-obsessed manipulator of inanimate objects. Helmer Wong (who also scripted and produced with Glen Morgan) doesnt generate tension so much as initiate a queasy guessing game about the source of the next grisly ""accident"" -- a weight machine? a runaway truck? condensation from a soft drink? -- punctuated by an occasional frisson of pitch-black humor. But whereas ""Final Destination 2"" at least strove for narrative intricacy imagining a clever time-death continuum with the characters and events from the original new pic is a desultorily plotted affair that feels less like a thriller than a homicidal checklist. In their race to save their classmates Wendy and Kevin essentially end up triggering one bloodbath after another; it never occurs to them that they might do a lot more good by minding their own business. In the storys one major stroke of invention the usual premonitions of death have been replaced with a set of photos (snapped by Wendy on the night of the roller-coaster accident) strewn with clues foreshadowing each characters demise. Apparently the Grim Reaper isnt just a petty avenger but an irrepressible showoff as even 9/11 is revealed -- in a truly tasteless real-world reference -- to be part of Deaths grand design. In a role that occasions much screaming and weeping offset by the occasional doom-laden epiphany Winstead is often too sniveling and mopey by half but still provides a solid anchor. Pics ""gotcha"" ending is just as half-hearted as the kicker that concluded its predecessor but far more belabored.

Yet as I listened to a mostly young preview audience react to the gruesomely elaborate deaths in Final Destination 3 the cheers laughs and awestruck ""Whoaaas"" growing more delirious with each slaughter I thought Why stop there? Bring on the gladiators The Final Destination films in case you missed the first two are the modern mall equivalent of those guilty-pleasure Omen sequels. Its not so much that the devil is involved (though in a vague sort of way he is). No its all about the deaths. Final Destination 3 opens with a huge roller-coaster crash (a follow-up to the plane crash and traffic accident that kicked off the first two films) and then one by one a handful of high school seniors who were ejected from the ride at the last minute get whats coming to them anyway. Its an escalating contest of can-you-top-this brutality with each death staged as the final link in a Rube Goldberg chain reaction. As a dude sits in his car at a fast-food drive-in station a truck spins off the road at the last minute and when it smashes into the back of the car -- bzzzz -- the guys head gets meloned by a whirring fan blade. What makes all of this ""fun"" instead of dark or threatening is that the victim was an idiot who leered at the class teases with horny glee. Take that perv But of course the babes get it too; theyre each trapped in a tanning chamber the camera lingering on their singed naked flesh. In Final Destination 3 all the victims are spoiled pills who razz one another with toxic distaste. When they get offed theyre being punished not for their sexuality (as in a slasher film) but simply for the crime of being the annoying scuzz they are -- and the audience grooving on the bad vibes goes wild. Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) whos the closest thing the movie has to a virginal nice-girl heroine has taken pictures of each one of the victims that foreshadow their grisly ends; the murders in other words arrive by cosmic design. But where is the grand mysterious force of evil coming from? At a horror roller coaster as breezy in its blood thrills as Final Destination 3 it almost seems to be coming from the audience.
