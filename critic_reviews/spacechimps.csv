Its a generic product description. You - or rather your very young children - understand that those functional two words promise monkeyshines and rocketry and thats all they need to know. A critics job is harder. Reviewing this thing is like reviewing a waffle iron.In which case does it make good waffles? Not really but kids the little garbage pails will eat just about anything. Short cheap weird and passably diverting ""Space Chimps"" tells the tale of Ham (voiced by Andy Samberg of ""SNL"") a cavalier circus chimp drafted by NASA to lead an interstellar space mission. Problem is hes an irresponsible cowboy and his arrogance appalls dedicated crew-mates Luna (Cheryl Hines) and Titan (Patrick Warburton). Once on the alien planet differences fall away as the three contend with Lord Zartog (voiced by Jeff Daniels who Im guessing has college bills to pay) a Shrek-ish meanie turned dictator.""Space Chimps"" is notable for the low-cost ugliness of its animation and for a strange bargain-bin surrealism. The movies surfaces have a hard plastic sheen to them thats the exact opposite of Pixars fertile detail (the humans especially seem to have come out of the computers half-cooked).Im also not quite sure what to think about Kilowatt (Kristin Chenoweth) a tiny Kewpie-headed critter whose head lights up and who at one point passes blithely through the intestinal tract of a cave monster. Back at Mission Control our heroes are guided by a kid chimp (Zack Shada) Hams grizzled mentor (Carlos Alazraqui) a nasty senator (Stanley Tucci) and a trio of scientists the least amusing of which is a ""funny"" Hindi nerd (Omid Abtahi) who falls down a lot. ""Space Chimps"" aint ""The Simpsons"" and it shouldnt have gone there.Aside from teaching your children racist stereotypes - and really its never too early - the movies acceptable entertainment for the toddler set. Anyone older may resist especially since there are so many superior animated movies out there already. ""Space Chimps"" raises the question How are you going to keep them down on the render-farm after theyve seen ""WALL-E""? (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

When a hi-tech space probe veers off course on to an uncharted planet a team of NASA chimpanzees are assigned to a retrieval mission. With Owen Wilson clearly unavailable SNL alumnus Andy Samberg provides the voice for Ham the laconic jokester forced to prove his worth. Despite a painfully lurid visual palette and some limp scripting Space Chimps at least succeeds as undemanding multiplex fare.

Its like that ""friend"" who you dont really like but always hangs around desperately trying to be funny at every opportunity but failing miserably (I know - I was this person once).

And Space Chimps is just that leaden experience. The plot couldnt be more boring and the animation is unattractive though augmented by super-bright colors evoking the Teletubbies which is not a good thing. The best that can be said about Space Chimps is that its a completely forgettable cinematic experience. Mystifyingly the unfunny one-liners are often way out of the purview of the intended audience which has to be very young children. As the chimps head up to space a crack about David Bowie is bound to go right over the heads of little ones. And its not clever enough to amuse their parents. The story centers around Ham III (voiced by Andy Samberg) the grandson of the first chimpanzee in space who is recruited to retrieve a wayward space probe that has disappeared in a faraway wormhole. Hes no chimp astronaut however. Hes a circus performer who relishes his simian slacker status. Reluctantly he joins a pair of more highly trained chimps (voiced by Cheryl Hines and Patrick Warburton) and becomes embroiled in what is meant to be an exciting space adventure. Sure its an inoffensive G-rated family film but does that mean it also has to be so dull and unimaginative? The superlative WALLE also is G-rated. Pixar has set the gold standard but clearly smart funny and moving films can be made that are appropriate for all audiences. And Space Chimps is not one of them. Its most reminiscent of bad Saturday morning cartoon fare. Audiences of all ages would be better off going to see WALLE for the second (or third) time.

"Space Chimps The primate stuff | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSpace Chimps The primate stuff The dialogue in Space Chimps might hold the answer to a question that still nags entertainment scribes. Just what did the talk-show gag writers do during last winters four-month movie and television strike?By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterFri. July 18 2008 Starring the voices of Andy Samberg Cheryl Hines and Jeff Daniels. Written by Kirk De Micco and Robert Moreland. Directed by Kirk De Micco. 81 minutes. At major theatres. G  The dialogue in Space Chimps might hold the answer to a question that still nags entertainment scribes. Just what did the talk-show gag writers do during last winters four-month movie and television strike?Article Continued BelowThe answer lies in Space Chimps. This animated movie from the producer of Shrek and its sequels is a compendium of silly puns and juvenile jokes similar in nature to the late-night antics of Letterman Leno OBrien and Ferguson.The space chimps are given to remarks such as ""So easy a human could do it"" and ""I feel like a stupid pet trick."" Descending even further on the humour scale they urge one another to ""chimprovize"" or ""Lets chimp this ride."" These zingers might fly right over the heads of the kids for whom Space Chimps was intended and cause their parents to cringe but the animated action movie nevertheless delivers - da-dum - more fun than a barrel of monkeys.Theres even an educational component to this space adventure. The smart-mouthed hyperactive Ham III (voiced by Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live) is introduced as the grandson of Ham the first chimp to travel beyond the Earths atmosphere. Thats a historical fact. The real Ham was launched 252 kilometres into the skies on Jan.31 1961. The descendant of the legendary Ham is a clown a circus chimpanzee that gets shot from a cannon until hes recruited against his will for a mission to a planet where traces of life have been detected. Fired off in the company of trained astro-chimps Luna (Cheryl Hines from Curb Your Enthusiasm) and the uptight commander Titan (Seinfelds Patrick Warburton) Ham III lands (""one small step for Ham"") on the newfound planet. The team is set upon by minions of the tyrannical ruler of the blob-like population. The self-adoring consumer-mad Zartog (Jeff Daniels) appears to have been modelled on Saddam Hussein.With the help of the cutest animated creature since Tinkerbell the phototropic Kilowatt (Kristin Chenoweth) the chimps proceed to show theyve got the right stuff. Ham III learns courage when thrust into frightening situations in the Valley of Very Bad Things. (The animated screen-high monsters were enough to scare off a 3 1/2-year-old girl at the preview screening.)Space Chimps is bound to earn the endorsement of the animal-rights lobby.

I on Monday afternoon was called to ""Space Chimps."" And at times sitting in an air- conditioned screening room for 80 minutes - so you dont have to - seemeda heroic sacrifice on par with lung donation. I went in expecting to be disappointed but even so I was disappointed. ""Space Chimps"" a digitally animated feature that gives every indication of having been written and drawn by its titular characters is unfunny. But it isnt just that; its also weird with some rattling moments of crudeness. Try explaining to a prosecutorial 4-year-old why one monkey says to another ""Is that a banana in your pocket?"" Other awkward allusions include one to the drug humor in the 28-year-old movie ""Airplane"" (""looks like I picked the wrong week to stop eating bananas"") and an almost funny but bizarre nod to David Bowies spaceman period which was so long ago that Andy Samberg who voices the lead monkey wasnt yet born. Samberg who is establishing a track record of delivering about one laugh per year is a circus chimp who gets blasted out of cannons and into the night sky. ""Space Chimps"" is touching for about 48 frames when his character Ham reaches wistfully out for the moon. He was made for better things. His grandfather was the first US monkey in space which makes Ham III the perfect choice to be sent on a mission with a scientist chimpette (Cheryl Hines) and a dimwitted chimp commander (Patrick Warburton) to recover a lost spaceship that disappeared in a far corner of the universe. While the chimps do weak parodies of the training scenes from ""The Right Stuff""- no twists are added just re-enactments that count on you to giggle because theyre done by chimps - we cut to a distant planet where the lost ship has landed among an alien race. The animation previously drab and cheap-looking now becomes actively ugly a visual litter box. The aliens are a herd of gopher-like figures with shiny skin who stand around being terrified of their leader a dictatorial beast (Jeff Daniels) who looks like a bull on his hind legs. He is using the new spaceship from Earth to advance his powers. When the space chimps arrive they get advice in defeating this despot from a little freak voiced by Kristin Chenoweth who looks like a midget with a babys head the size of a medicine ball. Youre unlikely to see a toy modeled after this character unless they sell Happy Meals in hell. The chimps toss around little puns (""Im just a chimp off the old block"" ""No monkey business"" etc.) while commenting on how lame they are. This touch of screenwriting self-hatred is refreshingly honest but when your jokes are this crusty why not discard them and start over? Besides when it comes to chimps and space Stanley Kubrick pretty much covered the topic. SPACE CHIMPS Opposable thumbs down. Running time 81 minutes. Rated G.

Joe Neumaier Thursday July 17 2008 556 PM No one should envy an animated film that opens after a Pixar classic - especially this years smart heartfelt ""Wall-E"" - but ""Space Chimps"" just throws its facetious premise at the wall to sees what sticks. All that family audiences in their seats can do is watch it slide slowly downward and count the monkey jokes.Actually theres not even as many of those as there could be. There are a few bad puns sure but where are the ""Planet of the Apes"" references? Or the nod to ""Lancelot Link Secret Chimp""? The Bonzo King Kong and ""BJ and the Bear"" name-checks? Yes theres a ""Curious George"" insult but how about a shout-out to Cheeta? Instead what we get are countless nods to ""The Right Stuff"" - a great movie but not high on the kiddie-rotation schedule - and a bland tale about Earth losing a probe in deep space where humans fear to tread. So scientists and a conniving senator send three chimps to retrieve it including Ham III (voiced lazily by ""SNLs"" Andy Samberg) grandson of Ham the real-life chimponaut blasted into orbit in 1961 in a Mercury-program prototype. This new Ham is a circus performer however and a kid. He takes nothing seriously including Houston his monkey mentor. But when his simian spaceship lands on the planet where the probe crashed Hams freewheeling style helps defeat an ugly noseless alien who enslaves his fellow extraterrestrials freezing some unpleasantly in a vat of goo. Vanguard Animations rubbery computer-generated style is fluid but insubstantial; the backgrounds have the look of a laptop screen saver. Meanwhile Ham and Luna the female primate voiced by Cheryl Hines look too similar to tell apart especially in their flight suits. Theres also the bombastic chimp commander Titan (Patrick Warburton) who never graduates beyond Grape Ape-like cloddishness. When it comes to their mission the script is all (non-opposable) thumbs. The aliens are blobby noncharacters with the lead despot voiced by Jeff Daniels in ""Dumb and Dumber"" mode. And then there is the most annoying animated sidekick in a long time a bulb-headed trying-to-be-cute glow creature called Kilowatt (Kristen Chenoweth) who sings an ear-piercing high-pitched note when its scared which is often. Even younger kids savvier now than ever will likely want to turn off Kilowatt. Whats that joke about one foot on a banana peel?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Is computer animation still such a novelty that it will pull moviegoers into theaters? Do wisecracking critters still push childrens joy buttons? Is ""Space Chimps"" really necessary? Its the latest in a long line of animated comedies that are family-friendly vaguely amusing and typically impervious to negative reviews. Although its executed at a workmanlike level of craft its entertainment value resides entirely in the so-so quality of its gags (yes there are slipping-on-banana-peel jokes). The films creators havent learned the Pixar strategy of creating a resonant story as the foundation of a film. So we get a formulaic tale of a lazy nonconformist who learns to take his responsibilities seriously and saves the day. Pretty much like the story of ""Kung Fu Panda."" Only in space. With monkeys. And not as funny. SPACE CHIMPS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating G Still with me? Well then here goes ""Space Chimps"" is the story of Ham III descended from Americas first chimpanzee astronaut. The heros grandson (voiced by Andy Samberg of ""Saturday Night Live"") is still trading off his family fame although hes a mere circus novelty act. Shot from a cannon in every show Ham has a stars swaggering ego combined with a rebellious streak that invariably sabotages his re-entry. Rather than concentrate on his descent path he tears a hole in the big-top canvas every time. Still his prestigious pedigree makes him the chimp of choice when a glory-grubbing senator (Stanley Tucci) demands a simian crew to search for a lost U.S. spacecraft. With a blustery commanding officer (Patrick Warburton) and level-headed copilot (Cheryl Hines) Ham follows the vanished rocket ship to a distant dimension. Once there our heroes recruit the aid of a pixie-like creature (Kristin Chenoweth) to battle a comic space ogre (Jeff Daniels). While the film has its cheerful passages -- Chenoweth employs deliciously silly vocal effects as the space sprite -- theres no effort to push the boundaries of the medium. Everything about ""Space Chimps"" screams ""good enough."" This product is a babysitting DVD making a brief stop in theaters before hitting the shelves at Target. But wait theres more. In a few weeks we get the opening of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" about three young houseflies who stow away on the Apollo 11 lunar mission. Its the same movie. Only with flies. Did this idea need to be screened twice within a month? Help.

What starts as a simian spin on The Right Stuff becomes a monkey-brained space odyssey as the apes fight to save an alien world from a despot who looks like the love child of a Teletubby and the monster from Cloverfield. While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids Space Chimps has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar-given knowledge that CGI can entertain -- and not just stupefy -- moviegoers of any age.

Assuming that its not a documentary about the early days of the space program - and its not - you figure it must be a kids movie and hope that itll at least be good dumb fun. Right on all counts. Space Chimps tells the story of Ham III (voice of Andy Samberg doing his best Ben Stiller) the grandson of Ham I the first chimp astronaut. But the simian apple as it were has fallen far from the tree; Ham III trades on his lineage by working in a cheap circus where hes blasted out of a rocket every night. Sometimes he lands on target. Most times he doesnt. Thats meant to show that hes a free spirit though it comes off mostly as a poor sense of direction. Meanwhile a headline-loving senator (Stanley Tucci) wants answers as to why a probe has gone missing. The answer isnt what he expected It has been sucked into a wormhole and has come out on the other side of the universe. Sensing a long news cycle with himself at the center he demands that the chimps the space program has been training as a public-relations stunt be sent to find it. Theyre certainly prepared. Titan (Patrick Warburton) is a by-the-book sort. Luna (Cheryl Hines) is an all-around good astronaut and something of a chimp babe to boot. Comet (Zack Shada) is the brains of the operation. But theyre not enough for the senator. He wants a chimp with star power. Enter Ham although not willingly. Ham likes the life of an underachiever and spends the first part of the movie scheming about how to get back to the big(ish) top. Then suddenly off they go blasting into space without further explanation. Maybe most 4-year-olds wont notice or mind the sudden unexplained leap in plot but uh what? Has Pixar taught us nothing? Anyway the probe has wound up on a planet where its being used by the evil Zartog (Jeff Daniels) to enslave the people or whatever it is youd call them. He has had a taste of Earth life and has enlisted the population to build a replica of a Las Vegas casino. Of course that means diverting the goo that comes out of an about-to-blow volcano into the town below which will destroy everyones homes. But thats the kind of evil creature Zartog is. Titan Luna and Ham eventually show up aided by light-bulb-headed Kilowatt (the always loud Kristin Chenoweth). Not a lot of surprises here but there are a few good laughs aimed at grown-ups and Ham is a big enough well ham to please the part of the crowd too young to have read or seen The Right Stuff. Space Chimps then is exactly what you think it is. Nothing more certainly but at least nothing less. Its not going to make you forget WALL-E - or even think about it - but itll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.

As light as a banana souffle and about as substantial ""Space Chimps"" is a diverting dish for young moviegoing primates. Though dwarfed by the summers two 800-pound animated gorillas (well one panda and a robot) Foxs relatively under-the-radar toon is a fairly fatuous but enjoyably slim family entertainment about three chimps dispatched to retrieve a multibillion-dollar intergalactic probe. Without the massive promo push afforded those other behemoths pics theatrical landing may barely register. A more promising payload surely awaits in the home-entertainment sphere. As much as ""Space Chimps"" monkeys around with reality its inspired at least in part by an actual event In 1961 NASA sent a chimpanzee called Ham (an acronym for the Holloman Aerospace Medical Center) on a brief mission in an initial test run for manned space exploration. In the premise for this comedy helmed and co-scripted (with Robert Moreland) by Kirk DeMicco the chimps are drafted for their first space expedition in decades after the Infinity probe crash-lands on an alien planet. Unsure of the planets atmospheric conditions the Space Agency under the eye of an ambitious senator (voiced by Stanley Tucci) resolves to send three highly trained chimps to retrieve the Infinity probe. Sniffing a PR opportunity the politician suggests filling a seat with Ham III grandson of the original space chimp -- never mind that the junior Ham (Andy Samberg) is a contented member of a traveling circus whose only aeronautics experience is his day job as a simian cannonball. Initially resistant Ham becomes intrigued by the mission only after meeting the attractive and brilliant chimp co-pilot Lt. Luna (Cheryl Hines). Their teammate self-important monkey Commander Titan (Patrick Warburton) is more brawn that brains. After a turbulent start they head into space and land on planet Malgor where they meet the evil alien Zartog (Jeff Daniels) a kind of crazed insatiable real-estate developer seeking global dominion. In no time Luna and Ham must track down the probe rescue Titan and help liberate the enslaved Malgoreans. Theyre aided by the diminutive Kilowatt (a part tailor-made for Kristin Chenoweth) who leads Luna and Ham through Malgors Valley of Really Bad Things which are of course only as bad as a G rating allows. The quasi-facsimile nature of computer animation -- its always a hair or two removed from reality -- is remarkably well suited to rendering the chimps who are so disarmingly (and alarmingly) like humans themselves. Effective too is the visual design for planet Malgor Its as if Dalis withered landscapes and Boschs cast of eccentrics have been slathered in candy-colored hues borrowed from Strawberry Shortcake. Though it plainly seeks to satisfy young kids every now and then ""Space Chimps"" offers a winking laugh for the adults in the audience. Luna and Hams psychobabble dialogue (theyre floating on the Dark Cloud of Id) for instance may mean little to children but its a choice allusion. The score credited to Chris Bacon and the Blue Man Group (who invite alien comparisons themselves) seamlessly blends familiar melodies with jaunty new compositions.

""Dunno Harry--probably the part where Kilowatt lets the giant monster swallow her."" Kilowatts an alien with a giant glowing head perched atop a teensy-tiny body; she blows high-pitched raspberries when excited and is voiced by Kristin Chenoweth who seems to think shes still on Broadway. All in all a very funny character--probably should have been the star of the film rather than Andy Samberg Patrick Warburton and Cheryl Hines as monkeys shot into a wormhole to see if theres life on the other side of the galaxy yawn. But the wee one wasnt impressed. ""But Dad that scene was just a rip-off from Star Wars"" Pardon? ""When Kilowatt says If you swallow me down I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine thats what Obi-Wan says to Darth Vader before he cuts him in half."" We agreed that the payoff following the big gulp was a giggle but then it hit him ""Dad the whole movies a rip-off"" Ah they cant even sneak one past the pre-K crowd which already saw this when it was called Space Wiggles. The animation incidentally is half-assed like they ran out of the 292.96 budget halfway through. Rip-off indeed.
