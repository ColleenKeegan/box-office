Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr D 10000 B.C. Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Camilla Belle Steven Strait; Director Roland Emmerich; Author Roland Emmerich Harald Kloser; Release Date Wide 03/07/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 12 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Not including the lady killed in front of her kid early in the rock-stupid mayhem of 10000 BC I count approximately two (2) women among thousands of hysterically testosteronic men. One has psychic powers but shes a clay-crusted crone so no wars are fought over her. The other with the dainty name of Evolet (the still-evolving Camilla Belle recently disconnected in When a Stranger Calls) is the alluring blue-eyed adopted mascot of a prehistoric tribe of mammoth hunters. Ev is the beloved of moody hero-in-training DLeh (as yet indistinguishable Steven Strait soon in Stop-Loss) and the favorite of marauding invaders -- one of whom scoops her up and carries her away across the mists of time space and computer-graphic possibilities. The musical beat in the background suggests tribal council on Survivor except when it sounds like ""Macarena."" Without Evolet standing in for all Mesolithic womanhood who will breed warriors for the Neolithic Age? And who will sew all the bric-a-brac costumes of the men fighting each other (and giant CGI ostriches too) in this blowhard saga from b.s. (as in blowhard saga) specialist Roland Emmerich (Independence Day)? Neither grand enough to be impressive nor antic enough to be charming the movie settles for bland and frantic climaxing in a showdown among decadent pyramid builders. How bad are these guys? Theyre sadists...and wink wink sissies.

"10000 B.C. Mammoth disappointment | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies10000 B.C. Mammoth disappointment There are bad movies. There are hack directors. But with 10000 B.C. a prehistoric epic that deserves extinction Roland Emmerich enters a whole new tar pit of crapitude.Steven Strait transitions from rock n roll to the Stone Age as the not-very-good woolly mammoth hunter Dleh a hero who is as dim as a dinosaur.  (HANDOUT PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 7 2008(out of 4)Starring Steven Strait Camilla Belle Cliff Curtis and Affif Ben Badra. Directed by Roland Emmerich. 108 minutes. At major theatres. PGThere are bad movies. There are hack directors. But with 10000 B.C. a prehistoric epic that deserves extinction Roland Emmerich enters a whole new tar pit of crapitude.The Razzie Awards may have to create new categories to do justice to this mammoth waste of time. Besides expected noms for Worst Film Worst Director and Worst Remake or Rip-off (One Million Years B.C. and Apocalypto are amongst the obvious steals) this much-delayed film cries out for consideration for Worst CGI Most Annoying Narrator Lamest Dialogue and Dumbest Action Hero.Article Continued BelowOn that last note come on down Steven Strait a failed rocker turned bad actor who reportedly lost 30 pounds hed gained for a previous movie to take on the role of woolly mammoth hunter Dleh (pronounce that Duh-lay) who is as dim as a dinosaur.When hes not tripping over his own spear or getting his hand caught in the mammoth-snaring net hes angsting over his ineptitude or mooning over his lady love Evolet (Camilla Belle). Hot shes not which is puzzling for a film aimed at modern Neanderthals.Dleh comes from a tribe of mountain dwellers somewhere near Middle-earth it seems whose name roughly translates as People With Bad Dreads But Great Teeth. All they eat are mammoths when they can catch them. When they cant which is the norm they starve. They all speak perfect English; yet take their marching orders from an ancient crone who goes into bug-eyed hysterics whenever one of her tribes people is in trouble.A gang of marauding slave traders led by a warlord (Affif Ben Badra) who wandered in from a Pirates of the Caribbean casting call invade Dlehs mountain village and make off with Evolet and the other women. Our hero and his crew do what any red-blooded caveman would they stand around for a while scratching their noggins before deciding to rescue the damsels.If theyre as good at rescuing as they are at mammoth hunting then Evolet is a goner. Entire herds of the beast go thundering past Dleh and his fellow warriors and its all they can muster to nab even a single one.The whole enterprise is bogus. 10000 B.C. looks as fake as a plastic dinosaur bone and its lensed with that awful blue tinge cinematographers use when theyre trying to be artistes. Its been 15 years since Jurassic Park yet the special effects in this movie cant hold a candle to it.German director Emmerich who co-wrote the screenplay with Harald Kloser doesnt trouble himself with the rigours of history or science - as hes proven with such previous turkeys as Godzilla (1998) and The Day After Tomorrow. The man is a consummate hack but he tops himself for absurdity here. He has the dreadlock people leaving their frozen mountaintop and walking into tropical and desert conditions to meet all manner of creatures both animal and human. There are birds that resemble giant marauding chickens and a tiger that might have leapt off the side of a box of Frosted Flakes. Dleh helps the tiger escape from a trap but not before telling it ""Do not eat me when I set you free."" Duh. The dreadlocks gang meet many rival tribes some friendly and some not. Im guessing at their names but they include the Warriors With Stakes Jammed in Their Chins the Warriors With Bamboo Masks and Matching Skirts and the Pirates Who Growl a Lot But Dont Do Much.The worst of them are led by a drag queen wrapped in silk curtains called The Almighty who is busy having slaves and mammoths build him a giant pyramid or maybe a Mayan-themed vacation resort.Its hard to figure out exactly who is after who in this film other than that they all seem to want to keep Evolet away from Dleh probably because they correctly suss that hes a total caveman.The plot is confusing even with the idiotic narration by Omar Sharif who is constantly intoning rot about how the dreadlock people are facing ""the beginning of the end"" and ""the last hunt."" You just wish somebody would club him.It could take several viewings of 10000 B.C. to make any sense of it. Not that I recommend such a cruel and reckless move. That would be punishment most primitive.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDreaded Ice Bucket Challenge of 2014 paid for ALS research breakthroughMillions raised for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research from viral stunt funded research that identified a gene NEK1 that contributes to disease.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

PicturesRating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violenceRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday nationwide 10000 B.C. They shouldve tried a more interesting year Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Within a few minutes into the ponderous prehistoric pseudo-epic that is 10000 B.C. you find yourself longing for George of the Jungle to crash into a tree or the Geico cavemen to amble up and put an end to the droning seriousness of this tedious tale. Heck even a cameo by Pauly Shore in Encino Man would liven up this bombastic bore. With a bevy of trendy dreadlock dos well-toned bodies and an array of bad accents the movie is like a satire waiting to happen. It might have been worth seeing had the film been directed by Best in Shows Christopher Guest rather than Godzillas Roland Emmerich. Instead were expected to take seriously this unimaginative story of a son living out his absent fathers dream. Perhaps a better title would have been Quest for Sire. Havent we already seen far too many wannabe mythic stories of survival featuring predictable attacks by human marauders and vicious giant beasts? The only noteworthy elements are its computer-generated predators such as the menacing saber-toothed tiger and rampaging herds of woolly mammoths. The visual sweep of desert landscapes mountain ranges verdant jungles and frozen tundra is spectacular. But the visuals arent enough to make the experience compelling. The actors might as well have been cardboard cutouts given their limited range and interchangeability. Cliff Curtis (Whale Rider and Three Kings) has little to do here except work on his tan as he makes his way across land masses. He travels in the company of DLeh (Steven Strait) a smoldering and hunky warrior intent on rescuing the mysterious blue-eyed girl he loves (Camilla Belle) believed to be either a sacred being or an evil witch depending on your tribal membership. The minimalist dialogue mishmash of eras and scientific and historical inaccuracy are sure to elicit laughs. The whole enterprise grows tiresome with repeated scenes of onslaughts and foot chases accompanied by a derivative score. The film brings to mind Apocalypto which for all its brutality was more riveting than this barbaric drag. The action is so plodding and the story so dreary that you feel as if youve lived through several millennia by the time it reaches its strained conclusion.

(PG-13) Warner Bros. (108 min.) Directed by Roland Emmerich. With Steven Strait Camilla Belle. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR Yabba-dabba-dont. A granite-headed bomb from the Stone Age the caveman epic ""10000 B.C."" may not turn out to be the worst film of the year. (After all the year is still young.) But it is an offensive waste of time and if the movie gods have mercy it wont even go straight to DVD. It will go right to the Petrified Forest to sit among the other prehistoric vegetation. Directed by the extravagant and extravagantly untalented Roland Emmerich the story features a prehistoric hunter named DLeh and his beloved Evolet. Theyve just begun to settle down to a cozy life of mammoth stew nit picking and potential cholera when a foreign tribe invades and carries Evolet off. So DLeh and his friends follow wooden spears at the ready. Thats not all thats wooden. The acting -- featuring the azure-eyed Camilla Belle as Evolet and the ropy-haired Steven Strait as DLeh -- is about as lively as knotty-pine paneling. The cast of characters features some snarling villains an ancient matriarch named imaginatively Old Mother and awful narration courtesy of Omar Sharif. There are a few nice moments thanks to the CGI crews -- a fleet of crimson-sailed ships a couple of mammoth stampedes an ancient city. Theres also a saber-toothed tiger the size of a bus and giant man-eating ostriches (somehow I must have missed that diorama at the Museum of Natural History). Making things less palatable though is the xenophobic subtext. Emmerich has always been a sort of crypto-reactionary -- his historical epic ""The Patriot"" made the American Revolution out to be nothing more than a middle-class tax revolt while his biggest hit ""Independence Day"" featured Jewish stereotypes and a score that bizarrely quoted from ""Deutschland Uber Alles."" But ""10000 B.C."" trades in even more cliches. Not that its the first -- beloved fantasies from the epics of Middle-Earth through the Narnia books to the recent smash ""300"" all cast their stories in terms of Us vs. Them in which the Them were often swarthy foreigners. Perhaps its a good thing that being so badly written ""10000 B.C."" does it so artlessly and obviously. But what are we to make of a movie in which the gentle heroes all speak perfect English and live peaceably in the North and the Southern devils all have hooked noses and headdresses? Or one in which even though these villains have enslaved countless tribes none of the Africans have had the courage to fight back until our fair hero arrives to lead them? Or one in which when this coalition of the willing does invade they find themselves in a land of pyramids and curved daggers and foreign gods and people who ""are not like us""? I can guess what were supposed to make of it. Luckily for everyone ""10000 B.C."" is too stupid to be taken seriously for long. This is after all a movie in which men march from the Arctic to the jungle to the desert -- all within a few weeks time. In which the villains supreme monarch is attended by a court of effeminate blind albinos (and dont think thats not a hard job to fill.) In which our hero before setting free a trapped saber-tooth tiger entreats ""Do not eat me when I set you free."" No tiger dont. Not unless you want a big bad mouthful of cheese. Rating note The film contains brutal violence and gratuitous idiocy. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

At his best the cliche-loving Emmerich turns out smooth crowd-pleasers like ""Independence Day"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow."" His latest effort is from the dopier end of his special-effects-oriented output somewhere between ""Stargate"" and ""Poseidon."" ""10000 BC"" is set in unspecified mountains where a tribe that speaks more or less perfect English has adopted Evolet (Camilla Belle) the sole survivor of a blue-eyed tribe (shades of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"") whose members apparently discovered mascara many centuries before previously realized. Evolet captures the eye of a handsome young hunter named DLeh (wooden newcomer Steven Strait) who apparently has a razor and possibly an exercise machine hidden behind the rocks. While DLeh is off hunting woolly mammoths Evolet and several members of DLehs tribe are captured by ""four-legged demons"" - some Arab-esque villains on horseback. A character named Old Mother instructs DLeh - whose father abandoned the tribe when DLeh was a child - to follow Evolet and rescue her to fulfill an ancient prophecy. DLeh and his small band cross over picturesque landscapes - this part was filmed in New Zealand others in South Africa and Namibia - and apparently turn up in Africa where they join forces with tribes of blacks whose members have also been taken prisoners. The ""four-legged demons"" (or whatever) are using the slaves and woolly mammoths to - you guessed it - build pyramids for a mysterious mostly unseen ruler known as The Almighty who may or may not have arrived from outer space. Some of the pyramids look like something that might have been designed by the Depression-era Works Progress Administration but then this is a movie that mixes and matches centuries and continents at will. Miss Belle alas is no Raquel Welch - who graced a million college dorm rooms in a poster for the 1966 flick called ""One Million Years B.C."" which in addition to being a remake of a 1940 movie is clearly one of Emmerichs many sources of uh inspiration. While the special effects are top notch - particularly the saber-toothed tigers - the humans are dull the dialogue is ridiculous and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in ""300"" is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure. Written by Emmerich with some help from one Harold Kloser (also credited with the droning score) ""10000 BC"" is as rambling as the narration delivered by Omar Sharif who wisely never turns up on-screen. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NEW YORK DOES LA Read Next NEW YORK DOES LA Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 74375 How Hillary blew her big moment 40314 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 20745 Judge blasts Nick Denton for lying about Gawker stock value Now On Is cheating to blame in Mary J.

Joe Neumaier Wednesday June 4 2008 424 PM 10000 B.C. Action-adventure about a band of early humans who join with other Ice Age warriors to find a tribeswoman and battle an evil civilization. With Steven Strait Camilla Belle Cliff Curtis. Director Roland Emmerich (149). PG-13 Violence animal cruelty. At area theaters.Anyone who thinks they dont make em like they used to will be glad to discover ""10000 B.C."" The movie from director Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"") isnt trying for the realism of ""Quest for Fire"" the 1981 drama thats still the Cro-Magnon opus to beat. Emmerich just wants to make a simple old-style adventure about the power of myth and pelt-wearing homo sapiens in love.But for every well-thrown spear there are 10000 moments that have all the gracefulness of a woolly mammoth stampede. As the Ice Age wanes a hunter-gatherer named DLeh (Steven Strait) loses the blue-eyed girl of his dreams Evolet (Camilla Belle) when shes taken along with much of their tribe by a marauding horde. DLeh walks off in pursuit with his mentor (Cliff Curtis) and one-time rival (Mo Zinal) and the warrior-heroes seem to cross continents and epochs in very short time. They find different climates and skill levels over every mountain and eventually meet the Tribe With the Funny Bamboo Helmets the Tribe With the Too-High Ponytails and the Tribe Led by a Guy Djimon Hounsou Probably Didnt Want to Play. As they all band together and find the reason for the abductions (Hey its the pyramids) the search for Evolet evolves into a massive slave-army liberation. Much as Emmerich and co-scripter Harald Kloser hit the action beats - a sequence in some tall grass feels very ""Planet of the Apes"" (and if ever a movie couldve used someone in a gorilla suit its this one) - its the big scary creatures that people want. But even there ""10000 B.C."" doesnt deliver. Mean killer ostriches attack but they make little chickeny sounds. The woolly mammoths are just elephants in hair shirts and theres a saber-toothed tiger that comes dangerously close to being a pet. This is no way to run a caveman epic. Still there are nanoseconds of accidental poetry like the visible tear stains on Evolets resting face. But then comes a moment of Mesolithic silliness like a ""Braveheart""-ish speech by DLeh to his men or a reference to snow as ""white rain"" or Omar Sharifs narration. And the less said about historical accuracy the better.Caveman epics can have dignity even if they dont care about authenticity. And that specific dignity comes from giving moviegoers a real ride a ""but that was cool"" moment to talk about afterward. ""10000 B.C."" tries but never catches fire. jneumaiernydailynews.com Joe Neumaier has been on staff at the Daily News since 2003 and is a 20-year veteran of entertainment journalism. Hes written about movies for Entertainment Weekly the New York Times the Washington Post the London Observer and USA Today Weekend has appeared on CNN MSNBC and Good Day New York and regularly discusses movies on New Yorks WWRL-AM. Among the scores of profiles hes done for print are exclusive one-on-one interviews with Jack Nicholson Angelina Jolie Denzel Washington Al Pacino Tom Cruise Will Smith Leonardo Dicaprio Woody Allen Martin Scorsese and Bill Murray.  His favorite film is Billy Wilders ""The Apartment"" (1960); favorite movie soundtrack is Nino Rotas ""La Dolce Vita""; and thinks the Disney animated films of the 1960s and George Lazenbys James Bond film (""On Her Majestys Secret Service"") are underrated. His favorite place to see a movie is a multiplex during the afternoon he prefers popcorn to chocolate treats and thinks hot dogs dont belong in movie theaters - but a concession stand with good coffee is always welcome.

Pictures 10000 B.C. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery 10000 B.C. is its name. Pre-history is its game. But what I want to know is Where? On which planet does it take place? Because the last time I checked pyramids werent built during the Pleistocene. And they werent exactly walking distance from the last snowy remnants of a diminishing ice age. But what a kvetch I am. So what if this colossally hokey saga mashes up history and geography and climatology and anthropology? So what if it links up land masses that have been unconnected since Pangea broke apart 180 million years ago? Who am I to complain McGraw-Hill? Publicity materials quote Harald Kloser (who executive produced co-wrote and co-scored the film) saying he and director/writer Roland Emmerich ""never intended for 10000 B.C. to be a documentary which is a huge relief. They also quote Emmerich on the little matter of location helpfully pin-pointing the setting as ""our own made-up Africa. In filmmaking terms this means portions were shot in New Zealand (for snowy mountains) South Africa (for the jungle below) and Namibia (for the desert nearby). In narrative terms it means that African warrior tribes can unite in a jiffy with light-skinned hunters in funky dreads to fight off kind-of Persian sort-of Egyptian slave-masters building vaguely pre-Colombian or possibly Pharaonic ziggurats assisted by wooly mammoths. The plot such as it is follows our hero Dleh (pronounced ""Delay as in postponement or Tom) and three brave comrades as they race to save loved ones kidnapped by these whip-wielding demons on horseback. The loveliest of the loved ones in Dlehs beloved Evolet who has blue eyes and a jaw-dropping ability to do absolutely nothing except stand around with her mouth open until the time comes for her to weep at which point her perfectly applied eyeliner begins to run. Fashionistas and followers of international starlets will be pleased to learn that Evolet is played by Camilla Belle the terror-stricken baby-sitter in the 2006 remake of When A Stranger Calls. Steven Strait who played Sky Highs mutant flamethrower wields a long spear and giant wig as DLeh while the fine kiwi actor Cliff Curtis (Whale Rider Once Were Warriors) heroically maintains his dignity as DLehs rival and mentor TicTic. And if you cant quite place the crinkly narrator thats the voice Omar Sharif. Its Dr. Zhivagos job to warn us that ""some truths do not survive the ages and Im assuming he means that until now no one knew that hunter-gatherers wore Maybelline. Visually 10000 B.C. boasts the oohs and ahhs of dusky primordial landscapes huffing slave ships and big-budget CG creatures. The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches perhaps inspired by 70 million-year-old Gigantoraptor fossils are idiotic but ... okay theyre idiotic. And the sabre-tooth tiger isnt so bad though it looks about as real as Diego in Ice Age2 The Meltdown. But all the glam effects in the world add up to nil in a corny derivative and incoherent script that dishes out cheese-fried Apocalypto with a dash of 300. There is fun to be had however unintentional when DLeh halts an advancing army by screaming ""Stop Stop Or when he tells his tribesmen ""I keeled thee (mammoth). I claim thee white spear and weeth it my woman Evolet. (Tribesmen ``Yah Yah Yah) And its worth noting that Emmerichs last film was The Day After Tomorrow the eco-disaster flick that foretold sudden glaciation; until I saw it I didnt know that you could outrun frost. Heres hoping he wont make yet another movie about yet another Ice Age - for at least another 10000 years. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Open-Box LG GizmoPal 2 GPS Smartwatch for 35 + free shipping Carbon Fiber Pattern Case for iPhone 6/6 Plus for 1 + free...

March 7 2008 Save for later Saved Married Life (PG-13)Director Ira Sachs. With Pierce Brosnan Chris Cooper Patricia Clarkson. (90 min.)A faltering attempt at black comedy mixed with romantic melodrama ""Married Life"" is always on the verge of being interesting but never quite gets there. Chris Cooper plays Harry who believes he must kill his wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson) rather than have her submit to the indignity of his infidelity with the ravishing Kay (Rachel McAdams) who is also being pursued by Harrys best friend Richard (Pierce Brosnan). Got that? The cast is first-rate but nothing goes very far in this film. Grade B- - Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? 10000 BC (PG-13) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Roland Emmerich. With Steven Strait Camilla Belle. (109 min.)If you like woolly mammoths youll love ""10000 BC."" Otherwise you may be out of luck. This CGI-heavy odyssey is about a hunter named DLeh (Steven Strait) who pledges eternal love to Evolet (Camilla Belle) only to discover shes been abducted by warlords. This is the kind of movie where a character cant just say ""the fires not out yet"" they have to say ""the fire still lives in these stones."" It made me yearn to see ""Caveman"" again. At least that was intentionally funny.Grade C - P.R.

Comments 10000 B.C. Overblown and stupefyingly dull this epic folly from Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) might not sink Warner Brothers but with any luck it will send the prehistoric adventure genre the way of the woolly mammoth. Apparently deluded that throwing money at the screen is the same as making a movie the director chooses empty spectacle over a coherent story spinning a ludicrous tale about a small band of proto-European hunter-gatherers who ally with African tribesmen against a predatory Asiatic theocracy. CGI-generated creatures like a saber-toothed tiger are risible and two singularly uncharismatic actors--Steven Strait and Camilla Belle--are cast as the lovers destined to save mankind.

Yabba-dabba-dont - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Yabba-dabba-dont Silly but fun 10000 B.C. follows a well-trodden trail into the Stone Age Email|Print| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / March 7 2008 Came a time saith the old tales when the great ice sheets retreated and early man advanced upon the earth -- a new man named Homo Hollywoodus for the stylishness of his dreadlocks (extensions by Trog) and for the perfection of the teeth of his women (caps by Dr. Gnar of Beverly Hills). And lo these new people did hunt the woolly mammoth and the spear-toothed tiger and did follow much too closely the plot laid down by the great shaman Mel Gibson in Apocalypto. And they did call this new movie 10000 B.C. and it was awfully dopey but also kind of fun.Now verily there have been earlier sagas of Homo Hollywoodus notably One Million B.C. in 1940 and One Million Years B.C. in 1966 and they too did figure beautiful %cavewomen with good skin and non-period cleavage. But I saith to you that 10000 B.C. is not a remake except in silliness of spirit and I also say to you that I have looked upon Camilla Belle as Evolet and can say that yea she aint no Raquel Welch.But let us talk of brave men DLeh (Steven Strait) a hunter of the Yagahl tribe in the remotest mountaintops where only the mammoths come of reasonably convincing computer-graphic aspect. His name say the marketing gods is the German word for hero spelled backward so does that not indeed make it so? With the coming of four-legged demons from the south -- suspiciously Arabic marauders on horseback foreseen by Old Mother (Mona Hammond) -- the blue-eyed Evolet is taken prisoner along with others of the Yagahl and DLeh waxeth wroth for he loves Evolet even more than his white spear. (Which is a totem of power so getteth thy mind out of the gutter.)And thus a band of manly men set forth on a heroic quest among them DLeh the aging warrior TicTic (Cliff Curtis) whose name causeth much giggling in the audience the young rival KaRen (Mo Zinal) and Baku (Nathanael Baring) hereafter known as The Kid. And verily the earths continents must have been closer together since it was possible in those days to travel from snowy peaks to jungle rainforests to barren desert sands as if these climes were no farther apart than subway stops.And it should be noted too that the Yagahl speak English in stiff archaic fashion much as I am writing and that the African tribes encountered by them speak an ancient movie tongue called Oogabooga. And if you say fie this cannot be I say woe betide he who cometh to such a film expecting paleoanthropological accuracy or political correctness for he will returneth home sorely vexed and out 10.50.Now you will look upon this movie and say critic it is a bad movie. How can it not be so when our hero falls into a pit of sharpened stakes and striketh none and indeed befriends a trapped saber-toothed tiger -- he of massive but bogus CGI -- by speaking gently unto it?How can a film that features a poorly shot attack by giant tree-climbing killer chickens be said to be good? Which rippeth off the ending of Apocalypto pyramid and all such that the great shaman Mel Gibson could sue?And I saith to you verily it is a bad movie with foolish racial politics and indeed it may someday be spoken of as the worst of the year 2008. But I also saith to you that I had a strangely good time and whether that is from laughing at 10000 B.C. or laughing with it I knoweth not although I strongly suspect the former.And it should be pointed out that Roland of the clan of Emmerich who hath fashioned this tale hath not ascended once more to the level of Independence Day but hath instead settled comfortably in the Valley of the Saturday Matinee B-Movie a land once inhabited by giants named Roger Corman and 1950s special-effects magician Ray Harryhausen whom the giant killer chickens doth seem to honor in their stop-motion jerkiness.So yea it is a stinker. But it is prophesied that in six months time you shall come across 10000 B.C. in the land of Pay-Per-View. And you shall say Pass the popcorn.

Films about prehistoric life offer so many unexpected lessons. As I remember it in One Million Years B.C. cavebabe Raquel Welch member of the pacific Shell tribe whips up the breastcloth/loincloth bikini and teaches manners to unrefined John Richardson expat from the warrior Rock tribe. In Caveman Ringo Starr invents the wheel the joke and (literally) rock-and-roll music. In Quest for Fire Rae Dawn Chong essentially invents language and the missionary position. In 10000 B.C. Roland Emmerichs tedious ludicrous and harmless glimpse of the dawn of civilization we see the origins of modern hair and makeup. The humans have dreadlocks and mud-masques and so do the woolly mammoths. Very hip very organic. Always a good thing when predators and prey are coordinated. Set in a CGI continent of mountain glaciers vast deserts and lush forests a continent of Negroid Asian and Caucasian tribes 10K is solemnly narrated by Omar Sharifan elder passing down his tribes origin story. It is the tale of DLeh (Steven Strait) the self-doubting outsider whose quest for his blue-eyed beloved Evolet (Camilla Belle) kidnapped by marauders on horseback will transform his people from hunter-gatherers to an agrarian community. DLeh is an outcast because his father left the tribe and never returned. So when he sets out to find Evolet he is anxious that he will likewise be regarded as cowardly. On his quest across glacier glade and desert DLeh encounters a saber-tooth and calms it with his newfound skills of tiger-whisperer. He also faces off an angry angry ostrich that looks like Big Bird with alligator teeth. Through it all DLeh is brave buff and brainy using inductive reasoning to subdue bloodthirsty enemies both animal and human. He has a boon companion in TicTic (Cliff Curtis) who helps this Pleistocene Ulysses achieve heroic feats. The films penultimate scenes are in Egypt where Evolet has been taken as a slave to build the pyramids and to be an all-purpose lust object. This setting affords DLeh the opportunity to show his aversion to polytheism and Emmerich to show crimson-sailed boats on the Nile. Ah the dawn of man; red sails in the sunset. Bottom line Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals. 10000 B.C. 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Roland Emmerich. With Steven Strait Camilla Belle and Cliff Curtis narrated by Omar Sharif. Distributed by Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 49 mins.

P Star Tribune ""10000 BC"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint There are shaggy-dog stories and then there are shaggy-mammoth stories. ""10000 B.C."" is a pachyderm-sized tall tale of prehistoric ardor and tribal warfare directed on an epic scale by Roland Emmerich who subjected New York to an instant ice age in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Turning his attention to the day before yesterday he feels no greater obligation to realism spinning a yarn that owes more to Edgar Rice Burroughs than anthropology. The scattered narrative is explained on the fly by a gabby elder the Hamburger Helper of storytelling. Speaking in the ""And lo it came to pass"" school of voiceovers he guides through the scenic but underdramatized film. When a clan of northern mammoth hunters holds its seasonal mighty warrior competition self-doubting DLeh (Steven Strait) wins by default. Tangled in the net and dragged along to the creatures semi-accidental death he accepts credit for the kill because it entitles him to claim his childhood love Evolet (Camilla Belle) as his mate. But Old Mother a wise wman with so many trinkets braided in her hair that she looks like a wind chime foresees doom. A thundering pack of ""four-legged demons"" on horseback sacks the village for slaves carrying off Evolet among their prisoners. With a small band of spear-carriers DLeh sets off across uncharted mountains and deserts to free his people. Evolet sporting the kind of twine-and-bone ritual bracelets popular two years ago at Abercrombie and Fitch drops pieces in a trail for DLeh to follow across the trackless wastes a primitive form of GPS tracking. The first 30 minutes of ""10000 B.C."" suffer from tired blood but the pace picks up when the dreadlocked searchers reach warmer climes. There are skirmishes with the slave traders velociraptor-style attacks by gigantic ostrich creatures and even a passage when DLeh befriends a saber-toothed tiger. That might have been intended as comic relief although the scenes lumber by so stiffly its hard to tell. After drawing several African tribes to their cause the hunters enter a mock-Egyptian empire where captive multitudes -- and harnessed mammoths -- build pyramids to the glory of the god-king. The guards Arabic-looking weightlifter types who wear curly-toed genie slippers have a fearsome way with a whip. Still DLeh and his men infiltrate the construction gang ready to spark an uprising and a mammoth stampede. The film was handsomely shot in exotic locations and its budget reportedly well north of 100 million bought a lot of impressive special effects But in the realm of heroic historical loincloth adventures ""10000"" is much less than ""300.""

Picture Review B.C. silly but great to look at 1 / 1 Back to Gallery 10000 B.C. Adventure. Starring Steven Strait Camilla Belle and Cliff Curtis. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (PG-13. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Say what you want about living 10000 years before the birth of Jesus - the universal health care was pretty great. That assumption is based on the obviously superior dental coverage in ""10000 B.C."" which despite taking place a full 11905 years before the invention of novocaine features entire tribes of men and women with teeth so white and straight they could be selling real estate in Walnut Creek. Yes that was a cheap shot but see if youre not taking a few yourself after sitting through ""10000 B.C."" a film that somehow makes the beginning of the Mesolithic period look as dreamy and romantic as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslets voyage on the Titanic. While the movie is completely ridiculous at least its fun to think of all the high school students who are going to mistake this movie for an accurate historical record and get Fs on their next pop quiz. The best thing that can be said for ""10000 B.C."" is that it doesnt skimp on the spectacle. It features so many stampeding woolly mammoths that youll wonder how they and not the humans became extinct. Even though youve never heard of most of the actors in this film there was a serious cash outlay to make the prehistoric pachyderms look awesome. The movie also shows with great detail how the Egyptians built the pyramids which actually happened about 7500 years after the setting of this film. Whos counting when love is in the air? The movie starts small opening somewhere in the frozen North where a small band of prehistoric men appears to be enjoying life after a recent visit from the ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" clan. Seriously you have never seen a group of people in a movie with more well-tweezed eyebrows than these mammoth hunters in ""10000 B.C."" - and that includes ""Steel Magnolias."" After the standard voice-over about a prophecy and a great journey thats about to come we meet DLeh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle) who like almost everyone else in the movie look like Michael Franti. Evolet and the rest of her tribe are taken as slaves which sets DLeh on an adventure to get her back. From there the story is a weird mix of ""Braveheart"" ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Against All Odds"" as DLeh and his friends gather together groups of random tribesmen - dressed so flamboyantly and distinctively that youll expect the Baseball Furies from ""The Warriors"" to show up next - and try to free their people. One thing that ""10000 B.C."" isnt is a drag. The film was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich who made ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" which guarantees that it will at least be interesting and kind of funny - perhaps intentionally so. Can anyone who writes a movie that features a kindly saber-toothed tiger possibly be going for anything other than laughs? The dialogue is also a source of frequent entertainment. Most of the actors speak in a manner consistent with an 11th-grade reading level except they dont have words for things like ""men on horseback."" (""What happened to your people?"" one tribesman asks another. ""They were killed - by four-legged demons"") Another tribe is bilingual yet the members still havent found a better name for the aforementioned tiger than ""spear-tooth."" Belle is a virtual nonentity in the film with any attempts at acting overshadowed by a brow that looks as if it was waxed between each take. And Strait is fine for this material but hes always seemed more destined for television not leading roles in films. No change here. The rest of the members of the cast play their roles appropriately over the top - it cant be easy to keep a straight face when there are 8-inch-long tiger fangs hanging from your ears - although no one is particularly memorable. Warner Bros. really should have spent an extra million dollars to get Ben Kingsley on the set for a few days. -- Advisory This film contains intense action and mammoth-related violence although even that gets screwed up in the end. There must be 300 woolly mammoths in this movie and not one good full-frontal trampling.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about 10000 B.C. click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. 10000 B.C. The caveman is a beloved archetype for a reason. Beetle-browed and quizzical cognitively challenged but game for anything hes a stand-in for us moderns as we try to puzzle out the mystery of our humanity. The classic caveman--a fur-clad club-wielding wheel-inventing regular guy--is a condensation of assumptions speculations and fantasies about our ancestral past. (That he never really existed as such was the premise for those brilliant Geico ads and the short-lived ABC series they inspired.) But caveman cinema even at its goofiest can be a thought-provoking genre. Depictions of early humans have the potential to ask the big questions Where does language come from? What should our relationship be to nature to technology to other humans? A good caveman movie also tackles more immediate concerns What me do when fire go out? How me escape from stampeding woolly mammoth? 10000 B.C. (Warner Bros.) Roland Emmerichs new prehistoric adventure disappoints not because its a bad caveman movie but because it isnt one at all. Rather than taking the trouble to imagine what early civilization might have been like--its culture its language its warfare its family life--the movie simply transposes a banal Hollywood epic into Paleolithic times. Or maybe Mesolithic. Emmerich whos already done alien invasion (Independence Day) and environmental armageddon (The Day After Tomorrow) excels at staging grand-scale chaos but hes no stickler for detail. So what if the construction of the pyramids didnt really overlap with the existence of the woolly mammoth? Can you honestly say you dont want to see a herd of crazed mammoths stampeding down the ramps of a pyramid in progress? Advertisement We begin as Omar Sharif informs us in a mystical voice-over at the dawn of mankind in the small mountain settlement of a tribe called the Yagahl. After his father mysteriously abandons the clan a young hunter DLeh (Steven Strait) falls in love with a blue-eyed cavegirl named Evolet (Camilla Belle looking fresh from a WB teen drama). When a group of Yagahl tribesmen including Evolet is kidnapped by marauding slave traders DLeh conscripts a band of hunters including his adoptive father TicTic (Cliff Curtis) to go in search of them. On their way these dreadlocked warriors will encounter the full roster of prehistoric threats rival tribesmen saber-toothed tigers and a killer reptilian emu that chomps its way through entire forests of bamboo. By the time they arrive at the huge quasi-Egyptian construction site DLeh has become the leader of an army of oppressed tribes who scheme to overthrow the enslavers and their veiled godlike pharaoh. Meanwhile back at the Yagahl encampment an ancient matriarchal figure known as Old Mother (Mona Hammond) relays the faraway events to the remaining tribesmen via a kind of psychic closed-circuit TV. I dont begrudge this plot its stupidity or lack of verisimilitude; some of my best friends are stupid and far-fetched. What makes the movie a drag is the pedestrian joylessness with which it plods through its hypercompressed evolutionary timeline. The invention of agriculture? Oh heres a bag of seeds to take home from your journey. The first encounter with foreign languages? Hey luckily theres a guy who can translate them all for you. One of the movies biggest disappointments is its failure to have fun with language. All the Yagahls communicate in grammatically perfect vaguely accented English. Even their mellifluous names (DLeh? Evolet?) could easily appear on the roster of a hippie preschool. (Need I invoke the caveman names from movies of yore Goov? Creb? Lar? Gaw?) Anthony Burgess created an entire proto-language for Quest for Fire; the best Emmerich and his co-writer Harald Kloser can do is to envision a time before the invention of contractions. (""Do not eat me when I set you free."") Im not asking for the anthropological earnestness of the great early-80s caveman classics (Quest for Fire Iceman The Clan of the Cave Bear) or the philosophical reach of the first part of 2001 A Space Odyssey in which technology war and space travel are all invented with the toss of a single bone. But at least give us the lusty fun of Caveman (1981) in which Ringo Starr and Dennis Quaid play two bumbling Paleolithic pals living in the year ""1 zillion B.C."" 10000 B.C. profits from the latest in Homo sapiens technology--the CGI predators are ably rendered and the digitized battle scenes spectacular (even if they do crib from Apocalypto and The Two Towers). But in terms of character development wit and simple curiosity its dumber than a Neanderthal. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Conventional where it should be bold and mild where it should be wild ""10000 BC"" reps a missed opportunity to present an imaginative vision of a prehistoric moment. Pussyfooting around with multicultural fantasies of how various African tribes might have banded together against unnamed pyramid-building slavemasters with periodic attacks by now-extinct giant beasts helmer Roland Emmerich does serve up some moments of grand spectacle to enliven an otherwise bland concoction. After long delays (pic was originally announced for summer 2007 release) Warner Bros. is pointedly opening the film in what is now referred to as the ""300"" slot generating expectations that should result in a potent opening. Stateside B.O. will likely slide quickly but international prospects appear quite brawny. With the nearly limitless possibilities provided by CGI and violence-tolerant R ratings it would seem that if youre going to make an action epic set in an exotic time and place you just need to go for it. Regardless of ones critical opinions of individual films its hard to deny the balls-out ultra-visceral stylistically audacious approaches of ""Apocalypto"" and ""300"" injected some fresh excitement into a long-dormant and generally derided genre. The box office will tell its own story but in terms of sheer impact it seems all but pointless to make such a film now that holds back to avoid an R rating. Compared to its brethren ""10000 BC"" seems neutered timid and unnaturally averse to showing much less dramatically embracing the implicit savagery of its warrior characters. It even seems to put itself above addressing the most elemental desires of the teen fanbase by offering little beefcake and absolutely no cheesecake -- a basic component entirely understood by the makers of the scruffy 1966 Raquel Welch starrer ""One Million Years B.C."" a film suitable even for small fry. First big sequence is a woolly mammoth hunt meant to establish the new leader of a small mountain tribe. As impressively rendered here the mammoths truly live up to their name but the hunt ends inconclusively; DLeh (Steven Strait) a dreadlocked young man considered to be the village coward almost accidentally makes the kill and in good conscience cant accept the two intended rewards -- the symbolic white spear meant for the top hunter and the hand of his longtime love blue-eyed beauty Evolet (Camilla Belle). As in both ""Apocalypto"" and ""One Million Years B.C."" the core of the film is a long trek into unknown territory prompted here by the kidnapping of Evolet and other young villagers by marauding horsemen. As DLeh older mentor TicTic (Cliff Curtis) and two others traverse snowy peaks dense jungle and eventually forbidding desert in pursuit of the interlopers they encounter a flock of giant flightless birds with outsized beaks that aggressively manifest the direct connection between dinosaurs and fowl as well as a saber-toothed tiger of refined sensibilities. Along the way DLeh gains the backing of a black tribe whose ranks have also been thinned by the slavers. More African desert folk join the march so by the time they arrive at a city dominated by a towering pyramid under construction the nomads have gathered a considerable army. The lascivious desires of her captors notwithstanding Evolet is being saved for delivery to the desert deity a shrouded figure with a voice like the devil in ""The Exorcist."" Gradually developing the instincts of a real leader DLeh bets that the thousands of slaves forced to work alongside mammoths pushing huge blocks up the pyramid will join his battle and the sweeping shots of the back-breaking work and subsequent fighting are undeniably imposing. All the same in none of the films numerous eventful episodes does Emmerich demonstrate any skill or even interest in carefully building the drama to create anticipation or stir suspense. As with a pyramid every sequence is just another undifferentiated block to be added to whats already there. This happens then that happens with no scene-setting nuance grace notes or imaginative embellishment. The borderline ludicrous feel-good ending suggests that a certain African pyramid-building empire went the way of Troy. Multiracial cast members make more impact by their looks than by any thesping efforts although Strait has a bit of Colin Farrells dark-eyed watchfulness. Visual effects are of a high standard as are locations provided by New Zealand South Africa and Namibia. One wishes the same could be said of Emmerich and Harald Klosers script which has the characters speaking relatively straightforward English makes no attempt to develop any distinguishing linguistic characteristics and features the occasional howler as when one warrior calms another by saying ""I understand your pain."" This is a case where some madly primitive musical accompaniment could have set a much-needed otherworldly tone circumstances that make the score by Kloser and Thomas Wander seem particularly banal.
