He can bare his teeth but prefers to chew doubters into submission like hes turning over an old can between well-worn teeth. He launches into gentle storytelling monologues as if employing stealth weaponry the young and green lap them up; the seasoned and weary roll their eyes submitting to conversational death by a thousand anecdotes. This is not a biopic in the usual cot-to-coffin sense even if that carved-in-granite title suggests otherwise. Instead Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner (Munich) - drawing on a book by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin - delight in the backroom wrangling and public rhetoric that in 1865 led to the 13th Amendment to the US constitution outlawing slavery. This is Spielberg in the historical mode of Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan but with his more epic and populist wings intriguingly clipped by a story that mostly takes place over just a few weeks in January 1865. Kushners script is a masterpiece of miniature portraiture. The films thrust is the countdown to a vote as Lincoln and his agents battle to find enough Republicans and Democrats to back the amendment while simultaneously keeping end-of-war negotiations on track. It also offers moving comment on Lincolns relations with his strong but nervous wife Mary (Sally Field below) and his sons (the eldest played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as well as throwing us into the heart of the frenzied horse trading and high-stakes talk of this critical moment in American history. (Among a vast ensemble of actors playing politicians there are enough hairpieces and beards on display to stitch together giant wigs for all four heads on Mount Rushmore.) Especially electric is the push and pull between Kushners talky microscopic script - unafraid of politics long scenes and four walls - and Spielbergs attraction in cahoots with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski to quietly iconic moments Lincolns famous beard silhouetted against the night or the faint shadow of soldiers riding past Ulysses S Grant (Jared Harris) and Lincoln as they chat on a porch. This doesnt mean Lincoln is entirely free of heavy-handed moments - an early encounter between Lincoln and some young soldiers verges on the corny and theres some near-slapstick stuff involving spivvy lobbyists. But mostly Spielberg finds a happy balance between the sober and the stirring and even John Williamss score is relatively muted. Its down to Day-Lewis taking Kushners many prompts and in Spielbergs reverent glare to give us a greater sense of the man beyond these few weeks. His Lincoln is flat-footed and heavy-ankled; he shuffles down the White House corridor as if hes dragging chains behind him. His shoulders are drooping his eyes are weary but his mind is as sharp as a bayonet. His Lincoln is complex and endearing never fully likeable but always hugely admirable and because of these happy contradictions Lincoln works as a snapshot of a great man without ever slipping into a portrait of sainthood.

The script just went round in circles and was largely on the lips of political windbags Lincoln first and foremost. The Civil War Lincoln and race relations hold a continuing fascination for the American public which may have derived some satisfaction from this film. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 16 2013N. GalenFeaturedmmm... a protagonist who complete dominates a long film to the detriment of context and the other players in the story (though the abolitionist limping senator with the black lover does gets close to stealing the show and is rather more interesting than the hammily-acted Lincoln); Day-Lewis acts like hes focused on getting an Oscar rather than bringing a human being to life - Lincoln as portrayed is a strangely zombie character an intelligent articulate zombie but still a zombie; I greatly appreciate Spielbergs attempt to deal with political process and I appreciate the lack of action but somehow the context is missing and after seeing the film I know some more facts but very little about what makes these politicians tick; and the lighting is way too stylised beautiful but unremittingly unreal so the film falls between the stools of docufiction and costume drama with costume drama winning out; and the second subject of the film - slavery - is almost complete absent (unlike Django Unchained) except as a verbal abstractionFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 27 2013jayFeaturedThe fire Trojan that is Daniel Day-Lewis strikes again. This hat-trick that he has forged for himself has been cemented with an incredible tactile illuminated performance of an American icon. Yes it it is very dialogue driven but without Lewis in the drivers seat this could be one heck of a mundane history lesson. Doris Kearns Goodwins book serves as the perfect template for a logistical narrative - although without it there would be no movie. It comes down to Tony Kushners adaptation to hone in her studies and make for one heck of a riveing piece of drama. Day-Lewis has stated that he wants to step down from acting. Yet on many occasions he has always implemented a self-imposed sabbatical between projects; that is until Scorseses delayed Silence can coax him from such exile.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 15 2013villardiFeaturedToo many reviewers want to play politics instead of reviewing the film and all the usual anti Spielberg mob venting their spleen. First how nice to have a film based around quality acting and speech instead of action 3D and special effects. The interpretation of Lincoln was fairly accurate as far as I know having spent some time studying the American Civil War. The screenplay was adapted (very well) from a recent book so dont blame Spielberg for that either. Yes a little syrupy at times but Day Lewis Sally Field and especially Tommy Lee Jones all superb for me. See it enjoy it and ignore all those people who were bored and are going to see Die Hard 27. PS I enjoy action movies tooFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 10 2013AgentFruitFeaturedIts not often I feel the need desperately to leave a film. Today was one of those very rare occasions. Unfortunately I was hemmed in by politeness and people. 148 minutes of utter boredom repetitive lines this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it. There isnt even anything visual to enjoy being almost monochrome in its dullness but not nearly as interesting. Quite why the critics are going crazy for it completely baffles me though in a way Im not surprised - its got Spielbergs name on it and once one critic has had his palm greased the rest have to follow suit for fear of looking like they dont know something. The user reviews are less than enthusiastic on the whole and if you look elsewhere theyre pretty dire. If you want a good sleep go see this film. Dreadful.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 3 2013DutchFilmFan2013FeaturedDaniel Day-Lewis will most probably go home with his third Best Actor Oscar in three weeks time with his simply incredible performance of President Lincoln What an amazing performance it was indeed and he was backed-up by solid performances as well from Sally Field Tommy Lee Jones David Straitharn Jared Harris Joseph Gordon-Levitt etc.. The two really loud populist politicians in this film who tried to block the 13th amendment reminded me of one or two populist politicians in my own country nothing much has changed after all these years apparently when it comes to politics. Maybe not everyones cup of tea but I enjoyed every minute of this rather long 150 minutes film; for me this is one of Mr. Steven Spielbergs best serious films so far.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2013AriesatLargeFeaturedI found the first half of the film rather boring but the second half very interesting. In my opinion its worth only to watch Daniel Day Lewis acting. Unless you are most interested in politics the push and pull and American history of course. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 26 2013IanFeaturedI find myself agreeing with the viewers rather than the reviewer. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent and is given able support by Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones but the film is a bit of a stinker. I found myself nearly falling asleep after about half an hour. Spielberg lays the Saint Abe on a bit thick and for much of the film it feels like a rather slow documentary. I will be amazed if it wins any of the ""big"" Oscars other than best actor for Daniel Day Lewis. A good 3 star film not up to best picture standards. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 26 2013philseeFeatured""Lincoln"" is American imperialisms creation myth. The lengthy wordiness of the film gives an impression of a history lesson. Unfortunately its slow boring fiction. The book on which the film is based was not written by a historian The war was provoked by manufacturing tariffs imposed by the north on the south which is why the south wanted to secede. It was nothing to do with slavery. Lincoln offered to confirm slavery in the US Constitution in order to keep the south in the union at the time of his first inauguration. Lincolns emancipation declaration was issued 18 months into the war when the north was losing in an attempt to get anti-slavery European support for his war. Lincoln negotiated with European powers to expel freed slaves to Africa after the war. It is likely the south would have had better race relations if it had been forced by economic necessity to abolish slavery like every other nation rather than imperialist conquest by the north. There are more black people in US prisons today than were ever US slaves in the 19th century. Its funny to hear self-professed liberals like Kermode and Bacon fawning over Spielberg for the making of this film. The film generates some dramatic tension up to the constitutional amendment vote however the idea of Lincoln running around to get it to pass is not credible. Day Lewis is effective in depicting a popular version of Lincoln but with few historical images and no voice recordings he has lots of scope.

For a moment I thought he would take it to Lincoln at the top to celebrate their triumph but instead he brought it to whom this resolution will directly affect in real life the people who are at the bottom with no voice as are not considered people. Very tragic and ironic for the Democratic Party to have been so blind and troglodyte in this historic moment.

"Lincoln | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lincoln ) Lincoln (United States 2012) November 17 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the many many smart decisions made by director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner when developing Lincoln was not to make it a traditional bio-pic of the 16th U.S. president. Instead they confined the main story to a one-month period January 1865 when it could be argued that Abraham Lincoln won his greatest victory. The movie could as easily (and accurately) have been titled The Battle for the 13th Amendment. Spielberg shows no need to dramatize Lincolns life as a series of ""greatest hits."" The Gettsyburg Address and Emancipation Proclamation are both referenced but neither is depicted. The assassination occurs off-screen. However by showing the private and public struggle to both free the slaves and end the war Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We dont need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was - this window is more than sufficient. Lincoln is rightfully credited with saving the Union. He is regarded as an idealist and opportunist who accomplished what no other president before him attempted. We read about him in history books and come away with the impression that he was a great man without perhaps recognizing all the elements that contributed to his greatness. Lincoln shows us an intelligent folksy person whose greatest assets are his conscience and his ability to play the game of politics as well as any man. Frequently underestimated by his opponents he outwits and outmaneuvers more seasoned veterans and comes away with a win that alters the course of history. In between the maneuvers he takes time offer parables and tell stories (like the one about Ethan Allen and the privy). If youre not entirely sure why Lincoln is universally regarded as one of the greatest U.S. presidents going into this movie youll have no doubts by the time its over. Lincoln is part character study and part period piece political thriller. Its about all the tactics some of which would be considered ""dirty"" by todays dubious standards (including but not limited to patronage positions as bribes) employed by Lincoln to forge the bipartisan coalition necessary in the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery). To do this he must avoid even a single Republican defection and gain at least 20 votes from Democrats. Initially the task seems impossible but Lincoln is relentless in his pursuit of victory. At the same time he seeks to close out the war on his terms (meaning that the passage of the 13th Amendment is not a bargaining chip in discussions with the Confederacy). The desire of his oldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to join the army creates tension between Abraham and his wife Mary (Sally Field). As strong as Lincoln is in presenting a richly detailed portrait of the title character it is equally effective in illustrating how the government worked in the 1860s. Those who believe partisan bitterness is a modern infection need look no further than the Capitol during the Houses discourse about the13th Amendment to recognize how civil todays bickering is. Some of the insults hurled by the likes of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) would shock and outrage congressman today. Some things never change however like the under-the-table deals and compromises mandated to avoid gridlock. Also noteworthy is the ease with which normal citizens once gained access to both the president and the White House. Lincolns office has more of the feel of a saloon backroom than hallowed ground. The films themes are powerful but Lincoln stands as tall as it does because of a series of amazing performances none more towering than that of Daniel Day-Lewis. It doesnt take a crystal ball to prognosticate that not only will Day-Lewis garner an Oscar nomination for his work here but he will probably win. Even with as impressive a resume as his is (which already includes Best Actor citations for My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood) this is a career performance. Actors have won top honors for far less riveting portrayals. Day-Lewis doesnt just play Lincoln; he inhabits him. Its as remarkable a clinic of acting as I have seen - far far beyond mere mimicry. The physical resemblance doesnt hurt but this isnt a case of Day-Lewis looking like President 16 - its a case of his becoming him. Impressive secondary performances abound as well and there will be Oscar nominations as well in supporting categories. Sally Field as Lincolns unstable wife stands a good chance as does Tommy Lee Jones as the fiery passionate Thaddeus Stevens. Additional possibilities include Hal Holbrook as Preston Blair and David Strathairn as Secretary of State Seward (although Strathairns fine portrayal may be too understated for the Academy to recognize). There are other recognizable names in the cast as well including James Spader John Hawkes and Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose 2012 resume is astonishing in its versatility. For Spielberg this represents a welcome return to form and a reaffirmation that he remains capable of accomplishing remarkable things on a movie screen. After last years twin disappointments of The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse its refreshing to see Spielberg rebound. Lincoln is perhaps not quite on the same level as Saving Private Ryan or Schindlers List but it can stand alongside any of the other ""serious"" films the great director has made. History-based movies need not be history lessons but the best of them like Lincoln bring the past vividly to life. Over the years I have read countless books about Lincolns presidency and The Civil War but there were things in Lincoln of which I was unaware. More importantly at no time have I felt as close to the real-life figure as I did while watching Spielbergs movie not when standing at the base of his statue in the Lincoln Memorial not when gazing up at the Presidents Box in Fords Theater and not when immersed in any book TV program or movie. If Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter left behind a vaguely unpalatable aftertaste Lincoln is the perfect solution with which to wash it away.

At area theaters. Steven Spielbergs masterful drama ""Lincoln"" starring a mesmerizing Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president opened in New York and Los Angeles last week. Upon seeing it in Manhattan one of my kinder gentler friends dashed off this e-mail ""What a sham"" she began. ""And I didnt like Daniel Day-Lewis in the role. That wasnt Lincoln. Hollywood fog and lights and a mess a lying mess shame on Spielberg."" Ouch. The e-mail was a reminder that  powerful art elicits powerful reactions -- not all of them laudatory. And as we head into award season ""Lincoln"" is going to get its share of love but also some cranky opposition some of it even deserved. Still as much as I share her suspicion of Hollywood mythmaking I beg to differ with my friend. Yes ""Lincoln"" with its high production values singular lead performance and stellar cast is undeniably the work of a director who intends his ""Lincoln"" to be the Lincoln film. But with its focus on the lofty ideals and rough-and-tumble political machinations it is also a sober and timely homage to our messy violent wondrous democracy. ""Lincoln"" isnt a traditional biopic. The story focuses on the final four months in the presidents life in particular the time when he was pushing to get the House of Representatives to vote on and pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. With the end of the Civil War in sight Lincoln believes the only way to successfully reunite the nation is to finish off slavery. Hed assumed extraordinary wartime powers during the conflict and in one scene Lincoln admits ruefully that once the war is over his January 1863 executive order known as the Emancipation Proclamation might not hold up legally. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner (who worked with the director on ""Munich"") took their inspiration from Doris Kearns Goodwins award-winning history ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."" Though the battle for the 13th Amendment is touched on in only a handful of pages the films focus underscores Goodwins arguments for Lincolns tremendous skill at governing. ""Lincoln"" offers proof of what magic can happen when an actor falls in love with his character. Because as great as Day-Lewis has been in his many parts he has never seemed quite so smitten. His embrace of Lincoln makes this whiskered commander in chief human powerfully so. This lanky soul is playful father to young Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and protective father to 21-year-old Robert. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt Robert is aching to join a war against his parents wishes. Day-Lewis is husband to mourning mate Mary Todd Lincoln. He is a grieving parent in his own right. This Lincoln is a storyteller a clever raconteur. For heavens sake he chuckles at his own jokes using them like parables to underscore some more profound political issues. When he settles into a yarn plopping himself on a desktop or staring down with a faraway gaze before he begins he might be met with rolled eyes. Or plain confusion. Early in the film Lincolns former political competitor and now his Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) replies to one of Lincolns homespun riffs ""I have no idea what youre talking about."" ""Lincoln"" is packed with characters and we mean that in both senses of the word. Sally Field allows us to rethink the high-strung burden Mary Todd Lincoln has been portrayed as. Yes the loss of their son nearly undid her but shes emotionally and politically astute. A chilly faux cordial face-off with Rep. Stevens shows a woman unbowed by Washington hierarchies or gossip. As good as Day-Lewis is Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader do their darndest to steal the show. Spader is often hilarious as W.N. Bilbo one of three lobbyists tasked with securing a few Democrats to support the measure. John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson play his colleagues. Jones is the dour Rep. Thaddeus Stevens a so-called radical Republican from Pennsylvania and the only figure who seems to understand deep in his bones that blacks are equal to whites. He is sour and sarcastic and utterly watchable. By his own admission Spielberg has been obsessed with the 16th prez since he was a boy. He clearly aims to honor his subject with a motion picture befitting his stature. That he attempts this while also revealing the human side of Lincoln is the films grandest and most generous ambition.

Slideshow As Lincoln Daniel Day-Lewis stands very tall Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Lincoln >> His house is the White House and the wraith is Abraham Lincoln 16th president of the United States. In Lincoln - Steven Spielbergs penetrating portrait of a nations leader at a moment of epic crisis - Daniel Day-Lewis delivers an utterly extraordinary performance his voice aquiver his body angular but pliant moving with a creaking spongy gait down the corridors of the residence on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Civil War has taken hundreds of thousands of lives. And Lincolns campaign to outlaw the trade in human beings (""If slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong"" he wrote) is being thwarted by a recalcitrant Congress. Lincoln begins with bayonets and mud and muskets soldiers in close miserable combat but for the most part the action in Spielbergs handsome piece of history is verbal emotional electric. With a screenplay by Tony Kushner adapting Doris Kearns Goodwins Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln the film masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life how to bring the war between the states to an end and how to eradicate slavery once and for all. And though his goals were lofty the country lawyer-turned-commander in chief was savvy enough to know that deals needed to be made patronage jobs promised if he was to win over the anti-abolitionist Democrats in the House of Representatives. And so Lincoln is as much about the process of our political system as it is about the people who try to master it. This is one of Spielbergs key achievements that he introduces a gang of contentious pols (William Seward Thaddeus Stevens Edwin Stanton) and manages to keep track of who they are and how they are allied with or opposed to their president. But Lincoln is also a human tale and Day-Lewis armed with Kushners eloquent prose brings his subject to life with grace humor and soul. The president was by accounts a wild storyteller and there are wonderful scenes where Lincoln veers off on colorful narrative jags regaling soldiers telegraph operators members of his cabinet with metaphoric rambles whose implications are not always clear. Perhaps its the alchemical way the actor gets under the skin of his character but Day-Lewis channeling of Honest Abe makes everyone elses job all the more daunting. Tommy Lee Jones as the Pennsylvania ""Radical Republican"" Thaddeus Stevens is up to the task with his wrinkles wigs and wry manner; Jared Harris brings a battleworn wisdom to his Gen. Grant. But Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincolns wife and eldest son never really get their footing. Field especially has trouble finding the center of gravity for the slightly loony Mary Todd Lincoln. And Gordon-Levitt as Robert the son who wants to enlist but is forbidden to do so broods accordingly. Yet this filial drama seems insignificant somehow. Lincolns relationship with his younger son Tad (Gulliver McGrath) is more compelling - the president curls up alongside his sleeping boy by a fireplace or watches as Tad surveys tintype portraits of slaves. But never mind a few misguided casting choices; Lincoln is exceptionally good elevated by a preternatural star turn and by the energy and invention its director displays in telling a story that doesnt rely on action and special effects. Instead it relies on a pivotal moment in Americas history as seen through the eyes of the man at the maelstroms center trying to wield his might doing what he believes is right.

Lincoln was known to quote the Bard and Tony Kushners screenplay my favorite so far this year glides along on colloquial Shakespearean cadence and language.Then theres the predicament of Daniel Day-Lewis Lincoln. He feels he must take action to pass the 13th Amendment and make emancipation official. And he must do it quickly before the Civil War ends to secure the support of a populace that likely would see little reason to end slavery once the war is settled.Doris Kearns Goodwins book Team of Rivals scored by slicing through the myriad Lincoln mythologies to reveal a master politician. Lincoln takes an even more audacious approach. Most of the action takes place in the space of a few weeks as the president elected to a second term seeks to flex his political capital for a higher moral purpose. Lincoln is a swift master class in realpolitik a reminder that all backroom deals arent created equal.Nor are all actors. Every once in a while in Lincolns 149 minutes you look past the bearded visage and realize thats Day-Lewis in there. Its an uncanny sensation that only the best of the best can create a complete and total suspension of disbelief. Day-Lewis Lincoln is mercurial -- melancholy funny always on the brink of winding through a story or a dirty joke. The movie takes Lincoln down from Mount Rushmore and renders him in bracingly human scale.Among Kushners boldest departures from Team of Rivals on which the film is loosely based is the elevation of radical Abolitionist congressman Thaddeus Stevens to major player. Played by Tommy Lee Jones in high dudgeon mode Stevens doesnt quite trust Lincoln. He sees the president as too pragmatic too deliberative. But Lincoln knows he needs the Stevens faction just as he needs the more moderate Republicans led by Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook). The debates on the House floor are volatile spry and never less than riveting.Sally Field brings passionate vulnerability to Mary Todd Lincoln damaged by the death of one son and not thrilled to see another (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln) enlist.But the real thrill of Lincoln lies in the fine art of twisting arms and forging compromise. This is Washington after all. Everybody wants something. Its hard to think of another movie that takes such pleasure in the elbow grease of politics the all-out push to accomplish something for the greater good.Lincoln is a stirring reminder that politics can be noble. Might there be a lesson here for todays shrill D.C. discourse? Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.LINCOLN(A) Directed by Steven Spielberg.

The team of Steven Spielberg Daniel Day-Lewis and Tony Kushner has brought forth a triumphant piece of historical journalism a profound work of popular art and a rich examination of one of our darkest epochs. The opening shot sets the tone. Confederate and Union soldiers fight hand-to-hand in a quagmire uniforms so muddied its hard to see who is killing who. Its a brutish battle for noble ideals and the key to the story. This biographical epic presents the final four months of Lincolns life as war in Washingtons trenches. Lincoln aims to govern a bitterly divided nation despite mutinies in his own ranks and hostile opposition. His goal is passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery and he batters it through with arm-twisting bribery misinformation and strategic compromise. This is no fawning portrait of an idealized leader but a deep study of a pragmatist with an open mind and a searching conscience. As Lincoln Day-Lewis delivers a multidimensional performance of great conviction and dignity aided by direction that sidesteps cliche at every turn. The camera first discovers Lincoln from the back as he greets a knot of rain-soaked Union troops. Here hes all Uncle Abe folksiness dispensing a kind word here and a joke there. Day-Lewis voice is thin and reedy which jibes with historical accounts but subverts our expectations. His attitude makes listeners lean in and so do we magnetized by his kindly reserve. That kind of charisma is strong political capital and Lincoln uses it sagely. He reasons that since his Emancipation Proclamation had no legal force over state laws Congress must prohibit slavery before the Souths imminent surrender and return to the union. That means outmaneuvering the chambers racist Democrats and wooing radical Republican abolitionists who see their president as a milquetoast compromiser. Video (4010) Lincoln Spielberg on the challenges of the film These scenes are good drama and surprisingly good comedy. Kushners screenplay is a bit stagebound with too many entrances and exits but his scholarship and candor are impeccable. He showcases Lincolns wit but also shows that his Cabinet could get damned tired of the cracker-barrel anecdotes. Lincolns adversaries resemble juicy eccentrics from Dickens. Lee Price is a blowhard delight as grandstanding Congressman Fernando Wood who denounces Lincoln as ""Emperor Abrahamus Africanus the First."" As Thaddeus Stevens a fervent anti-slavery Republican Tommy Lee Jones growls and glowers like an old lion. His strained formal meeting with Sally Fields Mary Todd Lincoln is a little minuet of polite mutual disgust. Lincolns other foil is his son Robert played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The college student is determined to prove himself by entering the war that his father detests. Still grieving two sons lost to disease Lincoln is not about to sacrifice another to the bayonet. Their strained relationship leads to one of the most emotionally devastating scenes in a Spielberg film. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski avoid the sort of Norman Rockwell pictorialism that would have sentimentalized the story. They alternate from shots in dark interiors half-lit by gas lamps to hazy panoramas of the wilderness outside establishing a distinction between civilization and the terrifying untamed beauty of the American frontier. The directors work here runs parallel to his restrained mature best in ""Schindlers List."" He avoids easy formulas triumphing through directness and conjuring nerve-racking suspense from long-settled history. Lincoln loathed slavery but was ambivalent at best on the question of the natural equality of the races. When the freed slave who is his wifes maid asks him what place he hopes America will have for its black citizens he hedges. For such honesty we must be grateful. Spielberg doesnt construct a waxworks tableau about social problems. He shows people wrestling with them in the mud and makes us wrestle them too.

(AP Photo/DreamWorks Twentieth Century Fox David James) David James This publicity film image released by DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox shows Daniel Day-Lewis portraying Abraham Lincoln in the film ""Lincoln."" (AP Photo/DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox David James) Four score and seven years ago Charlie Chaplin won the hearts of ordinary Americans without saying a word. After suffering through the speeches in ""Lincoln"" ordinary Americans might vote for the Little Tramp over Honest Abe.This tedious talkathon is Steven Spielbergs broadest misfire since ""1941."" And unlike that World War II comedy this Civil War drama wasnt drafted to entertain us.So after the briefest of battle sequences and an embarrassing scene where a noble Negro soldier regurgitates the Gettysburg Address to visiting dignitary Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) were subjected to a two-hour lecture on parliamentary procedure. Thats right -- a movie called ""Lincoln"" is confined to the few months in the presidents life when he cajoled the divided House of Representatives to pass the constitutional amendment that would end slavery. And then the final vote by the postwar Congress is relegated to a footnote.To compare this stiff history lesson to a waxy attraction at an Orlando theme park would be an insult to Walt Disney. Its more like a cheap video youd see at the welcome center of a state park.Spielberg is legendary for his visual feasts yet he serves us this turkey with no relish. Theres scarcely a memorable image in the entire film. What you will remember for better or worse is the voice of Day-Lewis. During his year of research he discovered that Lincoln had a reedy timbre so in a hollow victory for historical accuracy the meticulous method actor brays like an old prospector in an episode of Gunsmoke."" It will disappoint audiences who expect inspirational oratory but it should delight Doris Kearns Goodwin who wrote the book that is the basis for Tony Kushners windy screenplay.Goodwins tome ""A Team of Rivals"" is about the competing perspectives in the presidents inner circle. While Day-Lewis Lincoln is a folksy negotiator fine actors such as David Straitharn and Hal Holbrook are reduced to wearing silly outfits and calling each other fatuous nincompoops. Poor Sally Field undoubtedly deferring to the documentary evidence plays Mary Todd Lincoln as a hysterical shrew. Only fast-talking Tommy Lee Jones as Pennsylvania abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens briefly escapes the Spielbergian strait-jacket before he is recaptured for a group chorus of ""The Battle Cry of Freedom."" For his complex portrayal Day-Lewis is likely to have roses thrown at his feet but for the dreadful film in which hes enslaved emancipated onlookers will reach for the grapes of wrath.What ""Lincoln""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 229  Content One intense scene of war violence and brief strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Cast Daniel Day-Lewis David Strathairn Tommy Lee Jones. Rating PG-13 for an intense scene of war violence some images of carnage and brief strong language. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Tommy Lee Jones in time talks Lincoln Life story 10 biopics worth watching By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Nov 27 2012 859 PM We have come through a brutal bruising presidential election season with wounds aplenty on all sides. Most of us are sick of it all particularly because the first few days after the election seem to promise barely a momentary lull in the partisan bickering that divides so many. Steven Spielberg provides a balm. His ""Lincoln"" in addition to being a fascinating story that probably isnt what you think it is (more on that later) reminds us at once that politics was always a dirty game and that despite a few shady turns here and there some men rise above it. Way above it in fact into the annals of history. Abraham Lincoln was such a man and what Spielberg gives us greatly aided by Daniel Day-Lewis brilliant portrayal (we have come to expect nothing less from him) is a man willing to fight dirty to get what he wanted but also a man so unshakably sure that what he is fighting for is right that the ends justify his means. But this is not a biography of the 16th president not a rags-to-lesser-rags story. Instead its a small slice of life historically crucial life told in great detail. Its set in 1865 as the Civil War is winding down. The Senate has passed the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery but the vicious fight in the House seems all but certain to end in failure. Even Lincolns Cabinet and aides want him to back off but the president realizes that its now or never. When the Southern states return to the Union theyll never vote for passage of the amendment. Which puts Lincoln in an even more curious spot. A delegation from the Confederate States of America led by Vice President Alexander Stephens (Jackie Earle Haley) is heading to Washington to negotiate peace. Although peace is what Lincoln and everyone else want it cant come too quickly. Passage of the amendment must come first if it is to come at all. If it sounds like so much backroom politicking it is. But its exceptionally interesting entertaining backroom politicking. Tony Kushner working in part from Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals"" gives us in his script the hilariously mean-spirited debate on the House floor with radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) urging passage of the amendment and such Democrats as Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) fighting hammer and tongs against it. If you think the recent election got personal and malicious perhaps you may find solace in the knowledge that it once was even worse. (Youll need to readjust your political radar for the film; Republicans are the progressive party in 1865.) The stakes of course couldnt have been higher. Spielberg establishes the context from the first frames of the film with a savage ""Saving Private Ryan""-type battle. These were not theoretical political discussions; men were fighting and dying in large numbers. A later scene in which Lincoln rides through the aftermath of a battle is even more harrowing a grim reminder of what was lost. Not all of ""Lincoln"" plays out like an extended 19th-century episode of ""The West Wing."" Sally Field is suitably manic as Mary Todd Lincoln crazed by grief at the loss of one son to disease and the thought of losing another (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to war. David Strathairn works the back channels expertly as William Seward Lincolns secretary of State. He hires a motley crew that includes a hilarious James Spader as W.N. Bilbo to secure votes from weak Democrats careful not to get his own hands (or the presidents) dirty. There is in fact not a bad performance in the movie. But as with representative government there are firsts among equals. One is Jones outstanding as Stevens a pressure cooker scheming under an awful wig to get Lincoln to go ever further with the amendment; the president is more politically realistic (though Stevens can be when push comes to shove). Passage is vital to Stevens whose reasons are complex. But towering above all fittingly literally is Day-Lewis as Lincoln. We see his negotiations with his Cabinet with his wife with his conscience. There is a brilliant expediency to the man but it comes at such a terrible cost. We see the weight of that in his every move his every utterance even when he is telling yet another yarn to make a point. A sadness haunts him as if he knows the end of his own story even as he realizes the importance of the larger one a place in history not as important as history itself. Its how great men live. ""Lincoln"" reminds us of this and of its rarity. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

By Anthony Lane Daniel Day-Lewis in Steven Spielbergs movie a man who reaches out to the people he leads while seeming lost in himself.   Credit Illustration by Ricardo Martinez ""Lincoln"" tells an honest tale of Abe. For most of the movie we join the sixteenth President (Daniel Day-Lewis) in early 1865 as he seeks to wrestle the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution through the House of Representatives. The Senate passed the amendment outlawing slavery and involuntary servitude in April 1864. Now comes a rougher task with obstacles deployed on every flank. The problem is not the opposition--Democrats such as Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) a former mayor of New York who wanted the city to secede from the Union and reap a continuing profit from its cotton trade with the Confederacy. The problem is fellow-Republicans notably Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) whose perpetual head of abolitionist steam is enough to blow his wig off. He believes in racial equality in the eyes of God not merely as the amendment suggests before the law. How can so fervid a figure be reined in? ""Lincoln"" written by Tony Kushner directed by Steven Spielberg and derived in part from Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals"" is a curious beast. The title suggests a monolith as if going to this movie were tantamount to visiting Mt. Rushmore and the running time of two and a half hours prepares you for an epic. Yet the film is a cramped and ornery affair with Spielberg going into lockdown mode even more thoroughly than he did in ""The Terminal."" As befits a chamber piece we pass from one chamber to the next from the crowded floor of the House to the Lincolns bedroom a hospital ward and the study where Stevens likes to browbeat lesser men. Then there is the carriage with curtained windows in which a Southern delegation led by Alexander Stephens (Jackie Earle Haley) Vice-President of the Confederate States travels north in secret (and in vain) to discuss a peace deal--peace being the first thing that Lincoln prays for and the last thing he needs right now before the amendment is passed. Stephens was a ferrety fellow often in poor health and Haley is an alarmingly close match. Almost all the actors in ""Lincoln"" map neatly onto their characters aside from Hal Holbrook who looks too cushioned and comfortable for the role of Francis Preston Blair the architect of the failed peace agreement and a dead ringer for Nosferatu. Still its only proper that the guy who played Deep Throat should show up because ""Lincoln"" devotes itself to shenanigans in smoke-filled rooms with most of the smoke emerging from the cigar of Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) whose close confiding affection for Lincoln is well caught. No one is happier in this fug than Janusz Kaminski Spielbergs cinematographer who veils events in such a rarefied and sifted haze that they seem already poised halfway to myth. Just look at the President haloed and framed against a window in semi-silhouette as he sits in a rocking chair reading to his young son Tad (Gulliver McGrath). They could be in a picture book themselves. Because of scenes like that ""Lincoln"" becomes a fight. There is physical conflict but it seems perfunctory first a murderous opening scrap between black and Confederate regiments invested by Kaminski with the staccato desperation that he brought to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and then much later a corpse-littered battlescape. The true tussle of the movie however is between the Spielberg who like a cinematic Sandburg is drawn aloft toward legend--hardly an uncommon impulse when dealing with Lincoln--and the Spielberg who is tugged down by Kushners intricate screenplay toward documentary grit. You can never tell which of the two tendencies the visionary or the revisionist will come out on top. Thus on the one hand we have a John Williams score all plaintive piano solos and sobbing horns that could have been composed thirty years ago. In the same vein our first sight of Lincoln is from behind the radiance of his fame being too much to contemplate head on and we even get a foolish coda with our hero manifested like an angel through a flickering candle flame as if the film were unable to leave him be. On the other hand we get Tommy Lee Jones smacking his lips over slices of succulent speech ""We find the mephitic fumes of his oratory a lethal challenge to our pulmonaries"" he growls staring down the hapless Wood in the House. Then there is James Spader an actor too little used of late plucking a peach of a part--W. N. Bilbo one of a trio of enforcers hired by Seward to bully wavering House voters as the day of reckoning nears. Resplendent in whiskers and purple waistcoat Spader enjoys every minute haring to the White House mid-debate to beg a note from the President and greeting the great man as he pays a visit to the enforcers hideaway with the cheery words ""Well Ill be fucked"" Lincoln is undeterred. ""I wouldnt bet against it"" he replies with a knowing grin. It is in Day-Lewis needless to say that this tension between the high and the homespun coheres. One glance at his walk tells you what sort of fresh ground the performance intends to break. Not for him the long commanding stride that carried Henry Fonda through John Fords ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" but a singular shuffle half comic half sorrowful like that of a man hastening to catch up with a funeral procession and threatening at any instant to tip over and fall on his nose. The voice too is pitched a good octave above Fondas yet how swiftly we are lulled into its anecdotal ease. ""I heard tell once"" he begins and the roomful of listeners is hushed in expectation. In a way that is not far from Ford although he would not have countenanced the superb moment when Spielberg eager to crack the spell has Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) the Secretary of War peel away in exasperation as Lincoln halts a busy night--they are waiting for news by wire from the shelling outside Wilmington--to launch into yet another fondly polished tale. We can only imagine how Liam Neeson a gruffer presence who for a long while was Spielbergs choice of leading man would have fared as Lincoln; and I hope one day to see Viggo Mortensen whose bone structure has the right sad concavity impress himself on the role. What we derive from Day-Lewis though is the mysterious--and accurate--sense of a man who by instinct and by expertise reaches out to the people he leads while seeming lost in himself. Could that be why he buffs his own boots even when his valet is beside him? Some of his frowns like his conspiratorial smiles exist less in response to others than for the benefit of private rumination and the film has barely begun before he is quoting Hamlet on bad dreams in the midst of a chat with his wife Mary (Sally Field). Later there is a contretemps with his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who wishes to enlist. This flimsy subplot is beside the point--it could have been junked entirely--and yet when Lincoln discusses the matter with Mary the result is all the more distressing because the Presidents harshest quarrel is not with her but with his conscience and with his mortal thoughts. Just as the fracas over the Thirteenth Amendment has to carry the symbolic flag for Lincolns lifelong quest so the spectacle of one married couple raging over whether their child should fight and whether he might die crystallizes the fears of a generation. Through sickness infant fatality and military service these folk lived more closely with death than we can ever know. At the end of the scene Sally Field sinks beautifully to the ground the hooped skirt of her pale dress subsiding around her like a balloon. Here we feel is the authentic sigh of exhaustion emanating from a woman wracked not just by headaches but by the pressure of public performance--the unremitting demand imposed upon her husband for words and deeds. (To her reelection means ""four more years in this terrible house."" That may get a dry laugh in some quarters.) Many viewers may share her vexation for ""Lincoln"" is unapologetically packed with eloquence loud and soft. The Presidents speech to his Cabinet explaining why the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 may be insufficient comes embellished with cadenzas of legal nicety and lasts as long as an aria. But there is nothing inherently undramatic about a surge of talk; movies as different as ""His Girl Friday"" and ""My Night at Mauds"" exert the tightest of grips and a Lincoln film that paid inadequate heed to the forces of rhetoric would be like a porno film that stopped at the bedroom door. Nevertheless you can sense Spielbergs relief as the dialogue dwindles to a crisp minimum (""Wars nearly done. Aint that so?"" Lincoln asks) or when voices die down altogether and the glow of images takes hold. Hence the firelit sight of Tad handling photographs on frail glass plates of children much the same age as him though of another color with prices marked ""Two young boys. 700."" Hence too the shot of Lincoln--it should have been the closing shot of the movie--ambling down a hallway on what will be his last night out. The lofty stooping figure heads away from us with his back to the camera but he doesnt get any smaller as he goes. As Tolstoy said of Lincoln in 1908 ""We are still too near to his greatness."" Aint that so?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

The Great Emancipator rests like a humble Solomon upon a hard wooden chair surrounded by freely mixing black and white soldiers of that great war of his. One black soldier dares to speak of the injustice of being paid less than the white ones and then to demonstrate their understanding of the momentousness of their cause three of the battle-weary Union boys of 1865 recite back the words of the Gettysburg Address as if its already something their teachers demand they memorize.Warmly Lincoln dismisses the boys Hes a likable busy fellow the kind of president youd want to have a beer with. But then he ponders the words theyve parroted back at him and as his face hardens toward the profound determination that will power the rest of the film and his life hes all awash in the grainy high-beams favored by director of photography Janusz Kaminski hes heralded by a John Williams score thick and sappy enough to spread on flapjacks and hes framed by Spielberg like hes something fantastic and unknowable that we cant believe were glimpsing yet another of the directors impossible creatures something whipped up with Macs or a rogue strand of the 16th presidents DNA.Its just the kind of sentimental bombast that critics routinely assail from Hollywoods most profitable director. And its just the kind of thing that will stiffen the spine and open the tear ducts of millions of viewers possibly for generations to come. Amistad notwithstanding a new Spielberg history film is never just a movie Its future homework a multimedia addition to the Smithsonian a new official imaginative record. Even people who havent actually seen Saving Private Ryan know the gut-scraping crack-up of its D-Day and it might not be possible for mediated young folks to dream of Auschwitz in color. The staying power of these films--due as much to their artistic power as for their Time-cover 60 Minutes marketing--makes moments like Lincolns bathetic opening all the more sour for Spielbergs critics. Its easy to carp ""Is it now orthodox American belief that Lincoln sat around like Robin Williams in Hook thinking If those kids believe in me I just might too?""Like Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan Lincoln is for the most part served straight-up with little whimsy or pandering and with the directors lavish gifts--for bodies in motion for tension and release for clearly communicating multiple story beats in a single un-fussy shot--triumphing over any history-lesson stiffness. Lincoln even showcases gifts Spielberg has too rarely used Turns out hes awfully good with adults in rooms having long conversations which he hasnt much shown since the boys talk in Jaws. The film is as steeped in suspense as many of his adventure movies but here its never the threat of violence working your nerves at least not until the end when Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln set out to be patrons of the arts. And the economy and clarity with which Spielberg establishes the competing interests in the films protracted political wrangling has no precedent in his filmography Recall the yards of exposition that wrapped up Minority Report or the rushed inscrutability of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Shitty Whatzit. Lincoln is the work of a different director one truly fascinated by why his subjects do what they do one who invests each moment with the artistry he has often reserved for setpieces.Despite that scrupulousness when staring into a subject this grand he sometimes blinks. This is not new. He had the grown-up Private Ryan bawling at Normandy asking to be assured that his life was worth the sacrifice of the men who died for it. He had reserved Oskar Schindler working up into a fit over his failure to have been even more heroic. In perhaps his most ridiculed scene save The Lost Worlds raptor-vanquishing gymnastics he had Mossad agent Avner of Munich Hulking out as he pumps away at his wife intercut with a garishly brutal re-enactment of the murder of the 1972 Israeli weight-lifting team demonstrating that a normal sex and home life should be impossible considering this worlds preponderance of terror.In these moments as in the opening of Lincoln the great care of Spielberg the artist seems overruled by the anxieties of Spielberg the man the good-hearted liberal tug by that American guilt that we live too insulated from the worlds true horrors; the boomer who wishes his generation had done a better job stopping those horrors; the celebrity considered childish for too often having mined those horrors for popular fantasies. In their strained and urgent pushiness they resemble nothing so much as Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters insisting that his mashed potatoes mean something--he just cant show us quite what.The life of Lincoln aint mashed potatoes so you might find that opening unwelcome. Dismaying even--evidence that even after all these years this most accomplished of filmmakers doesnt trust that well be moved by mere storytelling. More charitably they can be said to evince a courageousness not often attributed to Spielberg. Here is an artist capable of fully immersing us in the epochal moments that shaped us as a people yet also eager to lay bare his fear of us as a people not measuring up to those moments. Worrying over this he lunges at complex--even existential--anxieties impossible for him to storyboard.Even his homely radiant Lincoln has his moment of doubt. Hearing his own address coming as something like prayer from the mouths of soldiers who soon might die he is stricken How could a mortal ever live up to those words and their promise?Like Spielberg this Lincoln blinks. And then like Spielberg he sucks it up and gets on with his mighty business.

"Lincoln directed by Steven Spielberg starring Daniel Day-Lewis reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lincoln Daniel Day-Lewis Performance Is Astonishing Lincoln Daniel Day-Lewis Performance Is Astonishing Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 9 2012 729 PM Lincoln The legislative process has never been this dramatic--or this fun. By Dana Stevens Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln Photo by David James - (c) 2012 - DreamWorks II Distribution Co. All Rights Reserved. Lincoln feels like a movie Steven Spielberg has always been fated to make. Of course these two figures were bound to collide at some point the most mythic of American presidents and the most myth-making of American  filmmakers. The values Abraham Lincoln has come to represent in the collective imagination--freedom equality justice mercy--are the same values Spielberg has spent a career celebrating and not infrequently sentimentalizing. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Lincoln does sometimes get a little sappy around the edges. Though his project here is clearly one of conscious self-restraint Spielberg cant resist the occasional opportunity for patriotic tear-jerking usually signaled by a swell of John Williams symphonic score. But in between there are long stretches that are as quiet contemplative and austere as anything Spielberg has ever done. In large part this quality of austerity derives from the fact that Abraham Lincoln is played by Daniel Day-Lewis an actor who is to other actors as Nijinsky was to other dancers of his time He seems to be engaging in a different art form entirely. Day-Lewis embodiment of Lincoln is less a portrait than a sculpture. You can walk around it and see different things from different angles. The character is so fully imagined so lived from the inside out that we leave feeling weve met and briefly known if not Lincoln himself certainly someone real and extraordinary. This isnt a Hollywood-style historical epic like War Horse or Amistad--its history on an intimate domestic scale Lincoln wandering the halls of the White House wrapped in an old wool blanket. Advertisement Lincoln does begin on a grand scale with a horrific mercifully short depiction of the realities of Civil War-era battle (a swarm of confused frightened men hacking at one another with bayonets and drowning each other in puddles). Immediately after we witness the 16th president at the front greeting two pairs of war-weary Union soldiers one black one white. The on-the-nose parallelism of this scene--and the unlikelihood that two separate soldiers would have independently memorized the Gettysburg address and have the presence of mind to quote it in full back to its author after a brutal battle--gets the film off to an unpromising start. Is this going to be a stiffly inspirational civics diorama? Blessedly we soon move into the main storyline which focuses very tightly on the last few months of Lincolns life as he struggled both to end the Civil War and to pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. The script by Angels in America playwright Tony Kushner draws heavily (though not exclusively) on Doris Kearns Goodwins best-selling book Team of Rivals which is about Lincolns clashes with his Cabinet over how to accomplish these two seemingly complementary but in reality conflicting goals. Would it be better for the Union to negotiate an end to the war first or to use the promise of peace as leverage to get the amendment passed? Is Lincolns primary moral duty as a leader to end the soldiers suffering with all possible speed or to ensure that the abolition of slavery is permanently written into the Constitution? The moral legal and political questions raised by Lincolns Scylla/Charybdis dilemma are the meat of the story here--and if that means most of Lincolns moments of high suspense occur in offices and legislative chambers well Kushner is writer enough and Spielberg director enough to turn vote-wrangling and strategic political chicanery into both wry comedy and high drama. Advised by Secretary of State William Seward (a superb David Strathairn) who despairs of his bosss habit of first seeking then ignoring his advice Lincoln tries everything to get a two-thirds majority vote from personally strong-arming reluctant legislators to hiring a team of Falstaffian secret operatives (James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) to offer patronage jobs in exchange for votes. The vision of Lincoln as a world-class horse-trader capable of deploying slippery lawyers tricks in the service of lofty goals animates many of the movies sharpest and funniest scenes. And though Day-Lewis Lincoln is a surpassingly gentle soft-spoken man given to long homespun anecdotes and bone-dry witticisms there are scenes in which Lincoln more than justifies his reputation among many of his contemporaries as a steel-willed autocrat seeking to usurp the powers of the legislative branch. In its second half the film focuses increasingly on Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) a Pennsylvania congressman whos spent his life battling for full racial equality. Stevens opposition to the amendment on the grounds that it doesnt go far enough endangers its passage and he and his fellow lawmakers square off repeatedly over the meaning and necessity of political compromise. Decked out in a curled black wig and limping on a cane hurling poetic invective at his opponents (""Slavery is the only insult to natural law you fatuous nincompoop"") Jones gives a magnificent performance that should have his best supporting actor nomination in the bag. The climactic voting scene in the House chamber is a rowdy melange of low comedy high drama and suspense--though we know of course that the amendment will pass in the end Spielberg and Kushner have so ably orchestrated the stories of multiple sought-after votes that each ""Aye"" or ""Nay"" plays out like a miniature cliffhanger. The movies depiction of its presidents enigmatic domestic life is only intermittently successful. There are some blisteringly honest scenes between Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) his depressed resentful but politically savvy wife. The portrait of the Lincolns marriage is remarkably complex especially in the scenes where she rebukes him for insufficiently mourning their dead son. We see how her bottomless neediness and his core of emotional reserve made for a toxic combination but we also sense their deep love for each other. I never quite believed in the storyline about Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the Lincolns oldest son Robert who insists on enlisting in the Army against his parents wishes--their Oedipal squabbles seemed familiar from too many other lesser movies. But the tender lively relationship between Lincoln and his adored youngest son Tad (Gulliver McGrath) runs through the movie like an animating spark with the boy racing through Cabinet meetings to leap on his ever-tolerant fathers lap. An early quiet scene in which Lincoln finds his child sleeping by the fireside lies full-length next to him and kisses him was the movies ""had me at hello"" moment for me--from that point I could tabulate its flaws as it went along while still loving every minute of it. Well all but the last few minutes in which we see not quite Lincolns assassination but a related event taking place at the same time. I admire Spielbergs choice to conclude on a note of indirection and discretion Ending on a tableaux vivant of the well-known facts of that night at Fords Theatre might have been both dramatically inert and crass. But I think the film should have ended even earlier on a long shot (beautifully framed by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) of the lanky stooped president walking alone down a hall of the White House on the way to take his wife to the theater on April 14 1865 five days after ending the bloodiest war in the nations history. We all know what happened next--and given how much we love this man we feel weve come to know its sad enough just thinking about it.

The first is the Gettysburg Address repeated back to the president from memory by a pair of battle-muddied Union soldiers one white and one black. The latter is the Second Inaugural shown in a brief flashback following Lincolns assassination which occurred little more than a month after the speech was given.At its core Lincoln is a film about the arts of suasion--one that encompasses oratory and extortion conciliation and conspiracy arms twisted and cheeks turned. It is a film in short about politics. Adapted by Tony Kushner from portions of Doris Kearns Goodwins 2005 biography Team of Rivals the movie portrays Lincolns deft maneuvering in the early weeks of 1865 as he sought to balance the competing goals of ending the Civil War and achieving passage of the 13th Amendment which led to the abolition of slavery. Within his own Republican party the president (Daniel Day-Lewis) delicately balances radicals against conservatives even as his surrogates cherry-pick Democrats precious vote by precious vote by nearly-as-precious abstention with alternating rounds of ingratiation bullying and outright bribery. Lincoln is a film about the arts of suasion--one that encompasses oratory and extortion arms twisted and cheeks turned. It is a film in short about politics.Though the film starts a bit slowly with hefty doses of introduction and exposition it gradually attains velocity depicting politics not merely as the binary struggle between opposing forces to which we have become all too accustomed (though there are elements of this characterization as well) but as a three-dimensional puzzle to be solved. There are a handful of occasions when Spielberg lays the uplift on a bit thick John Williamss score swelling like a bladder but for the most part the movie is lively and full of wit. The deep and varied cast--David Strathairn Hal Holbrook James Spader John Hawkes Jackie Earle Haley Tim Blake Nelson Jared Harris and many others--depict a compelling universe of political personalities orbiting the president. And if Tommy Lee Jones playing Rep. Thaddeus Stevens always comes across rather more as Tommy Lee Jones than as the iconic abolitionist--well there are worse things.Lincoln fares less well when it turn its focus to the presidents private life in particular wife Marys continuing grief over the premature death of their son Willie and both parents resistance to the entreaties by their eldest son Robert that he be allowed to enlist. The humanizing purpose of these scenes is apparent enough but here Day-Lewis is let down by his co-stars. As Robert Joseph Gordon-Levitt is forgettable his role considerably smaller than his billing might lead one to believe. The casting of Sally Field as Mary is more problematic. Like Jones she is too recognizably herself; but where the script furnishes the former with countless opportunities to deploy his mordant wit Fields relatively thankless role offers few compensations for her failure of mimesis. Contemplating historys judgment late in the film Mary laments to her husband ""All anyone will remember is that I was crazy and I ruined your happiness."" Despite the screen time afforded her the film offers little to enrich or complicate this verdict. Related Story Great Emancipator or Creepy Slob? Historic Portrayals of Abraham Lincoln Which brings us at last to Day-Lewis. In past great performances--as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood for instance or Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York--Day-Lewis created figures of such simmering ferocity that they threatened to burn a hole in the screen. Here by contrast he wisely opts for understatement receding gently into his characterization. Lincoln after all is already larger than life. The trick lies in bringing him down to a comprehensible size. In Day-Lewiss hands the Great Emancipator is alternatingly droll and melancholy sure of his arguments yet eager to engage with others part self-taught intellectual and part tricky lawyer. (""It isnt our Southern states that are in rebellion"" he explains amiably at one point ""but only the rebels in our Southern states."") Most of all he is an inveterate aphorist ever eager to illustrate his points by spinning tales--most of them presumably tall. (Among them he shares the funniest scatological joke about George Washington I expect ever to hear.) Day-Lewiss metamorphosis is at times uncanny His chin underslung beneath its curtain beard his spare frame slightly stooped his voice a tad higher than we are accustomed to hearing it with an accent demonstrably but not excessively Midwestern. The first two films in which I saw Day-Lewis were My Beautiful Laundrette and A Room with a View back in the mid-80s and I remember marveling that the same actor could vanish so utterly into roles so very different. Likewise his performance in Spielbergs film is so persuasive that praise for it almost feels like praise for Lincoln himself. And its hard to imagine higher praise than that.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 9 2012 Save for later Saved Daniel Day-Lewis (center) portrays president Abraham Lincoln as he struggles to abolish slavery. David James/Dreamworks/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" written by Tony Kushner attempts to memorialize our 16th president without turning him into a statue. This is a tricky business. Too much reverence and you end up with waxworks. Too little and you get ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.""To Spielbergs credit he doesnt go the great-moments-in-history route at least not altogether. Although I wish ""Lincoln"" were considerably more daring both as a piece of filmmaking and as an evocation of history it does a creditable job of delineating the horse-trading and backroom shenanigans behind one of the most momentous of all American political passages.The movie focuses on the four months at the end of the Civil War when Lincoln was determined to pass the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery. It ends with the wars conclusion and Lincolns assassination days later. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time By telescoping Lincolns life so drastically Spielberg and Kushner are trying to make these singular events emblematic of the man. We are supposed to see all of Lincoln in those four supremely trying months. And certainly we can register the imprint of the ordeal on the president through Daniel Day-Lewiss portrayal. (He resembles the wartime Lincoln of Mathew Bradys photographs.) Lincoln remarks at one point that being president has aged him 10 years and hes being charitable. The 50 best movies of all time Video Lincoln trailer Monitor Movie Guide But Day-Lewis is far too wily an actor to simply give us a stooped woebegone Lincoln and leave it at that. He employs a high wavering voice (apparently historically authentic) as a subtle wheedling instrument. Lincolns Shakespeare-quoting country lawyer act often involving the spinning of folksy yarns to the eye-rolling exasperation of his listeners is an artful guise. He is fully capable of rage but he parcels it out opportunely when no other option will do. Lincolns complicated attitudes toward slavery and the emancipation of blacks are streamlined and cleaned up for popular consumption (as opposed to say their treatment in Gore Vidals controversial novel ""Lincoln"") but there is one scene near the end that Im glad made it into the movie Asked by Marys dressmaker Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben) whether he accepts blacks as equals he equivocates by saying he does not know her or her people but that since like everybody else they are ""bare forked animals"" (a reference to ""King Lear"") he will get used to them. This tarnish to his halo has a welcome sheen. It desanctifies him.Day-Lewiss Lincoln is the spiritual center of the film but hes ringed by a multitudinous cast of characters including David Strathairn as trusted Secretary of State William Seward; Sally Field as ramrod-tough clinically depressed first lady Mary Todd; and most scene-stealingly Tommy Lee Jones as the incendiary imperially grumpy abolitionist Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens.Whenever Jones is on screen the films energy level kicks up several notches an indication I think that Spielberg otherwise overdoses on directorial decorum. Without any obvious opportunities for cinematic pyrotechnics - the scenes of battle and mayhem are few - he goes in for a studied golden-age-of-Hollywood approach. We see lots of talking heads in well-appointed halls and gloomy chambers. The camerawork is relatively stationary. (""Amistad"" which also suffered from stasis had more movement.) Spielberg is so determined not to goose this narrative about the fate of human dignity that he damps down his best strength his ability to make history seem contemporaneous through the sheer verve of storytelling.Part of the problem of course is all these famous actors strutting around in wigs and beards and bonnets. But that might not have been an impediment if the characters were brought more vividly more rudely to life.The marital rift scenes between Lincoln and Mary reach for gravitas but too often they have the effect of making Lincoln seem more henpecked than hounded. Only in Joness performance do we glimpse what this movie might have been - a deadly serious burlesque about matters of great moment.Spielbergs films have often if indirectly been about the consequences of absent fathers on a family. There are times in ""Lincoln"" when our not-always-entirely honest Abe is in a sense absent to himself. In some of the films most mysteriously moving sequences he appears while in mixed company to suddenly waft into some dark and private precinct. When Spielberg allows these silences - when for example he simply shows Lincoln slowly sauntering away from us down an unpeopled corridor - the film achieves a spooky eminence. Suddenly it becomes more than a history lesson however well crafted and researched. It becomes a meditation on the unknowability of great men of all men.

Dreamworks ""Lincoln"" is a serious movie and it knows it. And director Steven Spielberg wants you to know it too. It begins with just its title and then a long slow camera movement to reveal the man himself visiting a Civil War battlefield. A quartet of soldiers stand before him quoting the Gettysburg Address most of which theyve learned by heart. Later we will have title cards introducing important figures sunlight slanting through dusty air John Williams reliably intrusive music telling us how to feel and many -- far too many -- scenes of men in chin whiskers sitting around debating points of law. So if youve been sitting around wondering ""Gee when is Spielberg ever going to make another Amistad? "" heres your answer. ""Lincoln"" has several great things going for it. Screenwriter Tony Kushner has certainly unsurprisingly done his research (although some of it still sticks out awkwardly in the dialogue). And it has a number of lively (and truly lived-in) performances. A surprisingly corpulent James Spader for example is excellent as an arm-twisting political fixer (and provides some leavening moments of humor). And as the fierce complex Mary Todd Lincoln Sally Field creates an indelible portrait of a passionate demanding and often misunderstood woman. And then theres Lincoln himself. That Daniel Day-Lewis is terrific is well something we almost take for granted these days. Its not just that hes physically transformed himself into the gangly rail-splitter (even his fingers seem longer bonier) its that he emotionally changes into the man as well. You can watch the worries and wonders play out on his face and in his eyes; you can hear the irony in his reedy rangy voice as he answers a serious question with another one of his colorful stories amusing the crowd around him but also buying himself some time to think. But all those performances are stranded in the middle of a movie that seems determined to be dull. Its to Kushners and Spielbergs credit that they didnt merely reheat old material. But this is a movie about Abraham Lincoln that focuses only on the last four months of his life and stays pretty much rooted in Washington and his Cabinet meetings. Theres one startling savage battle -- more brawl than warfare -- but its over quickly within the movies first few minutes (and we never return to the conflict). The presidents historic speeches are mostly avoided too. Even the assassination happens offscreen. Instead the movie takes as its main interest the passage of the 13th Amendment which outlawed slavery and as its theme how ignoble means (patronage bribes outright threats) are sometimes needed to accomplish worthy ends. This is certainly interesting material historically. Politically too -- the movie feels like an expensive personal plea from Spielberg to President Obama to start fighting dirty and playing for keeps. But it fails to engage dramatically. It never truly explains why Lincolns Cabinet is at odds convinces us why this fight has to be waged and won even before the war is over or makes the political double-dealers as interesting as the boys in blue or gray. And it reneges a little on the promise of the title whose straightforward simplicity suggests a story that gets back far enough to see the entire man instead of rushing close to focus on one part. Of course Day-Lewis crams as much of the man into these four months of his life as he can. And one of his scenes with Field -- in which her worries about her family run full-tilt into his anguish over her high-strung emotionalism -- is filled with all the searing pain that only lovers can turn on each other. But for a man so funny so vital so literally larger than life ""Lincoln"" remains a Daguerreotype -- careful quiet and dully framed. Ratings note The film contains graphic battlefield violence.

"Lincoln review A more Honest Abe | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLincoln review A more Honest AbeSteven Spielbergs Lincoln serves history better than it does the multiplex and thats a brave and worthy achievement.Daniel Day-Lewis centre is a cinch for an Oscar nomination for his vivid portrayal of the 16th U.S. president in Lincoln.  (David James / DreamWorks)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 8 2012Lincoln(out of 4)Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Tommy Lee Jones Sally Field David Strathairn Hal Holbrook and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Directed by Steven Spielberg. 150 minutes. Now playing at Varsity Cinemas additional theatres Nov. 16. PGSteven Spielbergs Lincoln serves history better than it does the multiplex and thats a brave and worthy thing in a time of slippery truths and splintered attention spans.Neither the title-implied biopic of the 16th U.S. president nor a typical ""Spielbergian"" assault on the senses and tear ducts the film eschews the foreground in favour of the background possibly to its box-office detriment.Article Continued BelowLincoln mines rich drama in the hard politicking and outright vote-buying behind passage of the slavery-abolishing 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1865 a feat that Lincoln his fellow Republicans and supportive Democrats riskily accomplished while at the same time brokering an end to the countrys bloody Civil War.Few grand scenes of battle or high emotion play before the unsentimental lens of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski a departure from the style Spielberg is known for and which he amply demonstrated just a year ago in War Horse.An early moment sets the tone instead of a flashback of Lincoln delivering the famed Gettysburg Address of 1863 Spielberg chooses to have the president listen quietly as two pairs of war-weary soldiers one black and the other white quote brief sections of it to him from memory.Nor do we see much of the ""Honest Abe"" of storybook legend the man whose towering physical stature immense intellect unimpeachable integrity and golden tongue combined to drag America out of the darkness of slavery and into the light of its own founding beliefs of human equality.Daniel Day-Lewiss vivid portrayal of Lincoln is instead grounded on the complex humanity of the man one forced by circumstances to deal not only with epochal national concerns but also pressing family ones.His strong resemblance to the president could have made this an easy assignment for Day-Lewis but that would run counter to everything we know about this utterly devoted actor. Hes a cinch for a Best Actor nomination at the coming Oscars (which would be his fifth with two wins to date) but hes not inclined to curry favour either with audiences or Academy voters.His Lincoln is grey of hair and beard walks with a slight stoop and speaks in a higher register than our minds ear may wish to hear. Hes capable of thunder -- we see glimpses -- but he frequently comes across as timorous in his dealings not only with political foes and allies but also with his high-strung wife Mary (Sally Field impressive) and headstrong son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).This portrait of Lincoln which scripter Tony Kushner (TVs Angels in America Spielbergs Munich) loosely adapts from Doris Kearns Goodwins non-fiction bestseller Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln finds its focus in the marrying of high principles with low politics.This Lincoln is strong enough to push his anti-slavery amendment through a bitterly divided House of Representatives despite warnings from his wife his Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) and Republican Party patriarch Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) that hes risking his ample political capital and a Civil War solution by doing so.Parallels with Barack Obamas ""Obamacare"" battles are unmistakable but not overdone.This Lincoln is pragmatic enough to make the ""Honest Abe"" label seem hilariously overstated. He allows three bumptious Republican bagmen (played with Shakespearean wit by James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) to buy amendment votes with promises of golden appointments. He brings a lawyers skillful bluffs to his dealings with Pennsylvania Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) a voluble abolitionist and financial scold and with Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris) a military leader whose Civil War endgame is fraught with danger.This Lincoln is also gentle enough to spend quality time with his young son to bore people with his endless morality yarns (he even quotes the mathematician Euclid) and to bemoan his lack of genuine human contact ""Im very keenly aware of my very aloneness.""All of these visions of Abraham Lincoln are brought together in Day-Lewiss singular performance and if the combination sometimes seems lacking in high drama -- Spielberg has trained us all to expect it like Pavlovs dogs -- it never wants for the ring of historical accuracy.Spielbergs restraint and that of composer John Williams extends even to the assassination of Lincoln all part of the early months of 1865 that defined the still-young American nation. The event is depicted mainly off camera.Lincoln and its creators instead find inspiration in showing a fractious country and world that the American Revolution is forever a work in progress one best judged by the wisdom of time and not by the noise of the moment.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

And yet Spielberg is enough of a showman to prevent ""Lincoln"" from seeming merely good for you like spinach. History is made by people not by figureheads carved in stone and even if ""Lincoln"" sometimes belabors its points theres still plenty of oxygen in its atmosphere Its characters people who lived long ago and who tended to be much more loquacious than a 140-character burst would allow somehow seem to breathe the same air we do. Set in 1865 -- and adapted by Tony Kushner from portions of Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Lincoln -- the picture is a condensed yet detailed account of our 16th presidents push to pass the 13th Amendment and it holds surprising doses of cinematic drama in its expansive pockets. The picture opens with a rugged muddy battle sequence whose eerie placidity only makes it seem more brutal - its a case of black Union soldiers squaring off against Confederates who have a thousand reasons to resent them and the outcome is ugly for everybody. Shortly thereafter two young black Union soldiers stand respectfully before a shadowy figure giving him the thumbnail version of their experience of the war and intimating some of their hopes for the future. Its a screenwriters moment a too-polished precis. But Spielberg turns the heat up pretty quickly as the camera drifts toward the face of the man theyre so enthralled to meet Its Daniel Day-Lewis looking as if hed just stepped off the front of a five-dollar bill and the face hes wearing is that of a listener - and thats the first though hardly the last significant human touch in ""Lincoln."" Everyone knows Lincoln was a great orator (and we see that here too). But who ever thinks of him - or would know how to portray him - as a great listener? Day-Lewis is a marvelous actor when he doesnt succumb -- as he did in ""There Will Be Blood"" -- to hyper-actorly mannerisms and here he plays a man of infinite tenderness and almost unplumbable melancholy. One of the movies running gags - its almost as pronounced as a ""Saturday Night Live"" routine - is Lincolns habit of spinning out corny yarns that always come with a potent metaphor attached. Day-Lewis plays those moments for laughs knowing it seems that great men are usually the last ones to be in on their own joke. Yet his finest scenes may be the ones he plays with Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln Fields is one of those rare actresses who has allowed herself to grow into the face she was meant to have (though here she looks much younger than her actual 67 years) and she and Day-Lewis play out the kind of behind-closed-doors intimacy that may very well come along with all the stress and worry of inhabiting the White House. But most significantly - as the title of Goodwins book spells out -- Lincoln was politically speaking intensely shrewd. Thats where the chief drama of ""Lincoln"" kicks in although oddly enough many of the pictures most striking moments dont even require the presence of its title character. Day-Lewis gives a fine lead performance but its really the ensemble that makes the movie particularly in the nuanced contentious scenes in which the House of Representatives duke it out over the slavery issue. This was a time remember when the term ""Radical Republicans"" didnt mean wily ruthless Tea Partiers It was these radicals who pushed for an end to slavery. In their eyes Lincoln who was sensible about the political as well as moral reasons for ending slavery was too much of a moderate. Spielberg and Kushner work hard to keep the complicated political threadlines clear. They even manage to work in some laughs courtesy of three rapscallion lobbyists - played by John Hawkes Tim Blake Nelson and most wonderful of all a pudgy mustachioed James Spader - who are dispatched by Lincolns Secretary of State William Seward (a buttoned-up watchful David Strathairn) to change the minds of the balky Democrats. There are lots of villains here (including Jackie Earle Haleys lizardy Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens) but even more heroes (among them Jared Harris suitably sozzled-looking Ulysses S. Grant). ""Lincoln"" as shot by Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski has a burnished gaslit look Its a handsome figure of a film. But its truest triumph may lie in the casting of Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens the Radical Republican - and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee - who led the charge against slavery. Jones Stevens is a thundercloud with a sturdy moral sense and very bad hair; he even makes a pointed reference to his clumsy wig asserting that he looks worse without it. That sets the stage for the pictures most deeply moving moment (which also features S. Epatha Merkeson in a small but potent role)  a scene that cuts a window into the way some powerful cranky men allow themselves vulnerability only behind closed doors. Joness performance is a wonder. Even those heavy under-eye pouches the most recognizable TLJ trademark have a purpose here They carry whatever his eyes alone arent able to say. Abraham Lincoln may be Lincolns reason for being. But Jones Thaddeus Stevens is its reason to care.

Through that strange mix of realism artifice intimacy and scope that cinema uniquely possesses viewers find themselves transported to 19th-century Washington where Abraham Lincoln -- portrayed in a surpassingly sympathetic performance by Daniel Day-Lewis -- has just been reelected to a second term. But instead of a grand tableau vivant that lays out the great man and his great deeds like so many too-perfect pieces of waxed fruit Spielberg brings the leader and viewers down to ground level. Released from the plinth of the usual monumentality and worshipful adoration in which hes so often trapped Lincoln has been liberated -- the better to joke grieve spin yarns brood and work his considerable wits and wiles in the service of political sausage-making at its spiciest and most untidy. Thus ""Lincoln"" gratifyingly dodges the kind of safe starchy hagiography that some Spielberg skeptics feared. Rather the filmmaker who has brought Auschwitz and the besieged beaches at Normandy to life with such rigor and detail proves yet again that he is the best filmmaker currently engaging in the form of assiduous research and creative interpretation known as historical drama. Working from a dense lively screenplay by playwright Tony Kushner (who last collaborated with Spielberg on ""Munich"") Spielberg infuses ""Lincoln"" with energy acumen surprising humor and the unabashed affection for his subject that most Americans will wholly understand and probably share. Coming on the heels of this weeks election he also has given us a bracing dose of well-timed political escapism For a couple of hours at least Rs and Ds alike can get the shrewd sensitive fearless morally self-aware president theyve been craving. That Lincoln emerges with such endearing freshness and vigor has a lot to do with Day-Lewiss performance in which his characters lanky world-weariness comes through with each expressive glance. Much has been made of the high reedy rasp with which he delivers Lincolns endless supply of anecdotes quotations jokes and extemporanea. Although most historical descriptions of Lincolns voice -- including Doris Kearns Goodwins in ""Team of Rivals"" on which ""Lincoln"" is partially based -- use the words ""high"" and ""clear"" Day-Lewis seems to have focused more on the former than the latter. But Day-Lewiss voice soon becomes folded in with the myriad ways he so fully inhabits Lincoln as the man in full a wartime president haunted by hundreds of thousands of casualties desperate to bring an end to the carnage; the grieving father of a son who died two years earlier; the confounded husband of a woman prone to erratic mood swings. Sally Field plays Lincolns wife Mary Todd; although shes a decade Day-Lewiss senior they play younger and older than their years so successfully that they wind up meeting in the middle as a couple who visibly wear the toll the past four years have taken on their and the nations lives. Mostly though Day-Lewis introduces audiences to Lincoln the politician -- the canny even ruthless operator. As ""Lincoln"" opens he is deciding whether to introduce the 13th Amendment to the Constitution -- permanently abolishing slavery -- in January 1865 or to wait until a far friendlier Republican-majority House is installed. Its the fascinating world of horse-trading truth-shaving ""shady work"" and back channels that ""Lincoln"" brings to life most exhilaratingly as the president bargains and sometimes bare-knuckles his way to getting what he wants. Viewers expecting Spielberg to give them back their most revered secular saint may be surprised -- delightedly so -- to discover that he hasnt made the American version of ""Gandhi"" but the 19th-century version of ""Advise and Consent."" Audiences know the ultimate outcome of ""Lincoln"" (both the disposition of the 13th Amendment and Lincolns tragic end which is gratuitously spelled out in one of the films few over-sentimental moments). But the movie still exerts a riveting grip on attention and imagination. Kushner and Spielberg work in near-perfect harness to keep what is essentially a series of set pieces of men talking galloping at a brisk always absorbing clip. What makes ""Lincoln"" even more enjoyable is the cast of colorful foils for the title characters noble quest a gallery of rogues roues and rapscallions who bring Lincolns finer qualities into sharp relief while humanizing him as one of their own (albeit at their idealized best). So audiences dont just get the pleasure of having spent a couple of hours in the near-palpable presence of Lincoln as he warmly chats up constituents and Cabinet members (some of whom can be seen rolling their eyes when they sense another story coming on). They also get to meet the radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens played by Tommy Lee Jones with fulminating high spirits and scenery-chomping zest; Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) one of Goodwins rivals who ended up being a crucial part of Lincolns brain trust; Ulysses S. Grant impeccably played by Jared Harris in brief but poignant scenes of mutual regard and regret; and the scene-stealers of the piece Bilbo Latham and Schell (James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) who as vaguely disreputable operatives enlisted to procure ""yes"" votes hilariously skulk and smarm their way through ""Lincoln"" like a trio of Shakespearean fools (Rosencrantz Guilderstern and Abramoff anyone?). ""Its not illegal to bribe congressmen"" Latham notes. ""Theyll starve otherwise."" Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" is spiked with so many uncanny present-day echoes -- from partisan gridlock and casual corruption to non-denial denials and the unspoken (and unspeakable) prospect of a black man occupying the White House -- that even viewers who dont consider themselves history buffs will find it rousing provocative and utterly relevant. As vividly as Spielberg brings Lincoln and his material culture to life hes just as valuably made a celebration of the political process at the precise moment when we may need it most. Lincoln the man and ""Lincoln"" the movie serve to remind us that democracy and the leadership it demands arent always pretty. But they can be beautiful. Contains an intense scene of war violence some images of carnage and brief strong language.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 09 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Nov. 08 2012 150PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Steven Spielberg Written by Tony Kushner Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Tommy Lee Jones Sally Field Classification PG Genre biopic Lincoln is directed by Steven Spielberg but to his great credit few will mistake this for a Steven Spielberg film. Rather its a Tony Kushner film the playwright who conjured up the wordy but intricately layered script; and its a Daniel Day-Lewis film the actor who so richly embodies the iconic title role. With a few exceptions Spielberg reins in his kinetic flair stays his sentimental impulses and mutes his methods to match the material. Which is? A dramatized political essay essentially and although the Civil War is still spilling copious blood the picture mainly confines its focus to what politicians do. Yes this is a movie about people talking in rooms. And the talk at its best fascinates. Screen grab from the trailer for ""Lincoln"" Movies Lincoln The official trailer Sally Field attends the world premiere of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" at the Regency Village Theatre on Thursday June 28 2012 in Los Angeles Inivision/AP video Video Sally Field fought ageism to win coveted Lincoln role Unfortunately those few exceptions frame the movie. The opening sequence a bayonet slaughter punctuated by a black soldier reciting the Gettysburg Address to his patiently listening President does not augur well. Neither does the near-concluding scene a gimmicky twist on assassination night at the theatre. But most everything in between about 21/2 hours worth sees the narrative settle down smartly to its appointed and narrowly defined task capturing the events in January of 1865 that led to the passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. Like the war itself that political battle was fought on multiple fronts and again like the war it reflected the multiple facets of the commander-in-chiefs nature - his better angels to be sure but his worse too. This then is where Kushner and Day-Lewis shine.Lets start with the playwright who has fashioned the screenplay as a series of intense conversations - Lincoln with a pair of Northern petitioners; with his former rival and now Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn); with his cabinet at large; with Thaddeus Stevens the ferociously cranky abolitionist (Tommy Lee Jones); with his haranguing and sharp-tongued wife Mary (Sally Field); with a trio of lobbyists assigned to buy Democratic votes in the House; with Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) packed off secretly to negotiate with the secessionists; and not least with his soliloquizing self. In lesser hands all this chatter would have played like clumsy exposition but Kushner has a subtle touch. So amid the constant exchange of words often subdued sometimes fierce the complexity of the politics arises organically and rare in film with the nuance undamaged.That nuance is crucial because the central tension here is between two equally valuable pursuits that circumstance has rendered for the moment mutually exclusive ending the war before the ""spring slaughter"" and passing the amendment before a riven Congress. Conclude the war too quickly and the political will for the amendment will dissipate. However pass the amendment and it may fuel the Souths resolve to continue the war. Stop the killing or free the slaves peace now or justice now - each is an absolute good and each is an extremely thorny hugely pragmatic issue that begs for relative compromise. Neatly then the cliches of politics compete with the urgings of conscience the ""art of the possible"" with ""by any means necessary."" Clearly that struggle resonates through the years right into todays White House.On to Day-Lewiss work which proves to be another exemplary balancing act. Thanks to him the political essay is grounded in a character study just as nuanced. With that famously weathered face and a tall mans stooped gait his Lincoln is a man of many parts - a keen legal mind that delights in its Byzantine twists; an aggrieved husband; a compassionate father; a cold prosecutor of the war; a sensitive pardoner of deserters; a melancholic curt and silent; a humorist gregarious spinner of windy anecdotes. This latter knack lightens the film with surprising bursts of comedy but its Day-Lewiss ability to juggle all these conflicting facets that keeps us riveted to him. In such a large ensemble cast there are performances arresting (from Jones) and questionable (from Field). However at the still centre Day-Lewis is a marvel of quiet containment and a walking-talking paradox solid steel tempered with gentleness sad even when happy measured in anger and triumph alike.As for Spielberg despite that ill-advised beginning and a few lurches from bright comedy into laboured farce he wisely hides behind the script contenting himself with tableaux of speckled light refracted through dusty windows. His best kinetic flourish is his most restrained a tracking shot of a wheelbarrow on a daily journey from hospital ward to adjoining grounds where its heavy load - a tangled mass of amputated limbs - is unceremoniously dumped.Appropriately though its Lincoln we keep returning to with rapt attention no more so than when on the eve of the amendments passage he pauses to address his households black seamstress and from his imperious height speaks with an unvarnished honesty stripped free of any sentimentality ""You have a right to expect what I expect.... But what will become of you I do not know."" Mere months later over his shot and prostrate body that question lingers. Centuries later from the Jim Crow laws to the Civil Rights Act from the Harlem renaissance to the New Orleans disaster from George Wallace to Barack Obama it lingers still.

Starring Daniel Day-Lewis David Straitharn Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 120 minutes.) Its the voice. The voice is everything. History tells us that Abraham Lincoln had a high voice sometimes described as a silver trumpet sometimes described as piping but notably high enough to be mentioned. And yet the Lincoln of legend the Lincoln of movies has been either deep-voiced or Henry Fonda (who was in his own vocal category). Lincoln has been an oracle and now in Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis he is a man. The voice takes Lincoln down from his memorial and transforms him from a timeless sage back into the product of particular time and place the mid-19th century the American frontier. Suddenly we see the small-town tale spinner the backwoods politician someone who might easily be underestimated. He seems ungainly - not quaintly awkward but raw and slightly foreign to modern eyes. So that when were reminded that he is in fact a political and moral genius truly one of the great visionaries of history its almost a surprise. Lets just say it The experience of watching Daniel Day-Lewis in this role is nothing less than thrilling. This is Lincoln. No need for a time machine there he is. There are entire stretches in ""Lincoln"" especially in the Cabinet scenes as you hear the complexity of his legal and strategic thinking that you might very well forget youre seeing acting - even forget youre in a movie theater - and instead believe that youre sitting in a room with the 16th president. To be on the receiving end of that is more than entertainment. It feels like a gift.

President Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) looks across a battlefield in the aftermath of a terrible siege in this scene from director Steven Spielbergs drama ""Lincoln."" Photo David James Touchstone Pictures Lincoln review Daniel Day-Lewis brilliant 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Turbulent year ""Lincoln"" deals with a comparatively unknown and politically fraught period after Lincolns re-election in the fall of 1864 through early 1865 when the Civil War raged on even as the Norths victory was assured. Looking toward Reconstruction and the nation that would emerge from the conflict Lincoln decided that he needed a constitutional amendment banning slavery in all the states and territories that the Emancipation Proclamation might not be enough to eradicate slavery forever. But there was a chance a good chance that such an amendment might prolong the war. Thus there began the intense congressional battle over the 13th Amendment. The Congress of Lincoln is a Congress you might recognize a body containing a mix of big and shockingly small-minded people some pushing against the tides of history some complaining that the president is not ideologically pure enough or committed enough to be trusted. Black rights Among the radical liberals is Thaddeus Stevens an ill-tempered and vehement proponent of black rights. For almost a century after Reconstruction - in pro-Confederate histories and even in movies such as ""Tennessee Johnson"" (1942) - Stevens was portrayed as a villain. Here finally he gets his due. Surly and scowling and yet decent and right he is played by the ideal actor to embody those qualities Tommy Lee Jones. ""Lincoln"" was made to be enjoyed by everybody but the more youve read and the more daguerreotypes youve seen the more youll appreciate the films astonishing re-creation of historical tableaux such as Lincolns visit to the battlefield or the scene outside the Capitol on the occasion of his second inaugural. Spielberg doesnt linger on the battle scenes the way he did in ""War Horse"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" but the little we get are equal in ferocity and they convey the nature of the conflict - the hand-to-hand fighting the mud the blood the bayonets - with a brutality unique in Civil War movies. Likewise the actors were chosen with an eye for look and temperament. As Secretary of State William H. Seward David Straitharn plays Lincolns right arm the indispensable man who though lacking Lincolns farsightedness knows how to get things done. And is there any living actor who more resembles daguerreotypes of the wizened Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens than Jackie Earle Haley? The one minor compromise to star power was the casting of the 65-year-old Sally Field as the 46-year-old Mary Todd Lincoln. But then Mrs. Lincoln did a lot of fretting and no one frets like Sally Field. But all discussions of ""Lincoln"" must begin and end with Daniel Day-Lewis. Aided immensely by Tony Kushners script which dramatizes historical moments and freely creates others from an imagination steeped in knowledge Day-Lewis gives us a Lincoln whose patience derives from a lifetime of being smarter than everyone of knowing that he is 10 steps ahead of even his fastest colleagues. But even Lincolns patience has limits and the moment when he reaches it - when he slams his hand down on the desk asserts his power and insists that he will see his vision made real - is breathtaking. Even better it really happened. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Its cast members have won at least five Oscars with two apiece belonging to the odd but compelling couple at the center of the story Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln his tormented and demanding co-strategist and life partner. The two best-known previous films about our 16th president were made by D.W. Griffith and John Ford who represent exactly the kind of classic American cinema against which Spielberg measures himself. (In fairness neither Griffiths early talkie ""Abraham Lincoln"" starring Walter Huston nor Fords ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" with Henry Fonda in the title role is much watched these days.)Then theres the question of Spielbergs up-and-down directing career which includes three Oscars of his own several of the biggest hits in movie history and a marked propensity for sentimental overreach when he tries to tackle serious drama. (I remain somewhat willing to defend both ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindlers List"" for example but both are great in parts rather than great as a whole.) Expectations for ""Lincoln"" could not possibly have been higher and Im inclined to think that Spielbergs biggest challenge in making it lay in overcoming his own worst impulses. It could so easily have turned into sweeping oratory montages of Civil War dead and a slow-motion assassination scene in Fords Theatre all set to a keening John Williams violin score. (""Lincoln"" does in fact have a score by Williams but its effective and rarely obtrusive.)There are a couple of brief but memorable Civil War scenes near the beginning and end of ""Lincoln"" and a few snippets from his speeches notably his second inaugural address a few weeks before his death. But we dont see Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg Address and the event youll be dreading as the story moves toward April of 1865 is handled with grace and delicacy. As I noted in an essay last weekend John Wilkes Booth is never seen and never mentioned which can only have been a deliberate choice. (I for one am grateful.) As for Spielberg he has outdone Griffith and Ford and then some crafting a thrilling tragic and gripping moral tapestry of 19th-century American life an experience that is at once emotional visceral and intellectual. In a mesmerizing collaboration with a great actor (Day-Lewis) and a visionary writer (Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner) Spielberg has captured Lincoln as a shrewd political leader and a man of his time rather than a brooding philosopher-poet on a pedestal (although theres some of that too).I wanted to take a moment to honor Spielbergs accomplishment here because it would be easy to overlook it. You dont think about the way ""Lincoln"" is directed while youre watching it mostly because youre working through the bristly challenging language of Kushners screenplay or caught up in Day-Lewis portrayal of a dry angular prairie lawyer prone to long-winded and semi-relevant anecdotes who finds himself in the White House at a crucial turning point in the nations history. Youll certainly notice Janusz Kaminskis gorgeous subdued camerawork along with Rick Carters production design which captures the muddy streets and rough-hewn horizontal landscape of 1860s Washington in documentary detail.Kushners screenplay is based on the final two chapters of Doris Kearns Goodwins historical bestseller ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" and focuses entirely on the last few months of Lincolns life and his struggle to shove the 13th Amendment - which would outlaw slavery forever - through a divided Congress before the end of the Civil War. The reasons for this were simultaneously practical political and philosophical Lincoln knew that the Emancipation Proclamation he had issued two years earlier might be struck down by the courts after the wars end and wanted to make the constitutional change before the defeated states of the Confederacy could have a chance to block it. Furthermore after a sweeping Republican victory in the election of 1864 the lame-duck Congress included many dispirited and defeated Democrats who might be persuaded (by fair means or foul) to support the amendment at no political cost.Presumably Spielberg and Kushner are not psychic and could not have known that their movie would be released right after the reelection of a controversial president who faced implacable hostility from his political opponents. But they certainly understood that the situation Lincoln faced in the winter of 1864-65 has all kinds of contemporary significance and has been studied by historians and political scientists ever since. Although sometimes presented in schoolbooks as a man dominated by high-flown principles Lincoln was a savvy politician who had been willing to coexist with slavery (although he always detested it) for the sake of preserving the Union. When that failed and war came despite his efforts to prevent it he determined that there was no going back to the status quo ante and was prepared to engage in all kinds of dirty dubious and underhanded politics in the name of seizing the historical moment. You Might Also Like Spielbergs greatest strengths as a director lie in structure and balance - the way he handles main plot and subplot central characters and supporting characters. Add in Kushners remarkable ability to create distinctive characters in a few seconds of dialogue and you get one of the richest and deepest ensemble casts in recent Hollywood history. Certainly Day-Lewis as Lincoln dominates his scenes with his stooped ravens frame the smile that lets you know hes thinking a step ahead of you the flattened and slightly deadpan Midwestern cadence of his speech. (Obviously no films or audio of Lincoln exist - he was a few decades early for that -- but Day-Lewis has clearly studied the many descriptions of his physical and vocal manner.)But there are so many other vivid characters and scenes in ""Lincoln"" I cannot possibly list them all. There are major supporting roles like Tommy Lee Jones as Pennsylvania congressman Thaddeus Stevens a radical abolitionist who had long viewed Lincoln as a sellout or David Strathairn as the stern but loyal William Seward Lincolns secretary of state (who played the role of in-house enforcer that a White House chief of staff might play today). There are memorable bit parts including James Spader as a New York scoundrel hired by Seward to seduce wavering Democratic congressmen or Lee Pace as the pro-slavery Democrat and famous orator Fernando Wood who gave fulminating House speeches accusing Lincoln of setting himself up as an American Caesar. And then theres Sally Field.We dont have time to unpack all the theories and arguments about why Field - who won two best-actress Oscars in the 80s the only two times shes been nominated - seemed to drop off the Hollywood radar screen after she turned 50 even as Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep sailed from one triumph to the next. She was more of a pixie-ingenue type than they ever were I suppose and Im aware of the general opinion that a little Sally Field goes a long way. Whatever moment of inspiration caused Spielberg to cast her as Mary Todd Lincoln it was sheer genius because this is a role that demands bigness. By all accounts a feared and respected woman who was not much liked or loved (arguably not by her husband and children either) Mary was seen by many contemporaries as the power behind the throne if not something more than that -- the fiery engine that drove Lincoln forward. While some biographers have understood her as mentally ill (and that remains a possibility) Kushner presents her in just two major scenes as a woman of tremendous agony and pathos sublimating all her ambition and desire into her husband and her sons. In our own age Mary Lincoln could have been a politician herself or almost anything else she could imagine; in Fields ferocious portrayal she is a feminist hero many decades before the advent of feminism who made her own indelible contribution to American history.Steven Spielberg has often - and I say this with affection believe it or not - represented both the best and worst impulses of American film in the same moment. ""War Horse"" his Oscar-bait historical spectacle from last year almost became a great movie if you stuck through it but swamped itself in storybook pseudo-John Ford artificiality. He sometimes doesnt get full credit on the other hand for his harder-edged less overtly ""Spielbergian"" films from ""Munich"" to ""Minority Report"" to ""A.I."" to ""Empire of the Sun.""""Lincoln"" looks like a big historical drama on an epic scale but its one of those movies too a tightly focused and morally ambiguous study of character principle and politics. Its frankly nostalgic about both cinema and history recalling an era when Hollywood constructed mainstream entertainments that were also meant to edify and inspire. But it does not flee from the tragedy or the contradictions of its subject and this time around Spielberg has collaborators who rise to that ambition and make the film seem both an enduring classic and a contemporary lesson in the ways history keeps on detonating. Is ""Lincoln"" an inspiring story of American greatness? Yeah absolutely. But if you say that also say that its a cautionary tale of American mendacity and hypocrisy the unfinished story of a cancerous evil that poisoned and divided America from its birth and does so still.

Bonds loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is tested as MI6 comes under attack. 007 (Daniel Craig) must track down and destroy the threat no matter how personal the cost. (Photo amp; Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 8 2012 736 p.m. ET Who needs James Bond? The question is posed in ""Skyfall"" in the context of a debate about the role of old-fashioned human intelligence in a high-tech world of brilliant youngsters and an apostle of technology offers a snide answer ""Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled."" In the context of a revitalized franchise the answer is that we need 007 even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. The latest addition to the Bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis. ENLARGE Daniel Craig stars as James Bond in Skyfall. Sony Pictures The movie opens hair-trigger style with a man pointing a gun. The man is Daniel Craigs incarnation of Bond flinty-eyed with a closed-off soul and the sequence gets under way on the streets and rooftops of Istanbul; continues on a train where in the midst of definitive chaos James pauses to shoot his shirt cuffs out of his jacket sleeves; ends with a certified shocker and earns instant admission to the pantheon of classic chases. (The surreal credits that follow are no slouch either with Adele singing the title song.) None of that constitutes breaking news since extravagant action has long been a Bond staple. The distinction of ""Skyfall"" lies in the elegance of everything that sets off what its sensationally entertaining villain Silva calls ""all this jumping and fighting"" all this ""running around."" Photos Happy Birthday James Bond The opening sequence of ""Licence to Kill"" shows Timothy Dalton as James Bond in 1989. Ronald Grant Archive / Mary Evan Silva is played by Javier Bardem who manages--and this is the highest praise for a lowlife invention--to transcend the archvillainy of Anton Chigurh the nailgun-wielding monster he played in ""No Country for Old Men."" He does this not with physical weaponry but with an actors arsenal of skill and daring. Silvas affect is often light like his bleached hair. Hes a monster who uses whimsy to express menace a malign raconteur who savors the details of a ghastly story about survivalist rats. (The astute script was written by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan.) Mr. Bardem is only one of several top-flight actors who flourish under the direction of Sam Mendes. Mr. Craigs distillation of toughness and hurt tells us all we need to know of Bonds inner life. Judi Denchs M has given six previous Bond films a grounding that verges on gravitas. This time Dame Judi turns the role into a meditation on mortality along with a celebration of minimalist precision (as in her reading of the line ""Take the bloody shot"") and gets to fire off a few shots of her own. The cast includes Naomie Harris Ralph Fiennes Berenice Marlohe Ben Whishaw and as icing on the exploding cake of a giant climax the great Albert Finney playing a gamekeeper with a sense of history. Related Fifty Years of Bond Cars dont usually get applause from movie audiences though one of Bonds rides did just that at my screening. And producers dont usually get praise from movie critics though its warranted for Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson whose stewardship of the franchise is back on track after a near-derailment in ""The Quantum of Solace."" The kinetic pageant theyve put together is smart about many important things showmanship sexual politics visual splendor. ( Roger Deakins was the cinematographer.) The only false note is the straw-man dialectic of the plot No one in the intelligence community these days would argue against the value of human operatives. Yet the movies smartest suit is emotional intelligence ""Skyfall"" keeps us caring intensely for a hero who by any rational measure is a vestige of a vanished era. ENLARGE Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln. DreamWorks Lincoln The carnage of war provides a preface to Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" just as it did in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But this is carnage of a sort so old--a war in which fists strangulations and stompings supplement bullets and bayonets--that its depiction on screen seems new. Mr. Spielbergs remarkable film seems old and new too genuinely old in its beautifully rendered settings and costumes; genuinely new in its placement of our 16th president portrayed in eccentric glory by Daniel Day-Lewis within the politics of his day. ( Tony Kushners electrifying screenplay was partly based on Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."") Primarily though not exclusively a drama of ideas ""Lincoln"" concentrates on the last months of the presidents life when he sought to do nothing less than unite the nation by ending the Civil War and end slavery by pushing the 13th Amendment through a fractious Congress. These were conflicting goals and Lincoln pursued them with an idealists fervor and a pragmatists gift for the rough and tumble of the political process. Watch a clip from the Steven Spielberg historical drama ""Lincoln"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field Tommy Lee Jones Joseph Gordon-Levitt James Spader Jared Harris John Hawkes and Jackie Earle Haley. (Photo amp; Video Dreamworks) Youll have to go elsewhere for a rundown of all the characters and their intricate often devious motives. (Honest Abe himself was wondrously devious when the situation demanded it.) Indeed the film which has the courage of its complexity must have been made on the assumption that moviegoers would later go elsewhere--to books on the subject or discussions in educational settings--for a deeper understanding of what theyd seen. (Long after its commercial run ""Lincoln"" will remain an invaluable teaching tool.) For now though be assured that the political process in question is so vital as to leave you amazed at what it once was--a rowdy arena of accusations denunciations venality in the service of virtue virtue for its own sake or venality pure and simple and none of it shaped by opinion polls--as well as dismayed by the dumbshow its become. The cast uniformly superb includes Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens Hal Holbrook as Lincoln adviser Preston Blair Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln David Strathairn as William Seward and James Spader as political operative W.N. Bilbo. The production was designed by Rick Carter and photographed by Janusz Kaminski with original music by John Williams. Mr. Spielbergs direction is hugely energetic and almost invisible a fine combination though his film like the people it portrays is imperfect. A teachable moment at the start turns into awkward speechifying about the inequities between black and white soldiers in the Union army. And the ending bespeaks uncertainty about whether and how the presidents death needed to be shown; a fade-out could have come at the moment he turns walks slowly down a hall and leaves for Fords Theater. Yet the portrait of Lincoln transcends conventional judgments; its a complete creation perfect on its own terms. Mr. Day-Lewis who normally speaks in a rich baritone chose a tenor range and reedy timbre thats closer to whats known of Lincolns voice from historical sources. The effect is startling unsettling and entirely convincing. The actor also gives his subject a singular set of physical behaviors--arms and hands in constant motion as if pulled by a puppeteer; demeanor bleak more often than bright; posture stooped shoulders narrow. Still these are external choices and Mr. Day-Lewis works famously and phenomenally from the inside out. The mystery at the core of his gorgeous performance which is enhanced by Mr. Kushners script has to do with his masterly grasp of Lincolns quicksilver spirit. This president is a man of the people when he tells a bawdy story about Washingtons portrait in a latrine. But hes a man for the ages when in advance of congressional action on abolishing slavery he draws himself up and declares wrathfully ""I am the president of the United States of America clothed in immense power. You will procure me these votes."" Thats acting. Thats writing. That is indelibly the Abraham Lincoln we only thought we knew. ENLARGE Mads Mikkelsen and Alicia Vikander Magnolia Pictures A Royal Affair With its sumptuous settings urgent romance and intellectual substance ""A Royal Affair"" is a mind-opener crossed with a bodice-ripper. Nicolaj Arcels Danish-language film which he wrote with Rasmus Heisterberg starts in 1766 with an English girls fateful journey to Denmark. Caroline Mathilde a sister of Britains King George III makes the trip to marry her cousin the Danish King Christian VII ( Mikkel Boe Folsgaard) and become his queen. Shes only 15 but already cultivated and accomplished and Alicia Vikanders performance spans the next nine years with lovely authority. What Caroline doesnt know is that her husband-to-be is infantile willful and insane. This is suggested in a piquant imagining of their first meeting in a field; Christian isnt visible for a while because hes hiding behind a tree. (The films inventions are so dramatic and entertaining that youre tempted to think of the whole thing as fiction but the main elements of the script hew remarkably close to historical fact.) What Caroline cant imagine at this frightening juncture is that her life will be transformed by the royal physician Johann Friederich Struensee a man of the Enlightenment whose seductiveness extends far south of his brain since hes played by the marvelous Mads Mikkelsen. Mr. Mikkelsens face is unmistakable with its high cheekbones brooding eyes and chiseled lips and his character is the plots fulcrum. For Caroline Struensee opens up the world of learning and of love. For Christian the royal doctor is a constant companion who drinks with the king and whores with him but never judges him. Whats more Struensee turns the king into a progressive force in a struggle against the power brokers and connivers of the State Council who have kept Denmark poor and ignorant in the name of tradition and faith. Still Struensee is an overreacher as well as an adulterer. While hundreds of laws are being passed--enlightened laws that will open the country to the winds of change--the conditions of his downfall are inexorably coalescing. ""A Royal Affair"" is overlong; the inexorable comes more slowly than it might. For the most part though this superb film which was photographed by Rasmus Videbaek and scored by Gabriel Yared and Cyrille Aufort tells an absorbing tale with a remarkable sense of intimacy. At several points Struensee is warned of the myth of Lancelot and Guinevere. At others the story recalls the fraught relationship between the doctor and his volatile patient in ""The Last King of Scotland."" The king himself as Mr. Folsgaard plays him is interesting enough to sustain a movie of his own but Struensee has the majesty of his contradictions--formidable intelligence a loving heart and a fatal lust for power. DVD Focus ENLARGE Javier Bardem in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Weinstein Company/Everett Collection Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) Javier Bardem isnt villainous in Woody Allens wittily libidinous romantic comedy. Hes a man in the midst of intense femininity a Spanish painter who encounters two American friends on vacation in Spain-- Rebecca Halls Vicky who believes in an orderly life and Scarlett Johanssons Cristina whose feelings spin every which way. ( Penelope Cruz is the painters loose revolver of an ex-wife.) Still its easy to see in his blithe performance many of the traits that have made him such a terrific bad guy--the screwy insouciance the cheery hedonism the comfort zone that includes all sorts of contradictory feelings. ENLARGE All the Kings Men All the Kings Men (1949) A poisonous political process from our not-so-distant past dominates Robert Rossens classic film about the rise of a Southern demagogue. Broderick Crawford is Willie Stark a self-described hick transformed by degrees into a bully with a taste for booze a weakness for women and a power lust of spectacular proportions. The film was adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren; he modeled his hero on Huey P. Long Jr. the larger-than-life governor and then senator who dominated the political scene in Louisiana from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. Avoid the 2006 remake starring Sean Penn. ENLARGE Casino Royale Casino Royale (2006) Mads Mikkelsen is Le Chiffre the mournfully menacing banker who weeps blood in the self-described prequel that introduced Daniel Craig as a newly minted James Bond. The terrorists here are nobodies with no distinguishing characteristics or ideologies. What deepens the drama is the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd a lissome mostly cool British Treasury official played superbly by Eva Green. Martin Campbell directed a cast that includes Jeffrey Wright; Giancarlo Giannini; the movies producer Michael G. Wilson as a police chief; and of course Judi Dench putting her inimitable stamp on the role of M. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1140 a.m. EST November 12 2012This is a profoundly thought-provoking portrait of 16th president and his drive to end slavery and unite the country.Daniel Day-Lewis stars as President Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln offering a tremendous performance that is sure to be a leading Oscar contender.(Photo DreamWorks Pictures/20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field David Strathairn Tommy Lee JonesRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 29 minutes; Opens Friday in select citiesIts title notwithstanding Lincoln is an absorbing intellectual look at the political machinations involved in abolishing slavery not an exhaustive biopic about Honest Abe.A trio of truths stand out in this stately film (   1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday in select cities). First Daniel Day-Lewis so completely conveys the dignity and shrewd intelligence of Abraham Lincoln its as if historical footage has been unearthed and were watching the Kentucky-born president himself. Second its glaringly clear how divisive and hard-fought the effort to end slavery was not only on the battlefield but in the halls of Washington. Third and most important Lincoln was above all else committed to the principles upon which the United States was founded.The film is based in part on historian Doris Kearns Goodwins 2005 book Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. No revelations about the man surface; mostly we are privy to the politics of the era and get a compelling view of Lincolns determination as well as his ability to surmount hurdles and trounce the opposition in service of a greater good.The story is tightly focused on a few months in 1865 the final year of the Lincoln presidency. It documents how the president cleverly masterminded the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and thus ended slavery. Those who think wily power-brokering cynical manipulation and a polarized Congress are modern phenomena will be surprised to see intriguing parallels here. Though Lincoln captures the era with precision there is a modern resonance to the narrative.ALEXANDER Steven Spielberg brings Lincoln to lifeMORE Daniel Day-Lewis - a true Lincoln transformationMORE Latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesDirector Steven Spielberg a terrific storyteller and action director reaffirms his talent for drawing nuanced performances from an ensemble cast. Tommy Lee Jones is a standout as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens a Republican known for his sarcastic wit and David Strathairn is excellent as Secretary of State William Seward.Less impressive is Sally Field who seems miscast as Mary Todd Lincoln. The Day-Lewis/Fields pairing isnt convincing particularly given that Field is a decade older than Day-Lewis but Mary Lincoln was a decade younger than her husband.Day-Lewis low-key performance succeeds in every way imaginable. Playing a larger-than-life historical figure whose visage audiences are so familiar with presents a special challenge. His transformation is so seamless its almost spooky.The story is set as the Civil War rages. In the maelstrom Lincoln plots a strategy intended to abolish slavery end the war and reunite the country. His plan is much-criticized even by his closest advisers. But Lincoln remains resolute. The idea is to persuade lame-duck members of the House of Representatives to pass the unpopular amendment by promising them government posts and other perks. This is no somnolent C-SPAN gathering. Never was a congressional vote so climactic.Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America) wrote the perfectly calibrated screenplay. Janusz Kaminskis cinematography is strikingly beautiful. One of the final scenes of Lincoln walking down a dimly lit White House hall silhouetted in his trademark hunched posture is powerfully evocative.Through this very specific look at a critical time in Lincolns presidency Kushner Spielberg and Day-Lewis work together to present an honest look at Americas most revered statesman. Kushner finds an artful way to weave in the texts of the Gettysburg Address and the 13th Amendment as well as a creative way to present Lincolns assassination.Following the death a eulogizer intones ""Now he belongs to the ages."" With its low-key but eloquent approach this big-screen characterization further burnishes the legacy. 238 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/RKIH1a",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/08/lincoln-review/1671981/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,lincoln24,lincoln,usatoday

DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Lincoln Director Steven Spielberg Genre Drama Running time 159 minutes Rated PG-13 for an intense scene of war violence some images of carnage and brief strong language With Daniel Day Lewis Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tommy Lee Jones This election season pundits have been fond of pointing out the near-50/50 split of the electorate and talking about how the American people are as deeply divided as at any other time in our history. The opening moments of Lincoln put those hyperbolic claims in perspective as Steven Spielberg -- with his usual flair for highlighting how truly ugly war really is -- shows a nation so divided that its opposing factions are killing one another in numbers so extreme that the bodies are literally piling up on top of one another. Theres also a lot of talk today about the incivility of the discourse between our elected representatives. But Spielbergs depiction of the state of affairs on the floor of Congress during debates over the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery is another shot of cold water to the face. The conflicts here between the congressional Democrats (who oppose the amendment) and the Republicans (who were themselves fostering a shaky alliance between opposed internal camps) are only barely more civil than the soldiers on the battlefields. Not even wartime and daily national tragedy is enough to keep these politicians from sniping at one another so viciously that it makes the most heated modern exchanges feel like a legislative love-in. Presiding over all of this with a reputation for nobly rising above the fray is Abraham Lincoln here portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis in a performance so effortless and invisible that its easy to forget this is an actor playing Lincoln and not the man himself. Day-Lewis Lincoln is soft-spoken and folksy with a gentle reedy voice unlike that of many of the actors who have played the man before but truer to historical accounts of what he sounded like. That voice as thin and willowy as the man himself seems almost incongruous for a man of such charisma and presence -- even more so when it becomes clear that Spielberg along with screenwriter Tony Kushner has put together a portrait of Lincoln that is as averse to pulling punches as are his battle sequences. Working from Doris Kearns Goodwins Lincoln biography Team of Rivals Kushners script looks at just the few months leading up to the end of the war -- and more importantly to the difficult passage of that 13th Amendment. As the movie begins Lincoln is far short of the needed votes and even his Cabinet is fighting his commitment to its passage which it views as a distraction from and impediment to the coming end of the war. i Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln whose emotional volatility has been described in terms that lead some contemporary observers to believe she may have suffered from bipolar disorder. DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln whose emotional volatility has been described in terms that lead some contemporary observers to believe she may have suffered from bipolar disorder. DreamWorks What follows is a campaign of graft bribery and carefully orchestrated manipulation that is ethically dubious at best impeachable at worst. A team of men led by the slimy W.N. Bilbo (James Spader) is tasked by Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) with essentially buying the votes of lame-duck Democrats while abolitionist firebrand Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones in a performance just as central and Oscar-worthy as Day-Lewis) coordinates backroom deals within his own party. Spielbergs Lincoln is a man of undeniably noble intentions but one not afraid of getting his hands dirty in pursuit of those goals. The true genius of Day-Lewis performance is in how he allows just a glimpse at the passion rage and Machiavellian drive beneath the surface of a man given to telling wry folksy parables to get his points across. Even with the narrow focus the film sometimes bites off just a little more than it can handle. A subplot about Lincolns oldest sons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) determination to serve in the Army feels like a superfluous distraction while attempts to address the presidents complex relationship with his wife Mary (Sally Field) never quite approach the thoughtful depth and detail of the political maneuvering. In fact the human drama of Lincoln is often less compelling than its political plot -- which even given its on-the-record outcome becomes a gripping political thriller at its peak. Spielberg occasionally slips into the sort of maudlin sentimentality that sank last years War Horse viewing Lincoln with a gauzy deifying reverence that threatens to undercut the surprising toughness of the rest of the movie. But such moments are thankfully few and far between allowing for a more genuine admiration of the man This Lincoln isnt an abstracted infallible ideal but rather a deeply conflicted often lonely leader simply trying to do the right thing -- even if that means a few wrong things along the way.

"Steven Spielbergs Lincoln a towering achievement Review - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Steven Spielbergs Lincoln a towering achievement Lincoln Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Lincoln. Kenneth Turan reviews Lincoln. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Hollywoods most successful director turns on a dime and delivers his most restrained interior film. A celebrated playwright shines an illuminating light on no more than a sliver of a great mans life. A brilliant actor surpasses even himself and makes us see a celebrated figure in ways we hadnt anticipated. This is the power and the surprise of ""Lincoln.""Directed by Steven Spielberg written by Tony Kushner and starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president of the United States ""Lincoln"" unfolds during the final four months of the chief executives life as he focuses his energies on a dramatic struggle that has not previously loomed large in political mythology his determination to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery. This narrow focus has paradoxically enabled us to see Lincoln whole in a way a more broad-ranging film might have been unable to match. It has also made for a movie whose pleasures are subtle ones that knows how to reveal the considerable drama inherent in the overarching battle of big ideas over the amendment as well as the small-bore skirmishes of political strategy and the nitty-gritty scramble for congressional votes.VIDEO Lincoln trailer These things all begin as thoughtful films invariably do with an excellent script. A Pulitzer Prize-winner for ""Angels in America"" Kushner has always been adept at illuminating the interplay of the personal and the political. His literate screenplay based on parts of Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Lincoln"" is smart dramatic and confident of the value of what it has to say.Kushner has worked with Spielberg before (he co-wrote the Oscar-nominated ""Munich"" script) and his writing seems to bring out a level of restraint in their productions. There is nothing bravura or overly emotional about Spielbergs direction here but the impeccable filmmaking is no less impressive for being quiet and to the point. The director delivers selfless pulled-back satisfactions hes there in service of the script and the acting to enhance the spoken word rather than burnish his reputation.The key speaker obviously is Day-Lewis. No one needs to be told at this late date what a consummate actor he is but even those used to the way he disappears into roles will be startled by the marvelously relaxed way he morphs into this character and simply becomes Lincoln. While his heroic qualities are visible when theyre needed Day-Lewis Lincoln is a deeply human individual stooped and weary after four years of civil war but endowed with a palpable largeness of spirit and a genuine sense of humor.PHOTOS Lessons from the campaign trail -- on film At ease in his own skin Lincoln wears a shawl around the White House like he was born with it and is so prone to telling tales at every opportunity that his fed-up Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) snaps in exasperation ""No youre not going to tell a story. I cant bear to hear one.""Though Day-Lewis work inevitably towers over ""Lincoln"" one of the remarkable things about this production is not only how consistently good the acting is across some 145 speaking roles but how much the actors have been cast both for ability and resemblance to their historical counterparts from major players such as Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) and firebrand Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) down to minor characters like amendment opponent Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) and Lincolns secretary John Nicolay (Jeremy Strong).Working with his usual team of equals -- cinematographer Janusz Kaminski production designer Rick Carter editor Michael Kahn costume designer Joanna Johnston and composer John Williams -- Spielberg has paid particular attention to creating a realistic world for his characters to inhabit seeping us in the period and seeing to it that the color scheme and the muted lighting enhance the films naturalistic palette.BUZZMETER How Lincoln is holding up in the awards raceCare was taken with the physical details as well especially the interior of the White House where Lincolns office was re-created with complete accuracy and where the president interacts with his family trying to placate his ever-emotional wife Mary (a convincing Sally Field) distraught after the death of their young son Willie as well as oldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is desperate to enlist in the Union Army against his parents wishes. The political core of ""Lincoln"" begins with the presidents determination much to the displeasure of close advisor Seward to get the House to pass the 13th Amendment. Fearful that the previously enacted Emancipation Proclamation might not stand up to legal challenges Lincoln gets surprisingly steely as he insists that this simply must be done if slavery is to be permanently eradicated. The problem is getting the votes.To help make this happen Seward brings in a trio of arm-twisters the 1860s versions of todays lobbyists who are charged by a president not shy about saying he is ""clothed in immense power"" to use any means necessary to round up the needed congressional votes. This trio amusingly played by John Hawkes James Spader and Tim Blake Nelson are as close to comic relief as ""Lincoln"" gets. THE ENVELOPE Latest awards newsBecause the stakes are so high and because he turns out to be a master strategist the president himself inevitably gets personally involved in playing politics. He deals with key leaders like Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) a conservative Republican who is eager for peace talks with the South and of course Jones Stevens an irascible vitriolic abolitionist (""the meanest man in Congress"" according to Roy Blount Jr.) who is just getting warmed up when he calls an opponent a ""fatuous nincompoop.""One of the surprises and the pleasures of ""Lincoln"" is its portrait of the president as a man gifted at reconciling irreconcilable points of view someone who wouldnt hesitate to play both ends against the middle and even stretch the truth in the service of the greater good.Kushner has said that he wrote ""Lincoln"" because upset at todays endemic lack of faith in governance he wanted to tell a story that ""shows that you can achieve miraculous beautiful things through the democratic system.""

(David James) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 8 2012 217 PM Title Lincoln Film Info With Daniel Day-Lewis Davd Strathairn Sally Field Joseph Gordon-Levitt The 16th President fights to pass his anti-slavery amendment. Director Steven Spielberg (229). PG-13 Language. Lincoln Square Union Square. Opens wide Nov. 16. The history lesson in Steven Spielbergs austere engrossing ""Lincoln"" is less about the revered President himself but his method for justice. Specifically how he forced the House of Representatives into passing the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. That turns out to be ingenious. For ""Lincolns"" ultimate mission -- one it goes about in a smart rarely sentimental way -- becomes a kind of calling out from the shadows naming the oh-so-civilized men who voted to keep people as property while lauding now-forgotten lawmakers who did the right thing. And it provides Daniel Day-Lewis with an opportunity for his latest extraordinary performance one filled with kindness and strength in equal measure. Its January 1865 four years into the Civil War and shortly before Lincolns reelection inauguration. His secretary of state William Seward (always-great David Strathairn) knows the South is exhausted and that Lincolns amendment may present political issues. Lincolns 1863 Emancipation Proclamation had set forth a goal but hadnt got it into law. Thats what the amendment will do. But the Houses mainstream Republicans -- in 1865 a group of level-headed legislators -- didnt have the two-thirds majority needed to pass it. So they must court Republican ""radicals"" led by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) even though the wording proposed doesnt go as far as Stevens would like in providing equality. They also need some 20 Democrats known for their aggresssive disdain for Lincoln and his cause. Using political graft and fiery oratory the Presidents allies fight right up to the moment it passes. Despite a final 15 minutes that bows to old-fashioned predictability ""Lincoln"" is less a biopic than a beautiful celebration of the democratic process. The screenplay by Pulitzer Prize-winner Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") heightens the intrigue setting Lincoln and Stevens as cagey bulls who both know procedural morass -- two votes it turns out may keep millions from freedom. Despite the high emotions and Civil War strategizing Spielberg allows only one brief grippingly personal scene of bayonets and blood; the battles here take place in sitting rooms and in Congress. And through it all strides Day-Lewis his height exaggerated his voice an oddly endearing Midwestern wheeze and his magnetism extraordinary. This is no mere ""Great Man"" imitation and familiar profile -- this is a portryal of nuance and depth. Jones too is superb letting Stevens exhausted idealism creep into his cantankerousness. There are distractions -- James Spader as a drawling lobbyist is cartoonishly colorful while Sally Fields Mary Lincoln becomes a suffering sounding board. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Lincolns son Robert) Jared Harris (as Ulysses S. Grant) and Jackie Earle Haley (as Alexander Stephens Vice President of the Confederate States of the America) co-star to varying effect. Yet Spielberg allows his natural gifts for storytelling -- sometimes ill-served by his genre expertise -- to keep them all in the shadow not so much of Lincoln but of the conscience heart and mind that drove him on.

Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 11.08.12 | 352 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" does something that at this very particular moment in time seems almost impossible to comprehend. It makes politics exciting again. Maybe you dont want to hear this. Whether youre elated or dejected by this weeks election results youre doubtless sick of all things relating to governance. Besides trailers for ""Lincoln"" and the general hullabaloo leading up to its appearance in theaters have led most of us to expect a standard Spielbergian portrait of the 16th president as an exalted saint. But ""Lincoln"" is smarter and tougher than that. The crucial ingredient proves to be not the director and not even star Daniel Day-Lewis -- both of them working at the top of their talents -- but screenwriter Tony Kushner. The ""Angels in America"" playwright (he worked with Spielberg on ""Munich"") has penned an epic ensemble about the intersection of democratic process and higher moral thinking and its a rip-roaring entertainment brain food thats tasty and good for you. Sweet Lord how refreshing it is to hear dialogue that crackles with wit and personality -- with actual ideas. Rather than an overarching biography Spielberg and Kushner zero in on the weeks immediately following the presidents reelection in late 1864 when Lincoln opts to spend his new political capital by pushing through the 13th Amendment and abolishing slavery in the face of opposition from all sides. Based loosely on historian Doris Kearns Goodwins 2005 bestseller ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" the films a galloping drama of horse-trading strategic thinking and deal making all yoked to notions of what should be done rather than what could be done. Its the most enjoyable two and a half hours of historical C-Span ever made shot on a wide canvas (and on film) with impeccable eye to detail by Spielbergs longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Aside from the president not one character in ""Lincoln"" thinks the Amendment stands a chance of passing in the Senate and the House. Hardly anyone thinks its even a good idea. Were reminded that the Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure and that with the Civil War grinding toward a conclusion only a change to the Constitution would prevent slavery from resuming in the South. ""Lincoln"" takes pains to illustrate for a modern viewer the racist thinking that was part and parcel of the average white Americans worldview in January 1865. That certainly includes Lincoln himself who at this point has consciously chosen to listen to the better angels of his nature. By giving enough scenes to African-American characters like White House seamstress Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben) and Union Corporal Ira Clark (David Oyelowo) we comprehend the stakes as they see it. More critically by giving over the stage to the radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens -- a gloriously obstreperous Tommy Lee Jones -- the movie lets us understand how rare and how dangerous it was for a white man to publicly state that blacks and whites were equals on every possible level. Jones comes very close to stealing ""Lincoln"" with a performance of ethical purity and calm hilarious invective and if anyone else were playing the president the actor might have the movie in his pocket. Day-Lewis moves eerily beyond impersonation to embodiment though and we watch with fascination as he reinvents Abraham Lincoln as a canny politician hiding behind a folksy godlike exterior. Its a daringly low-key portrayal one that moves to private rhythms rather than public posturing and it seems directly descended from Henry Fondas dreamily confident ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" in the 1939 film directed by Spielbergs beloved John Ford. This Lincoln walks like a tortoise and thinks like a hare forever telling cracker-barrel anecdotes that reveal stinging moral rebukes. (Except for the scene in which he tells a dirty joke involving a picture of George Washington in a British toilet -- then like any showman he just wants a laugh.) The performance carries the weight of history at the same time its rooted in the day-to-day exigencies of statesmanship. Day-Lewis lets us see how the war and the presidency have aged Lincoln while teaching him to think for the ages. Yet at no time do we lose sight of the man indulgent toward his sons (Gulliver McGrath as young Tad and Joseph Gordon-Levitt without much to do as ardent Robert) exasperated and loving with his high-strung wife (Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln) and unyielding with the members of his Cabinet all men of greater pragmatism and lesser spine. One of the greatest pleasures of ""Lincoln"" in fact is the many characters and performances that strut across its stage. The presidents closest adviser Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) is a D.C. realist aghast at what he considers an act of political suicide. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) has a short fuse lit and re-lit by Lincolns meddling. The presidents Republican party is portrayed as a shaky coalition of radicals centrists and conservatives while the Democrats have a similar mix of grandstanding obstructionists and quiet realists. (The film makes clear that the parties are very generally speaking nearly the opposite of what we understand them to be now with Democrats urging a return to prewar policies and values and Republicans pressing the case for greater social inclusiveness.) So we get Michael Stuhlbarg as Kentucky Democrat George Yeaman gently agonizing over the right thing to do. We get Lee Pace as New Yorks Fernando Wood the Democrats silver-tongued fulminator (against whom Joness Stevens gives as good as he gets). Happily we get James Spader rejuvenating his career as the most juicily amoral of the three men employed by Lincoln to woo lame-duck Democrats with government jobs. (John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson are the other two; today wed call them lobbyists but Spielberg uses them as his own Manny Moe and Jack.) Kushners script winks at such realpolitik chicanery -- likewise at the secret peace talks with the Confederacy the president both offers and stalls -- while understanding this is both the price and the danger of getting things done. Lincolns imperial tendencies are chewed over in dialogue that sparks our own reasoning. ""What reins him in?"" someone wonders. ""Well the people I suppose"" comes the rejoinder. Just so ""Lincoln"" neatly balances naivete and cynicism the highest ideals and the lowest suspicions in a way that flatters an audiences ability to think for itself. At the same time it rolls along with the supreme craft weve come to associate with this director when hes pushed by intelligent collaborators. Only toward the end after the Amendment passes -- no spoilers there although ""Lincoln"" turns the vote into a finely tuned example of movie suspense -- does Spielbergs hagiographic bent take over and the machinery start elevating the president into the heavens. Kushners taste for speechifying has begun to wear on us by this point too and there are scenes that smack more of the stage than the screen. A bitter domestic spat between Lincoln and his wife humanizes the president almost too much; yes they fought but this is more Edward Albees George and Martha than historys. (That said Fieldss performance is a beautiful thing one that uses the actresss own neurotic edge -- her need for us to really really like her -- to breathe life into a smart volatile sorrowful woman.) ""Lincoln"" fights against the deification of the patient martyr who stares out at us from our five dollar bills but in the final scenes Spielberg caves in. Can he be blamed? Would he even be Spielberg without the triumphalism of Great Man moviemaking or John Williamss Copland-esque score cueing us to easy tears? Thankfully the director has Kushner to guard against his soggier impulses. (The assassination for one thing occurs off-screen.) More to the point ""Lincoln"" is about the petty yet profoundly necessary task of forging consensus -- of getting small-minded humans to look beyond their immediate concerns to their larger duty. Its about our flaws civic and personal then as now and what a genuine leader has to do to advance us beyond them as a people and as a country if not as individuals. Its also about the power of reason and the power of words to give body and urgency to reason. So yes ""Lincoln"" has a lot of talk moving and fatuous florid and brutally concise. This may sound like an ordeal in our era of partisan bloviation but Spielberg and Kushner rescue language as a holy weapon of persuasion and the only real antidote to killing one another on the battlefield. Its possible you may think ""Lincoln"" is too talky -- too full of characters and ideas too taxing to our Twitter-pated attention spans. Consider then that it may not be the movie thats unworthy of your time. You may not be worthy of it. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Its a must-see for Daniel Day-Lewis charismatic subtly shaded performance as Lincoln -- and an even richer one by Tommy Lee Jones -- but a colleague of mine at The Post has a point in describing the film derived from Tony Kushners wonky script as ""C-SPAN with whiskers. Actual depiction of the Civil War is pretty much limited to a single gory battle scene at the opening followed by a corny sequence where Lincoln chats with some young soldiers. They include a black recruit who demands equal pay in dialogue that hardly seems to fit the time period and whites reciting the Gettsyburg Address like theyre quoting lines from their favorite movie. Then Abe gets down to the business. Lincolns Cabinet is dubious about his chances of getting the 13th Amendment through the House but the president -- who has already freed the slaves as a wartime measure in the Emancipation Proclamation -- orders them to get it passed before the end of the bloody four-year war. The film begins in January 1865 three months before the Confederacys surrender which was shortly followed by his assassination. Urged on by his boss perpetually exasperated Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) reluctantly sends out a trio of scalawags -- wonderfully played by James Spader Tim Blake Nelson and a curiously under-utilized John Hawkes -- to try and buy the votes of lame-duck Democratic congressmen with patronage jobs and folders of cash. Its up to Lincoln himself to hold together his own badly divided Republican Party even if that means hiding peace feelers from the Confederacy from the conservative wing. At the same time the ""radical"" Republicans led by cantankerous abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens (Jones) oppose the amendment because they want the South to pay reparations to the former slaves. I must confess my eyeballs began glazing over during the exposition-laden first hour which introduces an army of characters played by what seems like half the over-40 membership of the Screen Actors Guild -- most prominently Hal Holbrook Jared Harris Jackie Earle Haley Michael Stuhlbarg and Bruce McGill. Fortunately Spielberg picks up the pace as the vote nears though there are relatively few of his trademark visual flourishes (not entirely a bad thing after the overwhelming artifice of ""The War Horse). At times the director seems over-awed with his subject -- or maybe hes visited the animatronic Lincoln at Disneyland a few too many times. The only significant female role -- the African-American characters male and female are unfortunately pretty much relegated to grateful spectators -- is Sally Fields overwrought Mary Todd Lincoln who frets that history will remember her a madwoman. Disconsolate after the death of one son in the White House she harangues the president not to indulge their firstborns ardent desire for military service. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Robert Lincoln in what seems like the sole concession to the youth audience but his part is small and awkwardly written. Gulliver McGrath fares better as young Tad Lincoln whom the president repeatedly dotes on -- and whos the focus of Spielbergs rather eccentric depiction of the assassination. Adopting an odd high-pitched voice Day-Lewis thoroughly inhabits the part of a war-weary president whos fond of telling long and folksy autobiographical stories (""I could write shorter speeches but I get too lazy to stop). Demonstrating a hitherto unsuspected gift for humor Day-Lewis has a particularly lovely middle-of-the-night scene with a pair of military telegraph operators. Its the kind of towering iconic performance that wins Oscars (Day-Lewis honored for ""My Left Foot and ""There Will Be Blood could become the first-ever winner of three Best Actor trophies). In some ways though the films real heart and conscience is old Thaddeus Stevens -- who must wrestle with reconciling his deeply held beliefs on equality with the need for compromise that will lead to more politically palatable gradual change. With a scene-stealing performance by Tommy Lee Jones as Stevens that ultimately left me in tears this is the most satisfying and stirring part of ""Lincoln.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of Abraham Lincolns efforts to end slavery and the Civil War during the final months of his life. BOTTOM LINE Honest Abe as wheeler-dealer is an intriguing new notion and Day-Lewis is extraordinary in the role. But this ""Lincoln"" feels like a museum piece well-crafted and resolutely traditional. CAST Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tommy Lee Jones LENGTH 225 Dark stately noble-minded and slightly creaky in the joints -- thats the Abraham Lincoln most Americans know and it also describes ""Lincoln"" Steven Spielbergs cinematic portrait of the man. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role ""Lincoln"" is wrapped in the heavy cloak of the traditional biopic with all the top-shelf acting period detail and important speeches the genre requires. ""Lincoln"" is based on Doris Kearns Goodwins book ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" which details the 16th presidents efforts to unite bitter enemies to end both slavery and the Civil War. Herein lies the movies freshest idea of Lincoln as a wheeler-dealer trading secret favors for yea-votes on the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery. Theres also something delicious in discovering that Honest Abe could be a Clinton-caliber prevaricator.

If in this postelection haze you can stand watching more debates the movies liveliest scenes take place in the riotous House of Representatives with scores of fine actors like Lee Pace (as the pro-South Democrat Fernando Wood) a surprisingly funny James Spader (as a dirty-work Lincoln operative) and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens another abolitionist willing to do anything for his cause. Stevens is also the one character in this mostly white movie who regards blacks as actual people not distant abstractions. As for Day-Lewis hes uncannily good. Few actors have seemed so thoroughly comfortable in a role and few could glide so easily through screenwriter Tony Kushners tricky dialogue mingling the eras flowery grandiloquence with down-home expressions like ""Buzzards guts man"" Sally Field as a histrionic Mary Todd and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as her son Robert feel less convincing. Overall this finely crafted ""Lincoln"" offers everything youd expect. But somehow thats a little disappointing. 221 VideoTrailer Lincoln PLOT The story of Abraham Lincolns efforts to end slavery and the Civil War during the final months of his life advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (brief violence and gruesome imagery) CAST Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tommy Lee Jones LENGTH 225 BOTTOM LINE Honest Abe as wheeler-dealer is an intriguing new notion and Day-Lewis is extraordinary in the role.

Comments (10) click to enlarge Lincoln Recommended Rated PG-13  149 minutes  2012 Steven Spielbergs long-gestating drama about the 16th president opens with an atrocious scene in which weary Union soldiers both white and black recite the Gettysburg Address for their visiting commander in chief. Miraculously this sentimental drivel is followed by an admirably clear-eyed account of Lincolns last three months focusing on the high ideals and low political gamesmanship that enabled him to pass the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress and end slavery in the U.S. Daniel Day-Lewis is extraordinary as the president capturing his wit and generosity but also the iron will that made him the countrys greatest hero and Spielberg has recruited a whos who of character actors (David Strathairn Hal Holbrook Tommy Lee Jones John Hawkes Jackie Earle Haley Bruce McGill Tim Blake Nelson Jared Harris) to embody the various political forces swirling around the White House as the Civil War nears its bloody conclusion.

Thaddeus Stevens the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee tells him ""I lead. You should try it some time."" It is the winter of 1864-65 but the barbs directed at Abraham Lincoln have the prickly familiarity of the insults that have been directed at Barack Obama over the past few years that he was a strange aloof man convinced of his superiority to the congressional rabble who favored elevated oratory over the mucky trench work needed to pass legislation. The analogy of the 16th and 44th U.S. Presidents provides a fascinating undercurrent to Lincoln the sturdy sometimes starchy drama directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner. Rather than add to the dozens of movie biographies of the Great Emancipator Kushner dipped into Doris Kearns Goodwins 2005 book Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln to focus on the Presidents drive for the House ratification of the 13th Amendment. Boasting an urgent density of detail and cunning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role and Tommy Lee Jones as Stevens Lincoln is a civics lesson that frequently brings life to the nations central political and moral debate. Just as important it joins Argo as a movie that dares to remind American moviegoers that its government can achieve great victories against appalling odds. (MORE Tony Kushner on Lincoln Screenplay Seances Greatest Political Speech ) In 1863 Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under his war powers as Commander in Chief. With the Civil War drawing to a close he needed a constitutional amendment to certify the abolition of slavery in all states Union as well as Confederate. To Lincoln and to the Senate that passed it the amendment would prove the truth of Thomas Jeffersons declaration that ""all men are created equal."" (Not all women mind you it would be six amendments and 55 years later before U.S. women got the vote.) But the House was divided between abolitionist Republicans and Confederate-leaning Democrats called Copperheads who invoked Scripture to oppose the law. As New York Democrat Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) thunders ""Congress must not declare equal those whom God has created unequal."" Like Obama who in 2009 deferred action on jobs legislation to spend nearly a year pushing his health care bill Lincoln is accused of delaying the wars end until the House has passed the 13th Amendment. But unlike Obama Lincoln eagerly cuts deals with wavering Congressmen employing cajolery patronage and veiled threats to secure the legislation. Ignoring the ethical clucking of his Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) Lincoln shows that to be a great statesman it doesnt hurt to be a savvy politician. (QUIZ Take the Four Score Quiz and Get TIMEs Lincoln Issue Free) As the director of this teeming fresco of idealism and compromise Spielberg is less the suave manager of emotions than the expert wrangler of crowds -- a talent he displayed in his 1997 Amistad another history lesson about black slaves and the Congress. In Lincoln he crams perhaps a hundred people into the frame during the House fracas. Though the movie spends little time on the battlefield the debate scenes are like war vignettes but with words for swords. Taking a visual cue from Ken Burns documentary epic The Civil War which covered much the same ground Spielberg employs tracking shots that move across the Congressmen then creep in for closeups. The difference is that here the photos move and engage in rhetoric that may be fierce eloquence or the standard flatulence of filibustering hacks. (Another touchstone to todays electors.) Abraham Lincoln is the movies favorite President with more than 300 portrayals in a century of Hollywood hagiography from Ralph Ince in the 1911 The Battle Hymn of the Republic to Benjamin Walker in this summers Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. In the decade of the 1910s Ince played Lincoln eight times John Fords actor brother Francis in another eight films and Benjamin Chapin 14 times. In the 1920s and 30s character actor Frank McGlynn Sr. made a career of Lincoln impersonation with more than a dozen films including John Fords The Prisoner of Shark Island Cecil B. DeMilles The Plainsman and with Shirley Temple The Littlest Rebel. Henry Fonda Raymond Massey Gregory Peck Charlton Heston Tom Hanks Sam Waterston Jason Robards and Hal Holbrook (who has a small role in Lincoln as presidential adviser Preston Blair) have all lent their faces and voices to extend the legend of the Great Emancipator. (VIDEO Steven Spielberg Daniel Day-Lewis Talk to TIME About Making Lincoln) The trick is to lend both plausibility and surprise to the portrayal and Day-Lewis in just his fifth film role in the 15 years since The Boxer meets the challenge smartly. Day-Lewis has always suggested an actor in isolation not just because of his fondness for remaining in character throughout the filming process but also because he seems so inner-directed debating not the other actors but himself. That technique suits Lincoln a remote and towering figure who wrestles in public with his own angels and demons -- and who speaks with apparent historical accuracy in a thin reedy voice that makes him sound like Walter Brennan with teeth. Day-Lewis Lincoln indulges the restlessness of his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) chafing to join the war and the dire presentiments of his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field bold and acute). ""You alone"" he tells Mary ""may lighten this burden or render it intolerable."" But the familys anguish however illuminating is not the Presidents or the movies chief concern. Lincoln sees any burden as tolerable to achieve his aims. The man has an amendment to pass and only then a war to win. He will win both with wit as well as grit drawing on his country boy-lawyer anecdotes that leaven the movies weighty tone even as they send his exasperated listeners eyebrows through their hairlines. ""I could write shorter sermons"" Abe acknowledges ""but once I start I get too lazy to stop."" At nearly 21/2 hours this high-IQ sermon is long but never lazy. Renouncing his tendency to make every movie take emotional flight Spielberg sticks to the story as Kushner has artfully compressed it. Lincoln is brain food and at another pivotal moment in American political history an instructive feast. MORE What Would Lincoln Do?

"Lincoln movie review by Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Lincoln A political animal of a different kind  Just in time for the election Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks his favorite movies involving real and fictional presidents. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Lincoln"" is a grave and surprisingly subtle magic trick conjuring the past and an almost ridiculously impressive figure in ways that transcend art direction and the right stovepipe hat. Director Steven Spielbergs latest combines the most commonly shared notions we have of our 16th U.S. president -- the folksy deliberation the spindly gait the all-seeing eye on the prize of history remade -- with the behavior idiosyncrasies and contradictions of an actual human being. It blends cinematic Americana with something grubbier and more interesting than Americana and it does not look act or behave like the usual perception of a Spielberg epic. It is smaller and quieter than that.There is pomp yes and the historical circumstance could scarcely be more formidable. Based on parts of the Doris Kearns Goodwin book ""Team of Rivals"" ""Lincoln"" focuses tightly on the final four months of its subjects life and his political maneuvering in support of the 13th Amendments abolition of slavery just as the Civil War was grinding to a close. Its a fascinating backroom movie hushed and intimate. Now and then the drama takes a back seat to the rhetoric. But this is one of the canniest explorations of a political animal in recent memory. The animal in question is played by Daniel Day-Lewis in a performance both iconic and gloriously human. While some may find the ""Lincoln"" screenplay by ""Angels in America"" dramatist and ""Munich"" co-screenwriter Tony Kushner daunting in its ardent devotion to language well ... I mean look if you cant turn an eloquent major writer loose on this president then where are we really? The subject matter Day-Lewis casual-seeming brilliance the collective authority of a supporting cast that could scarcely be improved These elements energize Spielbergs picture easily his most accomplished since ""Minority Report"" (a rather different sort of film) a decade ago.Last years Spielberg film ""War Horse"" pushed the Old Hollywood artifice to a breaking point and it had me wondering if Spielberg needed a change-up in terms of his longtime collaborators. They include cinematographer Janusz Kaminski production designer Rick Carter editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams. All have returned for duty on ""Lincoln."" And the results are exquisitely right. The picture does not go in for the hard sell. Spielbergs unfussy but highly expressive compositions evoke stately elements of John Ford (and in the more extreme foreground/background arrangement of actors in the frame Orson Welles). Mainly though this is Spielberg learning from himself and learning how and when not to push his technique out of insecurity or nervousness. There are images of Civil War carnage but battle footage in ""Lincoln"" is confined to a brief muddy bloody prologue recalling Welles ""Chimes at Midnight."" The first dialogue scene sets the tone and direction for the film. It is a conversation between Lincoln and first two African-American soldiers one of whom suspects his president may be more about words than deeds when it comes to equality of the races and then two white soldiers one of whom amusingly begins reciting lines from a Lincoln speech. The way this scene works (its one of the shrewdest things Kushner has ever written) were shown Lincoln first as the forbidding wonder in half-shadow the man of ""semi-divine stature"" as his Secretary of State William Henry Seward (David Strathairn) later calls him. Day-Lewis is marvelous however at finding little ummmms and hesitations and at locating what is very likely (though never to be proven) a truthful approximation of Lincolns thin reedy tenor speaking voice according to accounts of the day.""Lincoln"" makes full use of its 21/2 hours. We glimpse Lincoln at home in the White House with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field fiercely engaged) who has been through hell and back after the loss of their son. Her grief-borne hysteria has tried Lincolns patience to the point so posits the film that his domestic and political burdens seem roughly equal. For all that this is a marriage and a family wracked with melancholy and loss that knew love and camaraderie. Kushners big scene between Abe and Mary couldve used more of a setup -- its arresting but somewhat abrupt -- and yet you believe it. You believe their worst arguments mightve sounded like this.Mainly ""Lincoln"" focuses on what it took to get the 13th Amendment passed and the multifarious players involved either in its blockage or its passage. Tommy Lee Jones delivers a spectacularly good turn as Thaddeus Stevens Pennsylvanias ""radical Republican"" (remember the Republicans during Lincolns time were the liberal ones) whose devotion to the elimination of slavery drove his political opponents to distraction. A fictionalized trio of lobbyists ""skulky men"" charged with procuring Democratic votes in exchange for government positions are given great brio by James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson. Hal Holbrook Michael Stuhlbarg Gloria Reuben S. Epatha Merkerson and many more turn up for a scene or two sometimes three and while theres a Shakespearean history-play component to ""Lincoln"" the individual scenes rich in detail and sly revelations of character allow the flesh and blood to emerge from the debating. Throughout ""Lincoln"" Kushners skill in illuminating the margins of great events is on display. Key historical markers are addressed head-on briefly and often without dialogue such as Robert E. Lees surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox. Other images such as Lincolns battlefield survey on horseback strive for a classically mournful cinematic approach. The most lasting moments though are the unexpected details such as the way one anti-abolitionist (Byron Jennings) talks bitterly about ""this rash and dangerous amendment"" just as the hands of a slave maid enter the frame bearing a cup and saucer. Arm-twisting a political rival whose vote he needs Day-Lewis Lincoln at one point asserts how abolition will force America to ""extemporize and experiment"" its way forward. Nothing in Spielbergs film feels unplanned but the director allows himself simplicity as well as freedom in his approach to the material. The script may be highly verbal and it may not tell the whole truth about an extraordinarily complex leader. But I found it inspiring and Spielberg apparently felt the same way. mjphillipstribune.comLincoln -- 4 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for an intense scene of war violence some images of carnage and brief strong language)Running time 230Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Steven Spielberg Entertainment Movies Lincoln (movie 2012) Unrest Conflicts and War Slavery Politics and Government Film presidents ""You dont want what you think you already know."" 10 movies to see this winter 10 movies to see this fall Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1106-lincoln-20121108,0,2275346.column",200,lincoln34,lincoln,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Lincoln Steven Spielbergs new film about the last months of Abraham Lincolns life opens with an image that could double as a thumbnail for the entire American Civil War. In a shallow stream soldiers fight each other in a shoulder-to-shoulder battle that looks more like a free-for-all than military combat. They trade blows and bayonet thrusts in the mud in a bloody conflict that looks likely to leave no survivors. The Union soldiers are black which only underscores the point that at heart theyre fighting a war over slavery regardless of other factors. While that may seem too obvious a point to make in 2012 it wasnt always so and Lincoln is at heart a film about how history gets written how the laws that shape it get forged and how the messiness of both processes gets lost in time. In truth its more about that than it is about Lincoln (as played by Daniel Day-Lewis). Or at least it isnt the biopic its title suggests. Nor is it the war film suggested by that opening image. Written by Tony Kushner drawing from Doris Kearns Goodwins Team Of Rivals The Political Genius Of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln largely plays like a chamber drama about the difficulty of passing the 13th Amendment the piece of legislation ending slavery in the United States. It now seems obvious that the law was inevitable. But in the final months of the Civil War ending the conflict appeared to go hand-in-hand with letting the Confederacy keep its slaves. And even some on the Union side--more than a few--were appalled at the notion of guaranteeing freedom to African-Americans to say nothing of treating them as equals under the law. Above all Lincoln concerns itself with portraying the difficult process by which moral absolutes get transformed into laws. It isnt always a pretty or even honorable process. Its filled with backroom deals behind-the-scenes maneuvering compromise and gestures just short of bribery. From a knowing distance the president lets shady operators played by James Spader Tim Blake Nelson and John Hawkes use coercion and persuasion to win the votes needed to pass the bill while Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones letting go of the taciturn restraint of Hope Springs in a fiery performance) serves as the hectoring voice of morality. The film doesnt draw any direct parallels between politics then and politics now because it doesnt have to. Anyone paying attention wont miss the resemblance between the past and the present. The debate around the 13th Amendment takes up much of Lincolns running time and there are stretches where it seems like the film wants to demonstrate how history gets decided not on battlefields but in cramped quarters filled with bellowing men. As with Amistad Spielberg sometimes seems determined to make history come alive by focusing on its least naturally cinematic elements. Still its impossible for Spielberg to make an uncinematic film. With longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski he creates stunning interior compositions of deep shadows and piercing rays of light only occasionally interrupting the debates and maneuvering for stunning scenes like a presidential visit to a corpse-strewn battlefield that erases the distance between the corridors of power and those who fight and die to enact the goals decided within those corridors. Spielberg also packs the margins with telling details like the way Lincolns son Tad (Gulliver McGrath) is fixated on daguerreotypes of slave children or a brief exchange between the president and his wifes freed-slave confidant Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben) in which he admits how little he knows about the people hes fighting to free while she reveals that her happiness at the potential end of slavery comes tempered by her inability to imagine a future for African-Americans not informed by the oppression of the past. In that instance its almost possible to see the weight of history land on Lincolns shoulders. Day-Lewis captures both Lincolns human side and the qualities that turned him into an icon in his own lifetime portraying the charisma that made him such an effective politician as he wins over rooms with folksy stories that smuggle sharp points and uses his personal charm to bend others to his will. But it brings him back to Earth in fraught scenes with Mary Todd (Sally Field) and moments that reveal the personal toll exacted by all the bloodshed and conflict a burden Day-Lewis conveys more through body language than through words. Lincoln doesnt exactly underutilize Day-Lewis but his performance is so strong squaring with the Lincoln of history books while also creating a recognizably human character that the film suffers when its focus drifts elsewhere. It doesnt help that it only makes occasional attempts to tie the story of the 13th Amendment to Lincolns own evolving views on race. And the moments with Lincoln and his family are underdeveloped. Day-Lewis time with McGrath is unfailingly touching--particularly to those who know the childs fate--but Joseph Gordon-Levitts scenes as Robert Todd Lincoln end up going nowhere and the script gives Mary Todd a speech about how she fears shell be remembered only for her instability but barely gives her moments that arent defined by her instability. That said Lincoln is built around a magnetic Day-Lewis turn and the film is a memorable sometimes stirring look at how even the most righteous bill must struggle and even cheat to become a law. It demands a bigger stage than the one its given here. For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit Lincolns Spoiler Space.

Wisely director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner (""Munich"" ""Angels in America"") have avoided making ""Lincoln"" into a traditional biography -- theres no homework on the back of a shovel in coal no rail-splitting no debating Stephen A. Douglas. Instead working from historian Doris Kearns Goodwins book ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" the film abandons a macro approach focusing instead on the events of January 1865 and allowing Lincolns actions during that period to spell out everything that made him such a legend. The film opens with an intense battle sequence that suggests were about to get ""Saving Private Ryan"" with horses and bayonets when in reality the rest of the movie is going to be conversations and negotiations. (Its like how ""Whiteout"" put Kate Beckinsale in a shower scene in the first ten minutes to make up for the fact that shed be cloaked in a parka for the rest of the film.) After the battle President Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) talks to his troops including black soldiers who wonder how much of the freedom theyre fighting for will be coming their way after the war and white 19th-century fanboys who quote the Gettysburg Address back to him verbatim. The Civil War is winding down Lincoln has been re-elected and before his inauguration it is his intent to get enough votes in Congress to pass the 13th Amendment which would abolish slavery. Most of ""Lincoln"" concerns itself with the political machinations involved from hiring lobbyists (played by James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) to offer government jobs to Democrats in return for their votes to waylaying a delegation of Confederates led by CSA vice president Alexander Stephens (Jackie Earle Haley) to prevent them from arriving in Washington until after the legislation passes. There are some interludes involving Lincolns personal life mainly involving his son Roberts (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) desire to join the army which makes the presidents wife Mary (Sally Field) put even more pressure on him to end the war quickly lest they have to deal with the death of a second son but for the most part this is a movie about back-room politics. You dont have to be a C-SPAN junkie to find this kind of legislative sausage-making interesting -- take the songs out of ""1776"" for instance and its a story about getting the original Continental Congress to unanimously sign the Declaration of Independence. In a way ""Lincoln"" almost feels like a sequel to that movie; the Founding Fathers kicked the can of slavery down the road to appease the southern colonies and ""Lincoln"" sees those chickens come home to roost a mere 89 years later. Kushner has proven himself a master at making tricky material palatable ""Angels in America"" after all offers a lot more laughs than youd imagine from a story about AIDS Mormons and Jews. He paints Lincoln as a smart politician and devoted husband and father with a weakness for anecdotes (driving his cabinet up the wall with them in fact) and the movie manages that trick of creating suspense even though we already know the outcome. This is one of those films where every time a new personage appears on screen its a face you recognize; the closing credits should just read ""Co-starring the Screen Actors Guild."" Theres not a clunker in the bunch but this is Day-Lewis show all the way. You forget that youre watching an actor you know playing a larger-than-life figure; Day-Lewis both disappears into the role and makes Lincoln tenable and empathetic. The voice may occasionally suggest Walter Brennan but nothing about the performance ever feels forced or fake. The dreadful trailer makes ""Lincoln"" look like an awful collection of Spielbergian excesses including swelling John Williams moments (admittedly there are one or two) and Janusz Kaminskis honey-baked lighting (OK granted it appears but not too often) not to mention Tommy Lee Jones terrible wig (which actually winds up being organic in his memorable turn as Thaddeus Stevens). Dont let the marketing campaign keep you from seeing one of the best American movies this year and Spielbergs finest work in decades. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Own it Mr. Mrs. and Dr. America Were a big-hearted sappy got-damn people. We like our heroes homespun-folksy and our films directed by Steven Spielberg whether we admit it or not.Much has already been written about Daniel Day-Lewiss interpretation of the 16th U.S. president in Spielbergs Lincoln and specifically about the reedy Midwestern tenor he adopts for the role derived from the often-mocking historical documentation of political contemporaries and newspaper accounts. A sharp contrast with the stentorian elocution actors tend to adopt for the great emancipator its the most superficial and immediately apparent facet of this somehow almost 4-D character made flesh by Day-Lewis a vivid evocation of a man whom no living person ever knew and what amounts to the best guess of arguably the best actor of his generation.So thats one of the challenges Spielberg confronts squaring the Georgia white marble of the Lincoln Memorial with the flesh-and-blood reality we can never really know--evoking and honoring the man without diminishing the leader. The directors other challenges include relating a narrative about the complications and subtleties of political maneuvering and the inherent suckiness of the biopic form.Film Details Lincoln RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time150 More Info When you get beyond the technical and cosmetic aspects of Day-Lewiss performance--the attenuated voice gangling stride the actors striking physical similarity to the president--this Lincoln is quietly ironic an indulgent storyteller a charismatic leader. A politician by turns charmingly persuasive and iron-fisted. A melancholic who suffers deeply forced to barricade his grief behind a facade of steadiness and disarming humor. A father who sprawls on the floor with his young son and a husband whose wifes madness is no match for his affection. Day-Lewis is just crazy good.The film is studied and often somber but it is also hugely entertaining a bitchingly fun story of political gamesmanship influence trading patronage cronyism and outright bribery much of which involves a comic trio of lobbyists played by John Hawkes Tim Blake Nelson and the awesome James Spader.Spielberg avoids the biggest mistake screenwriters and directors make with biographical films TMI starting with the uteral fusing of protein chains and just letting the camera run until the subjects corpse decomposes into a skeleton and Ben Kingsley gets an Oscar. Instead he breaks with the form in two key ways. First he acknowledges that no matter how well-researched the film is a work of fiction and second lenses the portrait through the single most important event of the subjects life. Written by Tony Kushner and based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwins Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln the film dramatizes a single month in which the Republican party pushed for the 13th constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in the United States.From the perspective of contemporary political polarization Democrats can read the films parallels between Lincoln and Barack Obama effective leaders perceived by the extreme wings of their own parties as insufficiently dogmatic. And Republicans should be extraordinarily happy with Lincolns historical Republicanism particularly with the portrayal of Representative Thaddeus Stevens chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee an opponent of Lincoln who became a temporary ally for the purposes of passing the amendment. Played by Tommy Lee Jones who bears a remarkable resemblance to historical photos of the bewigged Stevens this is a sarcastic brilliant congressman whose radical opinions in favor of racial equality threaten to hoist him by his own cranky outspoken petard. Against steep congressional obstacles and bitter social headwinds the politically adroit Lincoln persuades and cajoles Stevens into tempering his rhetoric to ensure the amendments passage.The late-period Spielberg sometimes chooses his projects the same way grade school kids embark on term papers ""Abraham Lincoln was our greatest president."" ""World War II was a hard time."" Somehow ""Mommies should not abandon their robots"" gets in there too but the point is that like young people he favors giant world-bestriding themes. But then he pursues them from largely unexplored ground-level perspectives often rendering immediate and real what had previously been abstract. Battle scenes have never been the same since the landing at Omaha beach in Saving Private Ryan. Here Spielberg presents a gloomy White House in a dirty city of mud streets. The color saturation approaches black-and-white lending the film a kind of handmade intimacy much in keeping with the humanization of a figure best known from statues and pennies. Goodwin and such writers as Gore Vidal successfully imbued the man with a sense of humanity but filmmakers have usually tended toward a certain hagiographic tightness of ass. This Lincoln stunningly portrayed by Spielberg and Day-Lewis is real and relatable and so so cool. Oh and theres some orchestral bullshit by John Williams too if youre into that kind of thing.

"Review An epic Lincoln - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview An epic LincolnBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 11/07/2012 040000 AM PSTUpdated 11/08/2012 085632 AM PST In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers The Details Lincoln Sister Skyfall Skyfall The IMAX Experience This Must Be the Place Interviews with the stars hot new trailers The moment he first appears on the screen as the title character in ""Lincoln"" Daniel Day-Lewis reaches out grabs your attention and refuses to let go for the next two and a half hours.Day-Lewis is acknowledged as one of our great modern film actors and ""Lincoln"" only reinforces that view. He looks like he walked straight off a 5 bill or a Mathew Brady photograph. He is tall and stoop-shouldered with sunken cheeks and the haunted look of a man who has led his country through four years of a bloody civil war.Then Day-Lewis speaks and you are completely hooked. He talks in the high-pitched voice suggested by history books (and not previously used in a film about Lincoln). His plain speaking his way with a story and the wisdom of his words immediately make you feel like you are in the room with the 16th president of the United States.It is a mesmerizing performance and ""Lincoln"" would be worth seeing just for Day-Lewis. But there is more to Steven Spielbergs movie than that -- quite a bit more.If you think ""Lincoln"" is going to be another Civil War epic -- something certainly suggested by ads for the film -- you would be wrong. Working with a literate and lyrical script by playwright Tony Kushner Spielberg has crafted an intimate compelling drama. While the horror of the war permeates the entire movie there is just one short battle scene and one scene that takes Lincoln to the carnage of the battleground around Petersburg Va. The bulk of the film focuses on one crucial but nonbattlefield moment in Lincolns presidency the passage of the 13th Amendment which not only made freedom for the slaves part of the Constitution but granted them equality. Advertisement Lincoln has just been elected to his second term and the war is starting to wind down to what has become its inevitable conclusion. Lincoln realizes that the amendment passed by the Senate but stalled in House has to be approved before the conflict ends or it will be forever blocked by opponents.Drawing in part from Doris Kearns Goodwins best-seller ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" Kushners script gives us a ringside seat to Lincolns maneuvering (some of it more than a bit shady) to achieve his goal. An overture of peace from the Confederates is deflected. Jobs are offered arms twisted. He tries-- most often successfully sometimes not -- to move an array of colorful passionate politicians of the day around the chess board of Washington politics. Lincoln even grows testy with his own cabinet divided on the issue in a truly memorable scene draw largely from Goodwins book.It all culminates in the final vote on the amendment which even though you know how it turns out proves to be extraordinarily gripping.Beyond Day-Lewis towering presence what makes it all work is Kushners clever often witty dialogue and the cast Spielberg has pulled together an array of character actors drawn from both film and television. Tommy Lee Jones gets a showcase spot as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens the ill-tempered and sharp-tongued proponent of abolition who could derail everything with his refusal to compromise his beliefs. David Strathairn (""Good Night and Good Luck"") plays Secretary of State William H. Seward who may not have Lincolns vision but knows how to play the Washington game. Sally Field might technically be too old to be playing Mary Todd Lincoln but she makes the first lady often portrayed as completely mad a sympathetic if haunted character.Sometimes the use of TV actors with such clearly defined personas can be a bit of a problem. It may take you a bit to accept Jared Harris (""Mad Men"") as Ulysses S. Grant Walton Goggins (""Justified"") as a member of the House Gloria Reuben (""ER"") as Elizabeth Keckley and James Spader (""Boston Legal"") as a political operative. But you get over it fairly quickly and Spader in particular gives one of the liveliest performances in the film.""Lincoln"" does have one notable flaw. The vote is really the high point of the film but Spielberg goes beyond that to the assassination of Lincoln. The segment is perfectly fine but it feels tacked-on certainly unnecessary to a piece that should have ended with the moment when Lincoln leaves for Fords Theater.But in the end thats a minor complaint about one of the finest historical dramas ever committed to film. Its a triumph for Spielberg Kushner and most of all Day-Lewis.Follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.lincoln     Opens Friday in San Francisco; elsewhere Nov. 16Rating PG-13 (for language and some violence)Cast Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field David Strathairn and Tommy Lee JonesDirector Steven SpielbergRunning time 2 hours 29 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Okay. So Lincoln Steven Spielbergs bloated 50-million history lesson about Abraham Lincolns final days in office as he attempted by hook or crook to abolish slavery is noble civic-minded exhaustingly researched immaculately detailed crowded with a parade of cameos by good actors who look like Smith Brothers cough drop models and noteworthy for another critic-proof performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. It is all of those things. But Lincoln is also a colossal bore. It is so pedantic slow-moving sanitized and sentimental that I kept pinching myself to stay awake--which like the film itself didnt always work. The Civil War is in its fourth year. Lincoln has already signed his famous Emancipation Proclamation a year before his re-election to a second term. Now he wants an anti-slavery amendment to guarantee that the slaves he freed will stay that way forever protected by law. He needs votes from a hostile divided Congress to pass it. That means getting the support of Democrats--rabid right-wing conservatives in those days--as well as liberal left-wing Republicans. (How times have changed) And thats what Lincoln is about. People pining for a comfortable cinematic biopic about the controversial 16th president like those made in the past by Henry Fonda and Raymond Massey will be disappointed to learn that the films interminable self-indulgence sheds no new light on the life and death of the man himself. Based on the book Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin it boasts a dry ponderous screenplay by long-winded playwright Tony Kushner whose verbosity does to movies what a House filibuster does to action on a health-reform bill. Its a whopping drag. Instead of concentrating on Lincoln and the war that divided a nation the movie stays off the battlefield and focuses on the internecine shenanigans behind closed doors on Capitol Hill--the House debate the ranting and shouting the insults in both aisles of Congress the arguments defending and denouncing blacks. Instead of action we get intellectual ideas set forth while storming around conference tables behind the scenes of history. Ugly sets make 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue look like a rooming house. The sun never shines in 1865. Instead garish lighting filters through dirty windows into dark rooms that look like the inside of a Hershey syrup can. Into this matte-finish gloom marches a cumbrous crowd of expensive-dress extras most of whom Mr. Kushner never bothers to identify. Oh look its Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincolns oldest son Robert a rebellious college student who defies his parents wishes (every family has one). And theres David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward. Here comes John Hawkes as a lobbyist and an unidentifiable James Spader. Who is he playing? Hes gone before we get to know him. The ensemble enters through one door and exits through another Jared Harris as General Ulysses S. Grant and Jackie Earle Haley Hal Holbrook Tim Blake Nelson Joseph Cross and a cast of hundreds playing senators soldiers and servants. Jean Kennedy Smith the last surviving sibling in the Kennedy dynasty is listed in the credits as ""Woman Shouter."" Its that kind of movie. An endurance test with guest stars. Upstaging them all is Tommy Lee Jones as passionate abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who has all the bitchy lines and a secret black mistress to boot. Hes belligerent tortured and committed to the abolitionist cause (with personal motives that dont always extend to the countrys best interests). His cantankerousness gives the film a desperately needed pinch of comedy. And theres no mistaking the valuable contribution by Sally Field adding fire in an inspired performance as Mary Todd Lincoln the woman behind the man. Daniel Day-Lewis does what he can to delve beneath the legend and make Lincoln an ordinary man Lincoln telling corny jokes Lincoln visiting the wounded in a military hospital Lincoln talking turkey with black soldiers Lincoln threatening his wife with the madhouse for her grief over her favorite son killed in battle Lincoln fumbling with his hands yet writing speeches that changed history with clarity of vision. But his power is diminished by a script that forces him to explain his theory of equality by quoting Euclid on the rules of mechanical reasoning. In reality Lincoln believed in equality under the law but not racial equality; he had no use for blacks and maintained a strong personal belief that whites were a superior race. In his efforts to get his amendment passed Honest Abe was not so honest either. He and his cabinet of rivals were not above bribery lies suspending habeas corpus or bending the Constitution to break the Souths economic infrastructure. These are facts Spielberg conveniently overlooks. The title is misleading. Lincoln is about the votes not the man. Im more interested in the way the movie shows the terrible physical toll the passage of the 13th Amendment took on the mans life than in the disparate personalities he fought cajoled and strong-armed in order to pass it. The movie ends on Saturday April 15 1865 when Mary bosses her reluctant bone-weary husband into the carriage that takes them to Fords Theatre. There is no mention of the name John Wilkes Booth. In all theres too much material too little revelation and almost nothing of Spielbergs reliable cinematic flair. But on the plus side there is nuance and wit and Daniel Day-Lewis always makes you care. And you cant deny the timing of Lincoln. In a divisive election year when the Sunday morning pundits knock themselves out debating whether the political system still works its a good time to revisit a year when it did. rreedobserver.com LINCOLN Running Time 120 minutes Written by Tony Kushner (screenplay) and Doris Kearns Goodwin (book) Directed by Steven Spielberg Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field and David Strathairn 2/4 Comment Filed under Abraham Lincoln Daniel Day-Lewis Emancipation Proclamation movie Movie Review Slavery Steven Spielberg Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/11/lincoln-rex-reed-daniel-day-lewis-tommy-lee-jones/,200,lincoln40,lincoln,com/2012/11/lincoln-rex-reed-daniel-day-lewis-tommy-lee-jones/

Day-Lewis looks so much like the photographs of Abraham Lincoln that you dont have to squint even a bit to buy that its him. He nails Lincolns thousand-yard stare -- a gaze directed at once inward (at the whir of his own mental machinery) and outward (at the cosmic hum of history). Day-Lewis performance has a beautiful gravitas yet theres nothing too severe about it. He gives Lincoln a surprisingly plainspoken reedy high voice that retains the courtly cadences of the South. That voice -- from everything we know its quite accurate -- makes Lincoln sound like Will Rogers as a professor of human nature. This Lincoln lives deep inside his own unruly-haired head yet he loves the people around him even the ignorant (and racist) common folk who repay the favor by loving him back. And thats where he draws his political force. Lincoln which Spielberg has directed from a lyrical ingeniously structured screenplay by Tony Kushner is one of the most authentic biographical dramas Ive ever seen. But that doesnt mean its a stiff-jointed history lesson. The movie is grand and immersive. It plugs us into the final months of Lincolns presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine. (Kushner is the husband of EW columnist Mark Harris.) Most of the film unfolds in January 1865 shortly after Lincolns reelection when he knows that the North is going to win the Civil War. The real battle for him now is the fight against slavery. Three commissioners from the Confederacy head up to Washington City and Lincoln is confident that he could have their surrender within a week. But before that can happen he is driven to pass the 13th Amendment which would outlaw slavery. The Democrats hate the amendment and even Lincolns liberal Republican comrades want him to delay the vote. Only Lincoln grasps the stakes that once the Civil War is over the amendment wont pass -- it will be blocked by the Southern states. Winning the war could prove a Pyrrhic victory. Only by threading the amendment through the eye of a legislative needle can he alter the course of history. Lincoln features a great deal of incendiary speech-making on the floor of the House of Representatives and Kushners script which is based in part on the Doris Kearns Goodwin book Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln has a lot of fun weaving insults of astonishing brazenness into oratory that lays bare the issues in all their gripping moral complexity. Spielberg denying himself visual fireworks frames the action with a kind of stately tension. He thrillingly demythologizes Lincoln by placing us inside Lincolns experience -- shut up by himself (or with his querulous cabinet) in the drab meeting rooms of the White House or in his bedroom with the ambitious haunted Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) who still blames Abe for the death of their son Willie. Fields performance is shattering -- in a few furious scenes she redefines this First Lady as a woman whose supposed madness reflected a humane fervor as sterling as her husbands. As the congressional fight rages on Lincoln orchestrates it all. He seduces cajoles begs and tyrannizes. He offers patronage jobs -- bribes -- to the Democratic congressmen who support slavery. He courts but also tamps down the influence of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) the abolitionist whos so possessed by the cause that he might alienate any congressman on the fence. And through it all Lincoln must delay the wars end -- without breaking the peoples faith. The Lincoln we see here is that rare movie creature a heroic thinker. He has the serpentine intellect of a master lawyer infused with a poets passion. Lincoln brilliantly dramatizes the delicacy of politics along with the raw brutality of it. All thats pushing the amendment forward is Abe Lincolns will his ability to do anything -- even flirt with impeachable deceptions -- to fulfill his vision of justice. And thats why he spends the movie alone in spirit. When he bangs his hand on the table roaring at his lobbyists to procure him the votes he needs because hes ""clothed in immense power"" were seeing the birth of the presidency as we know it -- a force that can shape the consciousness of the world. Lincoln is a stirring paradox a dream of history as it might truly have happened.

Nor is every film director a visionary (though that should be part of the job description). In the case of the magnificently wonky Lincoln a political movie that ranks among giants like All the Presidents Men theres an unusually strong marriage between subject and maker. The scene that should have begun the film comes about ten minutes in after a smoky battlefield clash intended for the red-meat crowd. Daniel Day-Lewis transformed into a chatty stovepipe-hatted leader tells his wife about a nightmare in which he stands on the deck of a ship racing toward a foggy horizon. The fantasy is eerily quiet; even via the homey cadence of the actors soft narration theres a mysticism to it. Steven Spielberg has always been great when it comes to monologues like this; you can see wonderment swirling with fear as early as Jaws and Robert Shaws midnight tale of sailors fighting off sharks. Tony Kushners Lincoln script is freighted with similar unease--how could it not be?--but the movie thats come from it has a playful vigor a love of words and storytelling. Abraham Lincoln we learn drove his war secretary to apoplexy with gabby tangents; he told awkward jokes quoted liberally from scripture (""actually I have no idea what you mean by that"" one Cabinet member snaps) and inspired telegraph operators with offhand lessons from Euclid. Stealthily like its rambling language Lincoln arrives without the typical birth-to-death arc and thank Abe for that. Instead its mainly about the passage of the 13th Amendment (the one that abolished slavery) compressing all of its insights into a handful of contentious months in 1865. Its not your typical ""great man"" movie but something juicier a Sorkinesque peek into 19th-century congressional machinations and vote-engineering. Dont be scared by that. Lincoln is meant for todays audiences riveted by polls processes and hourly updates. Just as youre wrapping your head around how verbal Spielbergs latest is along come the performances that elevate his movies to the stratosphere. Apart from Day-Lewiss mighty turn--poised between clomping Illinois farm lawyer and brooding thinker--theres career-high work from Tommy Lee Jones as Republican scowler Thaddeus Stevens a fierce abolitionist who learns to compromise for the greater good. Sally Field scores as a frenetic First Lady and even old rascal Hal Holbrook gets to steal the picture for a bit as a pained peacemaker. If this is Oscar bait then that term has somehow been radically altered. (Leave it to Spielberg to rewrite the rules.) Defiantly intellectual complex and true to the shifting winds of real-world governance Lincoln is not the movie that this election season has earned--but one that a more perfect union can aspire to.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 4 2012 ShareThis (Photo David James/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox) Four score and seven filmsat leastmight have been contrived from events in the life of Abraham Lincoln but in Lincoln Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner home in on a narrow segment a few short months in 1865 before Lincoln was shot. The focus is not on the civil war that took hundreds of thousands of American lives or the assassination that came less than a week after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. (Lincolns death is the films tragic denouement not its climax.) The prism through which Spielberg and Kushner view the sixteenth president of the United States is politicsthe fine and coarse art of persuasion the machine in a democracy through which ideals are translated into legislation and legislation into law. By Spielbergian standards Lincoln is a nuanced knotty bridled piece of filmmaking an exercise in restraint. But Spielberg is a great film artist and that tone evokes the spirit of his subjectthe deep sadness the expansive sardonic wit the hardscrabble lawyerly intelligence. By the time the movie ends you dont feel as if you know Lincolnfew in his own time claimed to know him. But you feel as if you know what it was like to be in his presence. And so an icon (its a measure of how promiscuously that word is thrown around that it seems inadequate for one of historys truly iconic figures) has become a manand startlingly within reach. All this despite a stinkeroo first dialogue scenea real comedown after the chilling prologue a rain-soaked skirmish in which black Union soldiers go bayonet to bayonet with rebels and no man dies without an agonizing struggle. Then Spielberg introduces the president (Daniel Day-Lewis) from behind his monumental head gazing down at a pair of African-American survivors one awestruck the other inclined to press his case (respectfully) for Negroes to be paid the same as whites. The exchange sounds both too modern (You got springy hair for a white man) and too corny (they and others quote at length from the Gettysburg Address). But in its clunky way it serves a purpose. Lincoln is already halfway to a memorialwhich gives him more pause than anyone. And it quickly establishes the central issue. The Emancipation Proclamation freed black people but didnt make them equal. Actually it didnt even free them fully. It was an executive order in a time of warand the war was almost over. Hence the need for the Thirteenth Amendment which doesnt yet have the two-thirds majority to pass. Early on theres a lot of political shoptalk not all of it easy to follow especially with Day-Lewis looking so distractingly Lincolnesque. Theres no record of Lincolns voice or of how he moved but Day-Lewis captures what contemporaries described as a mysterious private sadnessas well as the ability to shake it off and be suddenly open and generous. Its a running joke here (as it was apparently in life) that Lincoln would launch into an illustrative anecdote or quotation at the drop of a stovepipe hat. But those stories are enthrallingand what a beautiful tall brow the actor has to furrow. Day-Lewis speaks in a soft cracked voice (with a hint still of the sonorous John Hustonesque quiver he developed for There Will Be Blood) and you can taste Lincolns pleasure in choosing each word in lulling his listeners with indirection before driving the point homeas when he likens his cabinet to pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters and declares I am the president of the United States clothed in immense power and you will procure me these votes He has a formidable team from David Strathairns powerfully prim Seward (once Lincolns rival for the Republican presidential nomination) to the trio of lobbyists dispatched to bend ears and twist arms to bribe and to lie rangy John Hawkes swollen-chested mustachioed James Spader and spring-heeled Tim Blake Nelson. We thrill to their escapades because theyre on Lincolnsourside but its depressing to see what pitiful cowards some of their targets are. (The racist states-rights bad guys are Democrats the liberals Republicanswhich means you have to do a little pirouette in your head whenever the party names are dropped.) Tommy Lee Jones eyes sagging under a thick-locked toupee has the scene-stealing role as the riotously belligerent abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. Counseled to play nice to say he doesnt believe that blacks should be equal only that they should be equal before the law his Stevens gazes on opponents with the bile rising in his throat visibly tortured by having to betray his ideals for the sake of a vote. But it is of course a vote that will change the course of historyin the right direction. 1 2 Next Share this story...

On Monday night the 50th edition of the festival continued that tradition by unveiling a supposed work-in-progress cut of Steven Spielbergs talky period drama ""Lincoln."" In both cases the festival used the slot to make room for a renowned filmmaker expanding his range but while Scorsese aimed big with an advanced CGI spectacle the Spielberg effort showcased the filmmakers uncharacteristic willingness to recede into the material resulting in a stagy hyper-literate drama that begs comparisons to his ""Amistad"" while towering over it thanks to a handful of measured performances and Tony Kushners heavy screenplay. There are moments in ""Lincoln"" when typical Spielberg-grade sentimentalism from the soundtrack to countless histrionic outbursts encroach on the storys more subdued qualities. But theres a noticeable consistency to the movies internal battles; this is after all a Civil War tale. Unlike ""Hugo"" which had uncompleted CGI imagery in its opening shot at the NYFF screening ""Lincoln"" looked like a finished product -- although Ive been advised that since the movie officially premieres in the closing night slot at AFI Fest next month an embargo remains in place so bonafide ""Lincoln"" reviews must wait. Instead consider this a descriptive guide to the movies distinctive qualities. The main takeaway Dont trust the trailer. The handful of scenes excerpted in the fleeting teasers released in recent weeks highlight the clumsier scenes involving Lincolns persistence in passing the 13th Amendment during the tense period when he campaigned for members of Congress to ratify the constitution in early 1864 four months before his assassination. With Daniel Day Lewis predictably embodying the presidents lanky figure and wise gaze and calculated delivery ""Lincoln"" tracks much of these developments through low key exchanges alternately unfolding in backroom strategy sessions and in grand showdowns on the floor of the House of Representatives. At two hours and 30 minutes or so (no one was quite sure of the runtime beforehand) ""Lincoln"" contains only a single battle scene in its opening seconds. The rest is pure talk a keen dramatization of Doris Kearns Goodwins tome ""Team of Rivals"" that delivers an overview of Lincolns crowning achievement in chunks of strategy talk. Ostensibly a well-acted history lesson it captures the turmoil of the period by observing Lincoln at work rather than wasting time valorizing him. Unlike John Fords ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" or D.W. Griffiths ""Abraham Lincoln"" Spielbergs focused approach compresses the portrait of an icon into a collection of conversations that oscillate between his professional life and the more uncertain challenges he faced in his relationship with his mentally unstable wife Mary Todd (Sally Field who lands a handful of frenzied monologues) and his children including the grown son Robert Todd Lincoln (a barely-seen Joseph Gordon Levitt) whose interest in joining the war gives the president a personal reason to end it. While hes still a dynamic morally upstanding figure Day Lewis Lincoln at least displays a fair amount of conflict. But he isnt the only star of the show. As smarmy Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens a loudmouthed member of the House more offensive in his approach to implement the 13th Amendment for reasons keenly revealed only at the movies end Tommy Lee Jones frequently provides moments of comic relief with his usual deadpan routine. Fields assaultive treatment of Lincoln whenever he hesitates on his goal also kicks up the movies energy whenever the proceedings turn dry. Nevertheless the motivating force of ""Lincoln"" belongs to its leading man whose screen presence is a wonder to behold even when he says nothing. Many scenes featuring arguments between members of Lincolns brain trust or opposing figures in the House find the president sitting with his head down and quietly listening as Lewis simply inhabits the character. In many of these scenes he breaks the silence with a jarringly shrill (but historically accurate according to most reports) delivery. He makes the case for Lincolns lasting appeal by realizing Lincolns personality with a mixture of charisma and humility. Theres not much to ""Lincoln"" aside from the president and his peers engaging in discourse on the many reasons to abolish slavery. The constant chatter alone makes it stand out in the filmmakers oeuvre. When I spoke to the director last year he said he felt no need to remain tethered to large scale storytelling. ""If I found a story and felt empowered to want to direct it and it was just a couple of characters in a room I would do it"" he said. Thats essentially ""Lincoln"" in a nutshell although Spielbergs choice of characters and the rooms they stand in mean the stakes are still pretty high. ""This has been a journey down through history unlike any Ive done"" he said to last nights audience. He got that right. Aided by Kushners script ""Lincoln"" is seriously muted compared to anything Spielberg has done before. ""The West Wing"" by way of a costume drama it tracks the abolition of slavery as a series of negotiations with major ramifications only transparently stated in the final scenes. ""This is history"" someone actually exclaims. Indeed it is and with all that talking ""Lincoln"" eventually runs out of breath but not before making it clear that the 65-year-old Spielberg most certainly has not.

Abraham Lincoln may not technically be the subject of Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" but Daniel Day-Lewis is inarguably its star delivering an unimpeachable performance as the United States 16th president in a shrewd stately and somewhat stuffy drama focused on a narrow yet defining chapter of Lincolns life abolishing slavery via the passage of a Constitutional amendment. Though historians will surely find room to quibble every choice Day-Lewis makes lends dignity and gravitas to Americas most revered figure resulting in an event movie whose commercial and critical fate rides on the reputations of not just Lincoln but the esteemed creative team as well. Too seldom does American cinema deal with the countrys most shameful policy the paradox by which a nation founded on equality might allow the subjugation and servitude of one race to persist for nearly a century. Spielberg however has faced the issue head-on not just once (""The Color Purple"") or twice (""Amistad"") but three times confronting it most directly -- at the very core of the policy -- in ""Lincoln."" The title functions as something of a misnomer considering that the president here serves as the instrument to emancipation and not the actual focus of the film as if ""Amistad"" had been released as ""Quincy Adams."" Liberally adapted from Doris Kearns Goodwins 2005 book ""Team of Rivals"" Tony Kushners script dramatizes the behind-the-scenes story of the wheeling and dealing required to pass the 13th Amendment -- undoubtedly the legacy for which Lincoln hoped to be remembered not realizing how compelling audiences would find every aspect of his private life 144 years later. The theater-trained scribe who previously co-wrote ""Munich"" for the director defies what admirers expect of a Spielberg-made Lincoln biopic. In place of vicarious emotion and tour de force filmmaking ""Lincoln"" offers a largely static intellectual reappraisal of the great orator limiting not only the scenery chewing but also the scenery itself in what amounts to Spielbergs most play-like production yet; its a style that will keep many viewers at arms length. Emphasizing talk over action Kushner concentrates on Lincolns strategy of forcing an unpopular and recently defeated policy through a lame-duck House of Representatives. Enlisting three buffoonish vote-buyers (James Spader John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) the executive doesnt hesitate to exploit his immense powers which extend to offering cushy government jobs pardons and other presidential privileges to those willing to embrace his position. This is politics as it is really played yet few writers have found a way to make it as compelling as Kushner does here. That success owes in part to the extensive character-actor ensemble Spielberg and casting director Avy Kaufman have enlisted repaying them with dramatic roles for not only Lincolns entire cabinet (most prominently David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward) but more than a dozen key allies and opponents of the 13th Amendment including Lee Pace as a showboating Democrat Michael Stuhlbarg as a conscience-conflicted swing voter and David Costabile as the doubting Thomas among Lincolns closest supporters. Despite occasional digressions into spectacular but artificial-looking Civil War battlefields the action is rowdiest on the floor of Congress where Republican representative Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) trades scathing barbs with such ideological rivals as George Pendleton (Peter McRobbie who more closely resembles frown-creased portraits of the real-life Stevens than Jones does). Though the film inevitably deals with Lincolns assassination notably played offscreen the climax comes during the Congressional vote itself in which Spielberg allows the names of historys heroes to ring out the way he previously did those saved on Schindlers list. Even more effective is the way Kushner integrates the full text of the Gettysburg Address and the 13th Amendment into the body of the film. Still since audiences inevitably prefer personal intrigue to the inner workings of politics Kushner laces ""Lincoln"" with details about first lady ""Molly"" (Sally Field) as Abe called his wife Mary and sons Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and Robert (Joseph Gordon Levitt) who withdraws from Harvard in order to enlist in the Union army despite his fathers adamant demands to the contrary. Still these human-interest scenes seem to get in the way of the story at hand offering valuable intimate glimpses of the Lincolns as seldom seen before yet inorganic to the abolition of slavery -- save one powerful scene when Mary having already lost one son and loathe to watch Robert perish in the Civil War publicly threatens her husband ""If you fail to acquire the necessary votes woe unto you you will have to answer to me."" Spielberg and Kushner hold this truth to be self-evident that behind every powerful man is a woman pushing him toward greatness. Informed largely by Goodwins research ""Lincoln"" presents an image of the president very different from the melancholy figure so often seen before. Such crushing grief falls instead to Field whose long-suffering Mary endured debilitating migraines and deep depression after the death of their son Willie but also scandalously overspent in her efforts to outfit the White House -- and herself -- to a level she felt befitting the first family. Curiously Mary was a decade Abrahams junior though Field is actually a decade older than Day-Lewis creating an odd almost maternal dynamic between the two actors. Meanwhile Day-Lewis plays Lincoln as a physically awkward but not unhandsome figure gentle with his children uncomfortable with ceremony (his disdain of calfskin gloves becomes a running joke) and firm when needed with colleagues who could not always see the wisdom in the man some considered ""the capitulating compromiser."" This Lincoln is a lover of theater and avid raconteur who easily quotes from Shakespeare and scripture a man who problem-solves via storytelling -- an impression that naturally flatters those in Spielberg and Kushners profession. Perhaps that explains the staginess of ""Lincolns"" telling right down to the creak of the boards under the great orators feet and d.p. Janusz Kaminskis conservative framing which recalls either classic prosceniums or heavily shadowed Renaissance paintings. Though incongruous with the psychological realism that Kushner through elevated dialogue aims to achieve this iconic style suits such a beloved persona. And yet Lincolns life takes a backseat to the ideological battle between two opposing ideas -- an end to slavery or an end to war. The result looks as much like a Natural History Museum diorama as it sounds a respectful but waxy re-creation that feels somehow awe-inspiring yet chillingly lifeless to behold the great exception being Jones alternately blistering and sage turn as Stevens. Production values are as elegant as one would expect from Spielberg grittier but no less impressionistic than last years ""War Horse."" John Williams score which seemingly incorporates hymns marches and other period music offers vital but unobtrusive support.

TWITTER Daniel Day-Lewis stars as the 16th president in the historical drama directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner. Far from being a traditional biographical drama Lincoln dedicates itself to doing something very few Hollywood films have ever attempted much less succeeded at showing from historical example how our political system works in an intimate procedural and personal manner. That the case in point is the hair-breadth passage by the House of Representatives of the epochal 13th Amendment abolishing slavery and that the principal orchestrator is President Abraham Lincoln in the last days of his life endow Steven Spielbergs film with a great theme and subject which are honored with intelligence humor and relative restraint. Tony Kushners densely packed script has been directed by Spielberg in an efficient unpretentious way that suggests Michael Curtiz at Warner Bros. in the 1940s right down to the rogues gallery of great character actors in a multitude of bewhiskered supporting roles backing up a first-rate leading performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The wall-to-wall talk and lack of much Civil War action might give off the aroma of schoolroom medicine to some but the elemental drama being played out bolstered by the prestige of the participants and a big push by Disney should make this rare film about American history pay off commercially. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More First unveiled at an unannounced sneak preview at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 8 Lincoln will receive its official world premiere on Nov. 8 at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles in advance of its Nov. 9 limited opening and wider release Nov. 16. Concentrating on the tumultuous period between January 1865 and the conclusion of the Civil War on April 9 and Lincolns assassination five days later on Good Friday this is history that plays out mostly in wood-paneled rooms darkened by thick drapes and heavy furniture and increasingly in the intimate House chamber where the strength of the anti-abolitionist Democrats will be tested against Lincolns moderates and the more zealous anti-slavery radicals of the young Republican Party. Occasionally there are glimpses of life outside the inner sanctums of government first on the battlefield where black Union troops join in the vicious hand-to-hand combat where the mud renders the gray and blue uniforms all but indistinguishable then in the dusty streets of the nations capital and in the verdant surrounding countryside. PHOTOS 22 of Hollywoods Best Presidents in Movies and TV The stiffest challenge facing Kushner was to lay out enough exposition in the early going to give viewers their bearings while simultaneously jump-starting the films dramatic movement. Quite a bit of information simply has to be dropped in quickly to get it over with -- Mary Todd Lincolns continuing depression over the death of a son three years earlier her husbands re-election the previous November the need for Lincoln to win over some 20 Democrats to achieve the two-thirds majority required to pass -- but the estimable playwright who won a Pulitzer for 1992s Angels in America  mostly manages to cover so many mandatory issues by plausibly making them the subjects of the characters vivid conversation. Particularly helpful in this regard are the intimate talks between Lincoln (Day-Lewis) and his most valued adviser Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) as well with his partys founder Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook a famous Lincoln in his own time). Having signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and gotten easy Senate passage of the 13th Amendment the previous April Lincoln is determined to push the House to act quickly and put his signature on the new law by Feb. 1 before the war is likely to end. What follows is a course in political persuasion in all its forms cajoling intimidation promises horse-trading strong-arming and intellectual persuasion down-home style. In conversation and physical movement Lincoln is a deliberate fellow who takes his time a country lawyer whose rumpled exterior conceals abiding principles and an iron will a man of no personal vanity or fancy education who is nevertheless unafraid to cite Euclid notably in his equation of equality = fairness = justice with which Lincoln frames the slavery issue. STORY At Lincoln Screening Daniel Day-Lewis Explains How He Formed the Presidents Voice Fundamentally unhappy in his family life with his almost continually complaining wife Mary (a very good Sally Field) who despairs of being condemned to ""four more years in this terrible house"" and oldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a college lad desperate to enlist in the Army over his parents objections Lincoln seems to find the greatest pleasure in spinning amusing life-lesson yarns dating to his lawyering days. The film accrues much-needed levity from these interludes less from the stories themselves than from the reactions of his captive audiences; by the third or fourth time Lincoln embarks on one of his tales the polite attention paid by his listeners has descended to ""here-he-goes-again"" eye-rolling and ill-concealed smirking. As he demonstrated in Angels in America Kushner -- who co-wrote Munich for Spielberg -- is adept at juggling a huge number of characters without confusion. One of the main subplots details the efforts of three Republican roustabouts (James Spader John Hawkes Tim Blake Nelson) to use any means necessary to change some minds on the Democratic side while at Lincolns behest delaying a high-level Confederate delegation making its way to Washington to talk peace. There also are occasional glimpses of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris) trying to discern whether the South is ready to call it quits. PHOTOS Steven Spielberg on Set But increasingly attention focuses on Pennsylvania Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) a lifelong activist for absolute equality among the races philosophically opposed to going along with a watered-down law. The loss of his and other radical Republicans support would spell disaster for Lincoln who in all events faces a massive challenge that calls on all the political personal and persuasive skills he has honed over a lifetime. At the films center then lies one of the remarkable characters in world history at the critical moment of his life. As Walt Whitman said of Lincoln (as he did of himself) ""he contained multitudes"" and Day-Lewis sly slow-burn performance wonderfully fulfills this description. Gangly grizzled and as his wife was known to say ""not pretty"" this Lincoln plainly shows his humble origins and is more disheveled than his Washington colleagues. With an astonishing physical resemblance to the real man Day-Lewis excels when shifting into what was perhaps Lincolns most comfortable mode that of frisky storyteller especially in the way he seems to anticipate and relish his listeners reactions. But he also is a hard-nosed negotiator with that critical attribute of great politicians in a democracy an unyielding inner core of principle cloaked by a strategic willingness to compromise in the interests of getting his way. A long scene in which he hashes things out with his cabinet (the single most explicit evocation of Doris Kearns Goodwins book Team of Rivals the one credited partial source of the screenplay) vividly exhibits his skills in action. The rare moments when Lincoln loses his temper are startling but also hint that his outbursts might be preplanned for effect. VIDEO Extended Lincoln Trailer Lincoln seems most ill-at-ease in domestic exchanges with his family especially with his harping wife to whose repetitive complaints her husband cannot possibly invent any new answers even if her sorrow is rooted in genuine depression. The dramatic and raucous vote on the 13th Amendment is both exhilarating and unexpectedly humorous with much shouting threatening and fist-waving fence-straddling Democrats being shamed by their colleagues and a gallery audience (including some blacks) hanging on every yeah and nay climaxed of course by the exaltation of victory. Appomattox with proud Gen. Robert E. Lee high on his white horse is briefly shown and Kushner and Spielberg have invented a novel way of portraying the fateful events at Fords Theatre that doesnt even show John Wilkes Booth. For whatever reason the filmmakers have skipped the ripe opportunity to portray one of the most extraordinary and haunting episodes of this entire period that of Lincolns nearly solitary early-morning walk through the streets of Richmond. The partly burning city had just been abandoned by the Confederate government and Lincoln increasingly became surrounded by awestruck suddenly free blacks who could scarcely believe who had just entered their midst some reacting as if he were Jesus incarnate. Finally arriving at the capitol building he entered the office of Confederate President Jefferson Davis sat in his chair and quietly drank a glass of water. STORY Steven Spielberg on 60 Minutes Why Hes Done With Action Movies and Other Revelations In the event Spielberg directs in a to-the-point self-effacing style with only minor instances of artificially inflated emotionalism and a humor that mostly undercuts eruptions of self-importance. Its a conscientious piece of work very much in the service of the material in the manner of the good old Hollywood pros without frills or grandiosity. At the same time however it lacks that final larger dimension and poetic sense such as can be found in John Fords great 1939 Young Mr. Lincoln to which Spielbergs film is a biographical and thematic bookend. Further helping matters is the mostly subdued score by John Williams whose over-the-top contribution to War Horse last year proved so counterproductive to that films effect. Working predominantly in shades of blue and black cinematographer Janusz Kaminski takes a similarly straightforward approach while the period evocation achieved by many hands led by production designer Rick Carter costume designer Joanna Johnston and the makeup and hair team is detailed and lacking in embalmed fastidiousness. Other than Day-Lewis acting honors go to Jones who clearly relishes the rich role of Stevens and whose crusty smarts prove both formidable and funny. Very much a good guy here Stevens in earlier cinematic days was always portrayed as an extremist villain both in The Birth of a Nation and in the odd 1943 Andrew Johnson biographical drama Tennessee Johnson.
