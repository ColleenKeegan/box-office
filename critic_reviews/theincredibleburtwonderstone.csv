"The Week in Movies Answering The Call and the Soporific Powers of Burt Wonderstone << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Week in Movies Answering The Call and the Soporific Powers of Burt Wonderstone Sony Halle Berry March 14 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes all people in an audience want is to be wanted even when theyre not. They get desperate to stop minding their own business and start minding a movies instead. For instance when a teenage girls been snatched from a mall parking lot and thrown into a trunk then comes this close to being rescued by a stranger some people in the audience think that girl needs some encouragement. So they yell to her ""Scream bitch. Scream"" Even after a cut to the inside of the truck reveals that the girls abductor is ready to impale her cheek with a screwdriver were she to scream some people in the audience need her to take that risk anyway. God willing every audience for The Call will have that person who thinks hes just on the phone with a friend or stuck in traffic or totally by himself in the theater. They dont make enough thrillers like this anymore ones you can talk to ones that uncannily enough seem to listen. The night I saw the movie when one character drops a phone about 15 feet into a shaft someone in the audience said ""Damn I would have to go down there and get that."" And down into the shaft the character went. This is a cleverly made smartly written totally satisfying armrest-gripper that begins in a Los Angeles 911 call center where a veteran named Jordan Turner makes the rookie mistake of calling back a teenager who thinks her assailant has left the house. The bad guy hears the phone ring and the teen winds up dead. Because Jordan is played by Halle Berry the murder makes her do things like fan her teary eyes and doubt her skill. It Haunts Her. Six years later Jordans removed herself from the call center floor and leads training sessions for aspiring operators. But its just like the James Brown routine where somebody puts a cape over him because hes too tired to go on then he pops throws off the cape and keeps performing. Thats Halle Berry in The Call. During one of Jordans training tours the movie cuts away to two teens walking around a mall. One leaves. The other Casey (Abigail Breslin) is left to walk to her car alone where shes promptly stuffed into the trunk by a lunatic. Luckily she has her friends disposable cell phone and calls 911 where an operator is standing by. Eventually that operator becomes Jordan who tries to avoid taking the call the way you avoid having someone pass you the phone when whoevers on the other end is the last person youd ever want to talk to. Jordans eyes well right up with post-traumatic stress but she pulls herself together and gets Casey to stop mewling and whining and shrieking. Kick out the taillights. Theres paint back there with you? Pour it through the hole where the taillight was. At some point early on while Caseys freaking out Jordan learns that theyre both Capricorns. ""Were fighters"" the woman tells the girl. Thats the moment I knew The Call would hit the spot. Its a line you put on a mental Post-it. Like 2004s Cellular another enjoyable chiller built around crime and mobile technology The Call is the rare horror film in the last decade or so to forgo metaphysics the supernatural and source material that was first a hit in Asia. Lately its just a bunch of computer-generated effects crying wolf. Until someone finds a way to make us truly afraid again of ghosts and demonic possessions were fine being scared by stuff that happens on Nancy Grace and Criminal Minds. The director of The Call is Brad Anderson; Richard DOvidio wrote the script. Anderson began in the mid-1990s in independent romances (Next Stop Wonderland Happy Accidents) and has settled into a balance of chillers (Session 9 The Machinist) and television series. For this movie he finds a way of turning a fairly conventional abduction thriller into something visually scary. He attaches the digital cameras to reclining medical chairs and doors. He puts them right up close to some of the actors until their faces start to warp. It feels like Danny Boyles recent dizzy overcaffeinated style. This funhouse approach gives earthbound activity a ghostly webcam gloss that enhances the usual close-quarters intimacy and atmospheric suspense that Andersons good at. It also helps that the abductor (Michael Eklund) seems appreciably insane without ever settling for anonymous bogeyman tics. Hes handsome but in a way that makes you nervous about showing up for that second date. The Calls peppered with good side-dish actors -- Justina Machado Jose Zuniga Roma Maffia and Morris Chestnut as a cop whos dating Berrys character and is the rare man in a movie who knows how to hold the star. But the main attraction is the bond between Berry and Breslin who seems even mightier with a memorably swollen eye. Berry needs more of these ""dont mess with me"" movies. She has nothing to lose anymore. Until she can find a decent comedy or a great movie well take her in these pretty good ones as long as she doesnt turn herself into prey or bait or eye candy. What we sense from her is strength and what we like is to see her strong -- and with better wigs (the springy geometric number she wears here says ""I get so emotional""). When she repeats the abductors tagline back to him theres nowhere else for The Call to go so it rightly sends us home high. But not before letting us pelt Berry with our two cents. At some point the other night someone yelled ""Dont go in there"" as she proceeded to go right on in. If this movie is half the hit it deserves to be Berry needs to defy the peanut gallery and go in there over and over again. In The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Steve Carell has big hair and a pale kind of tan. Its as if someone covered him in Doritos dust and put him in the oven. He plays the Las Vegas magician of the title a pompous diva whose creaky casino show becomes passe and whose professional partnership with Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) hits the skids. Anton leaves Vegas to bring magic to indigent Cambodians (one girl tries to bite his box of tricks) and the Trumpy owner of the casino Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) first fires Burt then considers hiring an ""edgy"" sadomasochist named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) whose approach to magic is like a tornados approach to real estate. Will Burt get back on top? Will he and Anton have rapprochement? Will Steve die in the middle of one of his stunts? I didnt care. At some point Burt falls so far from riches fame and sold-out performances that hes performing at a retirement home and a kids garden party and is being coached by his crusty boyhood idol (Alan Arkin). Needless to say with these two when it comes to rediscovering the joy of magic the student becomes the teacher. But the best material in the movie -- the moments in which the comedy has teeth and tension -- come when it pits Burts good wholesome magic against Steves grossness and self-mutilation. At that point of course Burt Wonderstone is no longer a satire of magic shows in Vegas. Its an allegory for comedy in Hollywood. And theres some wit in having Carrey send up Jackass-style stunts (in one he holds his urine for 24 straight hours; in another he drills a hole in his head). But as fun as Carrey is its a joke that feels at least 10 years too late. The director Don Scardino is a veteran of 30 Rock and he can do a lot with reaction shots and crowd scenes. He orchestrates some funny bits around Carells idea of superstar pompousness to play Burt like hes Morticia Addams. Fired and broke he moves himself and the contents of his hotel suite into the tiny apartment of his ex-assistant (Olivia Wilde whose exasperation makes her seem reassuringly human). She makes him a nice fish dinner and without finishing the meal he picks up the plates and puts them outside her front door the way he must have at his hotel. But John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have written a script that seems so scared of not being a hit that it forgets to be a movie. These two also wrote Horrible Bosses which was like a Steve Gray trick stretched to an hour and a half. Burt Wonderstone is desperate to remind you of the importance of humility and friendship and belief. Its desperate to make you care about characters who dont deserve it. But since every funny moment here involves cynicism arrogance heartlessness and self-destruction you never believe the movie when its telling you how nice and contrite these characters are. The best gag comes at the very end and involves members of the audience being dragged unconscious up aisles and heaved into a pile in a moving van. Its a very funny sequence thats also pretty mean They think the unconscious pile is us.

Entertainment Inc How long has it been since we actually laughed at Jim Carrey in a movie? I mean really laughed? He did have a couple of moments during the mostly forgettable Yes Man back in 2008 and hell always have our hearts for his (mostly serious) turn in the wonderful Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But its been a decade or so since he gave us more than a mild chuckle 2003s Bruce Almighty was merely okay but if it opened today it would probably feel like a triumphant return to form. So if nothing else the new dueling-magicians flick The Incredible Burt Wonderstone provides a welcome opportunity to reacquaint ourselves with a genuinely funny Jim Carrey. I wont lie It felt like reuniting with an old friend. The movie itself is another matter. It starts off with a flashback to young Burt a suburban latchkey kid bullied remorselessly at school discovering the wonders of a do-it-yourself magic kit. (""Everybody loves a magician ... and theyll love you too"" it not-so-subtly promises.) He soon enlists fellow loner-nerd Anthony as his sidekick and the two quickly become inseparable and grow up to become a popular magic act the Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton played by respectively Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi. But by the time the film settles into its story theyre on the verge of has-been-dom Regaling ever-dwindling crowds with old-fashioned vaguely sexist spectacle theyve turned their childhood fantasies into a tired Vegas routine. (One of their tricks involves a faux-high-school pantomime about Burt stealing a jocks girlfriend.) Trouble shows up soon in the form of fearless long-haired street magician Steve Gray (Carrey) a ridiculous David Blaine type who likes to do stunts and has a Criss Angel Mindfreak-like cable show called Steve Gray Brain Rapist. Gray will do anything -- sleep on a bed of hot coals not pee for a week drill a hole through his skull etc. -- to get a rise out of his audience. And it works because Burt and Anton find themselves trying to make their act more like the popular Grays with disastrous consequences. Lets just cut to the chase Carrey whose looks have gone from trickster-next-door to something more menacing alien and angular is perfectly matched to the part. This is a creepier incarnation of the Overconfident Dimwit role he perfected during his heyday. It helps that the gags themselves are funny but hes so gloriously driven (to rape our brains presumably) that wed laugh at him even if they werent. Not so with Carell however who brings both the pace and the temperature down pretty much every time the film cuts to the main story line. Burts journey from obnoxious showbiz veteran (an early scene where he halfheartedly seduces a groupie is more sad than funny) to humble comeback story never really registers The part calls for gathering desperation but Carell whose very stock-in-trade used to be his vulnerability can only muster whinier variations to his jaded loser shtick. Compare that to the breathless anxiety Will Ferrell brought to similar fallen-superstar parts in Talladega Nights and Blades of Glory. By the end of the film when Burt is supposed to get the girl and prove himself to be a changed freshly self-aware man we may find ourselves unconvinced. Luckily we may also not notice because there are still a lot of laughs in this movie. But theyre courtesy of someone else The true comeback story in this fictional comeback story doesnt belong to a character named Burt Wonderstone but to an actor named Jim Carrey.

At area theaters. Sure some of the presto-change-o lessons come far too easily in ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" starring Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi. Still this comedy about a magician who must hit bottom before rising again to the wonder of his beloved craft pulls plenty of sweet moments and a slew of laughs out of a story that might have been thin air. Burts perma-tan and outdated hair-dont are mere hints of his out-of-whack vanity. For much of the movie he might better be known as the Insufferable Burt Wonderstone. Carell portrays the Las Vegas attraction. Buscemi is co-headliner Anton Marvelton whom Burt treats more as sidekick than partner. It wasnt always thus. When we meet young Burt (Mason Cook) hes on the run from a neighborhood bully and headed home to a hard-working if absent mom. Its a psychological set-up meant to ensure our forgiveness and his transformation of course. Still. Note to screenwriters enough with using bullying as a quickie plot device; youre normalizing it more than youre critiquing it. A magic kit as a birthday gift gives Burt a calling. Fate delivers a best friend in Anton (Luke Vanek). Voil... Decades later the outsiders have their own theater in a Vegas hotel but their friendships in tatters. Written by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (""Horrible Bosses"") the comedy has gleeful fun teasing the idea of a David Copperfield/ David Blaine face-off for the soul of magic with Burt as the tarnished Copperfield-like performer. Jim Carrey brings his no-holds barred physical shtick and a snaky charm to the part of Steve Gray. The long-haired tattooed street magicians act is more endurance test than illusion. Think ""Jackass"" meets Blaine. When Burt makes a joke about the practice of cutting its off-color but spot on. Gray is a masterful masochist with a messiah complex. Just the same people line up for Grays bag of tricks -- even as they hurl at the smell of burning flesh. James Gandolfini portrays hotel chain honcho and Burts boss Doug Munny. The hardly subtly named Munny sees the future of show-stopping magic and its not Burt and Anton. Burt finds himself homeless and jobless. At a retirement community he meets his childhood hero. Alan Arkin brings his sardonic gifts to the role of the retired spellbinder Rance Holloway. Will magic regain its magic for Burt? Were pretty sure of the answer from the start. Still getting there is often ridiculous fun. Olivia Wilde reveals fine comedic instincts as Jane who becomes Burt and Antons assistant though she has finer aspirations. While Jane rebuffs with aplomb Burts caddish advances the screenwriters cant resist a clumsy sleight-of-hand when they make the pairs rapprochement far too tidy. Its a too-obvious gesture in a movie that pulls off some otherwise lovely comedic magic.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Strange Magic Even with a talented cast and some inspired moments up its sleeve this Vegas-set comedy fails to impress By Mary Pols MaryPolsMarch 14 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle WARNER BROS. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Asked how he is Vegas magician Burt Wonderstone answers ""I am incredible"" with smug glee; he considers this an utterly honest answer. The dorky abandon of this kind of low-level magic is what makes The Incredible Burt Wonderstone work. Not all the time mind you but enough to make me think this may be the kind of semi-bad semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them. The film directed by TV veteran Don Scardino (30 Rock Law amp; Order) wavers between two goals the first of which is the fairly tedious redemptive journey of Burt (Steve Carell) from a place of pompous piggery created by a decade of successfully headlining at Ballys into a decent guy who believes in the transformative power of illusion in its purest form. We only know theres decency under Burts spray tan glittery costumes and rampant chauvinism because of the movies prologue in which he is bullied by the middle schoolers (in a nice bit of irony the head bully is played by none other than Zachary Gordon the Greg Heffley of The Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise) and neglected by his single mother. To be fair on Burts birthday in 1982 she does give him the instructions for making his own cake (from a box) and an official Rance Holloway magic kit complete with video featuring Rance (Alan Arkin) who is Burts idol. (READ Times Mary Pols on Steve Carell as romantic lead.) The kit leads to Burts friendship with another put-upon child Anton who grows up to be Burts partner (played by Steve Buscemi) in the aforementioned Ballys act which combines the magic of a Siegfried and Roy with the sexualized showmanship of say Tom Cruises Magnolia character Frank T.J. Mackey. After years of packing the house at Doug Munnys (James Gandolfini) hotel Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton are facing dwindling audiences. Meanwhile tensions between the old friends are rising as exemplified by their dispute over possession of the adjective ""incredible."" ""It applies to both of us"" Anton says. ""What a hateful thing to say"" Burt responds. Carell is fiercely committed to being loathsome as Burt but also uncomfortable obliged by story convention and presumably box office needs to be the character we care about; its no wonder hes all over the place with Burt. The prospect that Burt Wonderstone would have a wholesome intelligent romantic interest is absurd but Olivia Wilde plays the part so gamely that the creepiness of it starts to fade. These are the parts of the movie that require the brain to turn off. The much more interesting aspect of Burt Wonderstone has to do with a satirical examination of magic as a business in the 21st century Theres a face-off between the old-guard magicians inspired by the likes of Rance Holloway and the new gonzo magicians represented with terrifying genius by Jim Carrey (and modeled presumably on David Blaine). He plays Steve Gray the ""Brain Rapist"" a tall dark-roots atop-blonde-tresses ripped beast who specializes in gross-out gimmicks like holding in his urine for 12 days and drilling holes in his own head (separate events just in case you were worried). Steve has a popular cable show and does not wear anything glittery. He favors more of an acid-washed militaristic look. In fact if a human being could be acid-washed hed look like Steve Gray. Also it isnt a good show until someone in the audience throws up. Burt who should talk calls Steve Grays act ""monkey porn."" Steves retort is the silken insult. ""Your skin makes me cry"" he says stroking Burts face. Id successfully kept Jim Carrey a secret from my young male child to this point--the less he knew about Dumb and Dumber the better especially with that sequel promised for next year--but a babysitting crunch led to his introduction. The movie is PG-13 but suffice it to say this was not my best parenting decision. Carreys Brain Rapist oh Lord try explaining the name is a marvelous piece of biting comedy so on point that at times the line between parody and plausible seems about as thick as a piece of thread. This is Carrey in full force as potent and nasty a creation as John Turturros Jesus Quintana but since hes on the screen a lot more than that character from The Big Lebowski he changes the tenor of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone from soft and silly to something more complicated and certainly more adult. (SEE Jim Carreys strange video love letter to actress Emma Stone.) The stylistic differences between Carell and Carrey as comedians one so determined to be liked the other seemingly beyond that neediness create a kind of narrative confusion that isnt settled by the screenplay. Its written by John Francis Daly (who will always be Sam Weir from Freaks and Geeks to me) and Jonathan M. Goldstein who also get a story credit along with a committee of two others and seems to have been a fluid enough document to allow both Carrey and Carell some creative license--theres a funny reunion scene between Buscemi and Carell that feels very improvised. Thats understandable given the talents at hand. But its just fluid enough to also seem on occasion to be uncontained. The triumphs are undeniable (Carrey obviously but also Alan Arkin who infuses his predictable role with a sort of weary alluring elegance) but when Burt gets a load of Steve Gray for the first time and says ""who is this hot mess?"" its easy to transfer the question to the movie itself. Maybe thats why I want another look at seeing The Incredible Burt Wonderstone; like every hot mess it invites the gaze.

Starring Steve Carell Steve Buscemi Olivia Wilde Jim Carrey James Gandolfini Alan Arkin Jay Mohr Michael Bully Herbig Mason Cook Luke Vanek Director Don Scardino Running time 141 Release Opened Mar 15 2013  Editorial Review Its all smoke and mirrorsBy Ann HornadayFriday March 15 2013Beware the Ides of March by which time expectations have been so lowered by mid-winter dreck that movie audiences can easily mistake mediocrity for genuine merit. On any other date ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" would be seen for what it is a generic fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesnt nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesnt qualify as a desecration either. Opening as it does on March 15 this half-baked over-processed shrug feels like a veritable breath of spring clearing away the cobwebs of dreary Die Hards slack Giant Slayers and grating and pitiful Ozes. In many ways ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" possesses all the structural elements that have worked in the past for its star Steve Carell He plays a cheesy Las Vegas magician (the title character) who has worked with his best friend and partner Anton Marvelton for 30 years when their livelihood is threatened by a streetwise newcomer. But viewers expecting the kind of chemistry that made ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman"" big hits will need to adjust their assumptions Here Carells sidekick is played by Steve Buscemi who has his own special brand of bug-eyed appeal to be sure but is essentially a straight man to Carells strutting self-tanned diva. When Jim Carrey shows up on the Strip as hipster stunt artist Steve Gray any hopes of comic riffing between him and Carell are soon dashed by the realization that true to his character he barely registers his co-stars presence. ""Burt Wonderstone"" is best appreciated not as an ensemble of inspired talents but as the convergence of very funny actors who are all starring in their own little movies. Still ""Burt Wonderstone"" magically produces its share of modest laughs With his ombre-blond hair and tribal tattoos Carrey does a magnificently deranged job of skewering the inane hijinks of such performers as David Blaine and Criss Angel. Carell more reserved than usual channels Siegfried Roy and David Copperfield (who good-naturedly shows up for a cameo) to create a character who will never end up in his classic repertory but allows him some clever visual humor nonetheless. (One of the few memorable bits in ""Burt Wonderstone"" is Carells one-man rendition of an undoubtedly two-man routine.) In the hands of better writers Carell and his co-stars would have had more to do in ""Burt Wonderstone"" (hes joined here by Olivia Wilde James Gandolfini and Alan Arkin); as it stands the movies saggy formulaic plot and Don Scardinos stodgy direction lead viewers from sight gag to punch line to sight gag culminating in a perversely amusing final sequence that one suspects also serves as a darkly apt metaphor for the filmmakers own feelings about their audience. Like the playing cards scarves and other tricks up its protagonists sleeves ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is momentarily diverting but its also destined to disappear quickly.Contains sexual content dangerous stunts a drug-related incident and profanity.

Steve Carell is fatally miscast as an arrogant flamboyant third-rate magician in ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone which by all rights should have been a second-rate Will Ferrell vehicle. Carell as Burt gives it his all but theres little magic and nothing incredible about this sloppy (if elaborately produced) comedy which is as stale and hackneyed as the show that he and his childhood pal (Steve Buscemi) have been performing for a decade at Ballys in Las Vegas. While its great to see Buscemi get second billing in a mainstream movie his Anton exists only to have arguments with Burt over whether to update their antiquated Merv Griffin-era routines invariably introduced by the song ""Abracadabra (the movies most annoyingly repeated gag). An abusive jerk -- well outside Carells comfort zone as a comedian -- Burt adamantly refuses to change anything. At least until a Criss Angel-esque gonzo magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) with a cable-TV reality show captures the interest of Burt and Antons longtime employer (James Gandolfini) whos beginning to wonder if theyre old hat. At 51 Carreys a counterintuitive choice to play a younger rival to 50-year-old Carell but his supporting role turns out to be one of the few things that works here -- hes very funny as a madman whose extreme stunts usually involve maiming himself with objects like a power drill. Burt and Anton respond with their own spectacular stunt -- spending a week in a transparent box suspended above the Las Vegas Strip. But that goes so spectacularly wrong it severs their partnership. And in the hands of director Don Scardino a TV veteran responsible for ""30 Rock what would seem to be surefire material turns out to be basically laugh-free. The script by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (who wrote the far funnier ""Horrible Bosses) is so utterly predictable that youll know far before this that Burt will end up jobless and destitute. Burt finally lands work entertaining at a nursing home where his childhood idol Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) is a patient. Arkin -- who appeared with Carell in ""Little Miss Sunshine -- is fortunately the sort of genius veteran performer who can spin the lamest lines into comic gold with an inflection here a raised eyebrow there. Poor Carell has a tougher time of it. He fares better with the few subtle gags. When reduced to staying at the home of their long-suffering assistant (Olivia Wilde wasted in a nothing role) he cluelessly picks up the dinner dishes and leaves them outside (as hes always done during his decade-long residence at Ballys). Ferrell an expert at playing idiot horndogs could ace the scene earlier in the film where Burt asks a groupie her age and to sign a release form. But Carell seems embarrassed as he does when Burt is required to sexually harass Wildes character and mock her own aspirations as a magician. A veritable festival of bad toupees and repeated gags that just lie there ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone runs a bit more than an hour and a half but seems much longer -- like it had been edited down at the last minute. It limps to a conclusion with a belabored sequence in which the reunited Burt and Anton -- theres the slightest doubt this will happen -- are required to put the audiences to sleep to win an audition for a contract at Gandolfinis new casino. Id wager that a good number of people watching this movie will also be dozing off by this point.

Pictures) FILM REVIEW The Incredible Burt Wonderstone An unfortunately misleading movie title Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 15 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 15 2013 332PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Don Scardino Written by Jonathan Goldstein John Francis Daley Starring Steve Carell Steve Buscemi Jim Carrey Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English For my first trick allow me to write off an entire picture by merely affixing to the title a one-word contraction The Incredible Burt Wonderstone isnt. Please hold your applause.Admittedly no one expected incredible. Thats shooting way too high especially for a Hollywood feature consigned to the calendar doldrums of early March. However funny would be nice given that the flick is being marketed under the general rubric of comedy. But funny it isnt either at least not the movie that Don Scardino appears intent on sort-of directing. Occasionally if only in self-defence the actors take charge to improvise a few hard left turns whereupon other movies break out which arent much funnier but do have the distinction of being weirdly incongruous and thus mildly distracting and so faintly interesting - hey well take our amusement where we can find it. Multimedia The Incredible Burt Wonderstone The official trailer As for that main movie it has Burt W. (Steve Carell) and Anton M. for Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) as the Martin amp; Lewis of magic acts - bosom buddies on the Vegas stage constant bickerers off. Blame Burt whose ego and hair are all of a puffed-up piece. These days though their act has grown stale and the crowds sparse. Not that it matters because the big screen has a way of killing even the best stage magic. In a live theatre the rabbit pulled from the hat is a neat trick; on film the dumb bunny is just camera trickery.Anyway Anton bolts the act which is a mercy since Buscemis talents are completely wasted here. In fact we keep hoping that being magically inclined hell turn himself into Nucky Thompson and offer up a sneak preview of next seasons Boardwalk Empire but no such luck.His departure leaves Burt to do what puffed-up guys always do in sloppy comedies hit rock bottom (reduced to hawking paper towels in supermarkets making stains disappear) then rise anew to become the nice guy he never was. Along the way humbled Burt plays a gig in a retirement home for entertainers who used to be somebody - I expected the place to be a lot more crowded than it was.Naturally he has a love interest (Olivia Wilde) whos a wannabe magician herself. When their love is finally consummated they keep taking breaks from the hot-and-heavy to pull condoms from each others ears. Yep thats one of those different movies that keep popping up. Another emerges when during the Burt/Anton reunion scene Carell takes it upon himself to mewl and weep and morph into God-knows-what-or-whom. Even Buscemi looks surprised seemingly eager to channel his inner Nucky and machine-gun this twerp.But the strangest movie-instead-of-the-movie comes courtesy of Jim Carrey as a rival Houdini who specializes in the magic of masochism - plucking a card from a bloody rent in his cheek spending the night on a bed of hot coals driving a power drill deep into his cranium. Coming from Carrey an erstwhile headliner who used to star in these sorts of shenanigans all this self-inflicted cruelty seems rather sad. Whats more Carrey plays him with an unholy stare and a two-toned Jesus wig as if to suggest that when it comes to resurrecting a stalled career simple magic wont do - only a miracle will suffice.Speaking of careers Burt and Anton redeem theirs by concocting a new trick that makes the whole audience disappear. But that disappearing act comes at the movies end - by then of course its redundant.

Steve Carell (front) plays Vegas headliner Burt Wonderstone grown arrogant and stale and Steve Buscemi plays his partner. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone review 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Comedy. Starring Steve Carell Olivia Wilde Jim Carrey and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Don Scardino. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) Steve Carell became famous when he took a supporting role in a Jim Carrey movie (""Bruce Almighty"") and stole the show. So it seems only right that 10 years later Carrey should put himself back on the map by stealing Steve Carells latest picture ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" The movie is pleasant. Its reasonably funny. But the one who gets the real laughs here the hard laughs is Carrey who plays the kind of role he should be playing - a complete lunatic. Forget lovable. Carrey doesnt need to be loved. With his particular gift he should just play an array of lunatics and let lovable take care of itself. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is about a lonely kid who uses magic to overcome his alienation and grows up to become a Vegas attraction. Burt (Carell) headlines the act with his best friend Anton (Steve Buscemi) but while Anton remains the same sweet guy he always was Burt with the years has become insulated and arrogant and the act has grown stale. Carrey as a long-haired street magician turned TV star represents the next wave in magic and his mere existence makes Burt and Anton look passe. Instead of doing sleight-of-hand tricks and splashy disappearing acts he takes magic into the realm of the disgusting. He hides a playing card under the skin of his face and has to slice himself open to retrieve it. In another scene he goes for the record in keeping his eyes open and to make things interesting he has his assistants shoot streams of pepper spray into his eyes. What helps make all this really funny is that the characters masochistic commitment to magic is nearly matched by Carreys masochistic commitment to comedy. That might not be pepper spray being sprayed into Carreys eyes in a steady stream but even water couldnt have been too comfortable. Hes bug-eyed and raving and hasnt looked so at home in years. Its as if Carrey has been waiting through a series of bland and corny showcases to find a role that doesnt derail or divert his intensity but embraces it. Just like the magician Carreys talent is not about quirky. Its about anarchy about making an audience squirm. At the start of ""Burt Wonderstone"" Burt has contempt for his work treats his partner like a lackey and is lewd to every woman he comes across including his new assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde). He has no conception that his stardom might be failing even when the owner of the hotel chain (James Gandolfini) lays it out for him. So the movie becomes the story of Burts re-education as a human being with plenty of comic opportunities along the way. As someone who has lived most of his life in hotels he doesnt know that people dont do the dishes by just putting them outside the door. Wilde and a comically amiable Buscemi serve as sturdy straight men for Carell who then pays the favor forward in his scenes with Alan Arkin as the great magician who inspired him. Comedy or drama Arkin has an appealing way of being so cynical hes idealistic - that is cynical about his own cynicism and exhausted by his own exhaustion. Something about Arkin must be right for our era because he seems to fit right in no matter what the movie doing more or less the same thing each time. Speaking of eras ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" begins in 1982 and gets the details right from Judas Priest on the soundtrack to a top-loading VHS player that will provoke nostalgia in all those who can remember - those things were tanks.

"Movie review The Incredible Burt Wonderstone - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Only thing incredible about Wonderstone is the hair Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 03.14.13 | 1241 PM If there were an Oscar for best bad hair ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" would be a lock. In this comedy about professional magicians and Vegas high-rollers there isnt a male cast member who doesnt have something absurdly tragic happening on top of his head. Star Steve Carell as the preening stud illusionist of the title sports a fetching Siegfried-and-Roy coif while Jim Carrey as his rival goes trailer-park heavy-metal. Alan Arkin appears to have had a tar pit shellacked to his scalp and Steve Buscemi labors under what looks like a small terrier in mid-sneeze. Even James Gandolfini as a cheerfully crass casino magnate wears a blond toupee that makes him look like the biggest hood ornament in town. The hair is funny in part because not much else is. ""Burt Wonderstone"" is a lazy underwritten imitation Will Ferrell movie -- an ""Anchorman"" rip about a fatuous boob who gets humbled and becomes a sincere slightly less fatuous boob in time for the end credits. But you watch the movie in a happy state of expectation anyway because the concepts so rich and just enough of it makes it onto the screen along with some fine character comedians. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Who hasnt looked at big-name magicians -- like David Copperfield who cameos as himself here -- and seen a childhood geek ecstatic to have found a way to get paid for it? A Barry Manilow with rabbits. ""Burt Wonderstone"" establishes that emotional terrain with a prologue in which two bullied kids (Mason Cook and Luke Vanek) team up as partners in sleight of hand and a few decades later we find them headlining Ballys as The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (Carell) and Anton (Buscemi). Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Theyve done Carson theyve conquered the Strip and their show is a brazenly clueless display of high Vegas kitsch cued to Steve Millers ""Abracadabra."" But Wonderstone has become a diva and a jerk with a bed that ""comfortably sleeps two dozen"" and a rotating crew of assistants and conquests. The appearance of Steve Gray (Carrey) a gonzo cable-TV ""street magician"" whose stunts are spectacular exercises in escalating masochism spells the end of Burt and Antons old-school popularity. So its David Copperfield versus David Blaine more or less a solid comic notion that falls surprisingly flat. Carrey whose role is little more than an extra special guest appearance represents the films approach Set up a comic situation and then let the cast wing it. Aside from one freakishly effective scene in which Gray somehow pulls a playing card out of his cheek Carrey is encouraged by director Dan Scardino to be as loud and weird as possible. And hes good at it. Hes just not very funny. Its the comic actors rather than the comedians who bring the focus. Arkin as a wily old mentor Burt rediscovers in an old-age home is a dry joy as usual and Buscemi turns his stock sidekick part into something rather sweet especially when Anton goes to the Far East to deliver magic kits to starving children. Gandolfinis killer bonhomie is as big as the Palace itself. Even Olivia Wilde in the token role of Burts assistant/love interest gives her lines an intelligent snap. Because Carell is both a comedian and a dramatic actor he gets his signals crossed. He makes Burt genuinely hateful at times which is at least interesting and when the character periodically finds himself at his lowest he lets out a strangled whimper thats actually touching. Carells giving away the trick -- that inside Burt Wonderstone is a terrified kid. After that its back to the slapstick dud jokes and general structural flabbiness. As the end credits roll ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" finally rises to comic inspiration when the secret behind the heros climactic Disappearing Audience Trick is revealed. By then its too late -- weve already vanished. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr.

"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone has magic but no heart review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone has magic but no heart reviewNo amount of smoke and mirrors can hide the burst seams frayed wires and bad-hearted humor of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 14 2013The Incredible Burt WonderstoneStarring Steve Carell Jim Carrey Steve Buscemi Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini. Directed by Don Scardino. 100 minutes. Opens March 15 at major theatres. PGNo amount of smoke and mirrors can hide the burst seams frayed wires and bad-hearted humour of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.A movie of clashing egos amongst Las Vegas magicians it brings out the inner conjuror in all of us -- but not for the reasons intended. Article Continued BelowYou just wish you could wave a wand or snap your fingers to undo the waste of talent and to straighten out the muddled and just plain nasty narrative.Could things go wrong when you have Steve Carell Jim Carrey Steve Buscemi Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini in your cast? They could go very wrong when you dont give them much of anything thats particularly funny or magical to work with. Directed by Don Scardino (TVs 30 Rock) and scripted by Horrible Bosses screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley Burt Wonderstone goes in more directions than a wayward white rabbit.Its part comedy part drama part romance part bromance part comeuppance part redemption part nostalgia trip part social critique partly sweet partly gross . . . and a whole lot of nothing that really clicks.Carells title role is a major hurdle. Hes a creep for much of the film and its hard for him to curdle his usual daffy charm. His Burt Wonderstone is first seen as a child in 1982 as a nerdy bullied and neglected kid who even has to bake his own birthday cake. He finds solace in the magic kit he receives as a gift and quickly sets about learning the tricks of a legendary prestidigitator named Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin).Burt bonds with fellow geek Anton Marvelton (Buscemi) an asthmatic child in need of testosterone and maybe also a hug. Burt and Anton become Vegas sensations filling Ballys for nightly shows that are followed by Burts nightly conquests of his latest female distraction.After 30 years Burt and Anton find themselves on the wrong side of novelty. Burt is bored of his routines -- how many times has he heard Steve Millers cheesy tune ""Abracadabra""? -- and hes tired of obsequious Anton. Burt is now the bully. He burns through showgirl assistants faster than he does the compliant fans who haunt the stage door although hes found a feisty new one in Jane (Wilde) who isnt so easily pushed around.A bigger threat than boredom awaits outside. Street magician Steve Gray (Carrey) dazzles tourists with dangerous feats that inspire awe fear and upchucks. He bills himself as ""Brain Rapist"" on his cable TV show.He attracts the attention of Ballys boss Doug Munny (Gandolfini) who never lets loyalty to his artists get in the way of making a few bucks.Before you can drop the needle on yet another spin of ""Abracadabra"" Burt and Anton are split Gray is on the rise and something more than hocus pocus will be needed to make things right.You can see where this is going but by this point its too late for Burt or the movie to win back audience affections on or off the screen. Hes been too big of a jerk and his contrition is forced and insincere. The inevitable love story subplot is rushed and as fake as a Vegas come-on.The films confusion of intentions continues until the very end with a coda of a big magic trick that is meant to dazzle but instead appalls. Is audience abuse legal in Nevada?The movie does prompt a few grim smiles and they mainly come from Carrey. He really goes for it as the fearless and insane Steve Gray a guy who doesnt just walk on hot coals he sleeps on them. Hed have made for a much more compelling heel-to-real character arc than the one Carell travels.""Its not about pulling a rabbit out of your hat anymore. Its about pulling your heart out of your chest"" Gray tells Burt.Hes wrong. The real trick is finding your heart in the first place a stunt The Incredible Burt Wonderstone fails to pull off.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   out of fourStars Steve Carell Steve Buscemi Olivia Wilde Jim Carrey James Gandolfini Alan Arkin Jay MohrRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideAlmost as mystifying as what went on in the secret papal conclave this week is why it took a half-dozen credited writers to fashion the forgettable formulaic and nearly laugh-free script that is The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.Perhaps its a magical disappearing humor act that afflicts this throwaway (  out of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday nationwide).And speaking of feats who absconded with Steve Carells reliable likability?ALEXANDER Carell conjures the outrageous in WonderstoneMORE Jim Carrey Buff blond bonkers in WonderstoneSTORY Whats behind Hollywoods ear? More magicians on-screenHe plays the title character who is a repulsive pompous illusionist. Even when hes eventually redeemed hes obnoxious. Fortunately hes paired with Steve Buscemi who plays Anton Marvelton Burts beleaguered and more endearing sidekick in a tacky magic show.The two became partners in prestidigitation as lonely picked-on kids. Fast forward three decades and the duo is a popular Las Vegas fixture. Think Siegfried amp; Roy -- with the elaborate coifs but sans tigers. The pair draw packed houses eager assistants and breathless groupies (whom Burt makes sign a contract before coupling).Every night Burt and Anton appear onstage accompanied by the same tired tune -- the Steve Miller Bands Abracadabra an inanely catchy song and apropos for Burt who wants to reach out and grab anyone who will have him. Offstage the magic has long worn off The guys are sick of each other.Soon things get old onstage as well. Their sleight-of-hand tricks seem dated and stodgy compared with the insane antics of tattooed street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) who like Zoolanders Hansel is suddenly so hot. Tossing his long blond hair with maniacal arrogance and hyping his characters TV show Brain Rapist Carrey wrings a few laughs out of wacko stunts that include sleeping on hot coals and holding his urine for 12 days.Casino boss Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) sees Gray as the future of magic and cans the longtime Wonderstone-Marvelton act.Their friendship sours (for reasons that are never fully explained) and Anton leaves the business altogether. Burt tries unsuccessfully to go solo. Because of his ridiculously extravagant ways he winds up broke and homeless -- his comeuppance sealed.There is some humor to be had from the duos lacquered hairstyles and glittery costumes but when Anton leaves the movie loses steam and never regains it.Late in the game Burt and Steve try to outperform each other at a kids birthday party in a largely humorless scene that turns the movie to mush.Burt gets a job doing card tricks at a nursing home and runs into his former idol magician Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin). The masters persuasive powers --which Burt heard on a videotape as a kid -- were what drew him to magic in the first place.""Everyone loves a magician"" Holloway said on the videotape. ""Theyre gonna love you too.""That was all the neglected Burt needed to hear as a lad. As a grown man Burts diva tendencies start to fade after he finally meets Holloway.But his redemption is too little too late and is unconvincing.What might have been an entertaining silly comedy opts for pseudo-earnestness over movie magic. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone just goes through the motions and conjures up cliches. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/WKdEc3",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/14/incredible-burt-wonderstone-review/1921629/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29,200,theincredibleburtwonderstone12,theincredibleburtwonderstone,usatoday

Adam (Jim Sturgess) sets out on a dangerous quest to reconnect with his love (Kirsten Dunst) who lives on a twinned world with a separate gravity. (Photo/Video Millennium Entertainment) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated March 14 2013 739 p.m. ET Rather than star-crossed the lovers in Juan Solanass ""Upside Down"" are planet-crossed; they come from adjacent planets with opposite gravities. These mutually repellent orbs--one up the other down depending on which one you inhabit--are so close to each other that their mountain peaks almost touch and theyre connected by a giant corporations towering (or plummeting) headquarters. People from our planet may dismiss this film as silly contrived self-enchanted or flawed in the terms of its own exotic logic and it is all of the above (or below.) Yet I fell for it by rising to the bait of its design--beautifully burnished images that youve never quite seen anywhere else--as well as its audacity in going all the way with a madly chancy concept. Falling for the film means seeing its stars-- Jim Sturgess as Adam and Kirsten Dunst as Eden--upside down from time to time even though their features arent flattered by inversion. It means swallowing with levitating grains of salt lots of pseudosolemn pseudoscience about inverse matter and local laws of gravity. (Knowing how silly some of this stuff is Mr. Solanas keeps it lightly droll as in my favorite line delivered by Timothy Spalls ostensibly devious scientist ""I combine upper and lower inversion with a hyperinfusion."") But it also means being treated to the oddly poignant sight of the lovers pitting hormones against gravity as teenagers and when he seeks her out a decade later to the sumptuous spectacle of their reunion at the Cafe Dos Mondos a mountaintop tango club where Adam redefines the notion of burning passion. (If he stays too long in her world inverse matter starts him sweating then sets him on fire.) ENLARGE Mr. Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst Millennium Entertainment Neither star is a stranger to cosmic themes expressed by extravagant images. Ms. Dunst was marvelous in Lars von Triers ""Melancholia"" a movie in which the spiritual state of melancholia is intensified by a planet of the same name that may obliterate life on earth. Mr. Sturgess was ardent if nothing else in ""Across the Universe"" Julie Taymors overblown celebration of young love and the Fab Four. But stunning visuals alone cant sustain a feature film as Ms. Taymors phantasmagoria showed. To give his story additional bulk if not substance Mr. Solanas the son of a prominent Argentinean filmmaker has added a social context with whiffs of class warfare Adams world is poor and dystopian Edens is rich and dominant. (In a lighter indeed goofier vein Adam uses a family secret going back to his beloved Aunt Becky to invent an anti-aging cream that lifts faces by reversing gravity.) Still its the look--along with the sound--that gives the film its distinction Alex McDowell designed the production Pierre Gill was the cinematographer and Benoit Charest wrote the music. At a time when so many movies look alike and studio productions sometimes look aggressively ugly heres a quirky vision at the intersection of sci-fi and romance. ""Upside Down"" can be beguiling if youre willing to invert disbelief. Watch a clip from the film ""Beyond the Hills"" about the friendship between two young women who grew up in the same orphanage. Winner of the Best Actress and Best Screenplay awards at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) Beyond the Hills Although Cristian Mungius fascinating anguishing feature is set in contemporary Romania the little Orthodox convent where most of the action takes place is feudal in its cultural isolation. (The convent is also isolated geographically but geography isnt the issue.) The story concerns two young women Voichita and Alina. Cherished friends since they were children in an orphanage theyre reunited when Alina whos been working in Germany comes to visit Voichita at the convent where the latter has found an austere but peaceful refuge. After the convent takes Alina in austerity remains but peace vanishes. ENLARGE Cosmina Stratan and Cristina Flutur Sundance Selects Takes her in that is over the strenuous objections of the defrocked priest whos simply called Father by the nuns. Doing the Christian thing doesnt come easily to this man of smugly rigid convictions. Neither does doing the enlightened thing when Alinas love for her friend leads her to challenge Fathers authority and to reveal herself as a deeply troubled soul. For a local doctor--not a distinguished clinician but not a fool either--the appropriate therapy is pharmaceutical a prescription for antipsychotics. As Father sees it Alinas sickness is spiritual a case of possession resulting from a surfeit of sin and his treatment which drowns the poor girl in guilt culminates in an exorcism. Mr. Mungiu who won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his 2007 drama ""4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" has a gift for working with actors. Valeriu Andriuta plays Father with fearsome intensity. Cristina Fluturs Alina is touching at one moment terrifying at the next. As Voichita Cosmina Stratan gives a wondrously mercurial performance by turns childlike numb vividly alive and hopelessly torn. (Last year at Cannes the two women shared a Best Actress award.) Its tempting to see ""Beyond the Hills"" solely as an indictment of religion but the film is more ambitious than that. Ignorance and superstition arent confined to the convent; people in town including the cops drop casual references to witchcraft as if it were part of everyday life. The broader subject is possession by primitive ideas. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Ginger and Rosa"" a look at the lives of two teenage girls growing up in 1960s London and the pivotal event the comes to redefine their relationship as the Cuban Missile Crisis looms. (Photo/Video A24 Films) Ginger amp; Rosa Sally Potters latest film opens with a mushroom cloud--uh oh sententiousness alert--followed by scenes of the devastation in Hiroshima followed by two babies being born in London in the same fateful year of 1945. Cut to 1962 when Elle Fannings Ginger and Alice Englerts Rosa best friends since childhood are still living in the shadow of the bomb. As it turns out ""Ginger amp; Rosa"" is less sententious--the hydrogen bomb truly did instill widespread fear at that time--than prosaic. Ms. Potter puts her heroines in a succession of interesting--and handsomely photographed--situations in which they define themselves by talking about what theyre up to rather than by taking urgent action. (The cinematographer was Robbie Ryan.) ENLARGE Alice Englert and Elle Fanning A24 Films Ginger becomes a political activist a teenage ban-the-bomber in conflict with her father Roland ( Alessandro Nivola) a well-known pacifist and deep-dyed narcissist. Rosa more interested in romance than politics falls out with Ginger after falling in love with Roland. Ms. Englerts performance isnt as interesting as it might have been if the writing hadnt favored Ginger. But Ms. Fanning a young actress of seemingly unerring instincts is a wonder whether in the existential despair that Ginger feels during the Cuban missile crisis--not only her world but the whole world seems about to end--or in the spiritual growth spurt that Ginger enjoys after both worlds carry on. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" Superstar magicians Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) look to salvage on their act. Also starring Jim Carrey and Olivia Wilde (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Over the course of 100 minutes that seem like a lifetime ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone""--was the title generated by an algorithm?--depicts rival magicians vying for celebrity with stunts that involve inter alia a marathon sweat in a transparent plastic box dangling above the Las Vegas Strip; a steady stream of pepper spray in the eyes; lying supine on a bed of hot coals; and drilling a hole into ones own skull. Torture? Yes but nothing like watching the movie itself. ENLARGE Steve Carell and Olivia Wilde Warner Bros. Pictures The title role plunges Steve Carell deep into the territory of smirking self-parody that was pioneered and pretty much exhausted by Will Ferrell. Once a boy magician Burt is a Las Vegas legend along the lines of David Copperfield except that his tricks are manifestly impossible without trick photography and that his act includes a friend from childhood who as a quarrelsome adult called Anton Marvelton is played by Steve Buscemi. (Burt is supposedly straight yet he and Anton quarrel like nasty parodies of gays.) Jim Carrey is Steve Gray a street magician who as The Brain Rapist topples Burt from fames pinnacle by staging a succession of increasingly masochistic performances. (Also by outsmirking him.) Olivia Wilde plays Jane a would-be magician whose loyalty to Burt is as unaccountable as it is unswerving since he is relentlessly nasty not to mention unfunny until he turns tediously nice. James Gandolfinis Las Vegas hotel owner is louder than everyone else. Alan Arkin does the best trick bringing a dollop of humanity to the role of Rance Holloway the magician who was young Burts inspiration. Apart from Rance the whole production is slovenly nonsense photographed on the cheap with blaring ghastliness. Yet it poses an intriguing mystery. Did the producers appeal to a denominator even lower than common by making their film as dumb as possible or did it just turn out that way? --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Another Earth (2011) Mike Cahills debut feature is another saga of twin planets and a provocative one. The Earth of the title an apparent duplicate of our own has suddenly appeared in the sky and just floats there serenely at a safe remove as if the law of gravity had been repealed. Exactly what that extraterrestrial Terra represents is hard to pin down--a way of looking at ourselves a chance to rerun our lives with different outcomes. The films star Brit Marling wrote the script with Mr. Cahill and served as one of the producers. ENLARGE Hope Springs Steve Carell plays it admirably and affectingly straight as a marriage therapist confronted by a couple who in late middle age find their sexual and emotional connections essentially defunct. Meryl Streep is the wife Kay. Her curmudgeonly husband Arnold is played by Tommy Lee Jones. Its moving to follow the couples crabwise progress and to watch two wonderful actors find flashes of beauty in unlikely moments. This is less surprising for Ms. Streep than it is for Mr. Jones who finally finds in Arnold a pained spiritual nakedness. David Frankel directed from a script by Vanessa Taylor ENLARGE Super 8 (2011) Elle Fanning is Alice an exquisite girl on the verge of young womanhood in a retrocontempo thriller by J.J. Abrams that combines a sci-fi plot with an enjoyable account of middle-schoolers seized by the need to make their own Super 8 movie. Alice agrees to play the main zombie but she doesnt know what a brilliant actress she is. Running her lines for the first time she leaves her castmates stunned and ""Super 8"" briefly becomes a movie about the primal power of movie acting as well as a revelation of Ms. Fannings extraordinary gifts. --J.M.

Pictures Watch A Clip From The Incredible Burt Wonderstone - See You In The Morning See You In The Morning Credit Warner Bros. Pictures There are some funny bits and characters around the edges of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone but its core is empty of humor. In fact this purported satire of Las Vegas magicians is a three-void circus the script the central character and the main performance. The committee-written screenplay begins with the premise that 20 years after the illusion-busting Penn and Teller set up in Vegas there could still be a market for a pair of old-school tricksters who call themselves Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton. Friends since childhood Burt (Steve Carell) and Anton (Steve Buscemi) have become offstage enemies. Boths biggest nemesis is Burt himself a preening show-biz phony who refuses to update the duos act. Hes more interested in plundering the shows young female fans one of whom is selected every night to check out Burts bed ""the biggest in Vegas."" Suddenly the magical twosomes complacency is challenged by street performer Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) a cross between Criss Angel and Sid Vicious. Greys act involves cutting and burning himself but he does more extreme damage to the careers of Burt and Anton. They lose their longtime gig at the casino hotel run by the jovially soulless Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) whose surname rhymes with -- oh you got that one huh? After bungling a desperate attempt at turning edgier Burt and Anton embark on separate voyages of self-discovery. The story concentrates on Burt who alienates -- again and again and again -- the duos former stage manager Jane. Played by Olivia Wilde loves-him/loves-him-not Jane is an engaging presence but one with a character arc shaped like a Slinky. Reduced to working the activity room of a show-biz rest home Burt encounters Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) the magician who inspired his childhood self to pull rabbits out of hats. As the crabby retiree who no longer considers magic to be well magic Arkin is as winning as Wilde. But he too is given a personality that bends whichever way the plot requires. Rival magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) uses masochistic stunts to draw crowds and publicity away from his faltering rivals. Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Least plausible of all is Burt a formerly bullied little boy who grows up without any apparent self-understanding. He holds opinions that are as archaic as his act -- such as the notion that Jane cant be a magician because shes a ""girl"" -- and are poisonous not only to his spirit but also to his gig. What kind of show-biz pro doesnt recognize the value of novelty? Because of the zigs between his intolerable and sympathetic aspects Burt is an unplayable part. But Carrey whose Steve Gray seems disturbingly almost plausible would have been a better choice than Carell. Zealous self-delusion is Carreys speciality while Carell usually plays the sort of guy whos burdened with rueful self-awareness. The movie opens with Burts dire childhood redeemed only by a magic set and his meeting Anton. There are also repeated appearances by Munnys son a Wonderstone fan who gets Dad to book the magician for his 10th birthday party. These episodes suggest that director Don Scardino (a TV sitcom veteran) and his cohorts hope their PG-13 movie will draw a significant younger-than-13 crowd. But The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is just too mean for young kids. In addition to Grays gory stunts there are a significant number of gags that turn on animal cruelty. These play out mostly off-camera and the nastiest one of them is resolved -- inexplicably -- with no apparent harm to the critter a cute puppy. It turns out that the dog like the movies human performers has suffered injury only to its reputation.

"Review The Incredible Burt Wonderstones title oversells movie - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Incredible Burt Wonderstones title oversells movie The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic What is it with Hollywood and hyperbole these days? Last week saw ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" and now we have ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" Calling it ""The Mildly Diverting Burt Wonderstone"" would have been more accurate but how many tickets is that going to sell?Neither as good as you might hope nor as dreadful as doubters may fear ""Wonderstone"" has in Steve Carell Steve Buscemi Jim Carrey and Alan Arkin four of the funniest men working in movies today. But it doesnt seem to know how to consistently get the best out of them. One reason is that ""Burt Wonderstone"" itself cant make up its mind what kind of movie it is. Part manic comedy part would-be heart-warmer of the ""follow your bliss"" variety its odd combination of tones and situations leads to as many awkward uncertain moments as funny ones.PHOTOS The Incredible Burt Wonderstone premiere Still the chance to watch Carell and Carrey (who costarred in ""Bruce Almighty"") throwing themselves into the kind of crazy characters they do best is not without interest even if director Don Scardino (best known for TVs ""30 Rock"") isnt quite sure how to handle the mood transitions the story demands.This tale of the ups and downs of a celebrated team of Las Vegas magicians (Siegfried and Roy come fleetingly to mind) ""Burt Wonderstone"" starts with its heroes as small boys unhappily bullied just for being alive.What saves the lads is exposure to ""Rance Holloways Magic Kit"" a sleight-of-hand education in a box that is introduced by a video by Holloway himself (the always funny Arkin) who promises these lonely kids ""If you follow my instructions everyone will love you.""Cut to years later and watch Burt Wonderstone (Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Buscemi) still best friends as they climb the ladder to success as a magic team finally getting signed by Ballys casino owner Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) to headline Las Vegas The Burt and Anton Theater. PHOTOS SXSW 13 must-see filmsAll this is merely prologue to ""Burt Wonderstones"" actual story which starts a decade after that and has poor Burt bored bored bored with his rich and famous lifestyle with his devoted partner Anton even with the endless groupies who have to sign a multi-page release before hell allow them to cavort on the biggest bed in Las Vegas.Wonderstone is especially hard on the acts comely female assistants and when one quits right in the middle of a show stage manager Jane (an effective Olivia Wilde) gets thrust into the role and quickly has to tell the great man ""I worshiped you for 10 years and youve made me hate you in 60 seconds.""""Burt Wonderstone"" is initially hampered by the difficulties inherent in putting magic on screen in these CGI-heavy days. So while the screenplay (written by Jonathan Goldstein amp; John Francis Daley) calls for lots of prestidigitation it can be difficult for viewers to tell what is the real deal and what was done with those helpful computers.With his hair long and leonine and his cut-to-the-sternum burgundy velvet costume appropriately sprinkled with sequins Carell has great fun with the egomaniacal Wonderstone and it seems at first that the film will focus on the comic rivalry brewing between himself and the equally driven gonzo street performer Steve Gray who prefers the title ""brain rapist"" to ""magician.""PHOTOS Biggest Hollywood flopsAs played by Carrey with unstoppable messianic fervor Gray is part masochist part performance artist part trickster. Given to enigmatic sayings like ""bad things dont happen to us they happen for us"" Gray is getting a national reputation for his cable show on Intense TV that features stunts like not walking but sleeping on burning coals and he and Wonderstone appear to be cruising for a bruising.Before that can happen however ""Burt Wonderstone"" takes another tack entirely. The Burt and Anton partnership collapses and humiliation after humiliation is visited on Wonderstone. He ends up sinking as low as doing magic tricks for the old folks at the Peaceful Oasis retirement home.Its here that ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" becomes another movie almost entirely clumsily focusing on the redemption of a soul on finding ways and means to humanize this reprobate magician and make him worthy of a good womans love. The film tries to regroup toward the end but its too late. Movies that try to have it all often end up with less than they started with.kenneth.turanlatimes.com---The Incredible Burt WonderstoneMPAA rating PG-13 for sexual content dangerous stunts a drug-related incident and languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Steve Carell The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (movie) Steve Buscemi Oz the Great and Powerful (movie) John Francis Daley Burt Wonderstone could vaporize if The Call dials up biz The Incredible Burt Wonderstone premiere SXSW 2013 13 must-see films Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-incredible-burt-wonderstone-20130315,0,6424554.story",200,theincredibleburtwonderstone15,theincredibleburtwonderstone,latimes

CAST Steve Carell Jim Carrey Steve Buscemi Olivia Wilde LENGTH 138 Magic and movies two different ways of fooling an audience share a few basic rules and here is one of them Never let them see you trying. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" a promising movie with all the makings of comedy magic fumbles so badly that you can almost make out the flop-sweat on its brow. Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton childhood friends who have grown up to become the powdered pomaded headliners at Ballys in Las Vegas. (Buscemis coif a platinum-blond horror is the best joke in the movie.) Theyre a big-prop act in keeping with Burts inflated ego but their ticket sales are shrinking. The reason is Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) a street magician with the Goth wardrobe of Criss Angel and the mundane ideas of David Blaine. His dark reality show ""Steve Gray Brain Rapist"" is edging out old-school glitz. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The stress leads Burt and Anton to split and here is where ""Burt Wonderstone"" begins flying apart like a fumbled pack of cards. While Gray wins over Ballys owner Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) Burt rediscovers the true meaning of magic with his childhood idol Rance Holloway (a welcome Alan Arkin). Can a humbled Burt reteam with Anton to reclaim their top spot? Will their former assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) realize her own magic-act ambitions? The scattered script a four-writer effort is juggled adeptly by director Don Scardino (NBCs ""30 Rock"") but its a lost cause. Were told that Gray is a conniving charlatan but Carrey plays him as a harmless fool -- which is it? As for our two heroes why are we rooting for the bloated Vegas hams over the street rebel? And what is the true meaning of magic anyway? A glancing line about ""childhood"" and ""wonder"" doesnt cut it. In the end ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is that most disheartening sight a botched illusion. PLOT An old-school Vegas magician crosses wands with a mysterious newcomer.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint As an example of crushingly unfunny comedy ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" can only be recommended to masochists and the morbidly curious. Steve Carell plays Burt a vainglorious Las Vegas stage magician who squanders enormous public goodwill as his work becomes stale and joyless. Carell achieved stardom in TV and film roles that mined the awkward uncomfortable rhythms and painful silences of real life. Hes now backsliding in a hackneyed overproduced comedy relying on silly costumes one-note characters lazy setups and dimwitted punch lines. In other words the movie provides its own critique. The problems begin in the first act as we meet 10-year-old Albert a bullied nebbish who seeks grade-school popularity with tricks from a ""Be a Magician"" kit created by legendary Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin). The only attention Burt wins is from the equally nerdy Anthony who becomes his partner in illusions. Jump ahead three decades to the present and they are Burt and Anton whose show ""A Magical Friendship"" has been selling out their casino theater for years. The act is a cheesefest of spangled costumes and corny overblown theatrics backed by the Steve Miller Band oldie ""Abra Cadabra."" Burt and Anton perform with all the verve of a Chuck. E. Cheese animatronic band. There are constant reaction shots as the audience roars in laughter and showers the stars with applause. Audiences are stupid Thats joke No. 1. Hard luck if youre expecting another joke. Popularity notwithstanding the two are still insecure children inside. Burt quite carried away with himself is a jaundiced diva. Hapless Anton (Steve Buscemi) sees their partnership in emotional rather than financial terms. Buscemi is the heart and soul of the film embodying the joy and innocence of adolescence. Carell incarnates stupidity immaturity and sexual obnoxiousness. For an actor specializing in dreamy vulnerability thats not great casting. Warner Bros. Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi are the magic duo ""Burt and Anton."" When guerrilla street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) steals their thunder with acts of bizarre self-mutilation the duo dissolves its act. We view Antons fall with sympathy but Burts with Schadenfreude. While sweetly daft Anton tours the Third World bringing magic to childrens lives (they really would prefer food and clean water) Burt swiftly slides down the Vegas totem pole. Hes reduced to entertaining residents at a rest home where he discovers his childhood idol Holloway. The old pro tells the mid-career hack his work is ""rote and mechanical"" an observation that will set viewers heads nodding in agreement. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" directed by TV sitcom veteran Don Scardino aims to skip but merely stumbles. The illusions that pepper the film never seem truly magical and valuable performers are wasted. As casino mogul Doug Munny (get it?) James Gandolfini smiles all his lines as if willing humor into them. Olivia Wilde playing Wonderstones put-upon magic assistant is a beautiful blank. In his supporting role Carrey is the films best comedic contributor. His spark of divine madness flickers here and there. When he declaims loopy hipster koans like ""Bad things dont happen to us they happen for us"" you can almost hear a sitar player noodling mood music. But after 100 minutes of ""Burt Wonderstones"" scant laughs and missed opportunities you wish it would just vanish down a trapdoor.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 322pm on Thursday Mar. 14 2013 Thursday Mar. 14 2013 Friday Mar. 15 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are a lot of big stars in the comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. Whats missing are a lot of big laughs.Well there are about four -- one right at the very end -- and this is a movie that clocks in at 100 minutes so thats quite a bit of downtime between guffaws to contemplate just why so many people who should know better are involved in this.Steve Carell is the title character a Las Vegas magician who -- along with his best friend Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) -- has a stage act that used to be popular but now seems to appeal only to those seeking refuge from the Nevada heat. This does not make casino owner Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) a happy man.Meanwhile Steve Grey (Jim Carrey) is wowing crowds with his new-generation human-endurance magic; think David Blaine minus 50 IQ points. Doug wants some of that action but Wonderstone whose ego is as vast as a Vegas showroom doesnt want to change.Finally Wonderstone and Marvelton capitulate and thats how they end up in that big box high above the street that weve seen in all the trailers.There is a story and no doubt lots of humor to be mined from the generational battle of magic styles. But The Incredible Burt Wonderstone with its tired labored gags and undercooked love story between Carell and an assistant who wants to be a magician (Olivia Wilde) isnt that story.Director Don Scardino comes out of episodic television (2 Broke Girls Royal Pains 30 Rock) and it shows in his flat approach. The movie is a succession of scenes in search of a laugh track.There are moments when Carrey transcends these barriers through sheer energy and force of will. The increasingly bizarre feats of denial and danger -- holding his urine sleeping on hot coals -- are given a jolt of electricity by his mere presence.Then theres that final extended sight gag which is good enough to almost make up for everything that comes before it. Still it would be better if The Incredible Burt Wonderstone just disappeared. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Comments click to enlarge The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Video Rated PG-13  100 minutes  2013 Occasionally amusing but instantly forgettable this Steve Carell comedy seems designed to be watched on airplanes. He plays a successful Las Vegas magician whos forced to better himself after longtime partner Steve Buscemi quits and his arrogant behavior gets him fired. As in some of Carrells other recent vehicles (Date Night; Crazy Stupid Love) he seems almost desperate for the audience to find him adorable though the humor here is generally good-natured and the other actors are allowed some funny moments too--particularly Jim Carrey playing a pretentious street magician modeled after David Blaine.

(Ben Glass/Ben Glass) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday March 14 2013 1200 PM Title The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Film Info With Steve Carell Jim Carrey Olivia Wilde Comedy about dueling magicians. Director Don Scardino (140). PG-13 Sexuality dangerous stunts drugs language. Area theaters. Like a creaky Vegas act desperate to please ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is so eager you cant help wanting to like it. But you also cant help wondering if something better is playing in the theater next-door. What magic there is comes entirely from the top-flight cast all of whom embrace the movies amusing premise. Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi are Burt and Anton best friends who perform together as Siegfried amp; Roy-style illusionists. Their long-running show at Ballys packs in tourists but Burts popularity -- and enormous ego -- take a hit when an edgy endurance artist named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) comes to town. Burt and Anton do conventional sword tricks with a pretty assistant (Olivia Wilde sparky and appealing). Gray a cross between Criss Angel and David Blaine works solo and drills into his own head. Once the Ballys CEO (James Gandolfini) sees this daring newcomers guerilla style our boys are out of work with Burt forced to entertain seniors at a retirement home. On the bright side one of the residents is former conjurer Rance Holloway (a mellow Alan Arkin) who inspired Burt to become a magician in the first place. And Burt will need all the help he can get to compete against Gray. A showman without much of a show Carell performs like a champ. Though screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (yep the kid from ""Freaks and Geeks"") have let him down he doesnt need a great script to be funny He simply widens his eyes or drops his voice and the audience is his. Carrey too gives his all and is undeniably entertaining. Given that hes actually older than Carell however hes also undeniably miscast as a hot young talent considered ""the future of magic."" Had this been a Will Ferrell project Carreys age would have become part of the joke. But both he and the movie are too self-serious for the broadly farcical tone required. Instead director Don Scardino -- an Emmy winner for ""30 Rock"" -- is bound by an old-fashioned sensibility that feels at odds with the material. One imagines Ferrell (or David Blaine) watching and wondering at all the lost potential - for better gags more interesting magic fresher barbs. Theres so much promise here that you may spend most of the movie searching for hidden hilarity. Instead do your best to appreciate its more obvious charms.

"Incredible Burt Wonderstone The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; incredible-burt-wonderstone-the ) Incredible Burt Wonderstone The (United States 2013) March 14 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli When I watch a comedy like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone I find myself wondering whether plot and character development should be considered in an evaluation of the production. After all the movie has been made with the intention of making people laugh. That being said however there are plenty of comedies that use narrative elements to enhance the humor. This isnt one of them and the material isnt sufficiently funny to allow me to forgive the films feeble storyline and two-dimensional inhabitants. At the core of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a satire of Vegas magicians. While it gets in the occasional amusing jab most of the punches are pulled (excepting when Jim Carrey is on screen). The film has the feel of something afraid to offend and thats always a bad approach for a lampoon. When roasting a subject the oven should be turned all the way up but even at its best The Incredible Burt Wonderstone never gets the temperature above the level needed to warm up leftovers. And its unfortunate that the funniest gag is left to the very end. Steve Carell appears to have outgrown these kinds of films although he returns to them from time-to-time. His work in movies like Hope Springs and Seeking a Friend at the End of the World have shown him to be a capable dramatic performer. Shoehorning him into a production that could have been assembled from scraps on a studio shelf does him a disservice. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone reminds me of some of the throw-away movies made by Will Ferrell after his big breakthrough of 2003-04. Still if the screenplay misuses Carell thats nothing compared to how it treats Olivia Wilde (as a generic love interest) James Gandolfini (as a casino mogul) and Alan Arkin (as an old-time magician) they walk on say their lines then collect their paychecks. The only one truly invested in his performance is Jim Carrey whose portrayal of the David Blaine-inspired street magician Steve Gray mixes Carreys old-school zaniness with an unsettling dark intensity. Hes almost worth the price of admission. Almost but not quite. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone opens with a brief prologue set in 1982 that shows how a young Burt (who will be played as an adult by Carell) and Anton (Steve Buscemi as an adult) become best friends and learn how to perform magic tricks. 20 years later theyre a Vegas sensation playing to a packed house every night. But the next decade is hard on their reputation and friendship. Burt has become jaded and bored and when his partnership with Anton falls apart he proves himself unable to survive solo. He ends up doing magic at old age homes and kids birthday parties. The bulk of the movie is about Burt rediscovering his mojo and beating out Gray in a competition to see who can offer a crowd the bigger ""wow"" factor. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone might have worked better if crafted more as a series of loosely connected sketches. The material cries out for the Christopher Guest approach; its determination to fit neatly into what Hollywood expects from a PG-13 comedy dooms it to relentless mediocrity. The movie offers just enough jokes not to fall into the ""wretchedly unwatchable"" category but its as forgettable as a motion picture can be. This represents long-time TV veteran director Don Scardinos leap from the small screen to the big screen and the result is a soft and safe film that attacks with baby teeth instead of fangs and reminds us that March really isnt a much better month for movies than January or February.

A cardinal rule of magic is never to do the same trick twice. Yet Hollywood continues to make careers disappear. Damsels are sawed in half by age 30 while comedic men go poof after they pass 40.To our surprise ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" resurrects two funny fellows who were left for dead Jim Carrey and Steve Carell. Its too cheesy and predictable to be a real miracle but by Vegas standards its a winner.We meet the titular character in 1982 when hes a bullied boy who finds solace in the Rance Holloway magic kit. Burts equally outcast sidekick is Anton with whom he practices tricks. Years later the well-oiled buddy act of Burt (Carell) and Anton (Steve Buscemi) is a sensation on the Strip. While Anton does most of the work sequined skirt-chaser Burt gets most of the glory (and affects a haughty accent like hes got a two-by-four up his sleeve). After Burt chases away their latest showgirl assistant they hastily recruit crew member Jane (Olivia Wilde) -- just in time for a career plunge accelerated by Burts ego and the challenge of sado-masochistic street magician Steve Gray (Carrey skewering the shtick of Criss Angel).Burt becomes a solo act and his attempt to re-enact the duos signature ""hangman"" trick without a partner is a comic highlight of the movie. Soon he is reduced to begging for bunny food and moonlighting as a magician in a retirement home. There he meets his hero Holloway (scene stealer Alan Arkin) who refines his rusty technique while Jane fluffs his flagging confidence. As a comedy about an egoists rise and fall ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" seems like a script that passed through Will Ferrells hands before it materialized in Carells in-box. Whereas Ferrell is usually likable and self-mocking enough to pull a sensitive rabbit out of his hat Carells character never draws us closer so the sleight-of-hand transformation is too obviously a trick. Yet the deck is stacked with some genuine laughs several of which are conjured by Carrey in a relatively small role.""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" may be a fake but the way it produces new amusement from old tricks is a treat.What ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 140  Content Sexual content dangerous stunts and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Presto The fun disappears from The Incredible Burt Wonderstone  1/2 The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Steve Carell. Steve Buscemi. Jim Carrey. Alan Arkin. James Gandolfini. Olivia Wilde.Good start right? But the more you like the performers featured in ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" the harder it is to sit back relax and enjoy. The comedy about Las Vegas illusionists on the rocks is thin weak and sour. The typical gags involve burnt flesh and the sight of someone pretending to crush a puppy to death. Its not a comedy; its a wince-edy. No magic here.""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" serves as a reminder that everything in a film has a chance to go wrong before a film begins filming. In other words Its the script stupid. This sort of comic vehicle isnt designed to improve the world or change the way Hollywood does business; its simply meant to hand you a few laughs and throw in a little heart by way of its pompous dislikable main characters redemption. And yet with so many jokes based on pain and humiliation without the requisite cleverness or nerve the result is blah. Since childhood Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton have been partners in magic fellow outcasts in a world they yearn to dazzle with feats of illusion taught to them by their hero Rance Holloway (who once appeared on ""The Merv Griffin Show"" we learn from watching one of his 80s-era promos). They boys grow up and become a hot attraction in Las Vegas -- Siegfried and Roy without the tetchy felines.A decade later the acts grown stale and Burt a blase Lothario played by Carell has become a terrible person. Buscemis Anton isnt so much a character as an embodiment of hurt feelings. They cant stand each other. And theres a dangerous new kid in town a ""Jackass""-y guerrilla performer (Jim Carrey doing pretty much what Tom Cruise did in ""Rock of Ages"" -- self-serious preening with weirdly off-kilter timing) who gives the bloodthirsty public what it wants violence drills to the skull that kind of thing.The key to this kind of intended smart-stupid comedy I think is elusive. The best of Will Ferrells smart-stupid comedies to date (""Anchorman"" ""Blades of Glory"") skipped along while pulling a straight face in their treatment of adolescent narcissists on parade. Both films leaned on strong ensembles keeping different sorts of funny people busy and wittily deployed complementing Ferrells knack for clueless brainless egotistical confidence.Carell is different and drier but a wonderfully skillful actor. You can barely tell in ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" Its interesting seeing Carell play a full-on louse (though of course a sweetheart underneath) but director Don Scardino seems to have misplaced everything he learned directing all those ""30 Rock"" episodes. Wheres the fleet-footed throwaway material? The movie settles for slow and crude and that combination works like an anti-charm with any sort of comedy. Nothing ignites or even intersects here. Carreys in his own movie doing stand-alone stunts that never work up a head of steam. Gandolfini underplays shrewdly as a venal casino owner; Wilde as Burt and Antons assistant with skills of her own redeems what she can where she can. Then Alan Arkin shows up and as I say every day of my film critic life Thank God for Alan Arkin. Plying his trade in a retirement home the fallen Burt finally meets his lifelong magician hero in his avuncular dotage. Arkins Holloway mentors Burt back to life reconnecting him to what drew him to magic in the first place. The actor cant save the movie. But he can save his scenes.And with this script written by the ""Horrible Bosses"" team of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley that really is magic.mjphillipstribune.comThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content dangerous stunts a drug-related incident and language)Running time 140Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Steve Carell The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (movie) Steve Buscemi Rock of Ages (movie) Tom Cruise The incredible Steve Carell Red Carpet Jim Carrey at The Incredible Burt Wonderstone premiere Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Incredible Burt Wonderstone opens with a scene that captures some of the bittersweet adolescent ennui of Freaks And Geeks the cult classic that created a generation of young stars and creators--including John Francis Daley the former child star who co-wrote the films screenplay. The film begins with a latchkey kid coming home on his birthday to find his mother has left him a cake mix detailed instructions for baking his own cake and his birthday present a magic kit bearing the alluring mysterious image of master magician Alan Arkin. The expression of radiant joy on the boys face speaks volumes about the power of escapism and reinvention to a lonely sad child though the vehicle for that reinvention couldnt be more ridiculous or more likely to get the child shoved into a locker. Arkin and this glowing take on the transformative power of magic both not-so-magically reappear later in the film by which point the opening scenes genuine emotion has been replaced by practiced schmaltz effective on many levels but fundamentally pandering and manipulative. Ripped haphazardly from yesterdays headlines and populated with variations on magics biggest names from the past few decades Burt Wonderstone features Steve Carell as the grown-up version of the wide-eyed kid from the opening scenes. Hes a preening peacock of a magician who barely tolerates partner Steve Buscemi for the sake of their enormously lucrative Vegas act. But when the act breaks up and Carell loses everything hes forced to re-examine his life and his misplaced priorities as he struggles to win back his career in the face of fierce competition from self-styled ""street magician"" Jim Carrey whose unfortunate facial hair and grating Poochie-style ""tude"" marks him as a Criss Angel stand-in. A 2013 comedy that pits a heterosexual exile from a Siegfried amp; Roy-like team against an Angel figure isnt going to win any points for capturing the zeitgeist and Wonderstone has the disadvantage throughout of taking easy shots at a cheeseball form of show business. Was anyone really dying to see someone take Vegas-style magicians down a peg? Carell is amusingly fearless in his characters noxious narcissism but when it comes time for his humbling the films humor turns soft and squishy. There are hints throughout of the darker edgier comedy that might have been if say Bobcat Goldthwait had made the film a Shakes The Clown for magicians but the filmmakers instead choose the route that entails a painfully arbitrary love interest who disappears for large swaths of the story (Olivia Wilde fine in an underwritten role) and plotting so lazy that the climax revolves around a big magic competition. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone has its cornball charm thanks largely to the confident work of old pros Carell Arkin and Buscemi but its ultimately a big gaudy predictable show strictly for the rubes and tourists.

In what we might call the post-""Seinfeld"" era - the era of ""South Park"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""The Office"" and ""Girls"" -- American comedy has become increasingly absurdist anarchic unpredictable and even confrontational in the half-hour television format. But when those same tendencies get forced through the Hollywood sausage maker as in the new Steve Carell vehicle ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" it generally comes out as a sentimental and highly conventional tale of fall and redemption with all the so-called narrative beats in the so-called right place.Is this really what the audience wants? A deliriously unhinged setup and larger-than-life characters abruptly devolving into a mind-numbingly familiar story with a totalitarian happy ending? No wait - dont answer that. (As others have observed this describes every hit movie of Will Ferrells career.) Anyway if I sound like Im focusing on the idea of originality I realize thats missing the point. Storytelling mostly is not about originality or surprise and its no big secret that the audience likes it if the hero is redeemed and gets the girl in the end. But theres still something to be said for boring old-fashioned notions of quality and execution such as not making your character transformation and happy ending seem careless and tacked-on and irredeemably stupid. Theres also something to be said for ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" which stars arguably the most well-liked comic actor in Hollywood and also has juicy supporting roles for Steve Buscemi and one-time comedy box-office champ Jim Carrey. Heres what it is This is a really lively fun and high-spirited comedy. If you leave after half an hour.Stay a full hour though and youre stuck in a death spiral of unfunniness as all the outrageous charm of the generational conflict between Carells Burt Wonderstone a David Copperfield-style Vegas superstar and Carreys upstart street magician Steve Gray (aka ""the Brain Rapist"") gradually leaks out like the sticky red goo from a punctured cruise-ship dessert. There are plenty of easy and genuine laughs early on as we watch one-time nerd-boy Burt become a creature of clueless grandeur with a leonine mane and a jumpsuit out of Elvis nightmares during the Johnny Carson era. Some viewers may suspect that Carell and Buscemi who plays Burts sweaty but commonsensical sidekick Anton Marvelton overdo the homophobic and/or homoerotic stage patter or the atrocious dance steps set to Steve Millers ""Abracadabra."" But if youve ever actually seen a Vegas stage show youll recognize the production values as being way too close to the real thing.When we reach the contemporary epoch Burt is a bronzed and preening creep with a penumbra of oddly hued stylist-baked hair - its a genuinely unsettling portrayal of a certain variety of chemically preserved stardom which makes it difficult to accept his sudden reinvention as a real person. He and Anton have been headlining a hotel showroom run by the blithe and unctuous casino magnate Doug Munny (played with an understated blend of malice and avarice by James Gandolfini) for a decade. They bitch each other out like an old married couple in between shows constantly firing their interchangeable female assistants which is how they end up hiring an aspiring magician named Jane (the lovely Olivia Wilde game but wasted in an underwritten role) and thrusting her onstage. You Might Also Like But Burt and Antons real problem even if they dont know it yet is that their old-school prop-heavy stage illusions are no match for Carreys Steve Gray a buffed-out dude with Jesus hair and tattoos whos doing low-grade performance art and shedding blood on the sidewalk outside the casino. (Gray is most obviously modeled on metal-flavored magician Criss Angel with a side of David Blaine.) One of the numerous things that starts to go wrong in ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" which is directed by TV veteran Don Scardino is that were supposed to find Steve more repellent and less authentic than Burt and it totally doesnt work. I mean theyre both idiots but Carrey is just so damn enjoyable when playing mock-profundity and bogus intensity especially when set free from being honorable or decent. This one of the best roles of his recent tortured film career and I immediately wanted the movie to become Steve Grays story and hoped the icky and reptilian Burt would go away.Indeed Steve gets written out of the movie almost entirely after Burt loses everything and winds up living in a shabby motel room with a desperation gig doing magic tricks for old folks in a retirement home. If youre guessing he makes connections there - to magic to love to life to a crusty but angelic Alan Arkin character - and is spiritually renewed then you can write the rest of the movie without my help. Thing is nothing about the script (which is by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley) or Carells uncannily unpleasant performance to that point gives us any indication that Burt is anything other than a fatuous sexist egotistical creep with no understanding of other people himself or the universe. Scardino is relying almost exclusively on the fact that Carell is the star of the picture and we basically like him or at least think we do. Therefore its OK for him to go through a chrysalis-like overnight transformation from unbelievable jerkass to decent and charming human being with a restrained wardrobe. What makes the minor-league dumbness of ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" so disappointing is that the film has at least some of the ingredients of a shrewd American satire not least in the quiet clever menace of Gandolfinis character who names his new hotel after himself (""The Doug"") and appears on the giant video screen outside its front doors beaming and preening. Jay Mohr gets a lovely throwaway role as a failed magician called Rick the Implausible a regular in a dive bar haunted by magicians that could have been the setting for David Mamet-style shop-talk encounters between Burt and Steve. Instead everything that happens in the final two-thirds of the movie - which is to say almost nothing - seems calibrated to cynical if plausible ideas about the audience First you make them laugh then you mellow them out with a full hour of boredom so they can text for tapas reservations and tweet about how great the movie was before its actually over.

""Remember"" advises their assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) ""all you have to do is nothing."" Its a funny line but one also suspects it was the production motto for ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" a movie that always seems poised to deliver big laughs but once the smoke and the pigeons clear leaves you only with a mild chuckle or two. The film falls squarely into the formula that Will Ferrell popularized -- lets find something dorky and look at characters who take it totally seriously -- but ""Burt Wonderstone"" cant decide if it wants to bury glitzy cornball Vegas-style magic or to praise it resulting in a comedy that occasionally talks tough but ultimately reveals a bland mushy center. Our hero is introduced as an unpopular bullied child; Lyle Workmans score goes into minor-key overdrive when poor little Albert (Mason Cook) gets beaten up on his birthday only to come home to an empty house a note from his working mom a box of cake mix and one present. But that present turns out to be a magic kit endorsed by the legendary Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) and the kid is hooked. (Any resemblance between Rance Holloway and Harry Blackstone Sr. is entirely intentional.) Magic not only stimulates Alberts imagination its a way for him to bond with fellow outcast Anton and the two become inseparable. A few decades later theyre headlining in Vegas with a show that spotlights their ""Magical Friendship"" -- except that off-stage theyre hardly speaking. Burt has become absurdly vain and pompous and their show while still popular is stale and repetitive. Stealing their spotlight is Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) a ""street magician"" of the David Blaine-Criss Angel school and while his shtick is more about self-mortification and less a matter of prestidigitation audiences go wild for his TV show ""Mind Rape."" Which leads to the Plexiglass-box incident and after that goes awry Anton leaves the act leaving Burt to try to do the same show by himself with no one filling in the other half of the dialogue. Canned by hotel mogul Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) Burt is reduced to living in a shabby motel and entertaining at an old folks home. (Theres no transition from top of the heap to bottom of the barrel; the words ""Reno"" ""Laughlin"" and ""Branson"" are never spoken.) Will a chance encounter with the aged Rance Holloway help Burt get his magical mojo back? Take a wild guess. Obviously in a movie like this its about the journey and not the destination but screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (""Horrible Bosses"") and director Don Scardino keep the proceedings mild when they could be wild. Worse they assign each character one or two defining traits and then we see them indulge those flaws over and over and over again until theyre not remotely funny anymore. Carell and Carrey are operating in their wheelhouses with these absurd showmen but theyre hemmed in by the scripts limited parameters and they quickly grow tedious. Their redundant cartoonishness becomes so wearying that Wilde and Arkin wind up stealing the movie by underplaying. We know from ""The Prestige"" and any number of other movies about magic that illusion is all about what you do while youre distracting the audience. Its too easy to look right through ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" which means it can never really dazzle us. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

And you would think that a movie boasting such artful laughmasters as Steve Carell Jim Carrey Steve Buscemi and Alan Arkin would have some real comedic heft.In the case of ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" you would be wrong on both counts. It is not a dreadful film. There are just enough laughs and clever moments to keep it north of the Adam Sandler line of comic ineptitude. But it is so wildly inconsistent that it always seems on the verge of completely falling apart and losing what little attachment it has to reality.The premise isnt a bad one. Certainly with proper execution it could have worked as a comedy with some dark overtones. This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Steve Buscemi background and Steve Carell in a scene from ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Ben Glass) ( Ben Glass ) Burt Wonderstone (Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Buscemi) have turned a youthful love of illusions and sleight of hand into a magic show that eventually earns them a headlining spot at Ballys Casino in Las Vegas. (The act or what we see of it seems like a second-rate Siegfried and Roy -- minus the big cats.) With all the glitz and glamour of the Strip its a couple of nerdy guys living the dream.But over the years Wonderstone becomes arrogant and narcissistic. Worse the tricks the onstage banter and most critically the duos diminishing audience have all become old.Then cable TV magician Steve Gray (Carrey) comes to Vegas performing his extreme street stunts and grabbing that younger audience. (Gray bears more than a passing resemblance to illusionist Criss Angel who once ""survived"" being run over by a steam roller while lying on a bed of broken glass. Ouch.)Advertisement A trick created by Wonderstone and Marvelton to regain center stage from Gray goes disastrously wrong thanks mostly to Burts self-centeredness. In the wake of the fiasco Anton quits Ballys boss (James Gandolfini surprisingly unfunny) gives the act the boot and Burt ends up going from the penthouse to living in a dumpy motel and performing at a seniors facility.In the end of course there is redemption a reunion true love (with the luminous Olivia Wilde who is better than her part) and a final showdown with Gray. Much of the comeback can be credited to legendary magician Rance Holloway (Arkin) who in a rare bit of honest dialogue lectures Burt saying ""What people want is not a magic show. What they want is real magic.""Real magic is what we dont get from screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley who hit the big-time with 2011s ""Horrible Bosses."" (Daley is the same John Francis Daley who stars on TVs ""Bones"" and is best known for playing Sam on ""Freaks and Geeks."") ""Horrible Bosses"" was a pretty funny if over-the-top piece of business but on ""Burt Wonderstone"" the writers cant seem to find a way to mesh the films constantly shifting tone or maintain a consistent connection to reality. Thats true right to the films ending when it loses what little grip it had on the real world of magic. They hit enough high notes to generate more than a few laughs but those bits and pieces dont amount to a cohesive whole.Director Don Scardino is a veteran TV sitcom director (""30 Rock"") and he keeps things moving. But he does little to help his cast get through the weak spots in the writing. Carrey has the acting chops to go to the dark side (which is where Gray ought to be) but in the end he comes off more Looney Tunes than dangerous lunatic. No one makes unpleasant more relatable than Carell but theres nothing he can do with Burt to make the magicians sudden transformation from raging egotist to nice guy even remotely plausible. Only Arkin really makes something of his role with his deadpan delivery making his moments on screen far funnier than they should be.Theres no question that you will laugh at times throughout ""Burt Wonderstone."" But if you are looking for something truly magical you will come away disappointed.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.the incredible burt wonderstone   Rating PG-13 (for language sexual content and do-not-try-this-at-home-kids magical stunts)Cast Steve Carell Jim Carrey Steve Buscemi and Alan ArkinDirector Don ScardinoRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

RELATED NEWS Steve Buscemis best roles By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Mar 13 2013 942 AM Steve Carell does a certain thing really well as any fan of ""The Office"" (or his work on ""The Daily Show"" before that) can attest He excels at playing characters who are in the words of a late great friend ""arrogant without portfolio."" They are puffed-up dimwits similar to Michael Scott during his run on ""The Office."" But the secret to Carells portrayals of these kinds of characters is that he always gives them an underlying sweetness a kind of hangdog charm however deeply buried that makes you root for them in spite of themselves. And therein lies the problem with ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" One of them anyway. Carell plays the title character half of a magic act gone stale mostly because of his own headstrong arrogance. Which could be good comedy fodder except that in director Don Scardinos film Carell doesnt give us enough to root for. Burt is a jerk pure and simple with the charm missing. Sure in the predictable story he slouches toward redemption but at a certain point its too late to care. Theres just not enough heart in the movie. Thats too bad. There are some genuine laughs in the film and the idea of letting the air out of such self-inflated performers as Criss Angel and David Blaine has a certain potential. Unfortunately its never quite realized here. The film begins with a flashback with the young Burt (Mason Cook) being bullied. For his birthday his busy single mom leaves him a box of cake mix and as a gift a Rance Holloway magic kit. Holloway (Alan Arkin) in his VCR instruction tape proves to be an inspiration and soon fellow outsider Anton (Luke Vanek) has joined Burt. Fast-forward and Burt (Carell) and Anton (Steve Buscemi) are playing the Las Vegas Strip rich and famous beyond their dreams. But Burt has soured. Hes obnoxious self-centered a firm believer in his own hype. Hes no longer performing for the love of magic but mostly to troll for women. He even does that in a rote by-the-numbers way; in one of the funnier sequences a willing conquest must jump through several hoops before bedding Burt including signing a consent agreement. But with their blow-dried hair and Siegfried-and-Roy-inspired costumes Burt and Anton are growing stale. The arrival of an edgy likely insane street magician named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey looking like Brad Pitt in an alternate universe) only emphasizes the point. (Grays ""tricks"" include holding his urine for several days and sleeping on a bed of hot coals.) Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) the owner of the hotel where Burt and Anton perform demands an update to their act which proves disastrous. Soon the pair has broken up; loyal assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) is also a casualty of their split. This could have gone many ways. Unfortunately the film follows a predictable route. Broke Burt entertains retired Vegas performers at an old-folks home. A discovery there will help him rekindle his love for his craft. But is there still room for a magician like Burt in a world of Steve Grays? It doesnt take a magician to guess the answer to that question. Buscemi disappears for much of the movie (though Anton shows up in an amusing CNN report) leaving the best performances to the supporting cast. Wilde is game elevating a thin character and while Arkin seems to have settled into playing the same type of character in every movie hes in lately it helps that hes really good at it. Carrey is best when there is something to anchor his unhinged tendencies and the Steve Gray character gives him that. But overall the film never finds its footing with its awkward shifts in tone accentuating the unease. Theres something a little off and its Carell. We want to like him in comedies. Its a big part of whats made him a star. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" never really gives us the chance. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr BURT OUT Steve Carell and Olivia Wilde star alongside Jim Carrey and Steve Buscemi in this magical story. (Ben Glass) B- The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Genre Comedy; Starring Steve Buscemi Steve Carell Jim Carrey Olivia Wilde; Director Don Scardino; Release Date Wide 03/15/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 98; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 28 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT In the Incredible Burt Wonderstone Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play world-famous Las Vegas magicians. Carell wears spangled red velvet and a poufy wig that makes him look like Barry Manilow and Buscemi sports an even more unreal-looking lanky mop. Each night they kick off their act by doing a smiley little dance to ""Abracadabra"" that cheesy-catchy Steve Miller Band classic. This trademark fanfare places the two somewhere between Siegfried amp; Roy and the head-bopping Butabi brothers from Saturday Night Live and I chuckled with mild pleasure at the dopey kitschiness of it. I assumed (or at least hoped) that the dance would be a warm-up for the much bigger laughs to come. Carells Burt Wonderstone and Buscemis Anton Marvelton have been partners ever since they were childhood geeks who began inventing their own magic tricks back in the early 80s. Theyve been doing their sold-out show at Ballys for so long now that theyre sick of it and sick of each other too. Burt off stage is a toxic diva who makes groupies sign contracts and treats Anton like an indentured servant. One night the two are working with a brand-new assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) performing a classic trick that requires Burt and Jane to huddle inside a box which Anton jabs with swords. Squeezed inside the compartment Burt asks Jane to sleep with him that night and when she turns him down he throws a hissy fit. It should be an over-the-top funny moment as Carell lashes out with a faux-aristocratic hauteur. Hes going for a Will Ferrell meltdown yet theres something a little too controlled about Carells bombastic nuttiness. The effect isnt hilariously insane. Once again its just kind of mild. Burt Wonderstone seems to be reaching for the tone of early Farrelly brothers movies like Kingpin and also for the madcap hostility of Zoolander. Yet in too many scenes the comedy doesnt quite ignite. The movie rarely climbs out of the chuckle zone except for a few times when Jim Carrey is on screen as Burt and Antons rival a stringy-haired tattooed street magician who specializes in cable-TV stunts that represent the new era Hes like Criss Angel as a Zen pain freak. The gleam of madness in Carreys eye finds a perfect home in this role which has him upping the ante on how far hell go (holding in his urine for 12 days spending a night on hot coals) all as a way to bedazzle jaded audiences. He beats Burt and Anton at their own game and their act starts to fall apart. And so in a way does the movie. Instead of getting wilder it turns earnest and mushy as Burt humbled by failure starts performing at a retirement home where he befriends Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) the cranky magician whose VHS tape first inspired him as a kid. Burt Wonderstone has a real affection for the world of illusionists a showbiz demimonde it treats with simultaneous snark and awe. Yet the movie itself is too cautious and unimaginative to bring off what a great magic trick -- or comedy -- should do make us laugh out loud with surprise.

Like his Daily Show reporter or The Offices Michael Scott his 40 year-old virgin lived in terror that someone might catch on to the fact that he knows nothing about subjects he purports to have mastered. When his virgin apes just-us-guys talk and insists that breasts feel like bags of sand our laughter isnt just at his absurd cluelessness. Its at Carell the performers ability to lay bare our near-universal impulse to lie to cover up our own ignorance at the way were implicated in this human failing. Remember that scene the next time someone asks if youve read a book that you feel you should have--then instead of pretending just say ""No.""Carell again plays oblivious in the fitfully inspired magician comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone but he doesnt play human. As the magician of the title hes a dick David Copperfield on the decline a third-rate casino act done up in chintzy velvet and grinding through the same tricks in the same show hes been doing for a decade. Its amusing that Carell left The Office in part to do a movie about the kind of guy who would never leave The Office; whats less amusing is that Wonderstone--unlike that virgin--has absolutely no idea that he doesnt know what he doesnt know. That means we never get those moments of broad yet recognizable behavior. Instead Wonderstone is all jackass cruel and dumb capable only of the most selfish and least inventive responses which stiffs the several long scenes of him sexually harassing poor Olivia Wilde (as Wonderstones assistant) or berating Steve Buscemi (as Wonderstones bickering partner in magic). Its a Will Ferrell-style part played by an actor lacking abandon. Carell never looks like his Wonderstone is truly into his comic horribleness.The movie is structured like an expanded Krusty the Clown episode of The Simpsons. At the start Wonderstone stands near the top of his magician world. Thanks to hubris and bad investments he loses everything and then has to claw back. This being a mainstream Hollywood comedy theres also a redemptive arc even more rote than the soundtrack cues which include Us3s ""Cantaloop"" and C+C Music Factorys ""Everybody Dance Now"" with no apparent irony.Film Details The Incredible Burt Wonderstone RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time100 More Info Trailer Inevitably Wonderstone rediscovers the spirit of his childhood finds something to believe in and even gets the girl hes been awful to since the first reel a development were presumably meant to applaud. All this blooming-into-a-better-person stuff gives Carell the chance to return to the mode of several of his more serious comedies one also often aspired to by Robin Williams and one that isnt all that human either that of the wounded man who heals himself by embracing naif-ishness. Its no less alienating than his abusive magician routine. The films biggest surprise is that were expected to feel something besides impatience as Wonderstone montage-ing himself back into shape gapes like a child at the wonder of magic.Outside a well-scripted magician sex scene and some charming late-in-the-movie stage patter Carell is never funny and human in the same moment. Thats especially disappointing considering that theres much here for audiences to laugh at. Screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (seen briefly as a paramedic) have been generous in the crafting of ridiculous magic acts several of which become ace comic setpieces. Buscemi is antsy yet beatific as the smarter less charismatic Roy to Carells Siegfried. Scenes of their act pre-crackup are funny enough but one of a dejected Wonderstone attempting it solo is a comic marvel evidence of what the rest of the movie might have been with smarter handling of Carells obliviousness.The supporting cast is all first-rate. Wilde is asked to do nothing more than be pretty and earnest and put-upon but Jim Carrey turns up as a controlled grotesque a self-abusing ""magician"" whose act is all about violations of his own body. Done up like a goonish Brad Pitt or regular Chris Hemsworth as Thor Carrey applies his cartoon expressiveness to its most judicious ends in years. Also strong is James Gandolfini as a casino owner with no time for bullshit; hes the only character in the movie who reacts to anyone else the way that a person might.Its notable these days when a big-screen studio comedy is as funny as a good episode of a smart show. Burt Wonderstone hits that mark at least--although Carells on-stage mincing to Steve Millers ""Abracadabra"" isnt a patch on Will Arnetts to ""The Final Countdown"" on Arrested Development. What was funniest about that was how much Arnettts Gob needed everyone else to be into it; his self-esteem was on the line each time he looked foolish. Carells Wonderstone just presumes that we are into it already--a mistake shared by the filmmakers.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

A racecar driver or a competitive ice skater or a 70s TV newsman will bask in a blustery arrogance coupled with a serious lack of self-awareness. Hell fall from grace thanks to an equally delusional rival; our hero must then work his way back to the top usually with the help of a cantankerous mentor or an estranged equally dim-witted sidekick. Youll wonder in fact while watching this lazy attempt to drop Steve Carell into a triumph-of-the-Will scenario about Vegas illusionists if the titular role was originally written for Ferrell--just as Steve Buscemis second banana could have been penned for John C. Reilly and Jim Carreys Criss Angel-like street magician was probably slotted for Ben Stiller. No matter; this aggressively humorless farce would play like a dead rabbit pulled out of a hat regardless of the casting choices. If youve watched Carells tenure on The Office you know he could easily occupy the alpha-moron throne. But neither the screenwriters nor 30 Rock veteran Don Scardino can set up a single gag properly though they do know how to efficiently waste comic talent (including Alan Arkin and Olivia Wilde). Wonderstones climax revolves around an improbable comeback trick that involves making an entire audience disappear. The movie itself should have no problem accomplishing that feat long before the end credits.

The Incredible Burt Wonderstone has two such actors - Steve Buscemi and Alan Arkin - as part of a gallery of very watchable faces that also includes Steve Carell Jim Carrey and James Gandolfini. Its just a pity that watching these men work is the only pleasure the film has to offer.Carell plays the titular magician who has spent a decade entertaining audiences in Gandolfinis Vegas hotel with his lifelong sidekick Anton Marvelton (Buscemi). But now audiences are dwindling Burt and Anton are at each others throats and more daring comics like self-harming David Blaine-clone Steve Gray (Carrey) are on the rise. From the gooey overlong opening flashback sequence its clear that somethings off here the jokes fall flat the characters are obvious the sentiment is too rich. Matters improve with the first appearance of Carell and especially Buscemi who with his blonde bouffant and eternally optimistic attitude is the heart of the film. The late arrival of Arkin also adds charm though his character never goes anywhere and thanks to a confused rambling plot theres even one point where were not sure if hes actually still alive. In the end theres nothing here beyond the obvious riches-to-rags friendship-lost-and-found celebrity-rivalry cliches. But the presence of those fine performers means that The Incredible Burt Wonderstone stays just the right side of bearable.

I cannot remember the last time I saw so many good actors so poorly served by a script and a film that will hopefully soon be forgootten. Wilde as the token female is never allowed to develop. Best avoided if at all possible. A poor 2 star film just.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 13 2013JacobFeatured""...and more daring comics are on the rise""?

TWITTER ""30 Rock"" director/producer Don Scardino offers a story about magicians (Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi) whose routines have fallen out of fashion. AUSTIN -- Comebacks are as easy as pulling rabbits from a hat in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone a showbiz tale thats enjoyable but as familiar as the old-school routines its magician heroes dish out. A top-drawer cast guarantees some commercial appeal for this theatrical outing by small-screen vet Don Scardino but the film isnt nearly as fresh as the show for which hes best known 30 Rock. Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton childhood nerds who bonded over magic tricks and grew up to be headlining partners in Vegas. Stuck in a glam timewarp they still wear spangled jumpsuits and too much hairspray while reciting banter theyve used for a decade. PHOTOS  From Anchorman to Office Steve Carells 10 Best Roles While Burt revels in the excess of stardom and Anton sweetly endures his jaded partners abuse new trends in magic are making them irrelevant Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) an endurance-stunt performer in the Criss Angel-/David Blaine- mold is drawing attention out on the Strip and online. In a half-baked attempt to outdo him -- instigated by the casino mogul (James Gandolfini) threatening to end their contract -- the men have a near-death experience and dissolve both their act and their friendship. As its title suggests the film follows Burt on his pathetic fall from fame which ends in a gig at a retirement home for aged entertainers. But Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daleys script gives us little reason to care about this humiliation and were still not done relishing Burts comeuppance when he finds his path to redemption At the retirement home he meets Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) the prestidigitator who inspired Burt and all his peers to learn magic in the first place. As an old-timer who knows more about pleasing crowds than any of his successors Arkin is well positioned to hover a bit above the rest of this movie; in a single sarcastic reaction shot he earns more laughter than any ten-minute stretch here. But Wonderstone underuses him spending time instead on Burt and Antons assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) who knows more about magic than her looks suggest and is destined to fill a romantic-interest slot as artificial as a bouquet of plastic flowers springing out of a trick wand. VIDEO Anchorman 2 Teasers Bring Back Ron Burgundy and Company Carrey fares a bit better enjoying his characters pompous anti-glitz shtick but the extremes of his stunts -- sleeping all night on hot coals drilling a hole in his skull -- are as broadly drawn as the stale act Burt amp; Anton have been peddling. Neither is quite believable as something that might exist in todays Vegas -- and as Rance Holloway would be the first to tell you making the audience believe is more important than all the slight-of-hand and planning that makes an illusion work.

And while it may fall short of working B.O. magic when it hits theaters March 15 the pic -- which played well with the opening-night crowd at the SXSW Film Festival -- could wind up generating steady biz on a long-term basis rather than pulling a quick vanishing act. Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi are well cast as Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton childhood friends (and fellow nerd outcasts) who grew up to be superstar magicians with their own permanent performance place inside a glitzy Las Vegas casino. Unfortunately success long ago went to Burts amply hairsprayed head. He and Anton routinely don their spangly costumes strike their practiced poses trade their well-worn wisecracks and rotely go through the motions during an act that obviously hasnt changed much in a decade or so. (Their apt onstage theme Steve Millers ""Abracadabra"" becomes an amusing running gag simply through endless repetition.) But despite Antons suggestion that they refresh their bag of tricks Burt is far more interested in bedding groupies -- using a meticulously detailed m.o. (including demands for proof of age and a signed release form) revealed in one of the pics most inspired sequences -- than doing anything that hasnt already worked with audiences. Their complacency leaves room for a snarky street magician/endurance artist named Steve Gray (think Criss Angel but with more attitude than talent) to siphon off their audience with self-aggrandizing stunts on and off the Vegas Strip. Hilariously played by Jim Carrey as a condescending showoff Gray thrives on shocking people with dangerous feats (such as maiming himself and sleeping on hot coals) that Burt indignantly insists arent ""real"" magic. Trouble is theyre real enough to attract the interest of Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) the fabulously rich and mega-egotistic owner of the casino where Burt and Anton perform. When Munny demands that his fading stars attempt something as spectacular as Grays risky trickery they do so -- quite disastrously -- leading to public humiliation an acrimonious breakup and the start of Burts reluctant journey toward something like personal and professional rebirth. Carell is at the top of his form as the self-absorbed Burt struggles to maintain his haughty sangfroid while trying to convince himself and everyone else thats hes still a superstar even as hes reduced to taking a gig as the resident act at a retirement home for Vegas performers. Fortunately thats where the fallen-from-grace former headliner meets a singularly irascible retiree Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) the same legendary magician who originally inspired Burt to pursue prestidigitation as a profession. With a little help from Holloway -- and encouragement from Jane (Olivia Wilde) a former stage assistant who proves to be pretty magical herself -- Burt is ready to compete against Gray and several others in an audition for a prime gig at Munnys latest hotel. But what he really really needs to seal the deal is a reunion with his estranged partner whose own journey of self-discovery shows that in some parts of the world people have desperate need of the rabbits magicians pull out of their hats. Former actor turned TV helmer Don Scardino does a bang-up job of unobtrusively maneuvering through stealthy tonal shifts in the free-wheeling script by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. Some of the standout scenes border on black comedy (including the blunt-force physical gags in the pics final minutes) while others rely more on traditionally sunny buddy-comedy humor. But Scardino and his players ensure that there are no bumpy transitions only a smooth ride. Buscemi is very engaging as the amiably optimistic Anton Wilde fleshes out a thinly written part through sheer screen presence Gandolfini attacks his part with infectious delight and Arkin continues his long run of show-stopping scene-stealing supporting perfs. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" boasts a brightly buffed technical polish. The trademark trick in Burt and Antons act is a stunt partly designed by real-life magician David Copperfield who appears as himself in a witty in-jokey sequence. Golden oldies and new tunes are efficiently employed in the mood-enhancing soundtrack. Expect to be humming ""Abracadabra"" for days afterward whether you want to or not.

Harvey Clapsaddle says March 21 2013 at 228 pm After reading the review I have to seriously wonder if Joe Leydon saw the same movie that I saw??? This was the worst excuse of a movie Ive ever seen I seriously wonder if the ppl who put this together did it as a joke This so called movie was on life support from the start and then flat lined. I sat in the theater wondering when is it going to get funny?? I should have known when they showed all these snippets on TV. They only showed the funniest clips from the entire movie which only lasted 60 seconds in total. All that could be shown in a typical commercial. Anyone who thinks this was a good movie and would recommend it to your friends is only trying to punish them for something they did. I left and went to the front of the theater and demanded my money back. I rate this movie 0.0 Reply Steve says March 20 2013 at 1130 am Funny funny and a hilarious final scene I recommend this film to all especially those who need a good laugh...and who doesnt these days. Reply Alex Howard says March 12 2013 at 738 pm I have watched as Don Scardino made the transition from performer to performers director. He did excellent work directing ""Law and Order"" then ""Ed"" and ""Royal Pains."" Don Scardino seems to be the kind of director actors love to work for. I cant wait to see this movie with the star-studded cast and the review you have given it. It will be the first comedy I will pay to see in many years. Reply Jake says March 10 2013 at 944 am Why does deadline report that sxsw said this movie got tepid response Reply mugsydean says March 10 2013 at 1222 am Writes John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein will soon rule the world. A truly great film. Reply rebecca bender says March 9 2013 at 1125 pm great review for this movie Reply Estrea Janoson says March 9 2013 at 329 pm Anything John Francis Daley writes is great Reply See All 7 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...

Clearly its ""Steve Gray Brain Rapist"". As embodied by Jim Carrey Gray represents the threat of newer edgier street magic that threatens to put old-school Vegas showmen like Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) out of business. Directed by ""30 Rock"" vet Don Scardino and written by a quartet of credited writers ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is a sporadically hilarious lark that nonetheless adheres to the lunkhead blueprint that has defined the careers of Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell over the past decade. Hell one could trace ""Wonderstone"" right over the plotting of 2001s ""Zoolander"" in particular the aloof lead (Carell) the equally aloof sidekick (Buscemi) the flamboyant rival (Carrey) the blonde love interest/straight (wo)man (Olivia Wilde). In one of the films funnier sequences Steve and Burt even engage in a competitive magic-off that isnt far off from that films walk-off bit. Carells pompous personality is only good for so many chuckles but Scardino has better luck finding laughs in the margins of the everyday world of magicians (jerk illusionists tease bartenders with lavish tips before levitating out the door; well-meaning ones bring magic kits to starving Cambodian villages) and from casual parental abandonment in the films prologue (""Happy Birthday Me"" pricelessly scrawled on a cake made from scratch by Moms kindly instructions). When hotel owner Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) remarks on Steve Grays success a defensive Burt scoffs ""So he mutters and cuts himself. My niece does that"" A lot of these one-off gags and throwaway lines muffle the creaks of a well-worn plot in which Burt loses his cherished spotlight shuns his best friend abuses his most beleaguered admirer and then wises up with the help of childhood icon Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) now banished to a retirement home. Even as something of an expert phony Arkin deflates the big-hair bigger-ego caricatures from a distance and makes the films stabs at sincerity somewhat bearable. Whenever ""Bruce Almighty"" cohorts Carell and Carrey do reunite there are some goofy laughs to be had but Buscemi and Wilde are in turn mostly left to exchange exasperated looks on the sidelines (a shame given Wildes impressively comical performance in last years ""Butter"" and her amusing anxiety early on here). Like the back half of its namesake ""Wonderstone"" isnt terribly hip edgy or new itself just amusing enough to pass the time. While Scardino and friends do manage to end the film on an admirably nutty note this gathering of comedic minds ultimately fails to produce any true movie magic.
