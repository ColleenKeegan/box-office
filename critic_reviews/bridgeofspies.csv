Entertainment Why ""Bridge Of Spies"" Is Going To Be Your Dads Favorite Movie Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have made a deliberately unsexy spy drama. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Scott Shepherd and Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies. Jaap Buitendijk / Touchstone Pictures ID 7124747 The only thing that could make Bridge of Spies the new Steven Spielberg movie more agreeably dad-like is if it were set during World War II which according to stereotype is the conflict of choice for thick historical tomes left to gather dust on paternal nightstands. Instead the film takes place during the Cold War which is almost as good -- morally murkier to be sure but everyone still wears hats and looks very serious -- and manages to be half legal drama half espionage thriller and all based on a true story (of course).Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks Americas most sturdily benign celebrity as James B. Donovan an insurance lawyer whos recruited first to defend a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance slyly terrific) in court and then to arrange a trade of him for Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) a square-jawed American surveillance plane pilot shot down over Russian airspace. The whole thing is handsomely made -- its shot by Janusz Kaminski Spielbergs cinematographer of choice for the last two-plus decades -- and old-fashioned in feel all about men in suits involved in making the world run. View this image > Mark Rylance and Hanks in Bridge of Spies. Jaap Buitendijk / Touchstone Pictures ID 7124760 This description sounds full of euphemisms for boring and yet Bridge of Spies is not. Its unfussy staidness with the exception of a spectacular plane ejection sequence is part of its power. Its told through the experiences of a family man who lives in Brooklyn works in insurance and spends half the movie powering through a cold all of which make it a fantastically unsexy spy drama but a deftly powerful movie about how we think about heroism. The only thing James shares with Bond is a first name and he deals with bureaucracy not shootouts. Two of the movies characters have agreed to die for their countries if necessary but its protagonist insists no one should be treated as expendable even the man feeding secrets to the opposition.The two parts of Bridge of Spies dont line up seamlessly but theyre both about forms of righteousness. In the first half James is essentially forced to take on the job that no one wants -- defending Rudolph whose capture takes place in a suspenseful near-wordless opening sequence in which the seemingly innocuous older man is revealed to be picking up coded messages while painting by the water. No one expects or really wants James to do more than the bare minimum but he does and for his diligence hes sneered at and harassed his house getting shot up while his wife (Amy Ryan) and children are inside terrified.Its James who saves Rudolph from the death penalty by urging the judge on the case to consider his value for possible exchange and as if in response an opportunity comes around when Francis is captured by the Soviets rather than as he was told going down with his plane. And its James who gets sent over to tense chilly Berlin freshly split in half by the Berlin Wall to negotiate an unofficial trade of personnel navigating three governments with their own agendas and attempting to figure out what everyone really means beneath the bluster and bluffing. The script which was written by the Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman shines in this section with bits of Coenesque quirk coming through in moments in which an East German official presides over a desk full of phones. View this image > Hanks and Amy Ryan in Bridge of Spies Jaap Buitendijk / Touchstone Pictures ID 7124767 So throughout does Hanks whos never glamorous or slick in this role but who holds firm. Theres a story Rudolph tells about someone from his childhood who earned the moniker ""the standing man."" When he applies it to Hanks character it should be cheesy and maybe it is but its also terribly moving. Like Spielbergs similarly dad-like Lincoln Bridge of Spies is a heart-on-its-sleeve affirmation of American values -- not in the loaded contemporary sense of the term but in the way the country was founded on values we have to work and fight to abide by. Its about a character who insists on treating an enemy combatant with the dignity and due process we said everyone was owed. And in that message its not old-fashioned at all.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Nancy Churnin Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Bridge of Spies is a tonic in polarized times.Its based on the true story of James Donovan a Brooklyn lawyer who took on the case of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957. Director Steven Spielberg has crafted a complex film that makes you question the drive to demonize adversaries and even more to break constitutional rules to pursue punishment.Played with self-deprecating charm by two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks Donovan is a regular guy with a loving family who happens to be a good insurance lawyer. With the down-home decency of a Frank Capra-esque hero he succeeds more than he fails because he treats people as human beings and appeals to others to do the same. Tom Hanks Alan Alda and Amy Ryan star in ""Bridge of Spies."" Dreamworks When he takes on the thankless task of defending Abel everyone from his family to co-workers to strangers staring at him balefully on the subway wants him to lose and let the guy die in an electric chair. Instead he develops a rapport with Abel played with masterful understatement by Mark Rylance a three-time Tony Award winner and TVs Wolf Hall star.Abel studying Donovan carefully with searching eyes tells the story of the ""sticking man"" he met in his youth -- a man whose response to getting beaten was to get up until his tormentors gave up hitting him. Donovans deliberation on whether to become a ""sticking man"" and a bridge between the troubled waters that roil between hostile countries is the question that powers the film.When an American is captured the CIA asks Donovan to negotiate a prisoner swap for Abel in East Berlin. The catch is that Donovan must go as a private citizen keep his mission secret and figure out how to do something hes never done. Complications multiply on arrival when he learns of an American student also being held as a bargaining chip. Tom Hanks stars in ""Bridge of Spies."" Dreamworks The script by Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen compresses events and alters details for greater dramatization but stays true to the heart of this remarkable tale. Masterful cuts from Abel to American pilot Francis Gary Powers (the appealing boyish Austin Stowell) shot down over Soviet territory underscore the similarities between two men trying to serve their countries.Authentic re-creations of the period including duck-and-cover clips about a nuclear holocaust that frightened young students serve as a reminder of a time not unlike our own when the threat of terror kept a steady and disturbing beat.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Oct 23 2015 Culture Tom Hanks is Steven Spielbergs great stoic hero. In Saving Private Ryan hes the schoolteacher soldier trying to maintain a semblance of sense in the chaos of World War II; in Catch Me If You Can hes the befuddled Fed blustering through every airy caper to drag the conman hero back down to earth. And in Bridge of Spies Hanks plays James B. Donovan a lawyer who defended the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel after his arrest in 1957 performing the vital duty of representing American fairness and giving Abel his day in court. More importantly to Spielberg Donovan actually put in effort as Abels lawyer rather than serve as a simple prop a distinction that recurs in the film time and time again.Related Story Historians Need to Give Steven Spielberg a Break Scripted by the playwright Matt Charman (and later revised by the Coen Brothers) Bridge of Spies follows Donovan as he defends Abel (Mark Rylance) up to the Supreme Court and later negotiates a prisoner swap in East Berlin after an American Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers  (Austin Stowell) is shot down behind Soviet lines. The writing is as stoic as Donovan who Hanks plays as a regular neighborhood guy just trying to ensure everyone gets a fair shake--but behind the facade is real shrewdness. Donovans work as a negotiator was fascinating but Spielberg and Charman frame him as a thin bulwark against the American governments attempts to work around its own supposed ideals at the height of the Cold War.In another directors hands Bridge of Spies might have a more paranoiac edge but this is Spielberg though certainly in minor key with a jarring Thomas Newman score taking the place of the expected swelling strings of John Williams (its the first Spielberg film Williams hasnt scored since The Color Purple). Rylance plays Abel not as a figure of menace (he was in fact a fairly low-level operative) but of reserved calm; every time Donovan asks him if hes worried about the possibility of being executed Abel flatly asks ""Would that help?"" As he defends his client and cites his constitutional privileges Donovan is openly disdained by a judge and prosecutor intent on rapidly convicting Abel; Spielberg draws a sly parallel with the much grander but effectively similar Soviet show trial given to the captured pilot Powers.The film is at its slowest when its dealing with the backlash Donovan suffered at work and at home--Alan Alda and Amy Ryan fill out thankless roles as his boss and his wife tutting over his dogged pursuit of justice. Far better is Scott Shepherd as Hoffman the CIA agent tasked with ordering Donovan to East Berlin where he presented himself as a private citizen seeking to organize a prisoner swap with the Soviets. Donovan spoke for the U.S. where the country could not secretly acknowledging East Germany and the USSR as diplomatic partners at a crucial point in the Cold War and Spielberg has as much fun as he can with that strange irony. Hoffman could be a terrifying man in black keeping Donovan on a tight leash but Bridge of Spies is free of those dramatics and Shepherd instead plays him as another frustrated bureaucrat trying to accomplish a limited task (the retrieval of Powers) as quickly as possible.With each walk-on part Spielberg underlines the slow creep of tyranny in a system that supposedly eschews it. Hoffman needs Powers back so he ignores the plight of another imprisoned American a graduate student arrested in East Berlin. Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews) needs Abel in jail as quickly as possible so he waves off Donovans complaints of warrant-less searches. Powers gets in his U-2 spy plane because hes ordered to (his capture is the films one bravura action sequence) even as its made clear to him that the U.S. military will disavow his actions if hes caught. When Donovan sits down with his Soviet counterpart their aims are exactly the same--the only difference as he keeps trying to remind everyone is that America is supposed to abide by the rights it grants in its Constitution.Its on the hokey side for sure but Spielberg mostly reins in his tendency toward thuddingly obvious symbolism although he does go a bit overboard in the films final triumphant scenes. Hanks helps by playing Donovan with gentle charm and humor rather than as a crusading patriot; his subtlety is matched at every turn by Rylance whose supporting work would likely be noticed by Oscar voters if it wasnt so admirably low-key. Donovans victory is small but palpable; still we know the ideals he fights for havent always recurred in our countrys history as a foreign power. Bridge of Spies is a tale of American exceptionalism but a quietly cynical one--and those are always the wisest kind.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

The colors are gray and green the skin tones pale as frozen fish and the film stock fuzzed and snowy. Our protagonist James Donovan (Tom Hanks) spends half the movie waylaid by a cold and takes his important meetings huddled over Scotch as if for warmth. Its easy to feel how the United States and the Soviet Union thought this permafrost would last forever.The story starts in 1957 the year Donovan was drafted to defend Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts of thermonuclear espionage. Abel a sallow man with a tight frown and lilting eyebrows was never going to be acquitted. Before the trial even starts Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews) bellows ""This man has to have a capable defense but lets not kid each other."" With his clients guilt already decided Donovan earns his pay merely by yanking Abel from the electric chair. Most people in America the government included would have preferred that he hadnt.Film Details Bridge of Spies RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time135 min. More Info Trailer But Donovan a former insurance litigator thinks Abel is valuable collateral. In the second act of the film -- set five years later in 1962 as East Germany is erecting the Berlin Wall -- Donovan has a chance to prove it by attempting to trade Abel to the Russians in exchange for Yankee pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) captured on a mission to photograph Soviet territory from a high-flying U-2 surveillance plane.Spielberg elbows us with the hypocrisy Wed like our man back unharmed even though we screamed to lynch theirs. And both captives face the same peril. Even if theyve stayed loyal and kept their lips shut -- and even if they somehow make it back home -- their own people might assume theyd squealed.

In a hat tip to the look of The Third Man the shiny-wet street scenes are drained of pigment until they could pass for black-and-white. (Plus every man east of the Atlantic is a blond with a Peter Lorre purr.) Yet rather than examine the shifting loyalties of film noir Spielberg purposefully drains the plot of intrigue. Its clear that Abel is guilty from the first scene in which he slices open a hollow nickel to extract a code. Were never in doubt where anyone stands. With the uses and themes established Bridge of Spies is free to ask a more modern question Are the good guys that much better than the bad?Standing on the Glienicke Bridge of the title Donovan is alarmed to spot German snipers on the other end. His CIA handler shrugs Our side has them too. Draw a line bisecting the Eastern Bloc from the West and they could be mirror images two gun nests two prisoners two sides that stoke fear in their people by calling one another the enemy. And when Donovan slinks into East Berlins Soviet embassy to cut a deal pretending to be disavowed by his own government even as it pressures him for intel is his subterfuge more innocent than that of his incarcerated client who by any measure of field success was a KGB failure?Flop or not the American people believed that Abel might have brought them to the brink of apocalypse. (Spielberg includes a wry scene in which Donovans alarmist elementary-school son lectures him on duck-and-cover.)In 1960 three years after Donovans headline-making defense of Abel made him the most noble and the most loathed man in America Harper Lee published To Kill a Mockingbird. Could Donovans headlines have crossed her writing desk in Alabama as she revised the racist Atticus Finch of Go Set a Watchman into a lawyer who fights for justice even when the courts would rather skip a few steps? In turn Hanks steadfast Donovan seems inspired by the movie version of Atticus embodied by Gregory Peck. (Perhaps by coincidence or perhaps by the same all-American underdog spirit that links the two actors Peck himself tried to play Donovan in 1965.)Most espionage thrillers send in James Bonds to save the day. Bridge of Spies sidelines the glamorous heroes -- the spies and soldiers who spend the movie in cells -- to celebrate the valor of ordinary men. You can hear the Coen brothers who co-wrote the script with Matt Charman when Donovans Russian counterpart sighs ""We little men just do our jobs.""Appropriately even at nearly 21/2 hours Bridge of Spies feels like a little film. Its long and stretched thin ditching subplots such as Donovans daughters dalliance with his aide to spend more time sipping booze in immaculate period sets.What Spielberg seems to want most from this respectable lark is for audiences to notice the parallels between the 1950s and today. Their U-2s are our drones; our allies still torture enemies for intelligence; and the demagogues at home continue to scream that current events prove that our way of life is doomed. Spielberg is freezing his modern anxieties inside this tale of a patriot who kept his cool. ""Be sensible be kind"" he advises as Bridge of Spies connects Cold War paranoia to todays terror.

The rub? Its a Steven Spielberg movie. Co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen. Starring Tom Hanks. We expect greatness. Make that Greatness. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes And so while youll be interested in one mans courage under fire this effort may leave you wanting more Saving Private Ryan-esque gut-wrenching drama and less cerebral Lincoln-esque orations. (It premiered Oct. 4 at the 53rd New York Film Festival.) The true story is set at the height of the Cold War against the Russians in 1957. Highly regarded Brooklyn insurance lawyer James Donovan (Hanks) is tasked with defending British-born Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court. Theres a mountain of evidence against him and hes surely guilty but per the U.S. Constitution hes entitled to a fair trial. Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) become the target of anti-communist fears when Donovan agrees to defend a Soviet agent arrested in the U.S. Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks Pictures Despite resistance from his wife (Amy Ryan who has more to do in Goosebumps) and threats galore Jim honorably stands by the soft-spoken painter. Theres just something about the reserved way that Abel goes about his business and speaks of his family. When he asks his client why he never worries Abel simply replies ""Would it help?"" In James mind he isnt a criminal; he was just doing his job for his country. PHOTOS Summer 2015 movie hunks But even after James loses the appeal (not a spoiler) his patriotic duty is only beginning. Hes soon summoned by the CIA to go to Berlin and negotiate Abels freedom in exchange for captured American U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) in Russia. This is where Spielberg attempts to turn his stately legal drama into a period espionage thriller. He partially succeeds You can feel the brisk chill as Jim holes up in his downtrodden West Berlin hotel room as well as the uncertainty in the air as he walks along the dividing Wall and then gets bombarded by a gang of youthful thieves. The film takes a more sobering (read eye lid heavy) turn as James takes on shifty government officials and lawyers in Germany. He doesnt have a particularly flashy gift of gab; hes just a decent guy doing the noble thing. That determination makes these talk-heavy proceedings thought provoking -- yet not necessarily edge-of-your-seat stirring. (One stray thought that crosses the mind during a negotiation Aaron Sorkin would have cracked this script wide open with a single punch-up.) PHOTOS TV to movie stars -- then and now Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) meets with his client Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) a Soviet agent arrested in the U.S. Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks Pictures In fact its telling the only character that shows passion here is the woman posing as Abels anguished wife in Germany. Theres already Oscar buzz surrounding Rylance yet the role is too understated to make much of an impact. Hes a sympathetic man only because hes seen through James caring and nonjudgmental eyes. American hero Powers also could have benefited from more fleshing out. In one haunting scene hes tortured for information in prison -- and yet isnt seen again until the movies last act. (Another stray thought that crosses the mind during a negotiation This retelling would have been even more fascinating from Powers point of view.) Meanwhile a male Yale student held prisoner in Germany -- who later becomes a crucial element of James wheelings and dealings -- registers in just a few overwrought scenes. The straightforward morality tale is especially frustrating considering the tantalizing early sequence. As Abel eludes feds on a New York City subway and then stealthily grabs a piece of hidden information stashed underneath a park bench the intrigue has all the makings of a white-knuckled chiller. Its almost anticlimactic when Hanks arrives into the picture Almost. Hanks does the Hanks thing so well that its almost criminal in itself. Still Spielberg isnt a master for nothing. And when all the parties finally meet up at the shadowy titular bridge for the big trade we get to witness humanity -- and classic filmmaking -- at its finest.

By Anthony Lane Tom Hanks is a lawyer who defends a Soviet agent in Steven Spielbergs film written by Matt Charman and the Coen Bros.   Credit Illustration by Olivier Balez The new Steven Spielberg film ""Bridge of Spies"" begins with a man in a mirror. The man is Colonel Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and we see three versions of him in one frame Abel himself holding a brush; his reflected image; and a self-portrait that he is carefully painting in oils. The whole thing is not just a dazzling composition with which to kick off a movie but a formal introduction to the world of espionage--a haven for multiple identities. The year is 1957 the winter solstice of the Cold War and Abel is a Soviet spy. He lives in Brooklyn and art is both his hobby and his cover story; he sets up an easel beside the Manhattan Bridge and after a while feels the underside of the bench on which he sits. There stuck fast is a nickel which he takes home and slits open like a chocolate penny along the rim. Inside is a folded slip of paper covered with code. We are only minutes into the movie but anyone with a soft spot for tradecraft will already be melting with fascination. Abel however has been rumbled. The F.B.I. having observed him as fixedly as we have bursts in and arrests him. The guy needs legal representation but who will be man enough or dumb enough to defend a Red Menace at a time like this? Enter James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks). He is an insurance lawyer but he was on the prosecuting team at the Nuremberg trials and his peers in the Brooklyn Bar Association have picked him for this thankless task. In the course of it he will be hectored repudiated and gazed at with loathing on the subway; the house where he and his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) live with their children will be shot at; and he will spend a night in a foreign jail. Nonetheless by asserting the right of the accused to a fair trial he will uphold the Constitution--or as he calls it ""the rule book."" In short the role of Donovan verges on the saintly and it is Hanks alone who stops it from tipping over. He unstiffens his lines so that a statement like ""The next mistake our countries make could be the last one"" which lesser performers would intone with thin lips and a set jaw is made to sound as if it just occurred to him with a rising tone on ""last."" Hanks often musing and always half-amused hails from the grand rank of actors like Henry Fonda Jimmy Stewart and Joel McCrea who have mastered the ungrand. They make us believe that oratory done right belongs at the dinner table or behind the counter of a store. Donovan is not surprised when his client is found guilty but rather than quit the field he battles on first by convincing the judge (Dakin Matthews) that imprisonment is more fitting than the death penalty and second by taking the case to the Supreme Court. Donovans argument is that Abel is not a traitor but a loyal servant of his country even if that country is a sworn foe of the United States and that America has a chance to show its moral colors by treating him as equitably as it would one of its own citizens. (Public opinion the film implies is against that basic privilege. Even some other lawyers reckon that its time to let the matter drop.) But Donovan makes a further point. Imagine he says if an American were to be captured by the Soviet Union. Might Abel not prove handy as a bargaining chip? And lo it comes to pass. A U-2 spy plane is shot down in Soviet airspace and the pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) bails out. He is tried convicted and interrogated. Each nation now has a man with a head full of sensitive information being held by the other side and Allen Dulles (Peter McRobbie) the director of the C.I.A. asks Donovan to go to Berlin and arrange a swap. Game on. All this is recorded history one of the best recorders being Donovan whose 1964 book ""Strangers on a Bridge"" guides us through the saga with a dry and courtly wisdom. (""When a judge compliments you it usually means you have lost."") Its instructive to see how his account has been crunched and compacted into the screenplay for ""Bridge of Spies"" which is by Joel and Ethan Coen in consort with Matt Charman. This is the first occasion on which the Coen Bros. have worked with Spielberg and its a happy merger. You feel a certain tautening of wit plus a keen and very Coen-like awareness that cliches which abound in the genre of the spy drama are there to be flirted with. Hence a fine scene of Donovan complete with umbrella and hat being trailed through the rainy darkness by a similar figure and crouching down to hide beside a car--a maneuver that gets him precisely nowhere. Then in Berlin there is a gang of East German youths whom Donovan encounters in the snow. On the page he marches through them but the screenplay adds a mean little twist by having them issue a threatening demand for his overcoat. He removes it and spends the rest of the movie with a foul cold. My only regret is that ""Bridge of Spies"" could not find room for Abels cellmate Vincent J. Squillante the king of the garbage racket in New York. The spy taught French apparently to the Mafia hood. How do you persuade the Coens connoisseurs of human mismatching to leave that out? There is a curious sense of well-being in settling down to ""Bridge of Spies."" To place yourself in the hands of Spielberg and Hanks is to be assured of a tale solidly told however bitter the anxieties of the historical setting. Is it possible however that the solid might congeal into the stolid and the dull? Well the title is a drag though I guess that ""Bridge of the Extremely Capable Insurance Lawyer"" would have been too much of a mouthful. And while Spielberg has shifted in his choice of composer from John Williams to Thomas Newman the shift is not far enough. He should have taken his cue from Otto Preminger who leavened ""Anatomy of a Murder"" his courtroom masterwork of 1959 with the music of Duke Ellington. We even saw the Duke onscreen playing piano with Jimmy Stewart. The lilt and the kick of the soundtrack didnt compromise that movie. They gave it cool. ""Bridge of Spies"" aint got that swing so whats it all about? Its not about the U-2 missions and certainly not about Powers who comes across as a lunk. Nor despite the set pieces in court is it about the majesty of the law. No the core of this movie is a standoff every bit as keyed up and as gripping as anything on the muffled streets of Berlin. What we thrill to is Rylance versus Hanks the British actor lauded for his stage appearances but barely known to cinema audiences up against the consummate Hollywood pro. You can see them prowling probing and wondering what the next move will be--or in Hankss case wondering whether Rylance will move at all. Admirers of ""Wolf Hall"" on PBS will have noted him as Thomas Cromwell standing like a statue in the shadows and realized to their discomfort that they could not look away. He does the same thing here as Abel; we watch him watching everybody else as if life were an infinity of spies. ""You dont seem alarmed"" Donovan says when they first meet and Abel replies with a gentle question ""Would it help?"" The Coens turn that into a refrain that beats through the movie growing wryer and funnier each time--right up to the fidgety finale where Abel is the calmest man in sight. You might suggest that ""Bridge of Spies"" plays everything a touch safe and that its encomium to American decency need not be quite so persistent. But when a film is as enjoyable as this one its timing so sweet and its atmosphere conjured with such skill do you really wish to register a complaint? Would it help? Call a movie ""Truth"" and youre asking for trouble. That is the risk run by James Vanderbilt who has written and directed a film of that title about the crisis that hit CBSs ""60 Minutes"" in 2004. The nub is an investigation presented by Dan Rather (Robert Redford) into the circumstances surrounding George W. Bushs service in the Texas Air National Guard. By the end of the ensuing farrago as the producer of the show Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) points out the central question--did Bush get an easy ride insuring that he would never be sent to Vietnam?--has been all but obscured in a blizzard of extraneous details. Mapes is snowed under and together with Rather and other CBS employees she endures the consequences. ""Youre being terminated"" her boss says. Hasta la vista Mary. The weirdness of ""Truth""--and I fear its involuntary comic value--arises from a disparity between the sparse and finicky minutiae of the narrative and the somewhat bouffant style of the presentation. As the program airs those who have toiled on it are seen smiling in proud slow motion while ordinary folk all across the nation in bars and in living rooms stare up at their TV screens as if witnessing the descent of the Messiah. Later when the report unravels along with Mapess sang-froid the film offers up as tear-streaked tragedy what is in fact a cautionary tale about photocopying the moral being that you should check your information at the source. Vanderbilt has marshalled his material with scrupulous care as he did when he wrote the script for David Finchers ""Zodiac"" so how come that movie was twenty times more riveting? Partly because of Finchers scary visual command and because deaths rather than deadlines were at stake but also I suspect because the new film clings to the nagging thought that if the National Guard story had held firm the Presidential election--and thus recent history--might have followed a different path. Who can tell? The path of wishful thinking though leads awfully close to mush.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 15 2015 417PM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 15 2015 420PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Steven Spielberg Written by Matt Charman Ethan Coen and Joel Coen Starring Tom Hanks Mark Rylance and Amy Ryan Genre thriller Country USA Language English At the close of Steven Spielbergs Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies New York insurance lawyer James Donovan looks out the window of the train on his way to work and sees a couple of teenage lads hopping over a backyard fence. Yes we get it Hes safely home in the land of the free not back in East Berlin where he has recently witnessed fence-hoppers getting shot. Spielberg has never been a subtle director but the Cold War was not a subtle time - at least not in terms of its competing ideologies. Yet this satisfying thriller based on the actual story of Donovans spy-swap negotiations rises above the occasional bit of patriotic bombast or predictable plotting thanks especially to the performances of actors Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance playing both sides of the conflict as admirable in their way. The ever-reliable Hanks sympathetically personifies all in America that is worth fighting for while his British colleagues surprisingly comic version of Rudolf Abel portrays the Russian spy as a man quietly steadfast in his loyalty to a different cause.The action begins with Abels arrest in a Brooklyn hotel room. The man is a mysterious little Sunday painter who seems to have spent time in Britain and certainly displays remarkable British phlegm in the face of espionage charges after a cache of listening devices and cameras is discovered in his nearby studio. Hes guilty but he needs a fair trial so Donovan who had worked for the prosecution at Nuremberg is approached to take on a wildly unpopular client. Despite the baying crowds that soon surround his pleasant house and pretty family Donovan agrees to give the Communist spy the best defence he can - and explains exactly why in a nice little speech about American values that he makes to a CIA agent as he refuses to break client-solicitor confidentiality and report what Abel has told him.So we find ourselves in the midst of the familiar story of a good man who is doing the right thing despite the public condemnation of his blinkered neighbours. Here Hankss fundamental likeability his warm representation of decency rather than self-righteousness is critical to making this idealism stirring rather than cloying.Meanwhile a less interesting subplot revolves around the recruitment and training of American pilots to fly spy planes high over Soviet territory. When Donovan saves Abel from the electric chair by reminding a judge that the Americans may some day want a Russian prisoner to swap the pieces all fall neatly into place Donovans next assignment is to try to arrange the exchange of the imprisoned Abel for U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers shot down and captured over Soviet territory on what appears to be his very first spy mission.Of course real life was not quite this neat - there were five years between Abels arrest in 1957 and the eventual exchange on Berlins Glienicke Bridge in 1962 - but Spielberg successfully turns the segue from the spys trial to his release into a fast-paced thriller animated by the dutiful Donovan as an unlikely Cold War operative. Shuttling between West and East Berlin he finds himself embroiled in negotiations involving the same cynical CIA agent a wily Russian diplomat and a slippery East German lawyer outraged over Soviet meddling. His assignment is greatly complicated by his own stubborn insistence that he will rescue not only the downed pilot but also an American economics student who got caught with a camera on the wrong side of the wall.The scenes in Berlin of the days surrounding the walls construction of the eastern sectors subsequent decay and violence of the tense relations between the East Germans and their Soviet masters are darkly intriguing yet the film is also deftly enlivened by flashes of humour throughout. (The script is written by those masters of black comedy Joel and Ethan Coen along with Matt Charman.) In that regard Rylances performance is particularly interesting as he infuses Abels dry understatements on his predicament with just the right dose of quiet irony. Wisely Spielberg has cast no villains in Bridge of Spies Here the ultimate triumph of the West is that the East is shown to be human.

Donovan who becomes involved in a prisoner exchange during the Cold War. Mark Rylance and Amy Ryan co-star. By Peter Rainer Film critic October 16 2015 Save for later Saved James Donovan (Tom Hanks r.) stares down client Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in Bridge of Spies. Jaap Buitendijk/Dreamworks II Distribution Co./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"" starring Tom Hanks is a solid conventionally made drama about the cold-war era which compared to now seems almost halcyon. Thats a gross underestimation of how bad things were back then of course but the film intentionally or not makes one almost moony for a time when the enemy even cloaked in subterfuge was in plain sight.Tom Hanks in his best man-of-the-people mode plays real-life James B. Donovan a top insurance agent who in 1957 is called upon by his high-powered firm to represent a British-born Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) caught in New York. Although he was a lawyer at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials Donovan for reasons the movie never delves into had switched his specialty to insurance years ago and is initially reluctant to take on the case. He sees it as a lose-lose proposition.From his agencys point of view all Donovan has to do is provide reputable counsel as a show of American uprightness before the inevitable boom is lowered. But Donovan to the consternation of his legal partners and practically everyone around him including his cozy family pursues a far more aggressive legal strategy that repeatedly invokes the US Constitution. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Spielberg and his writers Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen make it all too clear that Donovan is not some commie sympathizer. (Donovan offers a quick aside to his family about the rightness of the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg conviction.) What he stands for is a larger principle He wants to show the Soviets that in America the right to a fair and honest trial prevails. ""Lets show them who we are"" is his refrain. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide There is no question that Abel is guilty which makes Donovans strenuous defense of his rights confounding to stateside cold warriors. He becomes something of a pariah but in his unwavering commitment to principle Donovan is as steadfast as Gary Coopers sheriff in ""High Noon."" Hes very cagey though. He may be a staunch idealist but he knows how the world works and is always a few steps ahead of his adversaries and naysayers. Like the good insurance man that he is he manages to save Abels life by arguing that his client is worth more incarcerated - where he could potentially be swapped for a captured American spy someday - than if he were executed.And sure enough in 1962 the opportunity arises for a swap involving U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers who had been shot down and captured by the Soviets two years earlier. Donovan is called upon to arrange the swap in the about-to-be-divided Berlin where East Germans are frantically attempting to cross the border before the wall is built. One of those who doesnt make it Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) an American student attempting to get his East German girlfriend across the divide is captured. Donovan naturally makes it a condition that both Powers and Pryor be part of the exchange for Abel once again ruffling an entire aviary of feathers. The best and most heartfelt aspect of the movie is the friendship that develops between Donovan and Abel an amateur painter who is almost preternaturally soft-spoken and even-tempered. Whenever a perplexed Donovan wonders aloud why Abel isnt more upset over his prospects he answers resignedly ""Would it help?"" Both Hanks and Rylance a marvelous British stage actor are masters at underplaying which is just the right tone for their communions here. The decency of their interactions underscores the films central theme Enemies are people too and some of them like Abel were just doing their job in the same way that American spies were doing theirs.Spielberg has often been drawn to steadfast souls like Donovan - most conspicuously Abraham Lincoln and Oskar Schindler. Schindler saved thousands; Donovan only had to save two (or three if you count Abel). ""Bridge of Spies"" is solid and uplifting but it doesnt extend Spielbergs range. Perhaps one day he will make a movie about a historical character whose complexities are not quite so untainted. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for some violence and brief strong language.)

Bridge of Spies may be a snooze to the ADD crowd allergic to historical drama but its dished out by experts. Thats director Steven Spielberg and star Tom Hanks working from a Matt Charman script polished by the Coen brothers no less. Their topic is the pivotal moment in the Cold War when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and the U.S. had to negotiate the release of its captured pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). The way to do it according to lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks) is to exchange Powers for Col. Rudolf Abel (the exceptional Mark Rylance) a British-born Russian spy working undercover in Brooklyn until the FBI jailed him on conspiracy charges in 1957. His capture excitingly staged by Spielberg starts the movie on a high.

Take the insistent score by Thomas Newman filling in for Spielberg regular John Williams. Even the trailer seems to bellow ""In the shadow of war/One Man showed the world/What we stand for."" Since that One Man is played by Hanks an actor with an estimable gift for understatement (see Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan) the trumpets are unnecessary. Donovan is an insurance lawyer with a wife (Amy Ryan) and kids at home. When his boss (Alan Alda) volunteers him to represent Abel Donovan is suddenly reviled as the guy whos trying to free a traitor. Hanks expresses Donovans quiet heroism with admirable restraint. Its the script that pushes it with Abel calling him ""the standing man"" who gets back up to do right when hes knocked down. Bridge of Spies works best in the gray areas when Donovan sees Abel and Powers as patriots doing the bidding of their countries. It resonates when Spielberg gives us action that defines character as in Donovans trip to Berlin where conspiracies damn near kill him. During the climactic prisoner exchange on the Glienicke Bridge there are moments when we cant tell good from bad and standard spy stuff becomes a potent provocation.

Jaap Buitendijk/Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jaap Buitendijk/Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a reluctant but principled insurance lawyer drafted to do a hugely unpopular job defend a Soviet spy at the height of the Cold War. Jaap Buitendijk/Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures Russian airstrikes in Syria have some observers wondering if the Cold War might be heating up again. So Bridge of Spies Steven Spielbergs fact-based drama about Cold War brinkmanship could hardly be better timed to resonate outside its historical frame. Were introduced to the protagonists in 1957 when Cold War tensions are well tense. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have recently been executed for giving up atomic secrets. American schoolkids pledge allegiance to the flag and then practice how to ""duck and cover"" in case the Soviets drop the A-bomb while theyre at school. Thats the frame as we watch painter Rudolf Abel using a razor blade in his Brooklyn apartment to extract an encrypted slip of paper from inside a hollow nickel. He will shortly be apprehended by the FBI caught ""red"" handed as it were. As the public clamors for his execution the bar association joins with the government to ensure at least the appearance of due process. Abel doesnt have an attorney so one is appointed for him -- James B. Donovan a reluctant but principled insurance lawyer who hasnt done criminal work in a while though as his firms partners point out he worked with the prosecution at Nuremburg. ""Its important to our country"" hes told ""that this man is seen as getting a fair shake. American justice will be on trial."" Emphasis on ""is seen as."" Donovan -- who is played by Tom Hanks because Jimmy Stewart is no longer with us -- discovers the American system of justice has blind spots where foreigners are concerned. He notes plenty of prosecution errors but he cant keep the court from convicting. What he can do is plead for his clients life. Donovan asks the judge to imagine an American being captured by the Soviets. If we execute their guy he says we lose a bargaining chip. Five years later a U.S. reconnaissance pilot named Francis Gary Powers is shot down over Soviet territory. And Donovan gets to play that bargaining chip in East Berlin where the Soviets are at that very moment building a wall and are in no mood to bargain. Screenwriter Matt Charman is the guy who unearthed this true story and director Steven Spielberg aided by script polishers Joel and Ethan Coen makes sure you hear the echoes of our own era in it. These days we use drones for reconnaissance our justice system still struggles to deal fairly with foreigners we regard as enemies and shortcuts are sometimes proposed -- and resisted -- just as they were then. Hanks is given a doozy of a speech in which he parries a CIA agents insistence that the Cold War stakes are so high there are no rules by saying that the rule book is called ""the Constitution and we agree to the rules and its what makes us Americans."" I wish I could report that all of this is riveting in the telling but apart from Hanks and an understated scene-stealing turn by Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel Bridge of Spies mostly settles for being solidly told and atmospheric. That said there is a seven-minute sequence Spielberg brings to life so vividly itll catch you up short the abrupt unexpected world -- and era -- changing construction of the Berlin Wall. Soldiers laying cinder blocks in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable street. Puzzled German citizens family members on either side still able to just walk across what is about to become for decades an impassable diplomatic line in the sand. Nobodys shooting. Nobodys even shouting. But the tension and confusion are epic. Watching the scene play out staged with an earthy grandeur that seems to come naturally to Spielberg I marveled that in many many years of moviegoing Id never seen that moment caught on film before. Much of the rest of Bridge of Spies I kind of had.

"Bridge of Spies reviewed Tom Hanks and Steven Spielbergs Cold War movie has a message about Guantanamo Bay. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies Is a Cold War Movie With a Message About Guantanamo Bay Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies Is a Cold War Movie With a Message About Guantanamo Bay Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 16 2015 1044 AM Bridge of Spies Is a Cold War Movie With a Message About Guantanamo Bay Steven Spielbergs thriller may seem old-fashioned but it could hardly be more relevant By Dana Stevens Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies. Image courtesy of Dreamworks Bridge of Spies a Cold War espionage thriller directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks sometimes comes off as a throwback to another era both political and cinematic a time when the ideological fault lines between world powers could be confidently drawn in the sand or a Frank Capra hero could win a whole nation to his side through sheer dint of his basic American decency. But pay close attention to the smartly pinging dialogue (by Joel and Ethan Coen rewriting an earlier script by Matt Charman) Bridge of Spies is hardly a comfy old wing chair of a movie designed for contemporary audiences to settle into with a sigh and forget our own geopolitical troubles. This is a film that though its story (inspired by true events) begins in 1957 and spans a period of about five years uses that era to hold a mirror to our own. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Before you start listening carefully to Bridge of Spies dialogue though listen to its silence. In a brief but masterly opening sequence with no music and no more than the odd word of dialogue Spielberg sketches out the whole lonely existence of Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) a gentle-faced amateur painter living in Brooklyn who--as we learn by the end of this self-contained mini-movie--is in fact a British-born spy for the Soviets with an apartment full of state-of the-art surveillance gear. After a slow-moving yet suspenseful chase through the streets of a marvelously recreated mid-20th-century New York Abel is apprehended by the American authorities and taken into custody. Advertisement But even a Soviet spy is entitled to a fair trial in this great land of ours--or so says the attorney Thomas Watters (Alan Alda) with an obvious lack of conviction as he fobs the unpleasant case off on his junior partner James Donovan (Hanks). Donovan is an insurance lawyer and a good one--we see him negotiating relentlessly on a clients behalf in one early scene--but he hasnt defended a criminal case in years much less one this high-profile and politically incendiary. When it becomes clear that Donovan believes in that Frank Capra stuff for real--he genuinely does think Abel is entitled to the best defense he can give him and that even enemies of the state deserve basic constitutional protections--Donovan is shunned by his workmates his wife (Amy Ryan) and most disturbingly even the judge whos about to hear the case. Just go through the motions and get the bastard in the electric chair already everyone urges--but Donovan insists hell take Abels case clear to the Supreme Court if necessary. It doesnt hurt that the lawyer has come to like his quiet dryly funny client who talks very little about himself (or much else) but who gets across his deep respect for and gratitude toward Donovan his sole advocate on hostile foreign soil. Spielberg can play hard on the emotions but he shows a surprisingly light touch with ideas. Donovans strongest argument for sparing the spy from execution is that should an American ever be captured in Soviet territory Abel would be a valuable prisoner to exchange. A few years later--though the movies pacing makes it seem like only months--that opportunity arises twice over. In 1960 Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) an American pilot in a U2 spy plane is shot down over the Soviet Union hauled before a kangaroo court and thrown into a grim Soviet jail with no Russian Tom Hanks to stand up for him. The next year an American student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) whos courting an East German girl finds himself on the wrong side of the newly built Berlin Wall literally as the last bricks are being mortared into place. (The scene in which the young sweethearts on bikes almost make it past the wall is the films weakest and the moment Spielberg comes closest being the schlock merchant his detractors too often paint him as). Because of his prior relationship with Abel Donovan is flown to Berlin to help negotiate the prisoner exchange. A touchy East German official (The Lives of Others Sebastian Koch) insists that the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are two entirely separate political entities and will not consider striking a deal together. But Donovan stands firm He isnt leaving until hes secured the release of both young men in exchange for his single high-value prisoner even over the objections of the CIA itself. Bridge of Spies only contains a scene or two in which a character is directly faced with the threat of death (though when those scenes come like that U2 crash over Russian territory theyre heart-stopping). This is a movie driven by moral and political standoffs not physical ones and the fact that not every plot development is signaled by a fresh act of violence comes as a welcome relief from the casually high body count of your average espionage thriller. But a sense of menace hangs over every scene that not even Donovans most skillful bargaining can begin to dispel the threat of global thermonuclear war. With a few decades distance its possible to see the absurd waste of those Cold War years during which the worlds two great superpowers entered an insane competition to develop ever more powerful technologies of mass death while expending enormous manpower on high-tech ways of confirming what we both already knew that the other side was doing pretty much the same thing. Donovans opinion on the constitutional rights of what are now known as ""enemy combatants"" remains an unpopular one nearly 60 years later--just ask the prisoners at Guantanamo. But as he did in Lincoln Spielberg lets any comparison with contemporary politics arise in the viewers mind on its own never signposting the parallels too clearly. Hes a director who can play hard on the emotions (though Bridge of Spies shows unaccustomed restraint in that department) but he shows a surprisingly light touch with ideas. Hanks is the ideal actor to play Donovan who falls into the global espionage gig almost despite himself. Only Hanks could exude that air of sturdy Capra-esque decency without appearing to pat himself on the back while also convincing us he might be quick-witted enough to pull off this ad hoc feat of Cold War diplomacy. Mark Rylance the great English actor director and playwright who for a decade was the artistic director of Shakespeares Globe theater performs some mysterious act of alchemy in his role as the ineffable and unflappable Soviet spy. Almost without speaking a word he communicates this characters rich inner life in which a near-Buddhist resignation to the whims of fate alternates with a feisty instinct for self-preservation. Through all this Spielberg continues his decades-long run of somehow knowing exactly where to place a movie camera. Whether hes crosscutting between two men with umbrellas as one trails another down a rain-slicked street or pulling back for a full view of the bridge referenced in the title (Berlins Glienicke Bridge which connected the Eastern and Western sectors of the city and became a common spot for prisoner swaps) Spielberg has an effortless-seeming knack for creating compositions that are not just lovely to look at but integral to the idea or emotion hes trying to express. Near the end when the camera pulls back for that somber high-angle shot of Glienicke Bridge in the snow its the directors way of shifting our focus from this particular story--a man on a bridge one winter day long ago trying to help three other men get home--to the decades of history that have come and gone since. The one-time ""bridge of spies"" may have become in our time just a convenient way to get across the now-open city of Berlin. But the kind of liminal space the bridge represents--a border where opposing ideological systems come into contact and the potential for violent conflict always looms--has only proliferated around the globe in our terror-haunted post-superpower era. Its a cold dark morally ambivalent world out there and not everyone has the good fortune to place their civil liberties in the trustworthy hands of Tom Hanks.

"Bridge of Spies | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bridge-of-spies ) Bridge of Spies (United States 2015) October 15 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli With names like Spielberg Hanks and the Coen Brothers its hard not to be excited about a project like Bridge of Spies. Yet although the workmanlike production is solidly engaging it falls short of the loftiest expectations. Its worth seeing but not one of the best films of 2015. In terms of the directors oeuvre this will likely be remembered as one of his ""minor"" productions. (Think Always The Terminal and War Horse.) Part of the problem may be the sprawling screenplay which starts out as a courtroom procedural before taking a sharp right turn into John Le Carre territory. The spy element is where the films strength lies but its not on par with some of the great Cold War thrillers that have come to the screen both before and after the Berlin Wall fell. Admittedly the screenwriters are constrained by the ""based on a true story"" aspect but in concert with Spielberg they somehow fail to capture the powerful sense of claustrophobia that characterizes almost every film set in Cold War Berlin. The period detail is impeccable but the atmosphere is surprisingly tepid. The story opens in Brooklyn N.Y. during the late 1950s with the arrest by American authorities of suspected Soviet agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Concerned that the man receives top-notch representation the government approaches attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) to defend Abel. Although initially reluctant Donovan warms to the idea after meeting his would-be client. Although unable to secure a ""Not Guilty"" verdict Donovans arguments spare Abel the death penalty. However his vociferous defense of such an anti-American criminal earns Donovan the ire of his fellow citizens. In a parallel storyline Bridge of Spies introduces CIA pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who commands a US spy plane on a mission high over Soviet territory. He is given strict instructions that if the aircraft is compromised and in danger of falling into enemy hands he is to hit the self-destruct. He is also given orders about the conditions under which he is to end his own life. He fails in both regards and is captured by the Soviets. The CIA concerned about the top secret information Powers might divulge asks Donovan to broker a prisoner exchange Powers for Abel. This requires the lawyer who is sick with a cold to travel to Berlin and meet with KGB and East German officials in circumstances that could best be described as precarious. Although the screenplay is co-credited to the Coen Brothers its a strangely straightforward story with little of the quirkiness one often associates from the Oscar-winning duo. Their off-kilter sense of humor comes across in some of Hanks lines (consider his response to a CIA agent when hes in a phone booth) but the finished project would seem to lean heavily toward the pen of Matt Charman. Spielbergs recreation of 1960s Berlin is exemplary but there are times when his approach is surprisingly heavy-handed. In particular instead of going for something subtle he opts to use a sledge-hammer approach in contrasting what appears outside train windows when traveling in Berlin and New York. The misstep is small but strident. The spy aspects of Bridge of Spies are handled effectively although Donovans situation isnt as dire as what we have become accustomed to in other Cold War thrillers set in Berlin. Theres tension but its not suffocating. Even when Donovan is incarcerated we dont believe his situation to be perilous. Thats because no matter how loudly the U.S. government denies that hes their agent hes playing a game with rules and the other side is as bound by them as he is. In the end Bridge of Spies is more about the mechanics of how the deal gets done than it is about watchers skulking in the shadows and people disappearing into the night. Tom Hanks has grown into this sort of role.  Its that of a grizzled warhorse who is fueled by equal parts cynicism and idealism. Hes a good man who recognizes that might not matter much. Amy Smart (as Donovans wife) and Sebastian Koch (as the East German lawyer who becomes involved in the negotiations) provide solid support. But the real standout is Mark Rylance whose turn as the meek composed Abel compels the viewers attention. His quiet performance steals scenes away from Hanks and everyone else. A more tightly focused screenplay might have resulted in a leaner more riveting motion picture. Perhaps by attempting to tell the entire story from Donovans first to last involvement results in an arc that is difficult to manage. Bridge of Spies is an engaging mid-Autumn recollection of an era that is increasingly viewed through the tinted glasses of nostalgia. However despite the pedigree of those involved it would be surprising to see this emerge as one of the seasons great successes.

Big ScreenMovie Reviews Spielberg Hanks America 1 0 In full gee-whiz mode By Matthew Lickona Oct. 15 2015 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Bridge of Spies  With Bridge of Spies director Steven Spielberg star Tom Hanks and writers Joel and Ethan Coen and Matt Charman are standing up doffing their caps placing their hands on their hearts and declaring their love for America. Not the Murica of the outraged masses who still cant believe we put a socialist Kenyan in the White House and then destroyed traditional marriage. Nor the American Empire of the drone-happy data collectors and bomb-droppers who may do seemingly anything in the name of national security. Rather the America of Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington high-minded but not snobbish earnest but not quite naive self-sacrificing when called upon but also eager to withdraw into the happy bosom of the home. The America that Fitzgerald referred to when he wrote that ""France was a land England was a people but America"" -- America was an idea. And a citizen who believed in that idea who marched onto the field of battle -- or in this case the arena of international intrigue -- armed chiefly with a blend of practicality and principle that would have made the founders proud could do great things. Maybe even prevent a nuclear war. Spielberg amp; Co. probably didnt have to reach back 60 years to find a story that would allow them to portray such a place. But theres nothing like the passage of time to help us condemn what we might accept in the present. Maybe were okay with NSA data collection but who wouldnt cheer for Tom Hanks as he chews out a CIA spook whos after legally protected information? Maybe were fine with labeling accused terrorists as enemy combatants so we dont have to grant them due process. But who isnt moved as Tom Hanks lectures the Supreme Court on the honor loyalty and yes patriotism of the accused (and mislabeled) Soviet spy he represents? And what member of an angry mob wouldnt slink away from Tom Hanks brow lumpily furrowed in distress standing on the porch of his just-shot-up home and silently declaring himself a righteous majority of one? Well maybe a few. But yahoos and schemers are just the price we pay for living in the Land of the Free. So yes the story. Its the late 50s the height of the Cold War. American kids are watching cartoons in school about how to survive a nuclear attack by the Russians. And the feds have just caught themselves a Russian spy. They need to have a trial just to show the world that America plays fair but they accidentally hire James Donovan (Hanks) who actually believes it. Meanwhile the Russians manage to snag an American spy pilot Gary Francis Powers. Tensions rise and Donovan is picked to conduct the unofficial negotiations -- in the shadow of the newly erected Berlin Wall -- for a prisoner exchange. (Its so hush-hush and fraught that he has to tell his wife hes going fishing in the U.K.) Spielberg is in full gee-whiz mode here as eager to tickle your ribs as he is to tense your gut or swell your heart. (His Russian spy repeatedly deadpans in the face of danger.) Hanks makes an old-fashioned virtue of his soft approach toward 60; every wrinkle and fold is put to work. And just in case you arent sure how to feel cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is there to up the saturation even as he turns down the brightness yielding a world of somber richness and gauzy light. (Or maybe not. Maybe they just added the nostalgia in post.) The result is sweet smooth corn pudding that just might be enough to make the aforementioned Mr. Smith stand up and cheer.

Steven Spielberg and Hanks re-team with winning results.Bridge of Spies still featuring Tom Hanks.(Photo Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out of 5Spielberg and Hanks are exceptionally solid which sounds like faint praise but shouldnt.The film is old-fashioned yet speaks to what is going on in the country and in our lives today.""Bridge of Spies"" re-teams Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks -- about as reliable a pair as exists in American cinema -- in a film that is so old-fashioned and comforting that for much of the time watching it feels like cuddling up under a soft good-movie blanket.That doesnt mean the Cold War drama doesnt resonate in the present -- or that it doesnt have a few rough spots.To say the film is an exercise in exceptional competence would sell short what it has to offer a true story about standing up for the right if unpopular thing. This has meaning today when we weigh the benefits of safety against the risk of individual (and civil) rights.Spielberg and Hanks have both done better work but its hardly fair to hold that against them. Theyre both great with a long list of terrific films and both are too often criticized for having a soft spot (Spielberg in particular). What are we supposed to say that ""Bridge of Spies"" is Spielbergs best work since ""Lincoln?"" Thats certainly true. Thats also the last film he made before this one. Sometimes you become a prisoner of your own talent.In ""Bridge of Spies"" we see Spielberg and Hanks in familiar territory. No its not groundbreaking. Yes it involves a happy family sitting around being happy after a bit of a struggle. Neither of these things should take away from your enjoyment of what is a very good if not great movie.Bridge of Spies still featuring Tom Hank as James Donovan. (Photo DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC)Hanks plays James Donovan an insurance lawyer in New York who since he was a prosecutor in Nuremberg draws the short straw and is asked to defend the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance outstanding). Theres no question about Abels guilt In a fantastic almost-wordless opening scene Spielberg follows him from his New York apartment where he paints to a pickup and then back home where the Feds close in on him.What the government wants to do is make a show of providing even our enemies with a fair trial. But they dont want Donovan to win. Donovan knows this and he knows how unpopular his work in the middle of a Red Scare will make him.But hes also resolute. He sees the quiet unassuming Abel as a man doing his job and doing it well.  That is Abel is a man willing to be executed rather than give up secrets. With the odds stacked against him the only question is whether Abel will be put to death after his conviction.Donovan plays a smart hand Why not keep Abel alive to be used as a bargaining chip if one of our spies is ever caught? Soon enough this proves to be a good idea U2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured after not following the prescribed routine of killing himself in such a situation. The U.S. government now turns to Donovan to travel to Berlin even as the wall between East and West is being constructed to secretly negotiate Powers release. (Nothing if not thorough Donovan decides against the wishes of everyone to also work for the release of an American student trapped on the wrong side of the wall.)AZCENTRALBridge of Spies (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsOnce Donovan arrives in Berlin ""Bridge of Spies"" becomes more of a traditional spy movie albeit one thats done really well. There are godless Communists creeping around making last-minute demands and clouding the issue as much out of habit as anything else. Yet Donovan holds steady.Of course he does. Tom Hanks is playing him in his best Jimmy Stewart mode. Hanks could do this kind of role in his sleep; luckily he doesnt. Like Spielberg we probably take him and his gifts for granted. Between the two of them they make ""Bridge of Spies"" a movie that works as a period piece and a timely commentary on how we live now. If that sounds like faint praise it shouldnt.

Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures Tom Hanks as lawyer James Donovan in Bridge of Spies. Courtesy of DreamWorks Pictures Your country may be wrong Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies sadly admits. But it maintains that a solid American family man can always be trusted. In the Cold War as at home father knows best. That father is Spielberg regular Tom Hanks or rather James Donovan who presents himself as a plain-talking uncomplicated insurance company lawyer. In the sequence that introduces him Donovan coolly parses a claim insisting that a single incident cannot be multiplied into several payouts. The roundabout conversation feels at the time like an indulgence if not for Hanks then for the director. But it will later well pay off. There are no extraneous elements in this carefully structured docudrama which juxtaposes East and West with parallel scenes and emulates vintage Hollywood fare as painstakingly as it reconstructs 1957 Brooklyn and 1962 Berlin. Its in Brooklyn that we meet the phlegmatic man who calls himself Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) an amateur painter with a British accent. That his identity is indistinct is shown by the way he working on a self-portrait ponders his face in a mirror. Abel is a Soviet spy according to the FBI agents who bust him in a deftly choreographed sequence. To give the appearance of a fair trial Donovan is enlisted to defend Abel -- but not to make a fuss about lack of warrants and such. Constitutional protections dont apply to Commies (a fact that provokes comparisons to current questions about the pursuit of presumed terrorists). ""Dont go Boy Scout on me"" Donovan is warned. He does not that it helps Abels case. But Donovan gets a chance to earn another merit badge when spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down over Soviet territory. Donovan whose barely mentioned credentials include lawyering at the Nuremberg Trials and for the OSS is dispatched secretly to Berlin to swap Abel for Powers. He tells his wife (Amy Ryan) and four kids hes going fishing in Scotland. Upon arriving Donovan encounters the newly erected Berlin Wall and learns that an American grad student (Will Rogers) is trapped behind it. Donovan insists on freeing the kid as well as Powers over the objections of his callous CIA handler. The U.S. government men are just as calculating as the Soviets and East Germans Donovan faces when he steps through the Iron Curtain. Theres some tension in the Berlin chapter especially during Donovans visit to the eastern sector. But theres also absurdist humor likely the contribution of Ethan and Joel Coen; theyve reworked Matt Charmans original script into something resembling a screenplay they might actually shoot themselves. The conniving Soviets and East Germans are ridiculous but also deadly as Donovan is reminded when he happens to witness a brutal incident at the wall. Yet rather than emphasize the grimness of it all Spielberg takes his usual sweet-and-sour approach. Abel who may be killed if he returns home is even given a droll tagline as if he were in a screwball comedy. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski employs a drained color palette that suggests both the gray 1950s and faded film stock. As is typical of the director the movies period details are keyed less to history than to the eras cinematic style. In sensibility if not content Bridge of Spies is as much a movie buffs homage as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Like a classic Hollywood regular-guy hero Donovan returns home quietly and wins his broods adoration without saying a word. But then the final parallel scene conjures horror from an utterly innocent moment and sour replaces sweet as the movies end note. The take-charge dad can run his job his life and his family but random evil is beyond his control.

(DreamWorks)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 17 2015There are many reasons to recommend Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies the Cold War brought to life in vivid disconcertingly timely ways; the quickstep hugger-mugger of G-men in fedoras tailing a foreign agent on the streets of New York; the noirish intrigue of early 1960s East Berlin with its military checkpoints its paranoia its secret police.But without doubt the biggest reason to see Bridge of Spies - based on true Eisenhower-era events - is Mark Rylance the British actor of TVs Wolf Hall and theaters Jerusalem as he disappears into the quietly duplicitous role of the man known as Rudolf Abel.Carrying a British passport and a KGB skill-set Abel was a sleeper spy in Brooklyn posing as an artist - toting his easel around making portraits in his studio - and sending information back to his handlers in the U.S.S.R. The ragged dignity and deep resolve Rylance displays reverberates everywhere - even when hes absent from the screen.Exposed and arrested in 1957 Abel was given a defense attorney - the government was keen to show that in the United States anyone everyone deserves a fair trial even a traitor. And so Abel in his cell is introduced to James Donovan an insurance lawyer now but formerly part of the prosecution team at Nuremberg. A family man brimming with integrity Donovan is played by Tom Hanks the lines on his forehead furrowed in noble concern.""Are you good at what you do?"" Abel asks.Donovan assures that he is although defending a spy will be a first.And so an unlikely friendship - an American patriot a Russian operative - is born.Using a screenplay polished and honed by the Coen Brothers Spielberg dips into John le CarrA(c) territory (you cant help but think of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold when Donovan looks onto the newly erected Berlin Wall in the searchlights in the snow). But that only extends so far.There is a lot of story to tell here Abels highly publicized trial; the threats Donovan encounters for defending him - threats that literally hit home when guns are fired into the Donovans living room. Theres even a plea before the Supreme Court. And then the whole Francis Gary Powers business a United States pilot who was captured and condemned as a spy. His U2 reconnaissance plane with its 4500mm camera lenses was clipped by Soviet missiles high in the sky.Donovan had argued against the death penalty for Abel advising that it would be prudent to keep the Russian alive in case the need ever arose for a swap.And here was Powers (Austin Stowell) a prisoner of the Soviets. Donovan is enlisted by none other than CIA director Allen Dulles (Peter McRobbie ) to go to Berlin and negotiate the exchange. Its strictly unofficial and Donovan finds himself moving in shadowy quarters with shifty company - unsure who if anyone has his back.Things grow more complicated when an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is nabbed by the East Germans and charged with espionage. (The real-life Pryor is an economics scholar at Swarthmore; the details of his arrest back in 1961 have been dressed up and dramatized.)The gripping finale of Bridge of Spies occurs on the Galenical the titular structure that crosses the Have River and linked the East with the West. Donovan and Abel get to spend a few taut minutes on its span and for all the mounting suspense (what about this other American over at Checkpoint Charlie?) its great to see the actors together again exchanging words in the wintry night.seaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea Bridge of Spies 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Steven Spielberg.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""Bridge of Spies"" Tom Hanks Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers accomplish something startling. Heres a suspenseful espionage tale where the international intrigue isnt settled with sharpshooters anti-aircraft missiles or poison needles (though they all appear with frightening effect) but by shrewd negotiation. They have reached into the chilly Cold War -- a part of it that is inherently undramatic -- and pulled up an uplifting witty plum. The fact-based spy story is set in New York and Berlin during the dire days of the late 1950s and early 60s. It was a time when Americans and Russians were convinced that a sneak attack from the enemy was at best days away. Schoolkids watched unnerving civil defense films teaching them to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear blasts. Our national psyche was a tizzy of tension uncertainty and endless migraine headaches. Spielberg delivers the eras retro feel and look with meticulous attention to period detail; bulbous cars driven by large beefy guys in suits on the way to big meaty dinners. Hanks plays James Donovan a citizen whose name entered the annals of history though almost nobody is aware of it. Donovan was a crafty corporate attorney in New York City. Since Hanks is a very good guy at playing very good guys Donovan is wily but never shifty. He is a decent family man who sticks to the facts negotiating aggressively slicing apart his adversarys claims like a fearless champion fencer. Hes the guy next door if you happen to live in a really nice neighborhood. When his firms senior partners approach him in 1957 to serve the federal government with a pro bono defense it stirs Donovans belief in justice. When they explain that hell represent an immigrant accused of being a Russian spy Donovan declares ""Im an insurance lawyer."" But since its geopolitically wise to demonstrate Americas belief in judicial fairness he accepts the assignment battling the prosecutor and biased judge like a stubborn so-and-so. It was the sort of act that could make Red Scare vigilantes bring a high-caliber attack to your front porch. The movie is fine from the start but it rises a notch when Hanks shares the screen with Mark Rylance playing accused Soviet mole Rudolf Abel. Donovan doesnt befriend Abel but treats him with full respect working hard to get him the best judgment possible. Abel is not a particularly spooky spook. Rylances muted but deeply emotive performance creates a character who is in his own way as much a polite man of principle as Hanks Donovan. Rylance a Tony- and Olivier Award-winning Guthrie Theater alum makes Abel dispassionate mild-mannered and mysteriously fascinating. When he and Hanks work side by side its hard to decide where to look first. DreamWorks Mark Rylance is Soviet agent Rudolf Abel in ""Bridge of Spies."" Of course this is Hanks film giving him the sort of part he excels in upright but never dull. He perfectly balances Donovans commitment to mounting the best possible defense with a cheeky sense of humor. The screenplay by the Coens that dynamic duo of sardonic cynicism tones down their usual irony but they keep a supply of pithy banter handy. If Atticus Finch could crack a joke once in a while hed be in Donovans league. The films espionage focus tightens after the 1960 Russian capture of U2 spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers. Having carried the Abel case up to the Supreme Court before Abel was imprisoned Donovan is recruited by the CIA to pick up the old case again. Hes tasked with flying to East Berlin to negotiate for Powers release by exchanging him for Abel. Donovan learning of American academic Frederic Pryor wrongly seized by the East Germans on suspicion of espionage ups the ante and insists on including him in the swap. This triggers a byzantine mediation to free two prisoners held for different purposes from the Kafkaesque court systems of the USSR and GDR whose abbreviated names Donovan can hardly tell apart. As the Berlin Wall begins rising from the Easts wartime rubble and sharpshooters take down attempted defectors the insurance lawyer is invested in a genuine case of life and death. ""Bridge of Spies"" boasts an impressive amount of Spielberg magic. There are distorted mirror images of life in the East and West tense intellectual showdowns and an unforgettable scene of the U2 spy plane being hit by Russian ground-to-air missiles at an altitude of 70000 feet. Watching the pilot try to bail out of the disintegrating aircraft at supersonic speed is the kind of traumatic action Spielberg created in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The film is much more than a courtroom drama intelligently reflecting both the current frost in the air between Washington and Moscow and the American past. Its a salute to nostalgic idealistic patriotism that Norman Rockwell Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart would applaud.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Bridge of Spies Recommended Video Rated PG-13  141 minutes  2015 Tom Hanks lends his considerable Honest John appeal to this fascinating cold war drama about the secret exchange of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel captured by the FBI in New York City and Francis Gary Powers whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1960. James Donovan (Hanks) a Brooklyn insurance lawyer and former Nuremberg prosecutor agreed to defend Abel on principle which brought him and his family public scorn. Though he lost the case he privately persuaded the judge not to execute Abel arguing that he would be more valuable to the U.S. alive than dead and then wound up as part of the negotiating team that exchanged Abel for Powers on the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin. Directed by Steven Spielberg this has all the sobriety and polish of his previous historical project Lincoln (2012); youd never guess the original script was by Joel and Ethan Coen.

Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Bridge of Spies 3.5 stars Starring Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Austin Stowell Amy Ryan Alan Alda Directed by Steven Spielberg Written by Matt Charman Ethan Coen Joel Coen Duration 141 minutes Related Stories Steven Spielberg Tom Hanks talk about drama Bridge of Spies Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies brings the Cold War struggles between the United States and the Soviet Union to life in surprising ways. This intriguing story of a high-level swap of spies is virtually unknown today -- but the film is inspirational enough that viewers might do their own out-of-theatre research and learn a lot more. Like many of Spielbergs serious-minded fact-based films -- among them the Holocaust drama Schindlers List (1993) and the Israeli spy thriller Munich (2005) -- Bridge of Spies is a procedural. It is sometimes a plodding one that sacrifices energy for factual exposition. Despite some deliberately fuzzy time lapses in the storytelling the film is well-researched and includes arcane detail contributed by the families of two of the real people involved. Significantly Bridge of Spies also features solid performances from Tom Hanks as the American protagonist and humble hero and Mark Rylance who plays an English-born German-Russian spy who had infiltrated the U.S. during the 1950s communicating ""secrets"" to Moscow. Hanks may be in line for his sixth Oscar nom as best actor (which would be his first since Cast Away 15 years ago). Rylance who is a British stage actor best known on screen for his stunningly restrained and complex performance as Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall is a joy to watch for his nuanced work. This is especially obvious in the opening sequences (and he deserves attention for a best supporting actor nom). As written by Matt Charman -- with filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen involved in jazzing up the script and adding subtle touches that echo lines from their own films -- Bridge of Spies is a meticulous chronicle set from 1957 to 1962. It tells how an idealistic American lawyer named James B. Donovan (Hanks) becomes the defence attorney for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) after the CIA closes in on his one-man operation in Brooklyn. Defying criticism and upholding the American Constitution in the face of public protests Donovan defends Abel as a signpost of American democracy. Later the CIA enlists Donovan to represent American interests in a proposed swap of Abel for the U.S. spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who was shot down by a Soviet missile during a surveillance mission in 1960. Like the real man was reported to be Hanks Donovan is a quiet unassuming yet supremely confident man who uses his skills in negotiation to get through the bureaucratic labyrinth of the Soviet Union and East Germany. The delicate negotiations take place in Berlin just as the Communists are building the Berlin Wall. The film takes us through each segment of the story -- from Abels spy trial through Powers disastrous mission to the spy swap negotiations -- in a thorough manner. This is not exciting cinema. But it is interesting and Hanks is fascinating to watch in his middle age (although he begins to look more and more like Richard Nixon). The period is brought to the screen with aplomb. Spielbergs filmmaking team always brings its high-quality expertise to his projects so Bridge of Spies looks professional and real. My biggest quibble with the film besides how laborious the story feels as it unfolds so carefully is in its psychological aspect. Spielberg boldly condemns Americans for resorting to mob rule in their reactions to the Abel spy trial. Donovan is depicted as standing alone on the moral high ground. But Spielberg just as boldly surrenders his criticisms for a patriotic climax and denouement. So the initial critical thinking is washed away in a tidal flow of flag-waving -- despite the relevance of this critical point-of-view in todays America. Twitter Bruce_Kirkland bruce.kirklandsunmedia.ca Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Bridge of Spies review Spielbergs latest doesnt make for exciting cinema By Bruce Kirkland Postmedia Network First posted Thursday October 15 2015 1249 PM EDT | Updated Thursday October 15 2015 0105 PM EDT Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies brings the Cold War struggles between the United States and the Soviet Union to life in surprising ways. This intriguing story of a high-level swap of spies is virtually unknown today -- but the film is inspirational enough that viewers might do their own out-of-theatre research and learn a lot more. Like many of Spielbergs serious-minded fact-based films -- among them the Holocaust drama Schindlers List (1993) and the Israeli spy thriller Munich (2005) -- Bridge of Spies is a procedural. It is sometimes a plodding one that sacrifices energy for factual exposition. Despite some deliberately fuzzy time lapses in the storytelling the film is well-researched and includes arcane detail contributed by the families of two of the real people involved. Significantly Bridge of Spies also features solid performances from Tom Hanks as the American protagonist and humble hero and Mark Rylance who plays an English-born German-Russian spy who h Top stories Popular Latest Videos Just one night in jail for Forcillo We have no life grandparents of 12-year-old girl killed in car crash Trump or Clinton?

Photo Credit Jaap Buitendijk advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT During the Cold War a Brooklyn insurance lawyer must negotiate a secret prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia. Rated PG-13 (language some intense scenes). BOTTOM LINE Steven Spielbergs period drama works as glossy entertainment but also draws subtle parallels to the present. CAST Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Amy Ryan The year is 1957 and the case of a captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel unexpectedly goes to Brooklyn insurance lawyer James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks in Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies."" The trial is meant only for show but Donovan happens to care about due process. Bucking public opinion his own boss and even the CIA Donovan takes Abels case all the way to the Supreme Court. His argument in a nutshell is that if America is truly the nobler superpower we should prove it. That means adhering to our constitution even when dealing with a Russian agent. ""Will we stand by our cause"" Donovan asks ""less resolutely than he stands by his?"" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break That stirring moment with its echoes of present-day dilemmas over enemy combatants and civil liberties marks the halfway point of ""Bridge of Spies"" which soon kicks into gear as an espionage thriller. Donovan is sent overseas on a secret mission to swap Russias Abel (a wonderfully world-weary Mark Rylance) for our U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As an added wrinkle Yale student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) has been unjustly jailed in East Germany so Donovan -- a born negotiator -- decides to spring him too. The films title refers to the handoff point the perilous Glienicke Bridge between the Eastern Bloc and West Berlin. ""Bridge of Spies"" is classically Spielberg -- handsome-looking well-acted (Hanks is perfect as a Cold War Atticus Finch; Amy Ryan briefly plays his wife) and thoroughly American. One reason Spielbergs dramas are such crowd pleasers is that theyre populist but never partisan. Even in our increasingly fragmented body politic Spielberg can still speak to an overarching ""us."" He has never directly addressed current events (not for him the gay-rights drama or the Iraq War polemic) preferring instead to mine the past in movies like ""Amistad"" and ""Schindlers List."" Its a politically safe approach to be sure but its also what makes his films feel so universal and timeless. ""Bridge of Spies"" is another fine example. Written with intelligence and wry humor by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers its glossy entertainment that has the ring of deeper truths.

"Tom Hanks shines in the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Tom Hanks shines in the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies Bridge of Spies movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Bridge of Spies starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance directed by Steven Spielberg. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Bridge of Spies starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance directed by Steven Spielberg. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""The Bridge of Spies"" is a consummate professionals tribute to a gifted amateur a smooth entertainment with a strong but subtle political subtext thats both potent and unexpected.The professional would be Steven Spielberg a director with more than 40 years of experience whose superior filmmaking skills have been with us for so long its tempting to take them for granted which would be a mistake. Storytelling this proficient is never something we see every day. SIGN UP for the free Essential Arts amp; Culture newsletter gt;gt;Spielberg is so good he makes us forget that ""Bridge of Spies"" is basically two separate films one a courtroom drama the other a spy thriller with unexpected dark humor thrown into the bargain courtesy of Joel and Ethan Coen who did a credited rewrite of Matt Charmans script. It was Charman who came across the Cold War true story of the amateur a New York attorney named James B. Donovan shrewdly played by Tom Hanks. A successful insurance lawyer Donovan is taken out of his element twice over first when he has to defend a Soviet spy in an espionage trial then when he has to attempt an especially convoluted prisoner exchange. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story One of the interesting aspects of ""Bridge of Spies"" is that Spielberg apparently a longtime Cold War buff was taken out of his element in terms of collaborators as well.Yes longtime associates like cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn are still with him but strong and energizing help came from newcomers to the team like production designer Adam Stockhausen (""Grand Budapest Hotel"" ""12 Years a Slave"") costume designer Kasia Walicka Maimone and composer Thomas Newman.And though it isnt entirely new its always good to see Spielberg infusing contemporary political relevance into his films especially ones like this which are envisioned as large-scale entertainments. Bridge of Spies Dreamworks / TNS Tom Hanks stars in ""Bridge of Spies."" Tom Hanks stars in ""Bridge of Spies."" (Dreamworks / TNS) Though Hanks is almost a given in an heroic everyman role like this (though his character has some unexpected twists) it was apparently Spielbergs idea to cast the magnificent stage actor Mark Rylance (Thomas Cromwell in the ""Wolf Hall"" miniseries) as his costar who does beautiful work as Soviet spy Colonel Rudolf Abel.Abel is introduced in 1957 Brooklyn staring into a mirror not because he is terminally self-involved but because as an accomplished Sunday painter he is working on a self-portrait. This is weve already been informed at the height of the Cold War a time when the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. lived in fear and spied on each other as much as they dared.Soon enough the FBI bursts through Abels door and Donovan gets called in by his boss Thomas Watters (Alan Alda) who tells him he is being drafted to defend Abel something Donovan is initially not happy about because ""everyone will hate me and I will lose.""Watters responds with a patriotic speech saying ""American justice is on trial"" and ""it cant look like our judicial system tosses people on the ash heap.""Though Donovan is a genuine patriot who truly believes in ""the rule book"" a.k.a. the Constitution one of the politically interesting aspects of the film is that most other people in power are simply mouthing pieties and arent interested in the slightest in constitutional guarantees. When Donovan says at one point ""we can care too much about security and too little about liberty"" the post 9/11 relevance is hard to miss.During the elaborate course of Abels trial and appeals Donovan forms a bond of sort with his reluctant client who turns out to be a man whose diffidence and soft accent (Abel was born in the U.K. to Russian parents) masks a shrewd intelligence and a deadpan sense of humor. When Donovan asks him whether hes worried or scared the invariable ""would it help?"" response is perfectly delivered.Intercut with Donovans work defending Abel is the drama of Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) a military pilot recruited by the CIA to fly the super-secret single seat U2 spy plane over the Soviet Union.Powers is shot down captured and subject to brutal Soviet interrogation including being tortured with water in a way that inevitably brings to mind Americas recent and controversial use of water-boarding.Its at this point that ""Bridge of Spies"" changes course as Donovan because of the relationship he has developed with Abel is called in by the CIA and asked to go to Berlin as a private citizen and negotiate with the Soviets to trade Powers for Abel a delicate job that gets even more complicated when the East Germans throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings.Its in the Berlin part of the film that Hanks performance as Donovan takes on greater idiosyncrasy and heft. For one thing he has to battle an increasingly incapacitating cold that leaves him desperate to go home. (One senses the hand of the Coens who love to torture their heroes in this onerous illness.)For another this newly minted negotiator with the CIA and two sovereign nations leaning on him turns out to be very much his own person determined to do what he thinks ought to be done. One of the themes of the film as articulated by Abel of all people is the importance of being what the Russian calls ""a standing man"" and what we would characterize as ""a stand-up guy.""Something that James Donovan very much turns out to be.

James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a successful lawyer with a wife (Amy Ryan) kids and the kind of home -- impressive but not ostentatious -- to which most Americans aspired in the 1950s. Donovan lives a comfortable but not particularly exciting or unusual life.That is until hes selected to defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who has been accused of spying for Russia. Even though he was born in England Abel is reviled as a traitor to America and Donovan isnt happy about having a client that everyone hates. But he also has his principles and he insists that Abel is entitled to a fair trial regardless of the Cold War climate.That climate gets even chillier on May 1 1960 when an American spy plane is shot down over the Soviet Union. Donovan enters into negotiations to trade Abel for the pilot -- and is plunged into a realm with which he is woefully unfamiliar. Not only must the lawyer cope with the uncertainty of securing a just outcome but also with the possibility of getting killed. The fact-based ""Bridge of Spies"" is a suspenseful yet thoughtful spy story drenched in atmosphere and dread. Working from a script by Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen director Steven Spielberg delivers a film thats unapologetically old-fashioned. Those accustomed to cinematic flash will simply have to reorient themselves.But the adjustment is more than worth it as Spielberg makes spellbinding connections between the America-versus-Russia paranoia of the period in which the story takes place and the current privacy-versus-security dilemma. The film plays as an enthralling companion piece to ""Munich"" his 2005 examination of terrorism and its repercussions. As the deeply principled Donovan Hanks deftly balances earnestness and humor. And Rylances spirited performance is almost certain to yield an Oscar nomination. Despite its genre constraints ""Bridge of Spies"" is among Spielbergs finest achievements -- and a reminder that the past is much more than just a repository for nostalgia.What ""Bridge of Spies""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 222  Rating PG-13  Content Violence and strong language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Bridge Of Spies Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Tom Hanks Steven Spielberg Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"A Cold War E.T. Bridge of Spies review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA Cold War E.T. Bridge of Spies reviewSteven Spielbergs Cold War drama Bridge of Spies recalls a movie that may seem an odd comparison E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 15 2015Bridge of SpiesStarring Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Amy Ryan Alan Alda Peter McRobbie Will Rogers and Eve Hewson. Directed by Steven Spielberg. At GTA theatres. 142 minutes. PGSteven Spielbergs captivating Cold War drama Bridge of Spies revisits the directors favoured themes of outsiders and father figures while also recalling one of his classic movies E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.Both films feature aliens -- one from the former Soviet Union the other from outer space -- who are marooned in a foreign and hostile land with assistance and empathy coming from an unlikely source.Article Continued BelowIn Bridge of Spies Tom Hanks plays ""Elliott"" to Mark Rylances ""E.T."" with the story this time being a true one or as true as movies ever get. Joel and Ethan Coen rework a screenplay by British playwright Matt Charman investing it with their droll appreciation of the absurd.In Bridge of Spies Tom Hanks right and Mark Rylance centre deliver golden performances as natural combatants who find common cause in seeking honest justice even if only they realize it. (DREAMWORKS / TNS)  It opens in the Brooklyn of 1957 convincingly rendered in all its Eisenhower-era rectitude by production designer Adam Stockhausen and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Suspected Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Wolf Halls Rylance) a man whose face and body join into a permanent shrug has been nabbed by FBI agents. The electric chair seems inevitable for this hated enemy of America although due process intrudes requiring the legal services of an equally odd and upright figure defence lawyer James Donovan (Hanks) whose specialty is insurance not espionage.But hes unflappable and shrewd traits hell need when historic events -- the U-2 spy plane crisis the Berlin Wall rising the atomic threat -- conspire to have him use Abel as a bargaining chip to try to wrest captured U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) from Soviet hands. Donovan also seeks to free hapless U.S. scholar Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) from East German clutches resisting the FBIs preference for expediency over conscience. The action stretches over five years never hurried but always engrossing. Hanks and Rylance deliver golden performances as natural combatants who find common cause in seeking honest justice even if only they realize it.In his fourth collaboration with Spielberg Hanks once again brings the common touch to a high-minded character Donovan fights a bad cold and public antipathy while arguing that ""every person matters.""Rylances Abel more than matches Hanks in his portrayal of a loyal toiler one who is prepared to accept whatever punishment is meted out to him from either friend or foe.Both men proceed stoically and quietly in the midst of a dangerous political deep freeze making Bridge of Spies a shrewd observation by Spielberg that real heroes are the ones who do the right thing without demanding trumpets.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday October 15 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Directed by Steven Spielberg ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on the true story of the 1960 U-2 incident. Brooklyn lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is thrust into the center of the Cold War as he negotiates the release of a pilot whose spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. (Lionsgate) An air of wholesome stolid assurance pervades ""Bridge of Spies"" a handsome sober-minded Cold War thriller about a little-known chapter of American history. And why not? This absorbing tale of tradecraft political ideals and unimpeachable moral character has been brought to the screen by no less a craftsman than Steven Spielberg here directing from a script written by Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman. In case that pedigree isnt convincing enough Tom Hanks stars as the films inspiring lead character a quietly heroic New York lawyer who in another era would have been portrayed by James Stewart or Gary Cooper. Hanks is his generations answer to those paragons of rectitude and in ""Bridge of Spies"" he reminds us why. As James Donovan who in 1957 defended -- unsuccessfully -- accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel at the behest of the U.S. government Hanks exudes modesty high principles and simple fairness. When the plot thickens and he becomes involved in a swap of prisoners to take place in East Germany -- Abel for U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers whose U-2 was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 -- he shifts his trademark humility into overdrive insisting to his Communist intermediaries that he has a cold and just wants ""to go home and get into bed."" One of the many subtexts of the films low-key brinkmanship is how the Cold War kept from getting hot; Hanks has always been disarming but in this case hes literally as well as figuratively so. Hankss aw-shucks charm could easily curdle into smugness here but Spielberg keeps the self-righteousness to a minimum. When he allows Donovan to speechify its on behalf of constitutional due process and American fair play. These are clearly meant to resonate in the era of Guantanamo and mass surveillance -- much as the fractiousness and executive strong-arming in Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" chimed with realpolitik in 21st-century Washington. Mostly though the director simply follows the action first as Donovan meets his client Abel a taciturn sleeper agent and then as both mens fates intertwine with the U-2 episode an obscure American graduate student living in West Berlin and the emergent geopolitical identity of a brand-new East Germany. Filmed by longtime Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski ""Bridge of Spies"" looks as if its been carved from granite and mist. Blues grays and chilly puffs of white light are to Spielberg what syrupy ambers are to Woody Allen. Spielberg -- himself a child of the duck-and-cover 1950s -- adroitly establishes the heaviness and barely contained paranoia of the time which he depicts with rich unnostalgic atmosphere. Hes also done a good job of casting actors blessed with timeless features especially Amy Ryan who plays Donovans wife with understated elegance and a few particularly well-timed sidelong glances. With his aw-shucks charm kept under control by director Steven Spielberg Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who in another era would have been portrayed by James Stewart or Gary Cooper. (Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks /Twentieth Century Fox Film) It should come as no surprise that Spielberg moves viewers through Donovans story with good taste and practiced confidence. With the help of some clever cuts and dissolves from editor Michael Kahn he imparts an enormous amount of information in a series of swift graceful scenes that firmly establish the protagonists hard-nosed negotiating skills as well as his reflexive belief that Americas democratic values are its best weapon. The narrative of ""Bridge of Spies"" flags only when Donovan arrives in East Germany where he embarks on a series of talky often bizarre encounters with KGB apparatchiks and shadowy satellite figures the most amusing of which involves members of Abels fake ""family"" who implore the American attorney to free their husband and father. (As he often does Spielberg also cant seem to decide on an ending for ""Bridge of Spies"" so he supplies three.) Part of the reason why the Germany sequences sag is that they dont feature Abel who is played by British actor Mark Rylance in what with luck will be a career-making performance. Many viewers may not have heard of Rylance who recently played Thomas Cromwell in ""Wolf Hall"" on PBS. But his work in ""Bridge of Spies"" deserves to be widely recognized as an example of screen acting at its most subtle poignant and exquisitely calibrated. In the films near-wordless opening section during which Abel goes about his daily business as an unassuming painter Rylance communicates volumes about his characters discipline and isolation simply by way of facial expression and body language. Later as Abel and Donovan develop an alliance of mutual understanding and respect he relaxes just enough to indulge a streak of deadpan unmistakably Slavic humor. Rylance turns in a sensitive deeply etched portrayal of a studiously nondescript criminal. Yet ""Bridge of Spies"" expands from being a smart engrossing procedural to a carefully observed character study of Donovan a particularly intriguing heretofore overlooked American figure. Thanks to his own reflexive values Spielberg cant help but make the kind of inspiring classically constructed drama that we keep being told Hollywood doesnt produce anymore. Thank goodness he still does. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains some violence and brief strong language. 142 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Bridge of Spies review Low-key Cold War yarn - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Bridge of Spies review Ill trade you one Soviet spy for... Bridge of Spies Dreamworks / TNS Tom Hanks stars in ""Bridge of Spies."" Tom Hanks stars in ""Bridge of Spies."" (Dreamworks / TNS) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune You know its not a Marvel movie if an insurance lawyers the superhero. Its brilliant really. Whats the quickest way to establish the humanity of two leading characters in a Cold War drama? Give them both the sniffles.""Bridge of Spies"" does that and more. The film is an anomaly -- a confident slightly square highly satisfying example of old-school Hollywood craftsmanship starring a major movie star brandishing a briefcase and a handkerchief rather than a pistol. The trailers for director Steven Spielbergs first film since the 2012 ""Lincoln"" arent quite telling the truth. They promise a ridiculous degree of screw-tightening suspense amid imminent global destruction. The movies narrative (more or less true) contains those elements but sparingly. Its closer to John le Carre than to Tom Clancy. Some moviegoers at a recent sneak preview seemed thrown by the rhythm of the thing its devotion to steady sure-footed storytelling. Its best to know going in that this isnt ""Argo"" entertaining as that film was culminating in bad guys running around tarmacs with machine guns.On the other hand Spielberg has no interest in making a documentary. Hes in love with the ravishing fakery of the movies he watched as a kid the ones he went on to re-investigate decades later as a great American filmmaker. Adapted freely from the historical record like any good fact-based but not fact-bound docudrama ""Bridge of Spies"" honors the righteous underdog triumphant. Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan a Brooklyn N.Y. insurance claims lawyer and former Nuremberg trials prosecutor. Not that many knew about it at the time but Donovan negotiated a tricky exchange of Soviet and American spies KGB mole Rudolf Abel (born Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher) captured in New York in 1957 as a trade for the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers shot down over the USSR in 1960 and captured.On his own initiative Donovan rolled a third man into the trade. American doctoral candidate Frederic Pryor was picked up and detained on the hostile side of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Two Americans Powers and the forgotten Pryor for Abel Could the right negotiator pull off such a lopsided trade? ""Bridge of Spies"" which takes its title from the Glienicke Bridge linking West Berlin with Potsdam answers that question in due course. Bridge of Spies trailer Watch the first trailer for ""Bridge of Spies."" Watch the first trailer for ""Bridge of Spies."" See more videos Not long after the swap occurred in the 1960s a movie based on the little-noted event reached the screenplay stage. Gregory Peck was mentioned as Donovan opposite Alec Guinness as Abel. We can imagine the outcome. Pecks gravely righteous aura made him a kind of extra-super-mega-American stalwart and in the wrong hands or the wrong project a bit of a pill.Hanks is a different story. Like everything about Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"" Hanks performance makes relaxed professionalism and genial decency look easy. The role is what it is an exemplar of homespun virtues an Everyman with a patient stalwart wife (Amy Ryan reliably fine though a scene or two more wouldve helped) and kids more concerned about ducking and covering and a Russian invasion than their dads clandestine whereabouts once the Berlin affair gets underway. Donovan is not larger than life; hes an ordinary hero with the sniffles Capraesque to the core if Capra had ever made a Cold War spy picture. At one point Donovan refers to himself Powers and Abel as the three most hated men in America. The second Hanks says it you can feel the crowd thinking as one Naaaah. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Because hes relatively new to multiplex audiences Mark Rylance will likely walk off with the acting honors for ""Bridge of Spies."" He looks nothing like the real Abel but in a largely nonverbal supremely poker-faced performance -- even his stuffy nose is subtle -- Rylance suggests a forlorn practitioner of deception who recognizes a lucky break when he sees it. His luck is Donovan a man tasked with defending the rights of a Soviet agent (albeit a fairly ineffective one) at an especially nervous and jingoistic time in American history. Such times have a way of cycling back around. To the degree that ""Bridge of Spies"" can be characterized as championing a cause beyond freedom and the hardy U.S. Constitution it argues implicitly for humane treatment of prisoners both foreign and domestic. Its a sound business approach geopolitically speaking.Theres a lovely cat-and-mouse overture as FBI agents trail Abel through the subways sidewalks and parks of Brooklyn back when as John Cheever famously put it ""almost everybody wore a hat."" Spielbergs climax set on the fateful bridge gins up the suspense but shrewdly without cheap tricks. In between those set pieces ""Bridge of Spies"" concerns itself largely with civil if cryptic conversations such as the ones between Donovan and his CIA middleman (Scott Shepherd); between Donovan and the judge (Dakin Matthews a splendid character actor) gunning for Abels execution; between Donovan and an East German Stasi agent played by another ace character actor Burghart Klaussner. Id happily see ""Bridge of Spies"" again just for Klaussners scene full of florid gesticulating and a genuinely funny temper tantrum. As for Rylance he makes the bit involving the hollow nickel containing microfilm (""The F.B.I. Story"" in 1959 used it; the Abel case was known as ""the hollow nickel case"") a crafty study in minimalism. Rylance does little; we lean in to catch it.The films atmosphere is thick and luxuriously managed. In his 13th collaboration with director Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski keeps everything in period but that can mean whatever the cinematographer and the director want it to mean. Spielberg and Kaminski are as interested in magic as they are in realism. At one point we see a room in muted color and then in the same shot we spy Donovan and Abel in the adjoining room and theyre in virtual black-and-white tones. Kaminskis palette favors noir shadows cut by blinding contrasts; he relishes the sheen of pearly white light hitting wet pavement or the hoods of old automobiles.Often the actors are placed in near-silhouette against a wall of hot flat light even before we get to the Soviet interrogation scenes with the captured pilot Powers (Austin Stowell adequate in a thinly conceived part). The design and execution of ""Bridge of Spies"" draw attention to themselves but just in the right ways. Note how Spielberg stages and films a simple transitional shot of people spilling out of a courtroom hit by a slew of photographers and newshounds. How many directors know how to do that sort of shot without making it a cliche? The screenplay by Matt Charman was punched up by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen and the Coens mordant sense of humor subtly energizes each new move on the chessboard. Certain details in the script appear to establish consciously or not a linguistic strategy of triplets the way Donovan says things like ""I I I"" or ""very very very important"" for emphasis for example or the three times Abel offers the rejoinder ""Would it help?"" to his lawyer. Now and then you may feel like interrupting Donovans latest expository reiteration of the terms of the swap with a ""Right we got it"" But its better than being lost I guess. Clarity of meaning and design is everything to Spielberg. ""Bridge of Spies"" plants one foot in Hollywood mythmaking and the other in American history and American values including the right to an unpopular cause. If you can handle the occasional yellow-highlighted thesis line -- ""Youre not a Communist. So why are you defending one?"" Donovans son asks at one point -- youll be amply rewarded by not quite a great film but a very good one.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic. mjphillipstribpub.com Twitter phillipstribune ""Bridge of Spies"" -- 3.5 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some violence and brief strong language)Running time 215Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Bridge of Spies Steven Spielberg Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Tom Clancy Lincoln (movie 2012) Beasts of No Nation review Captivating story of a child soldier French new wave pioneer Agnes Varda in residence at U. of C.

This is a Spielberg movie starring Tom Hanks after all who comes as close here as he ever has (after 20 years of trying) to playing the Jimmy Stewart role in a classic Frank Capra picture about Americas wounded but essentially decent soul. ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place at a relatively recent moment of American history that would define so much of what has happened since and was co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen - who are younger than Spielberg but also remember that era. If this movies not going to have wistful ambiguous moments of resonance its not going to have any damn thing at all.Let me work my way toward the moment in ""Bridge of Spies"" that simultaneously moved me and rankled me and that captures the movies greatest strengths and most abundant weaknesses - always closely related in the case of any Spielberg film. Hanks plays an upstanding New York attorney named James B. Donovan (a historical figure although contained her in one of those Hollywoodized narratives ""inspired by true events"") a onetime prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal who has taken on two difficult assignments at the behest of the United States government. One of them gets him in trouble with his wife and his law firm and pilloried in the press as a Red sympathizer and possible traitor. The other one ends up getting him depicted as a national hero.First off Donovan agrees to defend accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (played here by the marvelous English actor Mark Rylance) an assignment several other prominent attorneys have refused. As the Coens and co-writer Matt Charman tell the story this begins as a straightforward question of legal principle Every criminal suspect guilty or not is entitled to a competent defense. But when Donovan comes to understand that Abels conviction is a foregone conclusion and that the government wants something that looks like due process rather than the real thing he moves toward more aggressive tactics. This is largely true by the way The real Jim Donovan damn near got Abels verdict thrown out arguing before the Supreme Court that the incriminating evidence seized by the FBI came from a warrantless search and that even an enemy spy (if charged as a criminal defendant) was entitled to Fourth Amendment rights. He lost that case by a 5-4 vote.A few years later - the chronology of ""Bridge of Spies"" is I suppose deliberately murky - Donovan embarks on a secret mission to East Berlin after the U-2 incident of 1960 when the Soviets shot down a CIA spy plane and captured its pilot the briefly famous and/or notorious Francis Gary Powers (played here by the bland WASPy Austin Stowell). It seems ludicrous to protect spoilers in a story about an episode that concluded 53 years ago but I suppose we can say that theres plenty of atmospheric Berlin Wall cloak-and-dagger stuff agreeable performances from Mikhail Gorevoy as an unctuous Soviet negotiator and Sebastian Koch as a shadowy suave East German and the obligatory Spielbergian in-jokes drawn from cinema history. (Donovan walks past a Berlin cinema thats showing a film called ""Ein Zwei Drei"" - that is Billy Wilders ""One Two Three"" a farce about the collision of capitalism and Communism in occupied Berlin.)If you want to know what happened to Rudolf Abel and how the Americans eventually got Gary Powers back you can go read Wikipedia. You can also see ""Bridge of Spies"" of course if you keep in mind that its a Tom Hanks Oscar-bait movie more than a history lesson. It doesnt misrepresent the facts or not exactly but it shears them free of context to a large and damaging extent. Anyway towards the end of the film with all that business squared away we see Donovan riding an elevated train over the placid outer-borough suburbs of the early 1960s. Hes trying to ignore the fact that the other passengers have noticed him because his face is on or near the front page of every New York newspaper that morning. (There were at least five of those at the time maybe more.)So instead Donovan looks out the window in contentment surveying the sunlit and prosperous nation whose most important principles he has defended. Then the train crosses one of those invisible urban boundaries into a poorer Brooklyn neighborhood of tightly packed multi-story buildings and he sees a gang of kids scrambling over a back fence from one yard to another quite likely up to no good. A cloud of fatherly moral concern passes over the sunny Tom Hanks visage and its like a Capra-Stewart monologue delivered in silence Are we living up to the promises we made to each other? When we insist that we stand for freedom and equal opportunity do we really mean it? How much better than the Commies are we in fact? You Might Also Like Spielberg is pushing an entirely unexceptional version of Hollywood liberal idealism here Yes we are a better and nobler nation because at least we still ask ourselves these questions. Rudolf Abel may have been railroaded but he had a good and honest lawyer and he was not tortured or subjected to brutal interrogation (as Gary Powers clearly was). But when we lose track of those questions when we no longer have the Jimmy Stewart-Atticus Finch-Tom Hanks paradigm of Establishment masculine decency to fall back on were in trouble. I have no particular problem with that lesson plan although one could say that the historical record calls for a sterner admonition and its delivered here with such Hanksian blandness that viewers are clearly offered the opportunity of missing the point entirely.""Bridge of Spies"" is meant to be an inspiring Capraesque fable about Jim Donovan exemplary American and thats fair enough. But in constructing that fable Spielberg and the writers skip over all the most important and interesting material about the U-2 incident. CIA director Allen Dulles was at once needlessly paranoid about Soviet plans for thermonuclear war and overconfident about American technology. Although depicted to the public as a super-secret cutting-edge surveillance aircraft the U-2 was a flimsy underpowered construction that the Soviets had no trouble detecting and shooting down.Powers did not disable or destroy the plane (as he had been ordered to do) and did not commit suicide when faced with capture (ditto). He probably wound up telling the Russians everything he knew about the CIA and the U-2 program -- and you and I would have too of course. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev trolled President Dwight Eisenhower for weeks after the initial incident delaying the news that Powers had been captured alive and inducing the Americans into spinning all kinds of embarrassing falsehoods about the supposed weather-spotting plane that had supposedly wandered of course after its pilot supposedly asphyxiated. Ike felt so despondent after the real story came out that he briefly contemplated resignation. In terms of historical fact the U-2 episode was a massive Soviet propaganda victory that made the United States look incompetent arrogant and poorly prepared. There are valid commercial reasons why Steven Spielberg doesnt want to tell that story but those reasons make clear that ""Bridge of Spies"" is itself a form of historical whitewashing albeit one less noxious and harmful than the customary American variety. I liked the movie a lot - its one of Spielbergs most measured and most adult films in years with production values every bit as good as youd expect. And it would be awesome in terms of cultural and historical impact if the ideologues at Breitbart and Drudge and so on decide to heap invective on this tale of Jim Donovans backstage role in the Cold War as pantywaist lily-livered anti-American moral relativism.But to haul out one of the bigger critical truisms (which happens to be true) stories about the past are invariably stories about the present in disguise and this one has a double edge that goes beyond anything that Spielberg and Hanks and their writers intend. Those who insisted in the late 1950s that the Constitution did not apply to Rudolf Abel - because we faced an implacable foe and it was a time of national emergency and so on -- have made the same argument many times in many ways and make it today about anyone associated with ""terrorism"" no matter how tenuous the linkage or how scanty the evidence. Thats a dangerous ideological illness that is well worth noticing. So is the seductive fiction that a redeemer will arise among us played by Tom Hanks playing Jimmy Stewart playing an upstanding lawyer who believes in the reasonable middle ground of the American way.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Splitting the difference between Frank Capra and John Le Carre Steven Spielbergs Bridge Of Spies mounts an ode to the little guy of American idealism within the realpolitik of the Cold War. Textured with ink-blot shadows ripples of snow and rain and pinpricks of bright primary color--a neon sign seeping red into a puddle a bar humming blue--its one of the most handsome movies of Spielbergs latter-day phase and possibly the most eloquent. Inspired by the real-life exploits of attorney-turned-international-negotiator James B. Donovan Bridge Of Spies turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often disarmingly funny cat-and-mouse game in which an insurance lawyer with a bad cold finds himself having to outwit both sides in the name of a democratic value. Largely set in an early 60s East Berlin that is equal parts theater of the absurd and painters palette smeared with shades of gray the movie stars Tom Hanks as Donovan who is drafted as the pro-bono defense attorney for KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance superb) and then finds himself representing the CIA when it comes time to trade Abel for downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Donovan however also wants to secure the release of an economics student who found himself on the wrong side of the newly built Berlin Wall--an exchange complicated by the fact that said student has zero value for American counterintelligence and is being held by the East German authorities rather than the Soviets. Co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen Bridge Of Spies often skews toward satire lampooning everything from anti-Communist groupthink and nuclear hysteria to the Eastern Blocs bizarre mix of pageantry and secrecy which finds the sneezing coughing hero having to maneuver his way around fatuous functionaries and inept impostors. (A revealing reference Looking for a phone booth in West Berlin Donovan finds himself in front of a theater thats playing Billy Wilders fast-paced Cold War send-up One Two Three.) And yet one would be hard-pressed to classify the movie as a comedy. The premise all but invites a run-down of Spielbergisms the mission-of-principle of Saving Private Ryan meets the quick-footed mid-century intrigue of Catch Me If You Can in Lincolns smoke-filled curtains-drawn back rooms of government. (Its no coincidence that two of those films also star Hanks who is cast here as a figure of fundamental gosh-darned decency who would seem unlikely if he werent played by Tom Hanks.) What it is though is the most purely expressive workout of a theme Spielberg has tackled before in Lincoln and the earlier Amistad the moment when the misty-eyed principles of American democracy get measured against its laws and policies. Its been a given for going on four decades now that Spielberg is about as confident a director as this countrys likely to produce. Even when he gets sappy--which he has more and more since aging his way into the pantheon of so-called great American directors--the one-time blockbuster upstart still directs the heck out of everything with a command of the nuts and bolts of film grammar thats easy to take for granted but which still puts him in a different category from just about everyone working in Hollywood today. (Even something as corny as The Terminal has a sense of finesse.) Bridge Of Spies is the directors most straightforward genre piece since War Of The Worlds; not coincidentally its also his best film in a decade.Shooting in roomy anamorphic widescreen and making only the most sparing use of Thomas Newmans score Spielberg renders the negotiation as a conflict of colors and forms which comes to a head at the snow-covered Glienicke Bridge--the notorious prisoner exchange point connecting Potsdam with West Berlin framed here as a corridor of white between two masses of shadow. Bridge Of Spies is full of thick broad strokes the courtroom rising at Abels trial cuts straight into children reciting the Pledge Of Allegiance before being shown an atomic scare film; a failed escape at the Berlin Wall gets a delayed rhyme in a shot of children gamely leaping chain-link fences in Brooklyn and so on and so forth. But even when it errs on the side of the heavy-handed Spielbergs direction retains a canvas-like quality. Large chunks of Bridge Of Spies may consist of men sitting and talking in evasive doublespeak but the movie always articulates itself visually and its two most suspenseful sequences are both effectively wordless the opening in which FBI agents pursue Abel through the streets and subways of late 50s New York and the crash of Powers U-2 spy plane during a surveillance mission over the Soviet Union. An ode to holding fast to moral principles geopolitics be damned becomes a hurrah for old-fashioned big-screen storytelling.

Tom Hanks (right) and Mark Rylance in Bridge of Spies.(Photo Jaap Buitendijk DreamWorks)As good-hearted and perseverant lawyer James Donovan in Bridge of Spies Tom Hanks has a scene where he inexplicably orders two breakfasts in a German hotel.His earnest attorney doesnt get to eat either of them -- thus how days go for an embattled guy caught between sides of the Cold War -- but the idea of a meal is fitting when talking about director Steven Spielbergs latest historical drama ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide). Its the very definition of meat and potatoes While not phenomenal especially compared to the rest of the Spielberg oeuvre Spies still hits the spot.Spielberg and Hanks team for the fourth time with Spies which is inspired by the real-life events that took place during the post-World War II paranoia of the 1950s and early 60s.Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) a quiet older Brooklyn man is arrested for being a Soviet spy and the CIA recruits Donovan to defend him in a court of law. Donovan -- a reputable New York insurance lawyer who assisted in the 1945 Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals -- takes the case though his wife (Amy Ryan) and law partner (Alan Alda) strongly discourage it.USA TODAYSpielberg builds A Bridge to Cold War eraNo wonder since he becomes as much an infamous celebrity as his calm client. Spielberg strongly sets the story in the mood of the time where anything involving Russia bristled the populace -- Donovan rides the subway to work and with his face on the front page of everyones newspaper he has nowhere to look without getting the stink eye from fellow commuters.Abel is found guilty but Donovans involvement only gets more complicated when hes tasked to head to Berlin and negotiate the trade of Abel for Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) the U-2 pilot being held by the Soviets as a spy after being shot down over Russian airspace.Bridge of Spies has so many fascinating personalities that it could as easily focus on Powers as it could Donovans CIA handler (Scott Shepherd) who is such a secret agent that he seems to be popping in from his own movie most of the time.But having it be Donovans story is classic Spielberg -- the tale of an ordinary dude going to the ends of the Earth to do the right thing is in the same wheelhouse as Daniel Day-Lewis 16th president in Lincoln and Harrison Fords whip-snapping globetrotter in Raiders of the Lost Ark.USA TODAY5 things we learned about Bridge of SpiesSpielbergs longtime cinematographer two-time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski takes usual period and spy tropes and make them look like works of art from the chaos-laden courtroom scenes to the stark tones of East Germany and the iconic Glienicke Bridge.Hanks is as usual rock solid as Donovan giving an extra air of humanity to a rookie wading into the rough and murky waters of espionage. The Coen brothers boost the Spies script especially in the interactions between Donovan and Abel as they forge a friendship -- Donovan cares and worries about his clients well-being and Abel plays the good soldier who wont give the CIA anything about his covert work.Rylance a known commodity to the PBS faithful of Wolf Hall and super-fans of the English stage is a brilliant revelation here to everyone else. He emits an icy intensity yet also a kind nature as Abel sits reserved either in jail a courtroom or on a freezing-cold bridge waiting for whatever fate chooses for him.Of all of the meaty performances in this Spielberg smorgasbord Rylance is the one to really savor. 122 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1RJRnmX,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/15/review-bridge-of-spies-steven-spielberg/73801908/,200,bridgeofspies32,bridgeofspies,usatoday
Bridge of Spies (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Bridge of Spies (PG-13) Tom Hanks stars in Steven Spielbergs drama about spy games during the Cold War. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/15/2015 Editor rating 3 Bridge of Spies Steven Spielbergs first movie in three years is a perfect companion piece to his previous film Lincoln. Both are historical dramas about a man struggling to do the right thing in the face of grave opposition from the public and the government. Both are based on true stories (although Bridge plays looser with the facts). And both are examples of what happens when Spielberg brings his considerable talents to bear on a story that is comprised primarily of loaded conversations with little in the way of traditional action. The movie kicks off with a wonderful setpiece that shows off Spielbergs ability to tell a story primarily through visuals -- is there any other filmmaker working today better at this? We meet Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in his Brooklyn apartment staring in the mirror and painting a self-portrait. The multiple faces are the first sign theres something up with this seemingly ordinary man. The phone rings; he answers silently listens hangs up and heads outside. Rudolf is being followed by FBI agents as he hops on the subway sits on a park bench and begins to paint. Spielbergs camera shows us that Abel is carrying out some sort of mission -- he picks up what appears to be a nickel that has been left for him -- right under the noses of the men who are shadowing him. He returns home cracks the coin open and pulls out some sort of document. Then the agents barge in charge him with espionage and arrest him. The entire sequence -- swift precise commanding -- is as close to traditional action as Bridge of Spies ever gets (a later scene involving the crash of an Air Force U-2 plane is more spectacular but less essential like something that was thrown in to kick the pace up). The first half of this complicated obviously personal movie consists of a lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) negotiating his way through a rigged assignment Provide Abel with a proper legal defense but dont defend him too well because we want to make sure he gets put away. Set in the late 1950s the first hour of Bridge of Spies allows Spielberg the opportunity to revisit his childhood fears -- Russia the bomb the duck-and-cover schoolroom classes commie paranoia. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman that was honed and polished by Joel and Ethan Coen Spielberg posits the movies central dilemma cleanly and neatly Does a criminal deserve all the rights offered by the Constitution even when hes caught committing treason? As played by Rylance a celebrated English actor playwright and director Abel bears no ill will toward America. Hes just doing whats being asked of him the same way Donovan is. When Abel is found guilty and sentenced to 30 years he practically shrugs; Donovan seems more interested in appealing the decision than he is. Hanks has played so many moral conscionable men that hes practically synonymous with goodness like James Stewart before him. But he doesnt coast and he finds intriguing wrinkles in Donovan a man who is surprised to discover an inner fire he didnt know he had (the real-life Donovan had much more experience with espionage and the CIA than his movie incarnation). Even after public opinion turns against him -- hes guilty by association -- and his wife (Amy Ryan) and family suffer the consequences Donovan refuses to go through the motions. He kicks Abels case up to the Supreme Court the way he would with any other client because thats his job and Spielberg shows us how even Abel gradually comes to admire him. The second half of Bridge of Spies which involves an American pilot arrested and charged with espionage for flying over Soviet airspace as well as a college student held prisoner by the German authorities grows more complicated and denser The movie is unusually heavy on dialogue although Spielberg and his go-to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski give the images a luxurious brooding sheen. The climax which sticks closely to history is somewhat underwhelming considering the buildup. But Spielberg isnt out to conquer the world this time. Bridge of Spies has been described as a minor work from a major filmmaker but the film is too personal to dismiss as a curiosity and its overall theme blends right in with many of Spielbergs previous pictures (most notably Munich Schindlers List and yes Lincoln) In a world thats been turned sideways where its no longer easy to tell right from wrong how do we preserve our integrity and character while fighting for justice and the common good?

Rating PG-13 (violence and strong language) By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Oct. 15 2015 Thursday Oct. 15 2015 Thursday Oct. 15 2015 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram In an age when international refugee crises more or less unfold live on Twitter and back-room governmental dealings are dumped into the daylight by digitally savvy whistleblowers Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies seems positively quaint.Not that the tale Spielberg and his collaborators have to tell is dull by any stretch. The fact-based drama concerns a tense paranoid period in the early 1960s as the United States and the then-Soviet Union engaged in diplomatic and military brinksmanship each country daring the other to step over the line and into World War III. But for all Spielberg his star-packed cast led by Tom Hanks and his on-screen and off-screen team (Joel and Ethan Coen co-wrote the screenplay) bring to the table Bridge of Spies is remarkable only for how stuffy and surprisingly inert the film becomes. Despite the parallels Spielberg teases out between then and now -- allusions to government sanctioned torture for instance -- Spies never truly springs to life.The film opens with the arrest and detainment of suspected Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) whose bemused reactions to his ongoing plight is Spies most singular pleasure. (When told he seems unworried by his circumstances ""Would it help?"" he asks the marvelous verbal equivalent of a shrug.)While Abels being held in America U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (played by the blandly handsome Austin Stowell) manning a spy plane for the C.I.A. on a covert mission is shot down and captured by the Soviets further raising the stakes. The idea of trading captives is floated by senior government officials necessitating the enlistment of a patriotic lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) to facilitate Abels delivery and Powers release. Donovan along with the audience is plunged into a world of mysterious alliances shifting intentions and uncertain loyalties placing him in the midst of fraught negotiations which are further complicated when an American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is also captured by the Germans a country undergoing some seismic Cold War changes of its own as it builds the Berlin Wall. Hanks brings his capable everyman quality to the role of Donovan sniffling his way through snow-blown Berlin and never letting the pressure of the situation get to him. Hes surrounded by a constellation of terrific character actors -- Alan Alda plays Donovans stern boss; Amy Ryan is his suffering-in-silence wife Mary; Sebastian Koch is Wolfgang Vogel a shadowy German go-between -- although none of them have much to sink their teeth into. Bridge of Spies offers few surprises -- a pitfall of based-on-history films -- and unfolds in such perfunctory fashion as to seem almost dull. Spielberg has explored this era before with Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan and again despite the complexities of the Cold War finds the enemies much more clearly delineated than in the 21st century. That said Joel and Ethan Coen who co-wrote the screenplay with Matt Charman dont expend much energy wondering about the European lives being affected apart from Abel although even he ends up being a cipher. With espionage television dramas like The Americans Deutschland 83 and Homeland deftly mining the world of spies for potent dramatic narratives its disappointing Bridge of Spies cant find the same spark in its nonfictional inspiration.

Sometimes he gets overly passionate and allows running times to run amok and every so often the films message albeit important could use more nuance. Yet those transgressions become minor annoyances in the end.And Spielberg isnt flying solo when transforming history into intelligent entertainment. He partners with a band of top-notch pros and the results are powerful rousing productions like ""Lincoln"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Munich"" and ""Schindlers List."" (R) Tom Hanks as Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan in Bridge of Spies. (Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks II) ( Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks II ) This same concerted effort is fully deployed in the Cold War-era ""Bridge of Spies"" a smart detailed spy drama that showcases high-caliber performances from Tom Hanks and especially from stage actor Mark Rylance (seen in the BBCs ""Wolf Hall"").Also contributing to this strong sturdy drama are an incisive screenplay from Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen; atmospheric cinematography by frequent Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski; and some sterling production design by Adam Stockhausen who won the Oscar for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and who brings the 50s and early 60s to rich life.Does ""Bridge"" rate as one of Spielbergs best? Not entirely since its overly drawn out notably near the end. But thats a minor complaint for a mature drama that demands rapt attention and prefers studied execution over frenetic pacing.Advertisement One distinct pleasure is watching Spielberg reunite with Hanks for a fourth time. Hanks likability fits snugly with the character of Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan a decent family man whos pitched into the political schematics of spy trading. Hes been saddled with a no-win case defending alleged Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) a soft-spoken artist who cinches his belt too tightly above the waistline and adopts the look of a nerd rather than a threatening agent.Donovan realizes its not an appealing assignment and his wife (Amy Ryan) is none too pleased hes leading the defense. In fact everyone is hostile toward Donovan who wants to see a fair trial even if a lets-get-him judge and public dont. To no ones surprise Abel winds up with a guilty verdict. But the trajectory of his fate changes when the American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down over Russia while hes surreptitiously snapping pictures. As the Russians slap the American spy with a 10-year sentence the Berlin Wall is going up and dividing East and West. Meanwhile an unfortunate American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) gets caught in the middle and is arrested in East Berlin assumed to be a spy.This eventually fuels a complex grand plan for a spy swap a delicate dance that teeters on the verge of collapse at any moment and an insistence from Donovan to make Pryor part of the exchange. Spielberg and his screenwriting team relish conveying the machinations that went into the deal-making demonstrating how uneasy political times led to finessed chesslike maneuvering to retrieve spies in an intense trade-off at Glienicke Bridge in 1962.The cast is ideal. While Hanks is as good as ever and makes us root for a man who wants to do the right thing it is Rylance who stands out. From Spielbergs metaphorically dense opening sequence in which his character is painting a self-portrait of his vexingly low-key responses to his attorney Rylance creates an unforgettably unique individual.Hanks plays well off him. And since Spielberg does love the underdog he turns Donovan into a virtuous character whos all but ready to be sainted. Thats not so bothersome until the final moments. In fact its refreshing to be able to cheer on someone who stands up against public opinion.""Bridge of Spies"" reminds us that underdogs can triumph and in the process even negotiate one hell of a deal by using brains not brawn.bridge of spies    1/2Rating PG-13 (for some violence and brief strong language)Cast Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Amy Ryan Austin StowellDirector Steven SpielbergRunning time 2 hours 15 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

EntertainmentMovies Tom Hanks expertly navigates Spielbergs Bridge of Spies Originally published October 15 2015 at 1201 am Updated October 16 2015 at 651 am Tom Hanks right plays an insurance attorney tasked with defending a Soviet intelligence officer (Mark Rylance) in ""Bridge of Spies."" (Jaap Buitendijk) Movie review Tom Hanks does a great job playing a man reluctantly dragged into geopolitical gamesmanship in this spy drama from Steven Spielberg. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer The Cold War has seldom seemed so cold as it is in Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies."" The light is a pale wintry gray particularly in the scenes set in Berlin at the time of the raising of the Wall. (Spielbergs favorite cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shot the picture and there are echoes of his ""Schindlers List"" style in the visual bleakness.) When the picture opens in 1957 the U.S. is gripped by nuclear jitters and the FBI is feverishly hunting Soviet spies. When agents find and arrest one in Brooklyn a Col. Rudolf Abel that sets in motion the real-life events Spielberg cogently dramatizes in ""Bridge of Spies."" Although set more than 50 years ago the picture strongly resonates with our present era of the war on terror. The hero is James Donovan (Tom Hanks) a prominent New York insurance attorney pressed to take on Abels defense to demonstrate to the world the fairness of the American justice system. The thing is no one wants him to succeed -- not the judge and certainly not the government. Movie Review 1/2   Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks Mark Rylance Austin Stowell Alan Alda. Directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen. 142 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some violence and brief strong language. Several theaters. Abel (Mark Rylance enigmatic and soft-spoken) is viewed as being an enemy combatant not worthy of a vigorous defense or indeed much of a defense at all. The parallels between Abels case and the situation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay are strongly drawn. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

And he articulates that belief before the Supreme Court as he appeals Abels guilty verdict arguing that it is ""who we are"" as Americans and that the roadblocks raised to prevent Abel from getting a fair trial are badly at odds with that ideal. The picture turns into a hall-of-mirrors spy drama when years after losing the case but persuading the judge to spare Abel from the death penalty Donovan is approached by the U.S. government to go to East Germany to negotiate a swap of Abel for downed U-2 spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). This mission is a forbiddingly ticklish one Hes not an officially acknowledged negotiator and the Soviets and East Germans hes dealing with have conflicting agendas. Hanks does a great job playing Donovan as a man of essential decency who nevertheless is an expert negotiator and a hardheaded realist. The skill with which Hanks navigates the intricacies of the plot amount to some of the best work of his career.

Photo Jaap Buitendijk Associated Press Spielbergs Bridge of Spies is much more than a solid ride 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Watching a Spielberg movie is like riding in the back of an old Town Car. Theres plenty of room the construction is solid you know youre heading somewhere and even if there are bumps the ride is always smooth. Indeed Steven Spielberg is so smooth so good at what he does that his best movies have a way of seeming inevitable when theyre the furthest thing from it. Case in point ""Bridge of Spies"" which is the product of some thousand (or 10000) decisions that all happened to be right from the casting to the choice of shots to the direction of the actors to the costumes and art direction. There is a gift for story at work here which is more than instinctive but has instinct at its core that can be described but not fully explained. Every filmmaker takes you by the hand but only some make you forget all about letting go -- and theyre never the ones that grip the tightest. The story of ""Bridge of Spies"" can be talked about in a number of ways as a story about espionage or the Cold War but at its heart its a character portrait. Specifically its the story of a man of principle who when confronted by the biggest drama of his life got bigger instead of smaller. James B. Donovan a New York lawyer in the 1950s is played by Tom Hanks who is the acting equivalent of Spielberg. He doesnt do anything fancy. He just does the right thing from moment to moment with his uncanny way of always knowing what the right thing is. The movie begins with what could almost be a silent sequence in which we encounter Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) a whimsical unassuming man who is soon revealed to be a Soviet spy. These early scenes are set in New York in 1957 and you could hope for no better transport to an earlier era outside of a time machine. Its not just the cars and the costumes that are perfect but the font on the signs and the kinds of businesses shown on the street not to mention a bridge in the distance that looks newer than it does now and the use of film stock that evokes a Technicolor newsreel. When we first meet Donovan he is negotiating on behalf of a client in his capacity as an insurance lawyer. We notice two things right away He knows how to win even while negotiating from a weak position. He can argue vigorously while alienating no one. These abilities will come into play later in the film. Video Bridge of Spies trailer History finds Donovan and the movie kicks into gear when he is enlisted to defend Abel who is accused of espionage. The American government wants Abel to have a good lawyer in order to demonstrate to the world that Abel is being treated fairly. What they dont expect is for Donovan to mount an actual defense. Some of the best scenes involve Donovans clashes with the presiding judge played by Dakin Matthews who assumes a superior air even as his manner suggests the unease of a proud man taking orders from upstairs. Spielberg and the screenwriters (Matt Charman and the Coen brothers) present Donovan as a kind of ideal combination of geniality and perception. Before anyone he has the notion that a foreign spy should be treated differently from a domestic traitor bearing in mind that America has spies working in other countries as well. This becomes important as ""Bridge of Spies"" transmutes from the story of a court case into one involving the U-2 incident and the crash of Francis Gary Powers. Spielberg being Spielberg the scene in which the spy plane is shot down from an altitude of 70000 feet is harrowing in its execution. But then all the details of this film feel right whether its the glazed look of people on a New York subway or the soul-sick frenzy of Berlin just as the wall was going up. Spielberg throws away nothing so that a single scene involving CIA Director Allen Dulles isnt merely functional but has reverberations. Without seeming to be doing much in particular actor Peter McRobbie makes you think that everything youve ever heard about Dulles is true especially the bad things.

""Bridge of Spies"" is not a direct allegory for our times but rather a useful reminder that at all the pressure points of our history there have always been people ready to do an end-run around the Constitution out of either fear or convenience. ""Bridge of Spies"" tells us that the Constitution is not some quaint national luxury but the road map out of the darkness. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

A lot of people like complicated cold war espionage thrillers but with few exceptions Im not one of them. I understand war and battle sequences and I totally get the Nazis. What I dont always understand is secret agents in business suits and Humphrey Bogart raincoats who slink around in rain-soaked back alleys spying on each other for reasons that are never clearly explained in foreign countries where nobody speaks English yet the good guys always manage to have the correct change for phone calls and hail taxis without telling the drivers where theyre going. So I dreaded Bridge of Spies with nobody more all-American wandering around East Berlin than Tom Hanks. I should have known better. The director after all is Steven Spielberg who knows how to make logical movies and has a special affinity for narrative coherence. Its a riveting film and I understood every word. BRIDGE OF SPIES  (3/4 stars) Written by Matt Charman Ethan Coen and Joel Coen Directed by Steven Spielberg Starring Tom Hanks Mark Rylance and Alan Alda Running time 142 min. The year is 1957 U.S.-Russian hostilities are in full swing after the execution of the Rosenbergs and in Brooklyn a Soviet spy is arrested for stealing classified American military documents and passing them to the Kremlin without registering as a foreign agent. Tom Hanks plays Jim Donovan the attorney drafted by the F.B.I. to represent him in court. A former assistant prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials Donovan is chosen because he stands for good old-fashioned integrity and justice and therefore seems like the perfect choice to save the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (played without his usual hyperventilating histrionics by stage actor Mark Rylance) from the electric chair. Donovans law firm thinks its his patriotic duty to prove that even a spy gets an honest defense on American soil. Ignoring the verdict of guilty on all counts Donovan risks the cost to his family and firm following the letter of the law to pursue an appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court despite the threat posed by both vigilantes and cops. Suddenly theres another more important reason to save Abel. When heroic U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is captured behind Communist borders it seems like an opportune time to negotiate an East-West trade--swapping Abel for Powers. Just as the state department the CIA and the Pentagon want to save face by sending Donovan to negotiate the swap on Russian soil the plot switches gears again when another American a naive Yale economics student named Frederic Pryor is captured on the wrong side of the Berlin wall and jailed. Powers is held by the Soviets Pryor is in the custody of the German Democratic Republic and Donovan takes it upon himself to demand the release of both men saving two lives instead of one. All of this takes place in a frozen winter landscape where officials from two governments play hardball and Donovans top coat is stolen by a gang of East German ruffians while hes fighting a debilitating cold all of which gives Mr. Hanks a chance to be vulnerable in a sympathetic Jimmy Stewart role. The screenplay by Matt Charman with a polish by Joel and Ethan Coen condenses a lot of confusing spy talk into a shrewd narrative that culminates on the infamous Glienicke Bridge where the outcome is never in doubt. I mean its a Tom Hanks movie so he has to emerge a hero. He does it masterfully abetted by Mr. Spielbergs customary finesse and attention to detail and supported by a fine cast that includes the wonderful German actor Sebastian Koch as the East Berlin lawyer seedy Mikhail Goreyev as the lawyer for the KGB a wasted Amy Ryan as Donovans wife and handsome Austin Stowell as Powers. Filmed in Poland Germany and New York Bridge of Spies is a solid chapter in the Spielberg filmography and another reason why his self-assured ability comes in handier on the screen than John le Carres when it comes to telling a good yarn in terms even a head-scratching novice like me can understand and enjoy.

Tom Hanks faces an East German checkpoint in Bridge of Spies ((TOUCHSTONE)) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 14 2015 at 853 AM updated October 14 2015 at 1024 AM comments Steven Spielbergs latest is a solid quietly made drama carefully wrapped around a civics lesson. Neither should surprise movie fans. From the start Spielberg has known how to put images together to put it mildly. His new ""Bridge of Spies"" is a good example often using pictures - or simple silence - to convey more than words employing editing to create parallel thoughts. And while hes explored social issues before - from the misguided ""The Color Purple"" to the standout ""Schindlers List"" - lately hes done it in small though still important ways like the way ""Lincoln"" tried to give President Obama a hard lesson in political deal-making. Its not a shock therefore to find Spielbergs new Cold War espionage story is really a small strong defense of our Bill of Rights. The story is based on fact (although some of the facts - such as how the Soviet spy was actually caught when a newsboy dropped a nickel and it cracked open revealing the microfilm - are too crazy for fiction). Soviet spy Rudolf Abel figures in; so does downed U.S. espionage pilot Francis Gary Powers. But the real drama begins when America tries to get Powers back and so asks a quiet Brooklyn lawyer to negotiate an exchange. Apart an early foot chase and the crash of Powers U2 jet - which Spielberg turns into a few white-knuckle minutes of action - this is a deliberate at times almost plodding film. As attorney James Donovan Tom Hanks is at his most Spencer-Tracy everyman; as Abel Mark Rylance is the very model of cold imperturbability. Most of the drama consists of quiet insistent conversations as Donovan shuttles back and forth among the CIA the Soviets and the East Germans trying to make a deal. There are still a few tense moments of course and ones which Spielberg smartly emphasizes by like Abel and Powers deliberately withholding information; unless you speak German as Donovan could youll occasionally wonder and worry just whats behind some of the brief threatening remarks he gets in East Berlin. But the heart of the movie beats quietly and it begins early after Abels initial arrest as Donovan - who was first his court-appointed lawyer - works to give him a genuine legal defense. And recoils in disgust as tainted evidence is admitted and the judge announces his eagerness to see the suspect convicted quickly. Because Donovan argues if this is a war of ideologies shouldnt we stick to our own? That even people we dont like - may even hate -- have rights? That America stands for fairness? Like many Spielberg movies this harkens to earlier movies quietly liberal classics like ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" - the idea that everyone deserves justice. And like ""Lincoln"" it looks to recent events particularly the spying we do at home and the way we treat prisoners in Guantanamo. And that may feel like an old issue to some; certainly ""Bridge of Spies"" feels a little dated itself with its almost fussy attention to period detail and indulgence in Hollywood stereotypes (a naive young couple separated by politics the quietly supportive wife waiting at home). But then some things arent flashy. Theyre simply essential. Like honesty. Like justice. Like simple common decency. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence.

Sometimes it feels like certain segments of the audience dont want the great director of the baby-boom generation to grow up. That probably says more about them than it does about him. Spielberg has of course made other films tackling factual chapters of the past like Schindlers List and Munich. But the reason I bring up Amistad and Lincoln in particular is that along with his latest film Bridge of Spies they make up what could be called his Constitution Trilogy. I realize that label may in fact make his new movie sound old-fashioned patriotic and sober - and it is those things - but its also a crackling Cold War espionage thriller that thrums with suspense and fleet precision. Set in 1957 the height of the simmering ideological and geopolitical showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks as a New York insurance lawyer named James Donovan whos tasked with the unpopular assignment of defending an alleged Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). According to our nations laws even during the paranoia-choked atmosphere of the era Abel is entitled to a legal defense. The American public and even the presiding judge may already presume Abels guilt but Hanks (once again tapping into the Jimmy Stewart Boy Scout idealism thats become his forte) is determined to defend him to the best of his ability. Plus theres something about Abels deadpan sense of humor and stoic integrity that Donovan reluctantly admires - even likes. Hes hellbent on saving his client from the electric chair. Who knows Abels life may even be useful in the unlikely event that someday the Soviets capture an American of their own and they can be swapped. This unlikely scenario soon becomes reality when a young American Air Force pilot named Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down over Russia while flying a classified U-2 surveillance plane and is captured and paraded in a Moscow show trial. Donovan is called into the office of CIA director Allen Dulles and informed that his duty to his country isnt quite over yet. Hes to go on a top-secret trip to the occupied bombed-out East Berlin and negotiate with the Russians and East Germans for a prisoner exchange. Based on real events and a script by Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen (who display yes the same old-fashioned patriotic and sober fingerprints they left on their screenplay for last years Unbroken - though this is a much better film) Bridge of Spies is like Capra with a dash of le Carre. Hanks is in his comfort zone as Donovan showing us a decent man grappling with history and his own civic ideals. But theres also a rascally twinkle in his eye that shows us that Donovan is more than just a red-white-and-blue father and husband in over his head. Part of him is getting off on the cloak-and-dagger rush of it all. Its the actors best performance since Saving Private Ryan. Meanwhile Rylance whos still probably best known for his brilliant work on stage is the films real breakout discovery. With his musical Northern English accent and bemused ironic demeanor he turns a story that could feel as musty as a yellowed stack of old newspapers snap to exuberant life. There are moments in the film when Spielberg teeters on the brink of becoming a little too preachy and strident when it comes to his heros decency and idealism - when subtlety should trump heavy-handedness. But at 69 Spielberg is still taking chances. After all it takes a certain kind of guts to risk being seen as old-school in Hollywood these days.

Photo Touchstone Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Bridge of Spies Running time 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence mild profanity). ""Bridge of Spies"" Steven Spielbergs best film since ""Saving Private Ryan"" stars a flawless Tom Hanks in the smart old-school thriller as James Donovan a Brooklyn lawyer who risked his life to free an American spy whose plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. The gripping real-life exploits begin a few years before that with the capture of a longtime Soviet agent Rudolf Abel in New York -- depicted with minimal dialogue in one of the most mesmerizing sequences Spielberg has ever directed. Brilliantly played by British theater legend Mark Rylance -- who nearly steals the show -- Abel is not acknowledged by his masters. So his defense at the spy trial is assigned to a reluctant Donovan who worked as a prosecution counsel during the trial of Nazi criminals in Nuremberg following World War II. Donovans aggressive defense of the obviously guilty Abel makes him a pariah in the press -- even his wife played by Amy Ryan and their children have their doubts. Abel is convicted but Donovan persuades the judge not to execute his client -- arguing that imprisoning Abel instead may provide ""insurance for future American spies who are captured. Sure enough the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency come calling when Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers is downed while taking spy photos over the Soviet Union -- where the KGB is trying to extract from Powers the kind of secrets that the CIA had not been able to pry from Abel. Mark RylancePhoto Touchstone Pictures The film does a fantastic job of capturing 1950s New York in its first half and surpasses that when Donovan travels -- with no official authorization or protection -- to a scary East Berlin where the US has no diplomatic relations. There Donovan witnesses East Germans seeking freedom being gunned down on the newly erected wall dividing Berlin. The top-drawer script by British dramatist Matt Charman and filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen subtly balances still-timely arguments that we need to provide civil liberties even to our enemies with Hanks dry humor -- as his character navigates Cold War hysteria at home as well as the conflicting political agendas of the Soviet and East German governments. Things become even more complicated when the East Germans arrest an American student on spy charges and want to trade him instead of Powers for Abel. The CIA is only interested in Powers but Donovan ignores their orders pressing for a two-for-one swap -- tensely and memorably conducted in the middle of the night on a barricaded bridge that once connected East and West Berlin. Surefire Oscar bait across the board ""Bridge of Spies is anchored by Hanks as a wily real-life hero who -- also in 1962 and into 1963 -- arranged the release of 9700 Americans and Cubans from Cuban jails.

TWITTER Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg reteam for the directors new movie a true-life espionage tale that premiered at the New York Film Festival. A feel-good Cold War melodrama Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what theyre doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict Steven Spielbergs first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the directors half-dozen previous ""war"" films but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielbergs fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks which world-premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16 looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielbergs generation the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time its possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north a principled American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty but James B. Donovan (Hanks) a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation. Read more The Walk and Bridge of Spies Bring Oscar Buzz to NYFF The story plays out over a period of five years from the time when British-born Soviet spy Abel is captured in 1957 to the suspenseful moment in February 1962 when Abel is traded by the U.S. for captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers who had been shot down in 1962 and an American student Frederic Pryor. But the filmmakers slight-of-hand skill compresses events dramatically to make it all seem to take place in a much shorter period of time a feeling accentuated by Donovans own impatience to make the wheels of justice and international diplomacy turn far more quickly than they ever actually do. The wonderfully comprehensive but unstressed detailing of 1950s American life in the opening stretches slides the viewer ever-so-smoothly into the period with a very different Brooklyn and New York subway system serving as convincing backdrops to the FBIs pursuit of Soviet agent Abel as he paints a landscape on a lovely afternoon. Plain-faced and nondescript in the extreme (no doubt the ideal for a spy) Abel never breaks a sweat and seems imperturbable no matter how dire things look for him. When asked repeatedly by Donovan if he isnt worried or nervous when faced with great jeopardy or even the prospect of the death sentence his typical response is ""Would it help?"" Plucked from the prosperous law firm where he is a partner to represent this resilient sad-sack of a client Donovan has no chance of winning this case but uncannily presents a strong argument for not putting Abel to death--his potential as a high-value swap for an American spy at some future moment; as he wryly points out its always wise to carry insurance. All the same his victory in this matter makes him seem disloyal even traitorous; fellow subway riders give him the evil eye his legal colleagues give him the cold shoulder and his house is even attacked at one point. Read more The Awards Pundits Talk Late Oscar Entries New York Film Fest At what seems narratively like the same time all-American he-man jet pilot Powers (Austin Stowell) is trained with three others to fly in the U-2 spy plane program which involves flying slow lightweight jets at 70000 feet to take highly detailed photographs of military installations within the Soviet Union. Stationed in Pakistan these pilots are clearly instructed to commit suicide if shot down deep in enemy territory. But in a stunningly rendered sequence Powers plane is strafed and starts spinning down while his parachute cord becomes stuck when he tries to bail out. In the end he survives and becomes the most high-profile American prisoner in the Soviet Union. With Donovans prescient prediction of future events born out the film elevates to a new level of intrigue tension and complexity as the lawyer is dispatched to a Berlin about to divided by a wall being built by the East Germans. Spielbergs fleeting imagery of this indelible moment in history is exceptional and vivid; East German workers toil building the walls blocks as citizens hustle to get across to the West before its too late and later Donovan and other passengers on an elevated train are stunned to briefly witness East German guards gunning down some people trying to make it up and over the wall. Another scene during this stretch of an American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) trying to get his East German girlfriend across the divide just at the moment when the wall has been sealed up strikes the only overtly melodramatic and false note in the film to that point. But there are wonderful and fresh scenes to follow as when Donovan arriving for a big meeting in East Berlin is greeted by Abels so-called family members who are obviously actors playing the parts and a scene in which a very Western-style East German lawyer Vogel (Sebastian Koch) dangerously roars his Volvo sports car down a snowy street with Donovan as his seriously discomfited passenger. Read more Steven Spielberg Says Superhero Movies Will Go ""the Way of the Western"" Amusingly Donovan who is lodged in supremely filthy and freezing conditions during his visit is made to be suffering from a bad cold the entire time hes in Berlin all the more reason for him to push things along to a quick resolution so he can return home. Making a trade with the East is very complicated due to Donovans insistence that both Powers and the Pryor be returned in exchange for Abel a deal made difficult because the Russians have the pilot and the East Germans (who are seen to be at considerable odds with the Soviets on many matters) possess the student. But the Americans shrewd sense of things brings the episode to a dramatic head with a negotiated pre-dawn prisoner swap on the Glienicke Bridge thereafter popularly referred to by name that provides the films title. Spielberg and his production team bring all of this off with assured finesse and great physical pleasure with rich contributions by production designer Adam Stockhausen costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski even if the latters undue predilection for flooding scenes with window light goes unabated here. Hanks makes Donovan into another of the actors Everyman characters but one with very particular American ""greatest generation"" characteristics such as unselfishness modesty and fundamental adherence to core principles hes been raised to value and live by. The actor undercuts any potential sanctimoniousness with a dry humor and reserve of intelligence that makes him very good company indeed. Read more Three-Time Tony Winner Mark Rylance Nabs Lead in Steven Spielbergs The BFG Rylance one of the greatest of contemporary stage actors has to date had only an intermittent screen career but Bridge of Spies suggests that could be about to change. He brings fascination and very very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland even invisible as possible. The entire cast is engaging down the line.

Its no small feat turning a shyster and an enemy spy into national heroes but thats the unique achievement of Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies."" If Jimmy Stewart were alive today the director surely would have asked him to play James Donovan a noble New York insurance lawyer roped into providing an alleged Soviet agent with pro-bono legal representation who later goes on to broker his exchange for two Americans held captive by Commies. Failing that hed done one better and cast honorary Boy Scout and all-around good guy Tom Hanks in the role transforming a potential indictment of patriotic hypocrisy and Cold War subterfuge into a riveting feel-good time for the whole family (two instances of the ""F-word"" notwithstanding) putting it on track to top ""War Horse."" Spielberg may as well have gone full ""R"" with this deliciously shady spy-swap plot as the richly re-created period drama -- which benefits from a crackling Coen brothers script polish -- boasts more courtroom time than it does actual cloak-and-dagger intrigue (in one scene Hanks runny-nose hero literally has his cloak stolen off his back by East German street thugs). While the helmers mythmaking approach makes for great Capra-esque entertainment younger audiences may find it terribly old-fashioned -- and theyd be right to think so although Spielberg would be the first to admit it was his intention to play things classical resolutely shooting on celluloid while blending aspects of a tony legal thriller with a hat-tip tribute to the rich expressionistic look of 1940s film noir. In Donovan Hanks finds one of the chewiest late-career roles he could possibly hope for playing the New York attorney with fists balled and belly slightly paunched simultaneously non-threatening and ready for a fight. Called into the office of his good-old-boy boss (Alan Alda) he has no choice to take a case that he recognizes will surely make him unpopular defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance a remarkable theater actor with a relatively short screen CV) whom the FBI have arrested and charged as a Russian spy. Set in 1957 ""Bridge of Spies"" evokes the era as one of mounting thermonuclear hysteria and alarming groupthink in which a lawyer who advocates for a Soviet agent can be seen as a traitor to his own country (potentially worse than Abel who wasnt American to begin with). ""Everyone will hate me but at least Ill lose"" he jokes though even his family -- his meatloaf-making wife (Amy Ryan) plus three flag-pledging kiddos who practice Bert the Turtles ""Duck and Cover"" drills in class -- question his loyalties. Because this is Hanks were dealing with audiences know what to expect though the revelation here is Rylance (an actor Spielberg also cast as his forthcoming BFG) who appears utterly transformed -- to the few who recognize his typically charismatic screen presence -- into a balding Eeyore-like gray moth of a man. Though there can be no doubt Abel is a spy the film prefers to depict him as a relatively innocuous painter earning from us a sympathy that no American citizen would have felt at the time. This is an essential strategy in all that follows as ""Bridge of Spies"" depends on our believing that Donovan and Abel are the most noble men in the film both committed to their respective ideals in Donovans case ""what makes us Americans"" (the Constitution) and in Abels doing whatever hes told to undermine it. If the basic narrative of ""Bridge of Spies"" were to take place today and a foreign agent were arrested in New York the poor sap -- whod surely be labeled a ""terrorist"" rather than a ""spy"" -- would be shipped off to some torture-friendly detainment facility never to be heard from again not assigned a lawyer of Donovans caliber. But Spielberg has no room for such cynicism recasting the Coens neo-nihilist distrust of the system as comedy (they reworked ""Suite francaise"" co-writer Matt Charmans script and while he was the one to unearth this terrific true story the siblings fingerprints are all over its telling). Here profoundly disturbing revelations about how America operates are played for a chuckle as when the judge for the case (Dakin Matthews) denies Donovans request for due process adding that he hopes his client is found guilty as swiftly as possible. Simultaneous with all of Donovans legal dealings another spy story unfolds as the CIA recruits an elite group of pilots to ""drive"" high-altitude camera-equipped U-2 planes over Soviet airspace. As ""Bridge of Spies"" repeatedly -- and rather eloquently -- reminds the Cold War was one of information not necessarily weaponry and in these exciting if somewhat clunkily integrated scenes we see how America fought for an edge in this intelligence battle. We also meet lantern-jawed Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who will be shot down in the films most dynamic sequence -- a rare taste of action amid so many slick wheeler-dealer proceedings. As it turns out insurance-savvy Donovan was right to plead that the judge spare Abels life as the Soviet spy now gives America a bargaining chip to trade for Powers return -- a responsibility that falls to Donovan after Hoffman the CIA stooge (Scott Shepherd) whod strong-armed him earlier returns to beg his assistance. Given the political sensitivities between the two atomic-trigger-happy nations the Agency insists that Donovan make the deal as a private citizen with no ties to the U.S. government which suits the film just fine as it gives Hanks every opportunity to go rogue. The CIA is only interested in Powers but Donovan -- who tells his family that hes going salmon fishing in England -- has decided that he wont settle for less than two freed Americans He plans to bargain for the release of a second prisoner as well Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) an American economics student who managed to get himself caught on the wrong side of the newly erected Berlin Wall. Pryor complicates things not only for the deal but for the script as well though a sappy re-enactment of his arrest does provide Spielberg with the chance to show the construction of the landmark that later came to signify the Iron Curtain. A scene in which Donovan watches East German escapees gunned down while trying to scale the wall later echoed by fence-climbing children back home in New York goes a touch too far the sentimental girl-in-red indulgence the director allows himself here. Otherwise Spielberg plays much of what unfolds in the films overseas second-act for absurdist humor With the exception of Sebastian Kochs enigmatic East German lawyer the Krauts are all played by odd-looking character actors with silly accents -- although to be fair the crew-cut G-Men arent especially nuanced either. The movie slyly manages to have it both ways criticizing the sort of blind American boosterism of the era while indulging in cheap xenophobic barbs as when Donovan criticizes newly christened countries the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for choosing names that are far too long evidently forgetting the mouthful from which he hails. Spielberg knows where to draw the line however maintaining a measure of hindsight-enhanced criticism amid his Hollywood fantasy (the CIAs willingness to sacrifice Pryor seems especially damning in an otherwise generally Pollyanna-like portrayal). But its hard to object when the artifice is pitched at such a high level an illusion spun amid top-level contributions from a core team of first-time collaborators that includes sets by Adam Stockhausen (the production designer responsible for building ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") Hanks wardrobe of Atticus Finch-worthy suits from ""Capote"" costumer Kasia Walicka-Maimone and a duly patriotic score from Thomas Newman. Still where would he be without longtime d.p. Janusz Kaminski who does wonders here with shadows while building up Hanks heroism from unexpected angles. One shot in particular in which a paranoid Donovan crouches behind a parked car in the rain feels every bit as iconic as ""The Third Mans"" reveal of the thought-late Harry Lime standing in a Vienna doorway. And the high-angle climax could be something out of a nouveau Western as Hanks saunters out onto the snow-covered Glienicke Bridge -- the hand-off spot that lends the film its name -- and brokers the deal in person. If this finale seems to lack something in suspense it compensates in poignance. Over the course of the previous two-plus-hours both Donovan and audiences have grown close to the uncrackable Soviet agent being returned to his bosses. We care more about his fate than we do either of the Americans coming home which just goes to show that Hanks has done his job.

TheOtherThirdWorld says February 8 2016 at 902 am The final scene Mr. Debruge is about Donovan caring about all the people involved... and the Constitution of the United States. If youd watched the movie youd know ""Standing Man"" Donovan by standing square in the face of the CIA the Secretary of State the Supreme Court the KGB and East Germany... risked his reputation and his life to insure that both Americans came home... and that the Russian was returned home safely. Its called COURAGE Pete. Look it up. Reply K. Kaprow says January 26 2016 at 416 pm Gushing musical score nauseating and predictable Spielbergisms the bland American Everyman hero...this film was everything I expected and less. Reply Brian Kitchen says January 16 2016 at 526 pm The street thugs who stole the cloak were Russian agents. That is how the Russian KGB director knows what store he bought it at. They were trying to get any papers that he might have forgotten to remove from his cloak in his threatened state. Reply A Thomas says February 29 2016 at 725 am I thought the Russian KGB director may have had someone in NY watching every move Hanks character made. Speaking German I could at least tell that the thugs spoke with a native Berlin accent so my guess was that the Russians may have been watching him ever since he took on the case of their spy. But I could be wrong maybe youre right. Your assumption at least doesnt seem as far fetched as mine. Reply Scott Harrell says December 16 2015 at 1012 pm This review does a disservice to the movie the art of cinema and history. I found the film to be superb - masterful and nuanced. The ""look"" of the film the art direction the dialogue even the haircuts were period-accurate and took me back to a tense period of modern history that seems simultaneously very recent yet also long ago. Methinks one may have to have lived through that period to really get it (clearly the reviewer did not). The script direction cinematography and acting (especially Tom Hanks in perhaps his best performance) were all at a caliber that has become increasingly rare in movies today. Reply dorothy says December 5 2015 at 724 pm Gosh what a twit you are Mr. Debruge. Most of us visit movies for the immersion and totality of the whole. For those who have not seen this fine movie you surely gave away all the interesting bits just to nitpick. I found the underlying questions to be most provocative given the world today and well presented. I write this as someone born in 1952. Reply Amy Weber says November 6 2015 at 931 pm Surely I am not the only one who thourougly enjoyed and was so excited to see Sean Connery as Abel near the end of Bridge of Spies? Reply Elliott rothman says October 21 2015 at 509 pm The film began in 1957 but wasnt ""set"" in 1957. Ever hear of the ""bridge of sighs""? As to the various points of view about patriotism Ill continue to regard it as the last refuge of scoundrels. My memories of diving under my desk in grammar school when commanded to do so by the ""teacher"" suggests to me that the scoundrels were firmly in charge during the Cold War - on both sides. Have things improved? Reply Ben says October 19 2015 at 502 am In the ""Filed Under"" string below the article it would seem ""Amy Adams"" should have been ""Amy Ryan"" eh? Reply Steven Snyder says October 18 2015 at 637 pm Why does the reviewer feel the need to call the attorney a ""shyster""? The Tom Hanks character is not depicted as doing anything dishonorable. Instead he is acting as we hope all attorneys will act Zealously and honestly representing a client regardless of the attorneys own feelings towards that client. Moreover the word has anti-semitc overtones. ""Shyster"" may have nothing to do with Shylock but we have seen too many writers use ""shyster"" to demean both Jews and attorneys. Reply Cheri says October 19 2015 at 158 pm Thank you for pointing this out. I was offended by the reviewers use of that word. Reply TheOtherThirdWorld says February 8 2016 at 917 am Peter Debruge uses ""shyster"" as anyone uses a buzzword... to hide from reality. He also uses ""enemy spy"" in the same context that we once used the word ""blood thirsty savage"" and today ""terrorist."" It allows him to despise a person he knows nothing about and protects him from the responsibility of finding out. Ann Medlock says November 15 2015 at 1022 pm Hear hear. I fear the reviewer is too clever by half and not nearly well enough versed in the English language nor in history. I saw ""shyster"" and thought perhaps he was writing English as a second language. Jay Justicee says October 18 2015 at 404 pm For the reviewer It takes an idiot to call this attorney a shyster. Reply NCSU68Grad says October 17 2015 at 728 pm Saw it tonight. As a 70 YO who went through the bomb ""stop and drop"" drills and had plans for bomb shelters handed out at the State Fair....along with a list of food and staples and essentials perhaps the realism and the attention to detail are lost on those that did not live through it. Remember Nikita Khrushchev live on our little Bamp;W TV pulling off his shoe and banging it. Ambassador Stevenson looked like he was shot at and missed. One comment on the technical aspects of the movie....The U-2 Plane scene was so ""lame"" that it was embarrassing. There were better special effects in Star Wars III. There was also a faux pas....the opening scenes are 1957 but there was a 1958 Green and White Chevrolet Biscayne in the movie. OK it COULD have been in the fall....but it was a bit tacky. They used a 1957 Chevy later on.....in the 60s swap scenes. Should have ""swapped"" them for believeability. The Government WOULD have purchased the Biscaynes. As to the story line and plot and Tom Hanks and others.....it was superb. There was NO politicizing....so Dem Repub Independent and even Atheist could enjoy it. As we were exiting the theater there was a ""pollster"" asking folks what they remembered and thought.....and IF they remembered the ""Product Placements. Coke (the drink) was prominent in one scene. Interestingly the use of cigarettes was greatly downplayed. Abel lit up once....and the German Street gang (straight out of Grease) where heavy smokers. The main characters PROBABLY would have been heavy puffers. I give it a 10....out of 10. Came away curious about the accuracy and also felt that it was something that I would want my grown children to see....although they probably could NOT imagine what their parents went through in the 50s and 60s. The Cuban Missile Crisis was harrowing....as was JFKs death. Reply Marc Schneider says October 16 2015 at 1228 pm I was going to comment about what seemed to me to be the reviewers somewhat hyperbolic cynicism about the American system. After all Abel did get a lot more due process than was typical in the Soviet Union and he was in fact guilty. I was going to do that until I read the silly bullshit from the right-wing nutjob patrol that thinks anyone that disagrees with them is a terrorist. Bernie Sanders is not a communist not even close to being a communist. If you had any idea of the difference between a socialist (which Im not even sure he is) and a communist you would understand that. In fact Stalin turned on the socialists because they were not communists. Of course its pointless to expect right-wingers to actually know something. Its amazing to me that these so-called patriots have no idea what the United States is supposed to stand for-other than apparently having a lot of cool weapons that can kill a lot of people.

Reply tlsnyder42 says October 14 2015 at 1044 am The movie shows the commies shooting down citizens trying to escape into West Berlin. This is what the Soviet spy in the movie gives his loyalty to. Someone in the movies says hes just doing his job. Yeah right? Like the Nazi stormtroopers carrying out Hitlers orders to murder six million Jews? Reply Dr. James J. Stewart says October 13 2015 at 1123 am Peter DeBruge is surely not an American patriot. Thats how much times have changed since I spent 32 years in US military uniform during the Cold War to include combat. Communism stinks no matter what Bernie Sanders says. Reply tlsnyder42 says October 14 2015 at 1121 am Contrary to what Peter says the Berlin Wall scenes give some needed perspective in the movie because until then the movie seems like an excuse for communist tyranny. Of course Spielberg and his friends keep giving tons of money to the Anti-American leftist radicals liars tyrants and murderers now leading the Democratic Party. Reply jim23414 says October 12 2015 at 1105 pm In case you care I stopped reading when you said full ""R"". Thats not the line. Either quote the line or use your own words. Dont change the line. You didnt write it you dont get to change it. Reply Paridell says October 25 2015 at 142 am I didnt stop reading at ""full R"" if only because I dont know the reference. Could you let me in on it? I saw the film today and I thought it was great. I remember those days and I thought it brought them out very well. My son born 1990 also thought it was excellent. Reply Mark Rubin says October 6 2015 at 611 am Not sure what to make of the comment about the Berlin wall and the theatric comparison mentioned to some NYC kid climbing a fence. Lets be clear about the intended purposes. These structures are typically used to demark property borders so that those that are not supposed to be within the safety of the defined perimeter do not try to enter uninvited. Those that rightfully reside inside are free to come and go as they like. This includes the wall that Israel is building to keep out those that would see it fine to blow themselves up and take innocent lives with them or perhaps a wall at the southern border of the US to keep out a flood of people who do not seem to think they need to obey immigration laws. Contrast this with a wall like in E Berlin. This was not constructed to keep others out but to keep those inside the wall locked in with no freedom prisoners within their own countries who would be shot if they tried to leave. Call it a fence or a wall it is the purpose that is the distinction and so many turn a clear distinction of good and evil into a murky muddy mess. Maybe it is Varietys review and not Spielbergs doing...I do not know...but to compare the Belin Wall to a NYC kid climbing a fence? Cmon. Reply Patrick says October 6 2015 at 824 am It is called contrast. Obviously he did not intend to mean that they are the same. It is hard to evaluate art through the eyes of right wing ideology. Reply Edgar Charles says October 5 2015 at 501 pm what an amazing film. cant wait to see this film. no one brings this type of story to the screen but spielberg. Reply cadavra says October 5 2015 at 1259 pm Having seen Rylance on stage several times Im thrilled to hear he finally has a film role worthy of his enormous talents. Reply paulchinchilla says October 5 2015 at 1128 am Does Variety review films or just provide a rundown of major plot points from beginning to end thus spoiling the film for everyone who isnt privileged enough to attend Festival Screenings? Reply davidkachel says October 5 2015 at 856 am The movie may be good but the review was too boring to continue reading. Reply Hal Three says October 5 2015 at 1030 am Next time well be sure and just text you a thumbs up or down kid. Sorry to confuse you with like so many big words.. Reply tlsnyder42 says October 14 2015 at 1058 am Well the reviewer does give away a lot of the movies plot points. Boredom has nothing to do with big words or short words. If David believes the review was too boring thats a valid opinion that tells us nothing about how intelligent David is or is not. SpyFan says October 5 2015 at 745 am ""If the basic narrative of ""Bridge of Spies"" were to take place today and a foreign agent were arrested in New York City the poor sap -- whod surely be labeled a ""terrorist"" rather than a ""spy"" -- would be shipped off to some torture-friendly detainment facility never to be heard from again not assigned a lawyer of Donovans caliber."" Does the reviewer perhaps remember the collection of 10 Russian illegals (as opposed to spies operating under diplomatic immunity) captured in New York circa 2010? They were all sent home rather quickly in a prisoner exchange. The most photogenic Anna Chapman went on to become a model and TV host. Try to moderate your reflexive anti-Americanism. I know its hard for you Hollywood related types. Reply Patrick says October 6 2015 at 827 am People who supported the war crimes committed against terrorism suspects are the real anti Americans. The Constitution is what makes us Americans. Reply Richard says October 18 2015 at 953 pm ""The Constitutution is what makes us Americans."" Tell that please to the political people that Steven Spielberg supports (i.e. the President and his minions). tlsnyder42 says October 14 2015 at 1100 am Foreign terrorists who purposely bomb civilian areas are war criminals not soldiers or even spies of from a recognized nation. They have information that may stop other terrorist acts. Barbara Moore says October 5 2015 at 643 am ""...which benefits from a crackling Coen brothers script polish..."" I have not seen the movie or read the screenplay(s) so Im making no judgement whatsoever on either but this has always been a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Im just curious Mr. Debruge did you read the original script or scripts? If not how do you know it benefited from the polish? I imagine that one sentence would be incredibly painful for the original writer/writers to read. How do you know the original script wasnt better? In fact if you didnt read any of the scripts how do you know any of them were crackling or not? Film critics who mention the script at all should be required to actually read the scripts. Case in point arguably the most memorable scene in Taxi Driver (which won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay) is the Are you talking to me..."" scene. Not in the script. An ad-lib moment. Can we please stop judging a script based on the film that was made from it? Reply Russ Starrett says October 5 2015 at 933 am I agree completely with Spyfan. That was an absurd shallow know-nothing statement by apparent absurd shallow know-nothing. This review totally turned me away from seeing this movie. Im sure in Hollywood the feeling is that the Russians were as harmless then as Islamic terrorists are today. A figment of the right wing imagination. I also caught the moral equivalency as well. If you want to see great cold war fiction watch ""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"". Reply tlsnyder42 says October 14 2015 at 1107 am I dont think the Geneva conventions apply to terrorists who arent agents of a nation state. Patrick says October 6 2015 at 830 am No one ever said the Soviets or Islamic terrorists were harmless. Only a know nothing would believe people actually believe that. Real Americans believe in the constitution and the Geneva conventions. Ken says October 5 2015 at 831 am Paul Schraders script for ""Taxi Driver"" did not win an Academy Award. In fact it wasnt even nominated. Reply Bill B. says October 5 2015 at 955 am Seems like everyone here has some sort of complaint. Not sure its something that I will run out to see but it sounds like hes made a good film. JE Vizzusi says October 5 2015 at 100 am OMG It would be nice to never compare anything to ""The Third Man"" A 2015 FIlm Noir attempt is implausible Reply babette says October 5 2015 at 612 am I hate film reviews. The reviewer never knows when to shut up and not give something away. I will see the film if it interests me not if some stranger saw it and liked it or not.

Gifts of civility small and large mark Steven Spielbergs latest film a deeply satisfying Cold War spy thriller that feels more subdued than usual for the director--even more so than 2012s philosophical Lincoln--but one that shapes up expertly into a John Le Carre-style nail-biter. In a knockout near-wordless intro a long-faced canvas painter (Mark Rylance magnetic) finishes an oil in his 1957 Brooklyn apartment makes his way to the park picks up a secret nickel under a bench containing a tiny folded document and eventually gets nabbed by feds on his tail. Hes Rudolf Abel the real-life Soviet spy charged with espionage. But the decent often feisty man at the films center is James Donovan (Tom Hanks) the lawyer who at great risk to his family defended Abels life as a matter of due process and integrity. One could be forgiven for finding this early stretch a touch Costnerian Apart from cinematographer Janusz Kaminskis blooming windows it doesnt quite feel like a Spielberg film until a burning American spy plane plunges past its parachuting pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Hes about to become a Russian prisoner and a pawn in a secret trade that the government hopes Donovan will broker in a wintry Berlin split by the Wall Abel for Powers. The verbal gamesmanship brings on a new energized movie beginning with Hankss charming Donovan slightly amused in his Irish crankiness even as his fancy overcoat is stolen by German teens (""You know--spy stuff"" is his explanation for the missing garment). Hanks has never seemed more like a modern Jimmy Stewart drink in hand just looking to get home to his bed as the script leans into its cavalcade of slightly bizarre negotiations with Eastern European goons. (The signature of the Coen brothers who did rewrites is hard to miss.) Bridge of Spies does end up on a bridge of spies but never mind its more literal moments Getting to its humane climax of coolheaded diplomacy is paradoxically Spielbergs most wily and adult journey since Catch Me If You Can.

Steven Spielbergs film about cold war intrigue the capture of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Able and the downing of U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is a vivid history lesson and an absorbing drama. The degree that the film captures your interest is remarkable considering that the outcome is not a mystery. I believe that the films success is three fold. First the exceptional screenplay written by Matt Chapman and the Coen brothers. Second by the acting chops of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Mr. Rylance is particularly brilliant in his understated performance of Able. Third the films director Steven Spielberg continues in his ability to produce a tightly acted riveting drama.There are additional stories the negotiated release of American student Frederic Pryor of which I was unaware the interesting conflict between the East Germans and their Soviet masters and the treatment of James Donovan after his initial defense of Able. The backstory of Donovans defense of Able and the sad state of the American justice system at that time is particularly riveting. We had just been through the McCarthy era in the fiftys and vestiges of its impact are still apparent in the films unwinding.Of particular interest to New Yorkers would be the location filming that was done in Brooklyn and Queens. With few exceptions the subway trains running during Ables flight from the FBI the accuracy was excellent.   The street settings were reminiscent of the Coen brothers "" Inside LLewyn Davis"" . I was fortunate to have been passing through the Village when that film was being shot and seeing all the vintage cars and extras brought back memories of being a student at NYU.If you havent seen Bridge of Spies see it. The old saw "" those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it."" is very true. During this election year a great many of the candidates are prying on peoples primitive fears with hateful invective half truths and outright lies. Let the buyer beware.

This true-life tale of espionage and international intrigue plays intelligently and suspensefully until Spielberg gives in to mawkishness As a film that uses history to tell us something about our present-day circumstances Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"" which premiered Sunday night at the New York Film Festival operates most successfully in its first half when the director (working from a based-on-true-events screenplay by Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen) equates anti-Soviet hysteria during the 1950s with the recent War on Terror tracking citizens willingness to start ignoring the Constitution once theyve been sufficiently panicked. Its 1957 and the Cold War is at its chilliest when successful insurance lawyer (and onetime Nuremberg prosecutor) James Donovan played by Tom Hanks is assigned to defend suspected Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (played by Tony winner Mark Rylance). The evidence against Abel is damning but the government wants to show the world that even its enemies get the right to a well-represented day in court. This despite the fact that Donovan is given insufficient time to prepare and his concerns about the legality of the warrants used against Abel are dismissed by Judge Myers (Dakin Matthews). See Video Tom Hanks Puts Himself at the Center of the Cold War in New Bridge of Spies Trailer The only leeway that Donovan gets in the entire case in fact is when he visits Myers at his home to plead that Abel not be given the death penalty -- partially as a humanitarian gesture but also in case the United States might ever need a prisoner to swap with the U.S.S.R. That opportunity soon presents itself when U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell ""Whiplash"") is shot down on a reconnaissance mission and soon Donovan finds himself once again pressed into service; the CIA sends him to East Berlin to negotiate a swap although officially the government pretends to know nothing of this mission. Its up to Donovan to use all his lawyerly skills to negotiate the trade of Abel for not just Powers but also Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers ""The Bay"") an American graduate student who has found himself on the wrong side of the newly constructed Berlin Wall. See Video Tom Hanks Tells Stephen Colbert Idea for Greatest Movie Never Made The segment of the film dealing with Donovans legal defense of Abel -- against the wishes of both his firm and his family he took his objections to those search warrants all the way to the Supreme Court -- makes for a powerful parable about the era of Snowden and Guantanamo where ""but"" and ""except for"" started creeping their way into discussions about civil liberties and right to trial. (Donovans testimony to SCOTUS even mentions that Abels status exists in a gray area since hes neither a criminal nor a captured military combatant.) This portion of the story turns out to be the first and most successful of the three movies unfolding in ""Bridge of Spies."" Once Donovan goes to Europe to make the swap the plot downshifts into fairly standard cloak-and-dagger stuff which is entertaining but not nearly as provocative as what came before it. And then as the capper we get Spielberg (abetted by the screenplay and another unsubtle Thomas Newman score) unable to resist hitting the same nail on the head three or four times to make sure that everyone in the back row got the message. For instance Once the trade has been set up and everyone is waiting to see if the Soviets will hold up their end of the bargain Abel tells Donovan that he has sent him a gift. Donovan replies ""I wish I had thought to give you something."" At this moment another director might cut to a look between the two that would convey volumes or maybe just have Abel say something along the lines of ""Were even."" But no the audience cant be trusted here to make the connection Abel has to actually say that what Donovan has done for him was in fact already a gift. And then he says it again. Meanwhile the movie spends time setting up situations like an apparent romance between Donovans daughter (Eve Hewson ""The Knick"") and his young associate (played by Billy Magnussen) before completely jettisoning them to a cutting-room floor somewhere. Also Read Outfest to Honor Tom Hanks Lisa Cholodenko With 2015 Legacy Awards If you can overlook the three or four endings of ""Bridge of Spies"" each more overdone than the last theres a lot to like here starting with a masterful wordless sequence in which Abel is pursued by federal agents throughout New York City. Theres a great opening shot of Abel; the camera pulls out and shows us its his reflection in a mirror before pulling further away to show Abel sitting between a mirror and a self-portrait he is painting letting us know that this character is always going to remain something of an enigma. Janusz Kaminskis photography feels true to the period without ever indulging in the flashy pizzazz weve come to associate with 1950s-themed diners and he saves the showy moves -- re-creating propaganda-film camera set-ups during Powers public show trial putting on a fish-eye lens when Donovan feels that everyone in his neighborhood is coming out against him -- for the right moments without ever overdoing it. See Video Steven Spielberg Likens Back to the Future to Taste of Buttered Popcorn in Back in Time Trailer Donovan is a classic Hanks role upright intelligent compassionate armed with a sense of humor. Its not revelatory work by any means but its a solid turn from an exceedingly capable leading man. Casting director Ellen Lewis and her team have assembled an array of Cold War faces pinched and jowly when necessary that give the film the feeling of the era. ""Bridge of Spies"" operates best when it remembers that those bridges run both ways and that both the United States and the Soviet Union were playing the exact same game on different sides. Its plea for common sense and equanimity in international relations is important to hear but like all messages it lands better when delivered with a lighter touch.

The rest is more familiar. But first theres the engrossing suspense of a nearly wordless prologue in which poker-faced Soviet agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) goes about his business in late fifties Brooklyn and buries his intel just as the FBI closes in. While the rousing tale of espionage has plenty of appealingly old-fashioned qualities theres no doubting Spielbergs ability to devise visually arresting moments that speak to the movies themes far better than its story. The gentle Abels apprehension by anonymous authorities suggests an ambiguous sense of right and wrong -- a conceit quickly undone moments later by the first shot of Tom Hanks face. Veering from complex layered storytelling to routine exposition ""Bridge of Spies"" is a neat encapsulation of Americas great commercial director pushing for sophistication while sticking to familiar beats. The ensuing plot relegates Abel to a supporting role as it focuses on Hanks as good-natured attorney James Donovan whos tasked with defending Abel in an obvious lost cause. Vilified by the media for rescuing a Communist he ultimately gets swept up in a daring attempt to swap the prisoner for two Americans in Soviet custody. Out of his league but firmly committed to seeing things through Donovans journey falls into the bucket of Spielbergian tales involving nearly flawless men acting for the good of their country and family. READ MORE Anne Thompson on Bridge of Spies But its better than a lot of them. Unlike ""Munich"" or ""Amistad"" the new movie benefits from an ebullient script originally written by playwright Matt Charman and punched up by Joel and Ethan Coen. Just as Tony Kushner brought an air of intellectual gravitas to ""Lincoln"" the Coens introduce a surprising amount of levity to ""Bridge of Spies"" a story that doesnt easily lend itself to wit. Yet Donovans smarmy reactions to the bureaucratic challenges placed in front of him lead to constant amusing exchanges. Tasked with defending Abel in a case for which even the judge has already determined the outcome he sighs ""Everyone will hate me but at least Ill lose."" Donovans resigned tone belies a mounting sense of commitment to saving the day and when the CIA asks him to go undercover in East Berlin to negotiate a swap Donovan barely hesitates. He has his practical reasons Defending Abel has put the lawyer and his family in the crosshairs of angry Americans. More than that Donovan simply does the right thing because he must -- even going beyond the call of duty and attempting to negotiate the release of a second prisoner. Such fierce commitment against daunting odds goes unquestioned throughout ""Bridge of Spies"" but Donovans patriotic sense of duty is so infectious that its easy to get swept up in his dangerous cause. Hanks tends to have that effect. Given the expectations for the role Hanks turns in a finely tuned jovial performance in a movie that barely gives much screen time to other characters (Amy Ryan as Donovans concerned wife barely registers as more than prop). Its Rylance however who stands out as the most potent ingredient His muted delivery speaks to a mounting sense of internal agendas that remain unexpressed throughout. It gets to the point where Donovan repeatedly asks the imprisoned man why hes not worried only to receive a cocked eyebrow and the soft refrain ""Would it help?"" Even as Abel keeps his cool however Spielberg keeps viewers on edge with a plot that keeps thickening until the very end. One dynamic sequence cross-cuts from Donovan addressing the Supreme Court about his client and a terrifying plane crash 70000 feet above Soviet territory. Thats where Air Force soldier Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) gets detained just in time for the Americans to negotiate a release. Meanwhile harmless American college student Frederic Pryor finds himself arrested in East Berlin a widely publicized incident that leads Donovan to demand a two-for-one trade despite the CIAs disinterest in Pryors case. As Donovan finds himself wandering East Berlin facing off against a series of dubious allies at various embassies Spielberg develops a compelling look at Germanys fragmented identity and its troubled American relationships through the lens of a single innocent observer. ""Is this an agreement or a conspiracy?"" hes asked by one German negotiator. While confident about his own motives Donovans never entirely sure. No matter how many twists it takes ""Bridge of Spies"" maintains a predictable visual polish thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski whose blue-hued street scenes and bright indoor lighting have been become as much Spielbergian touchstones as its themes. The score by Spielberg newcomer Thomas Newman apes the John Williams playbook of gentle piano and occasional trumpeting declarations. Its never subtle but even a smart movie about dueling agendas like ""Bridge of Spies"" winds up in some pretty obvious places. Eventually wrestling control of the situation from inept governmental forces Donovans efforts call to mind Tony Mendez the ambitious CIA operative played by Ben Affleck in ""Argo."" Both men non-fictional characters capable of sensational feats become vessels for celebratory tales of American heroism. Theyre selfless husbands and fathers tangled up in risky espionage and committed to a greater good thats barely questioned. Even so ""Bridge of Spies"" contains just a hint of subversiveness in its suggestion that the same people employing Donovan care less about morality than victory. Donovan isnt fighting the Soviets so much as the maintenance of the American way. His idealism fits a movie that could have been made at the same time as its period. Even the shades of darkness carry a slight antiquated quality. ""Bridge of Spies"" offers an easy access point for celebrating a genuine Cold War victory. Spielberg however makes that gamble surprisingly palatable. No other major American filmmaker provides such a welcoming embrace. Grade B ""Bridge of Spies"" premiered this weekend at the New York Film Festival. It opens nationwide on October 16.

With his sober but stirring Cold War suspense film Bridge of Spies Steven Spielberg continues his creative evolution from fatherless child to nervous father wondering (absent role models) if heas doing the right thing in the right way. His protagonist is James Donovan (Tom Hanks) a Brooklyn insurance lawyer tasked with defending a British-born Soviet citizen named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) against the charge of spying for the Soviets. We see in the first (masterly) sequence that Abel is indeed a spy (no mystery) but Donovan wants the court to regard the man not as a traitor to be executed but a foreign soldier doing his duty a and bravely refusing to give up information. In this most nebulous of conflicts in a world that could nonetheless end in a nuclear instant a figure like Abel would look mighty good strapped in the electric chair. But Donovan a though pilloried a stands tall. Related Stories Bridge of Spies Trailer Everyman Tom Hanks Prevents a Nuclear War The movie a written by Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen based on a true story a is explicitly a dramatization of personal integrity amid social madness. And Spielberg can be pretty explicit. But as Lincoln showed he has a grown-up passion for the subtle arts of negotiation and persuasion. Donovan embodies the idea that no matter how corrupt the system a principled talented individual can set right the most battered and bloody ship of state. Even the government that dislikes and publicly dissociates itself from him sends him on a secret mission trading Abel for a downed U-2 pilot (Austin Stowell) who disappointed his leaders by not committing suicide before capture. The abridge of spiesa is where the exchange will take place in a newly walled-off East Berlin. Is it worth saying again that I miss Hanks the impudent comedian and wish he werenat so often the standard-bearer for American decency? Okay Iave said it. Heas still impressive a he makes you feel Donovanas struggle to keep a clear head while stumbling (with a lousy cold) among shadowy antagonists in a frigid East Berlin a maze of doublespeak interrupted by machine-gun fire at poor souls scaling the wall. Spielberg evokes that free-floating malevolence superbly though he founders when shoehorning in the plight of an American student arrested as a spy. In the large cast Amy Ryan has disgracefully little to do as Donovanas wife but various dour agents are convincing and Mikhail Gorevoy has a deliciously evocative Peter Lorre timbre as a KGB mastermind. Itas Rylance who keeps Bridge of Spies standing. He gives a teeny witty fabulously non-emotive performance every line musical and slightly ironic a the irony being his forthright refusal to deceive in a world founded on lies. The poetic embodiment of fatalism he is Donovanas closest ally in terms of integrity but his opposite when it comes to slogging away on behalf of lost causes.
