Bruno Calvo/Picturehouse hide caption toggle caption Bruno Calvo/Picturehouse Director Olivier DahanGenre Fictionalized biopicRunning Time 140 minutes Turning the gorgeous willowy French actress Marion Cotillard into stooped arthritic Edith Piaf has to be the most striking uglification of an actress since Charlize Therons star turn in Monster. But its hardly this unconventional biopics only strong point. Piafs life on the streets of Paris in the 1920s and 30s turns out to have been at least as anguished as the tragic anthems she sang so vibrantly. Brought up in her grandmothers brothel singing for centimes on street corners winning international acclaim as a cabaret star only to die at 47 shes depicted as having been every bit as coarse tormented and difficult as she was talented. Olivier Dahan films her story in lush super-saturated colors leaping around in time with Cotillard lip-synching to classic Piaf recordings everywhere from the street to meticulously recreated nightclubs. The out-of-sequence storytelling is a tad confusing at first but the film gathers force as its leading lady goes into a tailspin idolized but unloved addicted to morphine and desperately ill -- une vie tres tragique en rose.

"La Vie en Rose | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; la-vie-en-rose ) La Vie en Rose (France/United Kingdom/Czech Republic 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli One has to wonder whether we are reaching the point of oversaturation with respect to bio-pics of famous singers. The landscape is dotted with them Ray Walk the Line Control Im Not There and so on. The field has become so crowded that Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan have embarked upon a parody of the genre called Walk Hard. Frances entry into the burgeoning genre is La Vie en Rose which is the latest feature to detail the life of icon Edith Piaf. The elements are all present a difficult childhood flashes of musical genius a rocket to stardom romanctic difficulties and drug addiction. Going into the film I admit to not having known much about Piaf who died three years before I was born. Nevertheless her story often feels overly familiar and I think the reason has a lot to do with its similarities to that of so many others. The film presents Piafs life via a broken chronology leaping back and forth across time without apparent rhyme or reason. The movie dips into nearly every phase of her life which lasted from 1915 until 1963 showing her in one scene as a dying woman who looks 20 years older than she is and in the next as a young girl during post-World War I France. La Vie en Roses blatant disregard of linear progression is similar in some ways to Todd Haynes approach to Bob Dylan in Im Not There but theres a key difference. Oliver Dahan may choose to present Piafs life in a fragmented fashion but everything is ultimately connected (and except for the childhood scenes there is a single actress playing the lead character). Haynes essentially made six short films and jumbled them together. The end result is more satisfying in La Vie en Rose although there are still difficulties becoming immersed in a storyline that jumps around so much especially when theres no clear purpose for presenting Piafs life in this fashion. The movie begins when Edith is a little girl. She is abandoned by her mother and father and left in the care of her grandmother who runs a brothel. Edith becomes beloved of all the whores who work there especially a needy young woman named Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner) who treats Edith as her own daughter. Eventually her father (Jean-Paul Rouve) returns for her and she joins him in his contortionist act. They leave the circus and strike out on their own starting a father-and-daughter street act. He bends his body into odd shapes and she sings - and what a voice she displays Some six years later Edith (Marion Cotillard) and her best friend MAmone (Sylvie Testud) are street singers. Thats when nightclub owner Louis LeplA(c)e (GA(c)rard Depardieu) discovers her. He signs her to a contact. After his murder her future is again in doubt but she is able to connect with those who can teach her singing techniques and its not long before shes on her way to international stardom. In the mid-1940s while in New York City Edith meets married boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) and they begin a passionate affair. She declares that he is her one true love and this is a sentiment she voices later in life long after his 1949 death in a plane crash. Following Cerdans demise Edith becomes increasingly devoted to her singing. She marries twice during the 1950s but the film spends little time with either husband. She becomes addicted to morphine and alcohol and repeated attempts to kick the habit fail. By the time shes in her late 40s and her health is failing she looks like an old woman. Those who go into La Vie en Rose knowing little about Piaf will get a crash course in her life although the fascinating World War II years are left out. (Was she a collaborator or a member of the French Resistance?) Theres also a lot of her music including both covers and original Piaf recordings. Her best known songs are all represented. As is often the case with music biopics your passion for the music may influence your love of the movie. Two things in La Vie en Rose are undeniably great the performance of lead actress Marion Cotillard and the work of the makeup department under the direction of Didier Lavergne. Both are deserving of Oscar nominations. In the entire field of potential Best Actresses few offer the kind of portrayal provided by Cotillard. This is no mere instance of mimicry. She inhabits the character bringing life and passion to the role. When we care about Piaf its because of Cotillards work not because of the haphazard approach of the screenplay. Although Cotillard has perfected Piafs mannerisms and exhibits flawless lip-synching theres more to her acting. She is given an able assist by the makeup artists whose efforts to age Piaf are without peer. This is one of those oh-so-rare instances when the old age makeup is completely convincing. It stands up to closeups. It does not look like a series of rubber applications held together by silly putty. From a strictly story-based perspective theres nothing special or remarkable about La Vie en Rose. However throwing Cotillard into the mix it becomes worthy of the investment of a viewers 140 minutes. In many ways Cotillard isnt just the glue that holds the film together - she is the film. This isnt the first time Piafs life has been brought to the screen and it probably wont be the last but Cotillard makes this particular version stand apart.

Comments La Vie en Rose 140 minutes Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard tears up all the available scenery in this overblown achronological biopic of French pop singer Edith Piaf. Whether sincere or cynical the movie is a near parody of the ""Je ne regrette rien""/""This is Mrs. Norman Maine"" school of female suffering and camp mortification the heroine grows up in grandmas brothel sings on the streets gets discovered by an entrepreneur (Gerard Depardieu no less) loses or gets snatched away from loved ones becomes dependent on drink and drugs. Director-cowriter Olivier Dahan lamentably leapfrogs past most of the German occupation when Piaf was a courageous member of the resistance. With Sylvie Testud and Emmanuelle Seigner.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""La Vie en Rose"" with Marion Cotillard Sylvie Testud Pascal Greggory Emmanuelle Seigner Jean-Paul Rouve Gerard Depardieu. Written and directed by Olivier Dahan. 140 minutes. Rated PG-13 for substance abuse sexual content brief nudity language and thematic elements. In French with English subtitles. The French singer Edith Piaf lived a life almost too melodramatic to believe; if it were a novel readers would arch their eyebrows. Born in an impoverished area of Paris to a cafe singer and a circus contortionist she spent much of her childhood in a brothel (run by her grandmother) and later lived on the streets until she was discovered at 20 by a nightclub owner. Her adult life would encompass both great fame and great tragedy illness drug addiction doomed love affairs and early death from cancer in 1963 at only 47. All this drama thoughtfully explored in Olivier Dahans ""La Vie en Rose"" may well remind Americans of Judy Garland with whom Piaf shared a distinctive voice (not pretty but raw and unforgettable) a way of emotionally connecting with an audience a turbulent life and a devoted following that continued long after her death. And like Garlands Piafs life has not been the subject of a major feature film until now. (The 1983 Claude Lelouch film ""Edith et Marcel"" focused entirely on Piafs romance with famed boxer Marcel Cerdan; likewise the 1974 French film ""Piaf"" told only of the singers early years. Garland has been played in television movies by Judy Davis and Andrea McArdle but to my knowledge her eventful life has not made it to the big screen.) You wonder why its taken so long for Piafs oh-so-cinematic story to arrive on-screen but Dahans film fortunately is worth the wait. Not a chronological biography but a tale that slips enticingly backward and forward in time its a rich tribute to the singer known as the ""Little Sparrow."" Marion Cotillard (""A Good Year"" ""Love Me If You Dare"") plays Piaf as a tiny slumped-over question mark of a woman who comes to life in front of a microphone. Its a tour-de-force performance in a colorful and sometimes mesmerizing film. This is a big story that requires a vast canvas and a confident hand and at times the film seems overwhelming; the sadness of Piafs life mirrors the melancholy quality of her singing and the hint of desperation we see in her smile. (The songs which include ""Non je ne regrette rien"" ""Milord"" and the title tune are all archival Piaf recordings expertly mimed by Cotillard.) Some of the scenes are unabashedly melodramatic such as when Ste. Theresa speaks to young Edith in a circus camp or a striking sequence near the end where Edith hearing tragic news staggers directly from her bedroom to a concert stage. This kind of heightened drama might not work in most movies but it suits its larger-than-life subject Dahans ""La Vie"" is the movie equivalent of a torch song. The metallic velvet of Piafs voice wraps around us softening and coloring the tragedies of her story. Cotillards Edith emerges as fragile yet determined a sad clown seeking the warmth of a spotlight. (At times she looks remarkably like Garland.) ""Youre playing with your life"" says a doctor concerned that an ailing Edith is determined to perform. ""So what?"" she replies with the mournful nonchalance of her songs. ""You have to play with something.""

Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu) and Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) star in La Vie en Rose. Photo Handout La Vie en Rose 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Great art its said comes from great suffering -- which may explain how Edith Piaf became Frances most beloved singer. Her tiny body hid a powerful voice which she unleashed with heart-wrenching emotions sparked by poverty tragedy illness and addiction. Piaf who died in 1963 may have predated music videos iPods and concerts beamed by satellite but in her day she was the real deal a singing dynamo whose gutsy imploring style was like Judy Garland and Janis Joplin rolled into one -- then multiplied. La Vie en Rose is the first film to depict the breadth of that life making the French-language film a sensation in its home country. But others may find Piaf -- and the movie -- an acquired taste. Compressing Piafs 47 years into 140 minutes director and co-writer Olivier Dahan had to make sweeping choices. One was to focus on her great suffering more than her great art. As a result the film suffers. La Vie en Rose is compelling but punishing -- an artful ordeal. The best way to process it may be as unintended camp rolling your eyes in amazement at its litany of misery and heaps of histrionics. Speaking of which ever notice how often Emmy- and Oscar-show clips feature actors crying and screaming? Such performances are widely considered a zenith -- subtlety be damned. La Vie en Rose is one long attention-grabber as star Marion Cotillard milks every melodramatic drop of Piafs life. Cotillard is arresting as she portrays Piaf -- from her sad-clown face to her volcanic temper -- and she maintains her emotional roil while masterfully lip-syncing to Piafs recordings. But even with an epic scope and strong attention to period details the film becomes a one-note wallow. If all Piaf did was suffer she wouldnt have had the will to survive it all. Apart from her hopeful affair with a boxer and the sustenance audiences gave her her life as seen here was relentlessly grim. And after two-plus hours of it viewers may feel theyve suffered enough to spark their own great art. Perhaps this film will play better on DVD when viewers can take breathers. Taken in one heavy dose this loving but misguided look at Frances cherished ""Little Sparrow"" bludgeons us emotionally. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Born into poverty she was discovered on the streets of 30s Paris singing for her supper precipitating a remarkable rise to fame and fortune. All that was missing in her life was love yet her romance with French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan was to be tragically short-lived. It was the making and the undoing of her the pain somehow lent her singing an even greater emotional intensity at the price of a punishing intake of drink and pills. She died in 1963 a mere husk of a woman old beyond her 47 years.String that lot together and youve got a showbiz story to rank with A Star Is Born for sheer all-out melodrama. With puzzling perversity however thats exactly what writer-director Dahan doesnt do. Instead he works his way through Piafs life like a pinball whizzing from bell to bumper. We get lots of fancy cuts and time transitions but the through-line of the character at the centre of it all is only just visible. Its a film which leaves you wanting more - a nice straightforward TV documentary perhaps - so that you can put the pieces of Piafs wildly excessive experiences back where they should be and discern just what made this woman tick.Maybe Dahan didnt want to do the standard showbiz saga - another Ray or Walk the Line for instance. But is there really so much shame in a biopic which you know actually tells you about its subject? Of course it is still possible to take a slightly off-track approach within the constraints of the sub-genre - the way Tim Burtons perception of Ed Wood as an authentic artist in his own mind at least gives that celluloid life a singularly heroic comedy - though more often than not studious artiness proves decidedly counter-productive. Admirers of Cole Porter probably still have nightmares about De-Lovely.In La Vie en Rose much creative energy seems to have been expended on figuring out how to tell the story in as flash a manner as possible without quite marking out Piafs troubled essential self. Although leading lady Marion Cotillards rather taller than the super-mignonne four-foot-six Piaf she deserves plaudits for her dedication to getting the physical mannerisms just so although perhaps because the film never really gets under its subjects skin that effort is also only too obvious. Yes she sings Je ne regrette rien and yes we cry. Yet the tears are for the song and the memory of a remarkable artist. Theyre very little to do with this strenuously crafted yet ultimately bungled 140 minutes of celluloid.

Marion Cotillard is outstanding as Piaf and if she does not get an Oscar for this performance then there is no justice. The much criticised flashbacks were not that hard to follow and as I viewed it each provided a proegrssion of both the early years and the later ones. It should not be asking too much of an audience to stay with time sequence other than a purely linear one and if the reaction in the auditorium I attended at the end of the film is anything to go by the audience got it very well.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post For a woman whom filmmakers hoped to portray as a delicate songbird Edith Piaf sure spends a lot of ""La Vie en Rose"" swearing like a French sailor. This 140-minute biopic feels more like an ordeal than a celebration. Piafs life was a series of train wrecks occasionally interrupted by layovers at the popular biopic stations of Drunk Bereaved Addicted and Scorned. The trademark melancholy enriching her voice throughout a 25-year singing career came through experience not imagination. We get some of those songs including a heartbreaking closing with the no-regrets classic ""Non Je ne Regrette Rien."" But we get a lot more of the backstage screeching seemingly countless episodes of the diminutive consumptive Piaf in a dressing room demanding more champagne more love or more father figures. She had one of the distinctive voices of the 20th century certainly but ""La Vie en Rose"" often gives more pain than pleasure. There are also astonishing omissions in such a sprawling epic. We get a glimpse of Ediths father in a World War I battle trench but the war scenes should have included Piafs apparently heroic efforts to help the French resistance in World War II - she posed for publicity photos with French prisoners of war that were then used to make fake passports for potential escapees. Because ""La Vie en Rose"" doesnt give us enough reasons to love the prickly Piaf such noble actions would have gone far. Director Olivier Dahan and co- screenwriter Isabelle Sobelman chose a disconcerting framework for Piafs alternately sordid and soaring tale. By the end we realize they may have intended it all as a deathbed confessional and flashback by Piaf who departed this life at age 47 in 1963. It might help for you to try that framework as your guide because the nonlinear action of ""La Vie en Rose"" hurtles wildly from 1963 to 1918 to 1935 and all stops in between with no apparent plan. Piaf wasnt born into a brothel but she was raised in one owned by her grandmother no less. Her mother fled her father went back and forth to the Great War and the circus. While one prostitute lies bleeding from an assault by a demented client the young Piaf goes temporarily blind from an infection - thats the kind of champagne-and-battery-acid lifestyle in which ""La Vie en Rose"" revels. Marian Cotillard takes on the role of the adult Edith lip-syncing to Piafs many recordings. She is first discovered singing on the street by a nightclub owner who if this is a French film must be played by Gerard Depardieu. Were supposed to admire Piaf because shes scrappy I guess but shes also a mean drunk and because shes drunk much of the time meanness dominates. She is elevated tossed aside elevated once again then finds the love of her life in a dapper French boxer who must die in a plane crash naturellement. These musicians. Considering Piaf Ray Charles Billie Holiday Johnny Cash Loretta Lynn and innumerable others its a wonder any songs got sung in the past hundred years. The final impression is of a two- hour montage. The film skims along like a sparrow and never dives deep into Piaf or the culture that created her. Francophiles may be smitten; for myself my ears felt quite raw and if not red then at least pink as a glass of rose. Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at mboothdenverpost.com.

"A complex portrait of a spellbinding singer - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A complex portrait of a spellbinding singer Marion Cotillard (right with Sylvie Testud) as Edith Piaf the urchin turned international star in ""La Vie en Rose."" (Bruno Calvo/Picturehouse) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 15 2007 Not too far into ""La Vie en Rose "" Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard ) enters a big New York recording studio and stands under a microphone. Her mouth opens and out flies a song. But its not the language in the tune you seize on. Its the language of her body. The woman stands with her legs apart and her hands on her hips. The face -- oh that face and its pallid skin red lips penciled eyebrows and unruly pageboy; she looks like Louise Brooks ghostly sister. Her face is a defiant aching mask. The year is 1959 four years before Piafs death from cancer and her expression suggests that theres an endless supply of ache-inducing material.If even half of Olivier Dahans robust film about Piafs life is true -- and lets face it much remains shrouded in myth and mystery -- its a wonder she could get dressed in the morning let alone forge a legendary singing career. But the movie exuberantly argues that her emotional aches and pains sustained her while the physical ones did her in. Her triumph was not simply over poverty bad genes and worse health. It was over a fickle cosmos too. Good luck came with a whole lot of bad.In this movies version of her life Edith is abandoned by her mother dumped at her grannys brothel raised by prostitutes separated from the hooker who painted little Ediths face like a clown but loved her like a doll and reunited with her abusive acrobat father. Young Edith goes blind until her sight is miraculously restored. She goes hungry until the club owner Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu ) discovers her busking on the Paris streets. He changes her name from Edith Giovanna Gassion to Edith Piaf and launches her career. But when hes found dead shes momentarily fingered as a suspect in the murder. Nary a word is mentioned of Piafs contributions to the French Resistance. Not tragic enough perhaps. In lieu of revolution the woman is slapped dragged shouted at nearly killed in a car crash dependent on morphine and spectacularly alcoholic. She loses friends including her butch buddy Momone  whos played by the wonderfully feline Sylvie Testud. But Piaf never wanted the show to stop. She loses family. And this is just a partial list.""La Vie en Rose"" comes wrapped in standard biopic packaging. It traces Piafs difficult rise from snot-nosed urchin to international superstar to palsied prematurely aged invalid complete with the obligatory star-conquers-world montage that includes close-ups of newspaper articles and copies of Match magazine flying off the presses. But the movie also spins like a wheel of misfortune around her life with dizzying almost impressionistic style. Even when the film stops oscillating to show Ediths blissful affair with the European middleweight Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins ) we suspect that bad news cant be too far off. They were both at the top of their careers and in 1983s bauble ""Edith et Marcel "" Claude Lelouch turned the lovers into one of his usual advertisements for having it all.Dahan uses the relationship to bring a moment of sanity to the film. Their amour wasnt fou. It was stabilizing for her the only calm she would ever really know. But her unraveling after its terrible demise produces the movies most ingeniously conceived piece of directing and production design wherein Ediths private agony seamlessly becomes a public spectacle. Better than almost any film about an entertainer Ive seen ""La Vie en Rose"" uses perceptive filmmaking as opposed to turgid exposition to explain its subjects psyche and to cleverly capture the spell she cast over audiences.Cotillard is spellbinding in her own right. Whether shes bounding mannishly up a flight of stairs learning how to sing in harmony with her body shuffling stooped and slow into a room or belting out a song completely drunk she turns Piaf into an intensely physical creature. But there is also incontrovertible sadness in her performance that gives the movie as much tortured soul as Jamie Foxx brought to ""Ray "" and as much melancholy as Joaquin Phoenix brought to ""Walk the Line ."" Sometimes even when the character is happy Cotillard whos only 31 keeps the singers face -- at 20 at 47 -- etched in the mask of tragedy.Its Piaf shes playing its true. but you wouldnt be mistaken for detecting in Cotillards rendition generous helpings of Judy Garland and Billie Holiday  women whose titanic talent was at war with their titanic unhappiness. Piaf was similar but on a smaller less self-destructive scale. By comparison shes an optimist. When she shuffles out in front of a packed concert hall to debut ""No je ne regrette rien "" three years before her death you know she means it. Shes singing her own ""My Way.""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

I especially loathe the self-destructive variety -- the kind that sentimentally impressionable people are always writing books and making movies about. You know who Im talking about -- the pill-poppers the drunks the would-be suicides all those Judys and Marilyns and Janis Joplins who emerge from their troubled childhoods into careers which revolve largely around making audiences wonder whether theyll actually show up for their performances. And if they do whether theyll give something other than a pathetic play for our sympathies -- which often enough involves our forgiving a sadly diminished voice or presence. This behavior is more than tiresome because there is no reason to believe theres a real link between their troubles and their talents. An off-stage battle with booze or drugs doesnt necessarily add depth or soul to their performances. On the contrary the history of show business is replete with sad stories that are redeemed by disciplined hard work. Plenty of stars refuse to trade on their hard-knock lives; they entertain us not by forcing us to wallow in their miseries but by causing us to forget our own for an hour or two. These reflections are occasioned by the arrival from France of La Vie En Rose a biopic about the gifted fragile and intermittently insane chanteuse Edith Piaf. Writer-director Olivier Dahan has given her story a sumptuous production -- with the look of an old-fashioned Hollywood musical sob story -- as well as a maddeningly fragmented structure. For reasons best known to Dahan he is always cutting from Piaf (played by Marion Cotillard) at the height of her relatively brief life (she was discovered in 1935 and died at age 47 in 1963) to this or that aspect of her dismal past -- her desertion by her mad mother the years she spent in her grandmothers brothel (no she was never a working girl though that seems to be the only indignity she was spared) her time as a street singer her rise to drug and drink addled international fame her inevitable decline and early death from cancer. Considerable attention is paid to the great love of her life Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) the middleweight boxing champion who died in airplane crash at the height of his fame and their love affair. But there is no rhyme or reason to this jumble -- except perhaps to stress Ediths endless self-victimization. This lack of narrative coherence naturally has the effect of distancing us from her story. I guess Dahan thinks it really only has one point -- her misery -- and that it doesnt make much difference what order he presents it. Cotillard appears to be as tiny as Piaf was (the singer was only 4 8"") and she acts neurasthenic as all get out but somehow her constantly victimized state works against our sympathetic response particularly since the films random structure often robs us of cause-effect connections. Sometime an inner voice threatens to burst forth ""Cmon Edie pull up your socks."" That pretty much leaves us with Cerdan radiating good nature and a casual pleasure in his own celebrity to make us feel good for a few moments and with Piafs uncanny voice still thrilling still moving in her classic songs. Its easy to make us believe that her sad life conditioned the rueful timbre she imparts to her music. Maybe too easy. Its possible that her natural vocal quality was the one lucky accident in her unlucky life. Which considering the fame money and sympathetic regard she collected was not -- considered from an objective viewpoint -- all that unfortunate. All right John Hard Heart has had his say. Maybe you will boo-hoo straight through this simple-minded cheaply sentimental and unrelievedly lugubrious movie. Me I made it to the long-delayed ending by shutting my eyes and ears to its dramatic passages and pretending it was a concert film. Sometimes my straying mind settled on the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Anita ODay who must surely have had their troubles but refused to wear them on their sleeves or on their bravely scatting tongues.

Plus Fido another reason to love zombies. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Bruno Calvo/Courtesy of Picturehouse) For those of us (a minority admittedly) who duck and cover at the first blast of Edith Piaf a French music-hall Ethel Merman without Mermans likable tackiness the new biopic La Vie en Rose makes the case for the little sparrows overemoting She learned to sing in public by singing for her supper. Olivier Dahans film depicts Piaf as an eternal abandoned waifraised in a brothel a circus with mean clowns and on the streets a performing monkey for a dissolute father and then a brutal pimp. Even sloppy drunk (often) even scared senseless she was loud urgent and on key. (Its not easy to blast on key as viewers of American Idol can attest.) We like her even at her most shrewish as a gamine terrible because we see the hell she came from andsince this is one of those back-and-forth-in-time biopicsthe hell in which shell end her days. Dahan uses Piafs song La Vie en Rosebasically a life in cloverironically and it turns up as an instrumental too. You cant get away from it. The tone is established early on when her father home from the war plucks 5-year-old Edith from under filthy sheets in her drunken mothers home and dumps her at the whorehouse of her icy grandmother. Just when Edith forms a primal bond with a maternal prostitute named Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner) her father reclaims her; the girl weeps and Titine shrieks shes going to kill herself. Its ghastly heartrending and as it turns out fakethere was no Titine. But then all biopics take liberties. The motif in any case is separation and loss. Nearly everyone of real significance in Piafs short life dies gets killed is carted off or isnt in the movie. Theres also a buried trauma thats unearthed in the end that has you going Huh? Pascal Greggory plays Louis Barrier the mentor who bullied Piaf into dredging up all those febrile emotions in her singing. So hes to blame. La Vie en Rose has some peculiar ellipses. For example the murder of her first patron (Gerard Depardieu bestowing his eminence on Edith and the film) comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere. The movie also leaps from 1940 to 1947 omitting the small episode of Germanys occupation of France at the height of Piafs stardom. She was quite the heroine to the Resistance but either the film was hacked down or the episode didnt fit in with Dahans view of Piaf as a basket case. Virtually all showbiz biopics have lapses and groaners but as Jamie Foxx Joaquin Phoenix Sissy Spacek and almost everyone except Kevin Spacey can affirm they pay off in awards for actors willing to hurl themselves into the volcano. Marion Cotillard is a hurler. Shes prettier than Piaf with round eyes that take up half her face but she doesnt get by on her looks. She knows you cant play Piaf halfway. As the diva in her prime she still gives you glimpses of the child famished for connection. Dahan devises a tour de force shot in which she rushes around her apartment in and out of fantasy as news of the fate of her prizefighting lover (Jean-Pierre Martins) sinks in. In Piafs old age (actually her mid-forties but she looks 80) she lurches forward a hunchback with stick arms those eyes burning with incomprehension. She lip-syncs convincingly to Piafs songs. Even when she overacts like mad she makes you think shes Piaf overacting like madthe little sparrow with the foghorn pipes. BACKSTORY For Billy Connolly the Scottish comedian and actor known for his verbose and at times vulgar stand-up routines playing a verbally challenged zombie was a departure from his normal roles. Connolly told the Calgary Herald This was one of the hardest acting jobs Ive ever done. Im not being facetious. It was hard because Im so used to wordsthey come in very handy. Especially when you want something. But I have to say years as a drunk did help me access the nonverbal part of my brain. Connolly was actually the second choice for the role of Fido; Peter Stormare had to drop out after landing a recurring part on Prison Break. You cant get away from zombies these days as vessels both of blood and pus and social and political satire. Shaun of the Dead Land of the Dead Showtimes Homecoming 28 Days Later 28 Weeks Later You say Enough zombies already? No please make room for Fido. A shotgun wedding of George Romero and SCTV its madly funnya treat for moviegoers who dont mind gnawed-off limbs with their high jinks. The title character (played by the marvelous Scottish actor and comedian Billy Connolly) is a domesticated zombie who becomes a pet to a boy named Timmy (KSun Ray)not incidentally the name of the kid in Lassie. This Lassie walks on two legs makes goo-goo eyes at Mom and when his containment collar malfunctions crunches into human flesh. But he has a sweet soul. Fido takes place after a bloody conflict between the living and the undeadthe latter brought under control by a military-industrial outfit that now calls the shots civil liberties be damned. Most suburbanites seem pleased with the arrangement though. The collared (and hence neutered) zombies make fine groundskeepers. The serene Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson) has a tall miniskirted number named Tammy (Sonja Bennett) who might have other chores. Timmys mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) needs to keep up with the Joneses and get a zombie too despite the squeamishness of her husband (Dylan Baker) who has never gotten over having to blow away his own father. (The elderly who can at any moment drop undead are suspect even in good health.) 1 2 Next Share this story...

Every once in a long while an actor plays the part of a famous person so convincingly we forget which one we are watching. Marion Cotillard gives that kind of career-making performance as fabled French chanteuse Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose. She is so marvelously in tune with her subject that we forget she is lip-syncing to Piafs music. Though melodramatic and messy in its narrative structure the film is mesmerizing almost completely the result of Cotillards performance. The singer was given the nickname ""La Mome Piaf"" or ""the little sparrow"" by Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu) who hired Piaf then a street performer for her first gig. We watch her tragic life unfold to the accompaniment of her songs. Unfortunately the shifts back and forth in time obfuscate rather than illuminate her personal history. Writer/director Olivier Dahan deserves credit for trying for a more impressionistic style than the standard biopic. But he lacks a deft touch focusing alternately on Piafs final drug-addled days her exhilarating rise to fame and her quasi-Dickensian childhood. Piaf was left by an alcoholic mother and raised by her circus performer father and grandmother the madam of a brothel. A kindly prostitute treated her as if she were her own child and we are led to understand that Edith went through a wrenching separation when her father took her to live with him. Its one of several plot points that feels important then trails off. Though her heyday as ""the soul of Paris"" is the most enjoyable part of the film her devastatingly lonely final years are the most haunting. She was 47 when she died ravaged by ill health and a morphine addiction. It is emotionally draining to watch the transition from scrappy girl to fun-loving toast of the town to addict in a wheelchair. Theres a riveting tale within this awkward litany of pivotal moments. Still despite the films uneven nature Cotillards extraordinary performance is worth experiencing. Share this story Digg del.icio.us Newsvine Reddit FacebookWhats this?

"Vie en Rose Piafs story | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesVie en Rose Piafs storyTo the French the life and music of Edith Piaf is so familiar that director Olivier Dahan thought it prudent to take an artsy approach to what he insists is not a biopic.By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterFri. June 8 2007 Starring Marion Cotillard Sylvie Testud and Jean-Paul Rouve. Written and directed by Olivier Dahan. 140 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A  Article Continued BelowTo the French the life and music of Edith Piaf is so familiar that director Olivier Dahan thought it prudent to take an artsy approach to what he insists is not a biopic.Too bad for those who might have enjoyed a simple retelling of a fascinating life and times. La Vie en Rose has some spectacular moments musical and otherwise and Marion Cotillards depiction of the Little Sparrow is brilliant. But somewhere between shooting and post-production the film got chopped into tiny bit-sized pieces reshuffled to such a degree that it becomes hard to follow the narration.Non-linear is not a bad way to go but did we really need to wait until the final 10 minutes of a 140-minute film to learn the origin of Piafs close relationship with the companion who remains with her until her dying days? And what about the father Louis? He first abandons her to a brothel and then reclaims her to work on the streets where he makes a poor living playing a concertina. Couldnt we have found out earlier what really makes his and Ediths relationship tick? Dahan sacrifices a lot of dramatic momentum to heighten emotional truths.The raw elements are compelling enough. A little girl is left in her grandmothers care by her wayward mother during World War I.When the father Louis returns from the front he takes over his daughter. He leaves her in a brothel where she suffers an illness that makes her temporarily blind. Then he retrieves her. One day he nudges her to sing in the streets of Belleville a seedy part of Paris. She belts out ""La Marseillaise"" and the coins start dropping into Louis hat. A successful agent Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu) spots her and puts her into a cabaret act. She has a voice that would shake the birds from the trees.Piaf is abandoned let down heart-broken at every turn. After losing her boxer lover Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) in a plane crash she adds heroin to her list of addictions. Her life is one long series of collapses and comebacks but the voice never wavers. Neither do her supporters who include manager Lois Gassion played by famous French thespian Jean-Paul Rouve.Cotillard looks an awful lot like Piaf but her work is no mere impersonation. Its a gripping performance. That and the soundtrack of the real Piaf singing showstoppers such as ""No Regrets"" are the best parts of La Vie en Rose.

Written and directed by Olivier Dahan. In French with English subtitles. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At the Clay and San Francisco Centre 9.) In this feverish unremitting and grimly joyless film about French cabaret singer Edith Piaf writer-director Olivier Dahan hot-wires life and art together in a tightly closed circuit. ""La Vie en Rose"" reworks the well-worn facts of Piafs life -- parental abandonment poverty the grainy guttural voice fame a lovers death alcoholism and drug addiction decrepitude and death at age 47 in 1963 -- into a sustained case study of grief. Even an ending built around Piafs throaty theme song of defiance ""Non je ne regrette rien"" doesnt dispel the gloom. Dahan takes a tragic view of his subjects life and almost never alters his gaze for 2 hours 20 minutes. The movie opens with a fragile Piaf (an intense Marion Cotillard miming singer Jil Aigrot) onstage in New York in 1959. The camera lurks around in shadowy space behind the audience then zeros in as the star collapses midsong. The action backtracks to Piafs down-and-out childhood in the Belleville district of Paris where the 5-year-old waif (Manon Chevallier) watches her mother (a misery-soaked Clotilde Courau) singing for centimes on the street. Its a handheld emblem of fate. Ediths circus performer father (the morose Jean-Paul Rouve) returns from the war and promptly deposits the girl with her grandmother the sour madam of a whorehouse. The child no sooner bonds with the loving prostitutes than she is snatched back by her father and conscripted into servitude in a traveling circus. Her enchantment with circus spectacle is thwarted when her father quits in a huff and takes to the streets as a contortionist busker forcing Edith (played by Pauline Burlet at age 10) to collect the few coins he earns. ""La Vie en Rose"" shuttles back and forth in time as Edith begins singing on the streets herself gets discovered by a nightclub owner (Gerard Depardieu) coached by a hard-driving voice teacher (Marc Barbe) and catapulted upward. Dahan handles the rise to fame with cliched montages of newspaper clippings and magazine covers. Crucial facts are either withheld or handled in a telegraphic staccato. When Depardieus character is murdered and a detective questions Piaf cameras angrily flash in her face. The scene like several others is both disjointed and implausible. The fractured narrative is a by-product of the films fixation on Piafs misery. It doesnt matter what happens from one moment to the next were meant to understand; the suffering of this performer was primary and irreducible. As for how all that unhappiness got transmuted into art ""La Vie en Rose"" asks to take that on faith hear it in that growling voice and rolling consonants and see it in the singers haunted bulging eyes. ""I prefer it dark"" Edith says when a nurse wants to open a curtain and let the sunshine in. It could be the directors defining statement of purpose. Give Cotillard (""A Good Year"" ""A Very Long Engagement"") credit for a fearless uncompromising performance. Her Piaf is always on the brink whether shes hobbling out on stage to sing one last song staining herself with Champagne at a party or counting out her final days listening to her old recordings and gazing into space. She looks trapped in her own body onstage peering out over the footlights like a caged animal. The scenes at the end of Piafs life are deeply etched in terror and difficult to watch. Its a heroic piece of acting intently focused on a singular view of the character. ""La Vie en Rose"" plays as a kind of perpetual death watch. Even the compelling love affair of Piafs life with the boxer Marcel Cerdan (a blandly elusive Jean-Pierre Martins) becomes a grueling ordeal. Much of their screen time together is spent at one of his fights with Edith wincing in the crowd at every blow. In the scattered moments when the clouds part the film opts for dreamy sentimental fantasia. The young Edith glimpses St. Teresa in the sparks from a circus performers breath of fire. The young singer debuts on the streets with ""La Marseillaise"" and the coins rain down. Piafs sad story has become an essential and perhaps inevitably reductive component of her legend. Shes the cabaret worlds Sylvia Plath. But for the fans who go on loving Piafs music the self-evident sorrow is balanced by a delight in what she could do with a song. Here the unhappiness engulfs everything -- the music the other people in her life and the temperament of the film. ""La Vie en Rose"" is a life seen through a glass tinted darkly with Cotillard glittering fiercely before the light goes out. -- Advisory This film contains images of drug use and prostitution.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Thursday June 7 2007 520 PM La Vie en Rose Biographical drama about legendary French singer Edith Piaf. With Marion Cotillard Sylvie Testud and Gerard Depardieu. Director Olivier Dahan (220). PG-13 Drug use language sexual content. At the Angelika. In French with subtitles. Less than an hour after watching writer-director Olivier Dahans impressionistic biography of legendary French singer Edith Piaf I was in a record store buying two CD collections of her songs. The 4-foot-8 Piaf known as ""The Little Sparrow"" in France has a voice that seems twice her size and a lyrical diction that is as haunting as it is unique. I needed to hear more. The movie may be a little too impressionistic. It hopscotches through Piafs alternately tragic and triumphant life from her early childhood to her slow death from cancer at age 47 in 1963 with chronologically out-of-order sequences in between. Even at 2 hours and 20 minutes ""La Vie en Rose"" seems too busy and too crowded with details. Often we have no sense of time or even place (Paris? New York?) and such major events as the murder of Piafs first mentor Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu) are left hanging in the air. Yet as Piaf fans will note and perhaps rue some of the biggest headlines of her life - her affair with the young Yves Montand her role in the French Resistance - are missing. The overall impression one gets is of the low-bred daughter of a part-time hooker and a circus contortionist whose enormous natural talent got her in over her head led to numerous ill-fated romances alcoholism drug addiction and flights of nearly mad self-indulgence. In other words its the role of an actress lifetime and Marion Cotillard (""A Good Year"") pretty much knocks it out of the park. Nearly a head taller than Piaf Cotillards stooping efforts to appear tiny make you wonder if Piaf wasnt shriveled with scoliosis (she wasnt) and she wears a smile during Piafs few happy moments with lover/boxer Marcel Cerdan that makes her look simple (she wasnt that either). But otherwise it is a heart-wrenching performance. The song for which Piaf is best-known - ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien"" (""No Regrets"") - leads to a killer finale with Cotillard perfectly lip-synching Piafs recording of it.

Sony Pictures Classic By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 20 2011 1201 a.m. ET In Woody Allens beguiling and then bedazzling new comedy nostalgia isnt at all what it used to be--its smarter sweeter fizzier and ever so much funnier. From the first note of music over a dark screen--a soprano saxophone played by some ghost of Sidney Bechet--""Midnight in Paris"" teases us into expecting nothing more or less than a charming pastiche of the bits and pieces that pop up in many Woody Allen films. The jazz score from another era introduces scenes of the city--not Manhattan in black-and-white splendor but Paris under a bright summer sun. Then a troubled writer makes his appearance--not the blocked novelist played by Josh Brolin in last years ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" but Gil a hack screenwriter played by Owen Wilson who wants to be a novelist. (He and his prickly fiancee Inez played by Rachel McAdams have joined her parents on what began as a business trip for her father.) To round out the familiar cast of archetypes theres Michael Sheens insufferable Paul a poseur who insists that Versailles means ""a place where the weeds have been pulled."" Watch a clip from ""Midnight in Paris"" starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams and Kathy Bates. The conflicts are also familiar and entertaining. The earnestly liberal Gil argues back and forth with his prospective father-in-law a conservative Republican who takes a dim view of him as well as his politics. Paul dismisses Gils nostalgia for a Paris that no longer exists as nothing but denial of the painful present. The name for this malady he announces is ""golden-age thinking."" All of that is well and good but this 44th film written and directed by Mr. Allen--imagine 44 films over four decades--has better poissons to saute. The plot flips at midnight when Gil a solitary wanderer lost in a maze of cobblestone streets spots a black-and-yellow apparition coming around a corner--a huge old Rolls-Royce filled with expat revelers. And not just a Rolls but a magic coach that might have come from a Cocteau fantasy. Once Gil joins the revels his tipsy befuddlement escalates to the innocent astonishment that Mr. Wilson has done so well in the past and does superlatively in Gils present which is interwoven with the fabled past of the Ville-Lumiere. Im starting to write in circles here because Im conflicted myself I dont want to spoil any surprises but I do want to convey the sense of joyous delight that flows from the films time-hops. Maybe the best way of getting into it is by noting that Gil was also the name of the movie actor played by Jeff Daniels in one of my favorite Woody Allen films--one of my favorite films period--""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" The magical moment of that achingly lyrical fantasy comes when Gils character an intrepid archaeologist steps out of the screen and into Mia Farrows grim Depression-era life. In ""Midnight in Paris"" lyricism yields though not entirely to the scintillating lunacy of a wannabe writer stepping into another era and finding himself in the midst of the writers and artists he has worshipped as gods. Cocteau is only one of many. The pianist singing songs with phenomenal lyrics--""in shallow shoals English soles do it""--isnt just a pianist. An American poet introduces himself as Tom. The alpha literary lion of the milieu is Corey Stolls Ernest (Im going along with the first-name-only game played by the credits) a somber self-mythologist who speaks about love and death in run-on sentences and keeps trying to pick fights. Mr. Fitzgeralds hair is impeccably marcelled while Mrs. Fitzgeralds psyche is so tangled that Gil gives her a Valium. (Shes played brilliantly by Alison Pill.) Kathy Bates is not just hilarious shes eerily convincing as Gertrude who of course has Pablos portrait of her hanging in her salon. (Speaking of the dour Pablo Ernest says ""Hes great but hes no Miro."") Gils presence is readily accepted by Adrien Brodys Salvador as well as by Salvadors friends Man and Luis; they see no problem with someone living in two worlds because theyre surrealists. Mr. Allen offers this inspired nonsense with the casual aplomb of an absurdist; its all so silly and such wonderful fun. That changes though when he brings on Adriana an aspiring fashion designer and sometime mistress of various painters in town Pablo among them. Shes as real as the marvelous Marion Cotillard can make her which is to say intensely and for Gil sublimely Adriana is everything his fiancee isnt with the added attraction of being a legend. And through their adventure in another magic coach ""Midnight in Paris"" reconsiders Pauls diagnosis. When was the golden age and why didnt we get to live in it? Its a serious question that the movie has the good grace to take whimsically though theres no contest photographically between present and past. The superb cinematographer Darius Khondji floods his vistas of daytime Paris with light thats gentle but banal while Anne Seibels production design turns several coins de rue into vaguely cheesy movie sets. In the nighttime Paris that Gil explores the colors are rich the shadows are deep the mists promise mystery and serpentine alleys invite the sort of dreamy meanders that suit Gil so well. (Annoyed by his romantic affection for soft summer showers Inez asks early on ""Why does every city have to be in the rain?"" One answer is that cameras love the look of wet pavements.) At the same time the movie gives todays Paris a boost by populating it with women whose intelligence and sensitivity are equal to their beauty. One of them a guide at the Rodin Museum is played by Frances First Lady Carla Bruni. (More than a piquant cameo its a pleasing performance.) Another Lea Seydouxs Gabrielle sells antiques at an outdoor stand and values Gil as a customer with special tastes. ENLARGE Johnny Depps Jack Sparrow accompanied by redcoats in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides. Disney Actors have always been eager to work with Mr. Allen; heres another demonstration of why. Every member of the cast shines at varying intensities Ms. McAdams as a young almost-married whos lively and attractive albeit a scold; Kurt Fuller as Inezs acidulous father; Mimi Kennedy as her dryly sarcastic mother; and in lesser roles Nina Arianda Tom Hiddleston Daniel Lundh and Michel Vuillermoz. But this is Mr. Wilsons picture. Practiced though his trademark naivete may be its entirely fresh once again because hes so good at playing such a complex role. Gil is a bit of a goofball but he is also without knowing it the genuine artist he yearns to be. For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being the film represents new energy in a remarkable career. In recent years Mr. Allens output has been variable; a succession of small mostly agreeable entertainments punctuated by the disagreeable miscalculation of ""Whatever Works"" and the glorious madness of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona."" Whats new about ""Midnight in Paris""--about its cheerful shallows along with its unstressed depths--is the lovely unseriousness of the whole venture. Just as Luis Bunuel did Woody Allen is growing more playful as he gets older. His new movie truly is a place where the weeds have been pulled. Everything comes up roses. Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides ""Its not the destination so much as the journey"" Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow declares in this latest addition to the theme park ride. For me it was not so much the journey as the destination--the curtained opening beneath the Exit sign--so Im not the one to say whether this film is better or worse than the previous one. Its definitely shorter and more coherent Jack and Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa both sail off to find the Fountain of Youth but Ian McShanes Blackbeard is after it too and not just Blackbeard and his crew of zombies but his daughter Angelica who is played by Penelope Cruz with a what-am-I-doing-here expression on her face. (She looks cute with a moustache.) Watch a clip from ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards in another cameo as Captain Teague asks ""Does this face look like its found the Fountain of Youth?"" Nope it does not. Mr. Depp fulfills his flouncing quota though his deadpan sometimes goes completely dead. The movie was written by ""Pirates"" stalwarts Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Theyre funny guys and the script might well be funny too but its hard to tell from the metronome rhythms set for the actors by the director Rob Marshall and by the editors working as galley slaves under their producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I did like an elaborate swarm of mermaids especially the one who washes up on the movies shores; her name is Syrena with a ""y"" to distinguish her from common sirens and shes played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. But the IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight the 3-D wasnt worth the bother and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra. DVD FOCUS Wedding Crashers (2005) Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are John and Jeremy motor-mouthed con men who crash wedding receptions to pick up girls. In the opening scene set in an office where the longtime friends maintain a dubious practice as divorce mediators an aggrieved husband laces into his wife who replies furiously ""You shut your mouth when youre talking to me"" This tidbit of skewed logic is only one bright moment of many in a film blessed with language thats sharply honed if often raunchy. Rachel McAdams is a bridesmaid Claire with whom John falls hopelessly in love. La Vie en Rose (2007) Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her astonishing performance as the tortured impassioned Edith Piaf. In the spirit of Piafs signature song I regret nothing about ""La Vie en Rose""--not the narrative confusion the sketchy details or the lack of historical context. Olivier Dahans long harrowing and phantasmagorical biopic doesnt bother with such events as World War II which slips by unnoticed. This isnt negligence but a reflection of Piafs point of view. Her life was only about singing and searching for love. And always the songs she sang with the intensity of a cyclotron beam. Broken Embraces (2009) Penelope Cruz does her best to act badly during several passages in Pedro Almodovars tragicomedy but her effort is doomed to failure. Shes magnificent even when her performance is supposed to be clumsy and those passages arent what they seem anyway. Theyre part of a wonderfully elaborate joke in a film that serves as a love letter to the movies and a demonstration of the mediums mysterious power. Ms. Cruzs Lena is part of a quadrangle that involves a blind Spanish screenwriter and former director an ominously amorous tycoon and the former directors production assistant. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

One of Edith Piafs signature songs was ""Non je ne regrette rien"" and discerning viewers worldwide are unlikely to regret buying a ticket to biopic ""La Vie en rose."" Versatile always spot-on thesp Marion Cotillard surpasses herself as the waiflike French songbird whose personal traumas fueled her art. Already presold to much of the planet impressively mounted and involving pic should be greeted with applause in most markets after ringing up the curtain at the Berlin fest. Director Olivier Dahan (""Dead Already"" 1998; ""Crimson Rivers II"" 2004) who co-scripted with Isabelle Sobelman weaves known incidents from Piafs personal and professional trajectory into a celluloid mosaic. Pic draws on old-fashioned show-must-go-on gumption yet feels modern not musty in its approach. Recent biopic subjects Ray Charles and Johnny Cash packed setbacks and success into much longer careers; Piaf died in 1963 at age 47. Younger auds accustomed to flashy belting may not immediately appreciate the gripping originality of Piafs delivery but they should be able to relate to hard knocks harder knocks drug addiction alcohol lost love and the needy flip side of adulation when your inner child is scruffy and wounded. Piaf spent her formative years in a brothel went blind for a while as a child was suspected of having murdered the impresario who gave her her first professional break -- and thats just the tip of a juicy biographical iceberg. Pics structure doesnt so much bounce back and forth in time as flow in and out of settings and incidents in non-chronological order. Action starts in New York on Feb. 16 1959 in front of a chi-chi crowd. Piaf starts singing in English only to collapse. Next sequence opens in 1918 in Paris where Ediths mother Anetta (Clotilde Courau) sings for the dirt-poor passers-by of the Belleville quarter. Ediths father Louis (Jean-Paul Rouve) a contortionist snatches his daughter from the grubby setting and deposits her with his mother Louise (Catherine Allegret eerily channeling her mother Simone Signoret) a brothel keeper in Normandy. Pic then returns to New York then back to Normandy in the teens -- all in the first reel. No artificial timeline is imposed on the proceedings yet the portrait feels rich and rounded looking back over the womans hurts and triumphs as she might have recalled them at the end of her intensely bittersweet life. Sweeping slightly dreamlike result has plenty of forward momentum but also feels unhurried. A whorehouse may be no place for a little girl but it was there that Edith received the closest thing to actual mothering she would ever know. And young Edith is instilled with a lifelong taste for prayer by spunky flame-haired Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner wonderful) a church-going prostie and the scripts only invented character. A wiry wisp of a woman who eventually loomed larger than life Piaf was discovered on a street corner by Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu). Borderline geeky shes a vocal curiosity whose cabaret debut proves electric. But the streets continue to tug at the feisty-yet-tentative ""little sparrow."" (""Piaf"" is vintage Paris slang for the bird.) Period re-creations feel just right from impoverished Belleville via the championship bout in 40s New York by Piafs true love boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) to mid-50s California. But well-dressed sets and convincing costumes would have meant little without Cotillards bracing and affecting perf. Cotillard nails the assignment portraying Piaf at 20 to Piaf on her deathbed with a range of gestures her trademark posture and a core of eternal hurt melded with ferocious pride. She embodies Piafs raspy speaking voice her imperious street-wise attitude her simple joy at being lionized by other celebs and the taste of artistic triumph mixed with the constant hum of genuine tragedy. Casting is excellent across the board with high marks for tykes Manon Chevallier and Pauline Burlet as the young Edith; Pascal Greggory as Piafs devoted slightly lovesick manager; Rouve as her itinerant acrobat father; gruffly handsome Martins as Cerdan; Allegret rock-solid as the brothel keeper; and Sylvie Testud as Ediths guttersnipe drinking buddy Momone. Widescreen lensing is intelligent and communicative throughout. The eerily choreographed scene in which Piaf learns Cerdan will not be coming to join her is handled with baroque majesty. Makeup and hair are both outstanding. By the end of her life the real Piaf looked some 25 years older than she actually was and Cotillards scrubbed good looks are transformed accordingly. Music-hall numbers crackle with the charge of live performance. Interstitial score delicately incorporates melodies from Piaf standards without upstaging the action or diluting the power of the songs when married with their lyrics.

But this brilliant account of the life of Edith Piaf - the French songbird born of the streets and the brothels who became a cultural icon for a nation - visits the usual benchmarks juggles them around emphasizes sharp detail over seismic events and delivers the portrait of a life that is vividly explosively real. Populated with whores and boxers thugs and impresarios the low and the mighty La Vie en Rose covers two World Wars and a whirlwind of history zooming in on the big doleful eyes - and big beautiful voice - of the woman nicknamed ""la mAme"" the kid ""the Little Sparrow."" As portrayed by Marion Cotillard in a performance that has to be recognized when Oscar time rolls around Piaf comes off as uniquely talented and tortured a strong-willed woman whose rough childhood and impoverished early years forged a fiery soul - in the frailest and most abused (drugs alcohol you name it) of bodies. Lip-synching (perfectly) Cotillard transforms herself from the plucky street crooner with the lesbian sidekick to a grande dame of the music world and all phases between. She is quite simply amazing. The actress (A Good Year A Very Long Engagement) brings new meaning to the word transformation There isnt a second of screen time when youll find yourself thinking that youre watching an actor at work. With Cotillard in La Vie en Rose you are witnessing some kind of unexplainable extraordinary inhabitation. Filmmaker Dahan - heretofore known for a slick Luc Besson-produced thriller and a pretty good Isabelle Huppert drama La Vie Promise - toggles around the decades getting great supporting work from Sylvie Testud Emmanuelle Seigner Gerard Depardieu Clotilde Courau Jean-Pierre Martins (as Piafs prizefighter lover Marcel Cerdan) and a pair of magnetic kid actors who portray Piaf at the ages of 5 and 10. Jettisoning any sort of straightforward chronology Dahan instead creates a timeline of emotional moments of unimagined lows and highs and of the supremely gifted maddeningly difficult woman at its center. For Piaf fans La Vie en Rose is a must-see. For fans yet-to-be Dahan and Cotillards film is an opportunity rich with discovery.
