But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Restoring the seductive style of the no-nonsense procedural heist movie to complete luster this is the kind of pic that knows the difference between being masculine and being macho. ""The Score"" is as close to a hat trick as any mainstream Hollywood entertainment in some time. Restoring the seductive style of the no-nonsense procedural heist movie to complete luster this is the kind of pic that knows the difference between being masculine and being macho. While latter quality has reached depressingly new lows the former has been in desperately short supply and helmer Frank Oz manfully replenishes the stockpile and shows that he can switch from a superior comedy like ""Bowfinger"" to this meticulously detailed thriller as easily as switching suits. The project would be noteworthy solely as a kind of summit meeting for great thesps from Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando to Edward Norton and Angela Bassett but behind the megawattage is a supremely solid movie and the combo should help the Paramount/Mandalay release bag excellent B.O. Studios ad campaign eschews Brando from its ""big-head"" imagery (matching key pair of De Niro and Norton) while suggesting that this is an action thrill ride -- an undoubtedly irresistible proposition for a summer release but far off the mark. Every sequence is staged and paced for maximum effect but the pulse is deliberate and precise rather than overtly kinetic. Its an outstanding case of form following content as these are precisely the disciplined working qualities practiced by De Niros pro thief Nick. Whether Ozs direction managed to cover for a script reportedly unfinished by production start and touched by several hands including the incisive Lem Dobbs of ""The Limey"" or whether script ultimately crystallized is impossible to tell from the viewing since the final job is seamless. Neatly divided into three sections pics efficiency tautness and taste for just the right dose of tension are immediately established in a sleek shadowy 10-minute opening sequence that shows Nick breaking into a safe during an estate party. Whats different this time is not only the documentary-like treatment of the job but Nicks escape which is a graceful extended trip over the U.S. border to Montreal where he lives using his profits to run a fabulous-looking jazz club called NYC. Its a serious club too as Oz liberally shows hosting the likes of Cassandra Wilson and Mose Allison for the lengthiest onscreen appearances these world-class swingers have ever had in a movie. Setting as well as De Niros distinct gravitas also establishes Nick as a man in charge and one who knows what he likes. When he informs casual lover Diane (Bassett) that he finally wants to quit his illegal trade and devote his life to her and the club Ozs camera frames the exchange in some stunning master shots that allow the viewer to take in the reality of the couples life while pointedly avoiding melodrama. Nick has decided to make this change after his partner in crime for 25 years Max (Brando) has already dropped by the club with an offer he may or may not refuse to pull off a job at the massive Montreal Customs House -- even though this violates Nicks key rule of never stealing in his own neighborhood. Brandos Max is a kind of underworld Truman Capote corpulently cuddly old enough to not take too much of anything seriously. Undeniably theres chemistry between De Niro and Brando with the actors seemingly finding new layers in each scene. (Notably while the pair share the ""Godfather"" legacy theyve made no previous films together.) Rounding the circle is the appearance of Jack (Norton) whos cased the Customs House for weeks under Maxs employ under the guise of being autistic. Nicks doesnt like working with partners but Maxs long-developed methods of friendly persuasion plus his willingness to promise to give Nick more of the take put the pieces in place and start an endlessly fascinating process of younger and older crooks designing the heist. What intrigues is the sheer amount of work that goes into planning and execution which is never overwhelmed by Hollywoods usual appetite for bigger toys and bigger guns. Even the obligatory computer scenes including a few smartly brief ones involving a wiggy hacker are packed with suspense as is each step toward the final deed. ""This takes discipline more than talent"" Nick reminds Jack looking enviously around the club Nick has built up. Its a good summation of the filmic storytelling throughout. The 35-minute finale is a superbly executed sequence of second-by-second action that has Oz up to now a perfectly competent comedy director putting on a clinic in how to deliver suspense. And Brando De Niro and Norton among the three best movie actors of their generations empower these extremely smart but flawed men with enough chinks to suggest that the whole masterful project may collapse like a house of cards. The three share two scenes together and what emerges is how they play three different slightly off-key tones. Though less costly than much of the summer competition pic is second to none in the tech department. With years of working for masters like Conrad Hall and Owen Roizman -- but only a handful of undistinguished d.p. credits -- Rob Hahn emerges here as a new star among Hollywood lensers drenching Jackson De Govias lavish yet realistic sets in stark shadows that feel like mortality. Howard Shores minimal and masculine score is of a piece with pics nature. Use of Montreal locations as themselves rather than as faux American backdrops reps a new way of justifying runaway productions.

In The Score a sturdily diverting old fashioned heist thriller that looks like a masterpiece of sheer competence next to the slovenly action fantasy F/X grab bags that have been passing for summer entertainment De Niro plays a veteran safecracker named Nick Wells who exists in a state of such anonymous order and caution that he might be a fubsy middle aged English bank manager. Nick an American lives in the tranquil urban historical oasis of Montreal where he owns and operates a seductively spacious jazz club. But thats his day job his cover. He executes his audacious midnight burglaries outside of the city working solo mapping out every detail so that nothing can go wrong then returning like a phantom. The challenge of playing a control freak like Nick is that De Niros own wary taciturn spirit could just end up making the character seem dull. But his performance is a textbook instance of acting that plugs you into what it doesnt overtly show. Nicks caution his watchful radar armor is a kind of quiet mania and De Niro evoking James Caans brooding nihilistic cat burglar in ""Thief"" draws you right to the center of what Nick is guarding against not just getting caught but losing his edge on the world. When he goes into his top secret tool shop to plan a job (its a veritable minihardware store hidden behind a hairdressing salon) he could almost be a criminal superhero ditching his innocuous ordinary guy alter ego. As a movie ""The Score"" is a lot like Nick smart tense clever and methodical. It doesnt exactly reinvent the cliches of the heist genre (in fact it embraces nearly every one of them) but then this is the sort of movie you enjoy exactly because of its gadgety obsessiveness and deft clockwork design its nearly ritualized suspense. The terrific opening scene in which Nick in the middle of a score neatly outwits disaster sets the movies tone plotting and precision locked in a duel with the ongoing threat of chaos. ""The Score"" offers the pleasure of seeing a master plan flawlessly executed as well as the equal and opposite pleasure of watching that plan go up in smoke. Nick takes his robbery assignments from Max his longtime fence and comrade played by a twinkly less flaky than usual Marlon Brando who appears to be doing an underworld cross between Truman Capote and a very lordly elf. Its Maxs idea to set up Nick with Jackie Teller (Edward Norton) a brilliant and arrogant young thief who has infiltrated Montreals Customs House by going to work there under the alias of a twitching mentally challenged night shift janitor. The film gets away with this amusingly tasteless stunt only because Norton in a variation on his debut in ""Primal Fear"" does it with such skilled gusto; he makes it seem not a gimmick but a virtuoso ruse. Nick whose ground rule is that he wont steal in Montreal is coerced into breaking that rule in order to team up with Jackie the upstart brat. Theyre out to filch a 17th century French scepter worth 30 million thats being held in the Customs House. Nicks rationalization It will be the big one - his Last Score. Frank Oz directing his first thriller after comedies like ""What About Bob?"" and ""Bowfinger"" makes the planning and execution of the heist a satisfyingly breathless game of deception brimming with the sort of state of the art technological fetishism (video monitor fakeouts an ingeniously employed minibomb) that ""Thief"" made standard 20 years ago. There are also hokey contemporary touches like a sweaty manic mother fixated hacker who might as well be named ""Bates"" Tarantino. The heart of ""The Score"" however is the fast and hostile interplay between De Niro and Norton both ruthless in their intelligence but with vividly contrasting moods. Is Jackie whose preppy imperiousness veers off into recklessness a sociopath or does he just pretend to be one for the fun of it? And is Nick the working stiff thief really such a straight arrow or does he privately dig the thrill of the action? Jackie and Nick are partners rivals and enemies all at the same time and ""The Score"" in the tradition of every heist film from ""Rififi"" to ""The Killing"" to ""Sexy Beast"" makes the aftermath of the robbery the true test of character. The picture is hardly as intricate as those other films or as original but in a season starved for honest flair itll do.

Three-way tie / Terrific stars solid plot keep The Score entertaining 1 / 2 Back to Gallery THE SCORE Suspense thriller. Starring Robert De Niro and Edward Norton. Featuring Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett. Directed by Frank Oz. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) No that isnt Marlon Brando in a fat suit at the beginning of ""The Score."" Thats the great man himself. By now Brando has become as big as his talent. Hes in good company the best. With Robert De Niro and Edward Norton co- starring ""The Score"" is filled with heavy hitters who are also having a good time. So will the audience. This is a solid suspense thriller thats fun. These stars have put it together in a spirit of playfulness -- as in playacting. We are on familiar turf with this heist noir. The actors acknowledge this at the same time they spin it forward into unexpected places. De Niro is a safecracker who wants to hang it up and retire to his Montreal jazz club. With Angela Bassett as his main squeeze who can blame him? Brando is a big-time international fence who tempts him into one last job. Norton is the inside operator. Even with such giants of screen acting as Brando and De Niro Norton has no reason to feel intimidated or overshadowed. Maybe the best young actor in movies today he can take care of himself. He certainly has the most innovative role. Jack the proud young thief he plays is something of an actor himself. The first sight of Norton in this film outdoes even that of Brando. These guys know how to make an entrance. When it suits his purpose Jack pretends to be slow-witted (in the film he is called ""a retard""). It is not the only occasion when Jack will pretend to be something hes not just the most obvious one. You dont know Jack -- and neither does Nick (De Niro) who is suspicious of the deal from the beginning and goes into it against his better judgment. These actors improvising good stretches of their scenes together is part of the fun. Just in case anybody misses it the movie gives big hints. ""I had to improvise a little bit"" Jack says disingenuously at one point and the jazz soundtrack nails it down with the song ""Ill Make It Up as I Go."" (San Francisco jazz fans will be pleased to spot Mose Allison playing at Nicks club.) SLY BRANDO ROLE If Nortons role is the flashiest Brandos is the slyest. Max (Brando) sets up the heist the lifting of a French national treasure a 17th century jeweled scepter from the Montreal Customs House. Maxs good humor takes sudden surprising turns. Catch what Brando does with an open bottle of mineral water. The older actor sometimes leaves the impression he is throwing De Niro outrageous lines simply to see if he can get a rise out of him -- maybe I like to think because both actors once played the same character (Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather"" and its prequel sequence in ""Godfather II""). SYDNEY GREENSTREET Nicks suspicions prove well founded when he catches Max in a lie. ""I had to do something to get you to suit up"" Max admits. Here Brando is a living reminder of another great (and bulky) noir character actor Sydney Greenstreet (""The Maltese Falcon""). In a scene strangely set at the empty swimming pool in Maxs mansion with Brando draped in towels and a robe but sitting in an empty Jacuzzi Max switches from nonchalance to self-pity in an effort to keep the deal alive. At key moments De Niro supplies Nick with flashes of the disgust but unflappability of an old pro. With three generations of actors like these director Frank Oz does the smart thing He leaves them to their own devices so he can concentrate on the heist itself. The scepter is inside a safe inside a laser-beam ""fence"" inside a chain-link cage inside the basement inside the customs house. COMIC TOUCHES Oz is primarily a comedy director (""In amp; Out"" ""Bowfinger"") which shows not only in little touches but also in his handling of comic scenes with a computer hacker who still lives at home with Mommy and with a couple of nervous Nellies who arrange to meet Jack in a public park for a payoff. Norton has bulked up again not as much as for ""American History X"" but enough to give him credibility as unexpectedly tough. Jack is also confidently witty. ""Why dont we worry about next time next time?"" he tells the jumpy contacts in the park. Advisory Contains raw language.

"CNN.com - Review Acting makes for a top Score - July 12 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Confident direction guides heist Review Acting makes for a top Score By Paul TataraCNN.com reviewer (CNN) -- ""The Score"" is director Frank Ozs first dramatic feature - after years of whipping up commercial comedies like ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""In and Out"" - so it comes as something of a surprise that hes never seemed so sure of himself. This is a good old-fashioned heist picture that emphasizes meticulous pacing and character development over optical effects and speed-freak editing techniques. Now Oz is no dummy. You dont have to get fancy when your movie features Robert De Niro Edward Norton and a hefty scene stealer named Marlon Brando. Its best to just sit back and let them do their thing ... and pray that Brando doesnt sink the entire project with his oddball antics. De Niro plays Nick a Montreal-based professional thief who in the time-honored tradition of this type of movie is looking to make one final score before he permanently settles down. He also runs a successful jazz club and would like to walk the straight-and-narrow for the sake of his long suffering girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett whos utterly wasted in her empty role).

USATODAY.com - Stars try their best to settle Score Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/13/2001 - Updated 1105 AM ET Stars try their best to settle Score By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Score (out of four) Stars Robert De Niro Marlon Brando Edward Norton Angela Bassett Gary Farmer Director Frank Oz Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for language Only in a movie season as ho-hum as this one would The Score a deliberately paced high-tech heist movie be considered the classy intelligent offering among the pack. The story of a crack safecracker about to retire but persuaded to pull off one last job is predictable Hollywood fare. Were the stars not of the caliber of Robert De Niro Marlon Brando Edward Norton and Angela Bassett the movie would be lackluster indeed but their turbo-charged performances add intrigue to this sedate action film. Read more Video View trailer for The Score De Niro stars as Nick a discreet career criminal whos so proficient and -- odd for a thief -- principled that he has acquired a hipster jazz club and stayed out of jail for the 25 years he has been pulling capers. His long-time partner in crime Max -- played convincingly by the larger-than-life (and we do mean large) Brando -- persuades Nick to apply his talents to make off with a priceless French scepter making this the first heist film designed to hasten only the pulses of French nobility. The caper will enable Nick to settle down with his stewardess girlfriend (Bassett) hang up his pliers and go legit. Max teams Nick with Jack (Norton) a cocky thief whose undercover gig as Brian a mentally retarded janitor at the Customs House where the scepter is being held has given him access to the security system. Norton is an intelligent actor who plays Jack slickly but his portrayal of Brian suggests hes been channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Director Frank Oz known mainly for comedies such as Bowfinger and In amp; Out (as well as serving as the voice of Miss Piggy) does a capable if slack-paced job. There are explosions double-crosses and chase sequences but it just doesnt add up to edge-of-your-seat tension. Folks who love to spend hours poring over merchandise at Circuit City may find the meticulous detail with which The Score depicts its high-tech gadgetry fascinating but others might find it somnolent.
