But its problematic as to whether Miramax can build on target aud to attract demographics other than pre-teen and adolescent girls. Legions of loyal N Sync fans likely will line up to buy buy buy tickets for ""On the Line"" even though only two-fifths of the immensely popular boy band have prominent roles in this yummy-bubblegummy romantic comedy. But its problematic as to whether Miramax can build on target aud to attract demographics other than pre-teen and adolescent girls. Pic is a perfectly harmless often humorous featherweight confection -- think ""Serendipity"" re-imagined as a teen-skewing Saturday morning sitcom -- with a decent chance to score modestly respectable B.O. coin before reaching the greener fields of homevid. Certainly N Syncer Lance Bass could have done a lot worse in picking the right launching pad for his feature acting debut. (Pic also is first product of his production company A Happy Place.) Boyishly handsome singer makes a mostly affable impression as Kevin Gibbons a minor functionary at a Chicago ad firm whos chronically unable to ""seal the deal"" in his romantic pursuits. Amusing prologue shows Kevin as a high school band lead vocalist who turns tongue-tied and flop-sweaty when he tries to serenade the girl of his dreams. Flashfoward to present day and pic finds Mr. Shy Guy hasnt really changed all that much. At 26 Kevin still hangs out with three former schoolmates Rod (fellow N Syncer Joey Fatone) a bar-band singer with dreams of a song-writing career; Eric (hip-hop comic GQ) a manic underachiever; and Randy (James Bulliard) a bookish type who might have been played by James Spader 15 or so years ago. Buddies urge Kevin to loosen up take more chances and while hes at it chase a few ladies now and then. Trouble is Kevin is too milquetoasty for his own good. Fortune smiles on the pleasant young man late one afternoon when he encounters a vivacious young woman while riding the El train. As they chat Kevin discovers Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui) shares his deep appreciation for Al Green as well as his eccentric ability to name every U.S. president. Obviously theyre made for each other. But he cant quite work up the nerve to ask for her name and number and manages only a melancholy grimace as she appears to walk out of his life. Forever? Not hardly. Kevin finally starts to forge a backbone for himself after a haughtily ambitious co-worker (Tamala Jones) swipes his idea for a Reebok ad campaign. Sufficiently fired up to make an atypically bold move he plasters much of greater metropolitan Chicago with attention-grabbing flyers with his name and number hoping to somehow connect with the woman who got away. News of his desperate search spreads throughout the city thanks in part to coverage by a cynical newspaper columnist (Dan Montgomery) with a long-standing grudge against Kevin. Unfortunately the publicity only serves to generate lots of calls from the wrong women. Even more unfortunately Kevins buddies volunteer to screen the respondents by making dates with any female who phones. When Abbey finally does try to contact Kevin she winds up meeting the boorish Eric. She is not impressed. Based on a well-received short written by screenwriters Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton who expanded their original script to feature length ""On the Line"" clickity-clacks down the track at a brisk clip under the energetic direction of Eric Bross (""Restaurant""). Plot relies heavily on mixed connections and fortuitous coincidences much like ""Serendipity."" So much so in fact that you cant help wondering if Miramax honchos ever doubted the wisdom of releasing two such similar romantic comedies within weeks of each other. Only major shortcoming is an overall inconsistency of tone in performances as well as storytelling. Scenes pitched at the frenetic pace of a vintage ""Monkees"" episode alternate with more traditional youth-comedy hijinx and sentimental hokum. On one end of the thesp scale Jerry Stiller lays on the schmaltz as an avuncular mailroom supervisor; on the other Dave Foley nibbles at the scenery with his hypertense caricature of an ad agency boss. CQ leans toward the cartoonish extreme as does Bon Jovi vet Richie Sambora as a self-absorbed rock star. But N Sync singer Fatone demonstrates appreciably more restraint even while playing for easy laughs. Jones earns credit for gracefully maneuvering through some tricky shifts of character development. Femme lead Chriqui is appealing and persuasive. Better still she looks more like a real person -- that is like someone you might actually meet on the El -- than your standard-issue glossy Hollywood beauty. In fact one of the nicer things about ""On the Line"" is across-the-line casting of actors who while undeniably attractive hardly qualify as pinup material. Of course N Sync fans might dispute that assessment but never mind. For the record Fellow N Syncers Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick make fleeting appearances in a ""Behind the Scenes"" mock-documentary near the end. (Joshua Chasez fifth member of the boy band evidently passed on the project.) A couple of the bands tunes are included in the chart-bound soundtrack. But pics musical highlight is a closing-credits production number with Al Green leading the cast in an exuberant new version of ""Lets Stay Together.""

You wonder how he would have described Lance Bass the N Sync chorus boy who stars as a lovestruck Chicago ad writer in On the Line. With his sweetly grinning fluffy-cheeked face Bass resembles nothing so much as the slightly less masculine sister of k.d. lang. Hes so harmless you practically want to turn him into a throw pillow yet theres no denying that he plays to his tween-girl audience with the same ingenuous instinct on screen that he shows on stage. In ""On the Line"" Bass meets his cutie-pie soul-mate (Emmanuelle Chriqui) on the L train. After failing to get her name or number he plasters the town with please-call-me handbills which is enough to turn him into a media sensation. Fellow N Syncer Joey Fatone is also on hand as a roots-blond ""punk"" who plays Mutt to Bass Jeff. ""On the Line"" would like to be ""Serendipity"" for the Oxy-and-Skechers set but it feels more like the worst movie Michael J. Fox never made.

Daily Edition Login to download The Enemy Movie Review 106 PM PDT 3/21/2011 by Natasha Senjanovic FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Good performances salvage paranormal war film with a shaky metaphysical premise. TWITTER War itself is a horror but when Lucifer himself turns up a or does he? a a Bosnian commando unit starts tearing itself other apart in Dejan Zecevicas paranormal thriller. BELGRADE -- Just days after the end of the Balkan War a Bosnian commando unit starts tearing itself other apart in Dejan Zecevics paranormal thriller The Enemy which closed the 39th Belgrade Fest. Strong performances some witty dialogue and a genuinely ominous atmosphere keep viewers engrossed but the films supernatural premise is superfluous given the context. Nevertheless production values are high and given that Serbian films are few and far between The Enemy should do the rounds at festivals. The horror spin will entice home audiences otherwise saturated with war films and theatrical releases are also ensured in the co-production countries Croatia Republika Srpska (Bosnia) and Hungary. To show the universality of conflict Zecevic and co-screenwriter Djordje Milosavljevic use a possibly demonic character as a metaphor for what drives friends and comrades to destroy one another. While that could explain the beginningsof violence its foggy philosophical overkill in a story set at the end of a bloody civil war. The Enemy opens intriguingly in total darkness with a POV shot from behind a wall thats being torn down. As bricks crumble and light starting shining through a man comes into view behind the wall sitting at a table calmly smoking a cigarette. Next the story jumps to the soldiers led by their commander Cole (Aleksandar Stojkovic) who joke as they deactivate the same field mines they planted during the war which has been over for a week. Replacements are coming the following day so they banter about what theyre going to do when they get home. They are free men -- almost. Matters are first complicated with the arrival of Danica (Marija Pikic) a young woman whose abandoned country house the platoon has been occupying. She wants the soldiers out. Things get really twisted when they capture some enemy soldiers who in turn are holding the innocuous-looking Dada (Tihomir Stanic). These soldiers freed Dada from behind the wall of a bombed-out factory and claim he was ""somehow just waiting for them."" Soon after they started fighting and killing each other off. Everyone grows convinced that Dada is Lucifer himself who has others do his bidding by planting seeds of discord. Cole and his men laugh off the story but theres something disquieting about the serene middle-aged Dada who doesnt deny the accusations although he looks more like a shell-shocked peasant. However the radio breaks down replacements dont arrive and the previous days mines are replanted trapping the group in the house without access to the outside world. As the claustrophobia and fear build one by one the soldiers crack and turn on each other. The meek Dada looks on while Cole protects him refusing to allow anyone to kill a civilian. Stanic doesnt overdo his characters ambiguity - just when you think hes a half-wit an evil glint escapes his eye. Hes properly elusive until the films open ending. The sepia-toned Enemy isnt gory as most of its violence is psychological. The suspense escalates nicely until the last act when the supernatural mumbo-jumbo starts to sound silly. Newcomer Pikic struggles a bit with her role in the otherwise strong cast. Noteworthy performances come from StojkovicVuk Kostic as Coles second-in-command and Ljubomir Bandovic as a simpleton soldier who loses his mind.

An unembarrassed high-octane demonstration of the virtues of a U.S. military with a mission the latest war pic from 20th Century Fox couldnt be better timed to fit the popular mood. A correction was made on May 17 2004. an Be."" An unembarrassed high-octane demonstration of the virtues of a U.S. military with a mission the latest war pic from 20th Century Fox -- a studio with a proud tradition in this field -- couldnt be better timed to fit the popular mood especially a mood imbued with a building sense of victory in present-day Afghanistan. The fantasy behind the bloated pic from tyro helmer John Moore and writers David Veloz and Zak Penn is that the focused purpose defining the current war is actually applied to the muddled international mess that was the war in Bosnia. As gray as the backstorys real politics may be the conflict on screen couldnt be more black-and-white ultimately reducing a dizzyingly complex civil war situation into a visual effects-laden cat-and-mouse cartoon. A rushed release from 2002 to the holiday season is a marketing masterstroke that will deliver explosive B.O. As he cools his heels along with his mates on the USS Carl Vinson during a peacekeeping mission off the Balkan coast fighter jet navigator Lt. Burnetts (Owen Wilson) voiced yearnings for genuine battle already sound quaint in the post-Sept. 11 atmosphere. Although Veloz and Penns script has crossed signals from the start -- Burnett is a big kid who likes playing football on the Vinsons deck and at the same time is depicted as a grunt with the Vision Thing -- the itchiness Burnett feels is the same kind of confused yearning heard among the dusty soldiers of ""Three Kings.""Actually the war is on hold since the so-called ""Cincinnati Accord"" has just been inked by warring Bosnian Serbs and Muslims and no armed maneuvers can continue while the peace details are worked out on the ground. Burnett must have taken those TV recruitment commercials seriously though and just to drive the point home rock n roll rumbles under everything he does while his commanding officer Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman) is his paternal boss practicing tough love. When Burnett hands in his request to leave the service Reigart reviews his list of run-ins with MPs and considers his complaints so much immature whining. Both predictably are in for a wake-up call. Moores background in musicvideos and commercials and influence from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of filmmaking is all too apparent from the first cranked-up track-shots-on-speed takes of the big ship and our hero but nothing in these noodlings or the standard-issue set-up prepares viewers for the spectacular action sequence at the 20-minute-mark that really sets the movie into full motion. Reminded by supreme NATO Admiral Piquet (Joaquim de Almeida) that hes on a short leash Reigart orders a simple photo reconnaissance mission. It falls to Burnett and his pilot buddy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) -- during Christmas Eve no less -- but routine collapses when Burnett spots Serb activity in what should be a demilitarized zone. The camera on their F-18 records Serb troops arms and worst of all a killing field and right away the Serbs fire heat-seeking missiles at the jet. What follows is a thrilling dogfight with the F-18 pair doing their Chuck Yeager best to elude the missiles until one clips the wings and sends the crew into a terrifying drop to the ground. Its a jolting coup de theatre and one that the movie never tops. Stackhouse downed by a broken leg is at the mercy of the ruthless Serbs as Burnett trying to reach high ground to radio for rescue witnesses his buddys execution. The entire Balkan conflict now comes down to Burnett -- who eludes more bullets than even a Hollywood superhero has any right to do -- vs. evil Serb commander Lokar (Olek Krupa) his tenacious marksman known only as Tracker (Vladimir Mashkov) and what looks like half the Serb army. To make matters worse for Burnett Reigart is hamstrung by the international accords from sending in a U.S. rescue squad anywhere near where hes fleeing. Though the executive battle between Reigart and Piquet is meant to carry heavy political meaning its dramatized despite Hackmans determined efforts in the clunkiest manner possible and it tends to only interrupt the suspense and pace of Burnetts race across Bosnia. Unfortunately Moores staging alternates unevenly between a strong grasp of suspense and a total surrender to the thinking that seeks the biggest possible bang. What could have been an emotionally draining episode as Burnett finds himself in a field of land mines ends up being a crude set piece to show off a domino-like string of explosions. On the other hand Moore captures the pure chaos of urban warfare as effectively as anything since Stanley Kubricks ""Full Metal Jacket"" in a startling sequence involving a Muslim enclave that reveals itself as a bombed-out shopping mall. Its clear that any action-oriented thesp could have handled the Burnett role since Wilson is given few moments beyond the opening section to give his own comic flavor to the character. What Moore and Co. truly could have used was Wilson the writer since the various attempts to bring a sense of off-kilter fun and even satire to the story are gravely half-hearted. Hackman doesnt generate his usual fire for the conflicted admiral who written differently could have been a great role for the hardest-working thesp in showbiz. The re-skedded release of ""Behind Enemy Lines"" contains unforeseen benefits and deficits. Beyond being in perfect tandem with the new national patriotism it appears at the same time as Danis Tanovics Cannes-awarded ""No Mans Land"" also set during the Bosnian war. The great difference -- and it proves to be all the difference in the world -- is Tanovics war-battered sense of the absurd and this pics unabashed flag-waving. The rush to the holidays has visibly forced cutting corners in the effects department producing both stunning and all-too-obviously digitized pyrotechnics. A cornucopia of optical tricks many of them already overused in the TV ad world Moore came out of tend to give pic an artificial feel. Just as off-putting is Don Davis score which given whats onscreen can only be termed bombastic.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"USATODAY.com - Balkan war film doesnt fly Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/03/2001 - Updated 0928 AM ET Balkan war film doesnt fly By Mike Clark USA TODAY Behind Enemy Lines (out of four) Stars Owen Wilson Gene Hackman Joaquim De Almeida David Keith Director John Moore Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for war violence and some language Somber Balkan events from the Clinton 90s remain in the public consciousness despite Septembers shift of our attentions. David Halberstams War in a Time of Peace deservedly is on the best-seller list and the Cannes-awarded No Mans Land opens in select cities next week. Thankfully neither work offers the pop-soundtrack bombast of the too-infrequently somber Behind Enemy Lines which sometimes reduces a mediocre pursuit movie with capable action to ""Rockin Bosnia."" Read more Video Behind Enemy Lines trailer That said theres nothing very rockin about seeing Gene Hackman give a rare indifferent performance as a Navy admiral trying to effect a rescue for which his hands are tied. Moved from a January release date after the recent surge in patriotism ex-TV commercial director John Moores debut feature gives top-billed Owen Wilson about 20 minutes to act typically goofy. Then his characters situation turns serious. As a jet navigator obliviously cruising through his final weeks on the USS Carl Vinson hes ordered on a photographic mission over a no-fly zone after Hackman reprimands him for his lousy attitude. Then the pilot of his F-18 is shot down by Serb troops. Thanks to the so-called ""Cincinnati Accords"" (did someone make a wrong turn off Interstate 75 on the way to Dayton?) the war is supposedly on hold. But mutual distrust is rampant and probably more so in Wilsons case after he witnesses Serbs execute his pilot. Immediately hes on the run dodging more close-call bullets than in every 1940s war film and Western put together. Hackman can track Wilson with satellites but cant help him because the NATO admiral (Joaquim De Almeida) nixes any attempts at an accords-wrecking rescue mission. Wilson will have to find a safe zone on his own. Because hes either going to make it or he isnt the movie has to make it on what Wilson experiences along the way. Some of the mine-filled rubble Wilson has to traverse is visually imposing and generates a little suspense but the Bosnians are as indifferently characterized as the guys back on the ship. The 1988 Vietnam drama Bat21 in which Hackman found himself trapped behind enemy lines wasnt any great shakes either. But it at least gave its actors at least a little more to work with. War movies come and go which is obviously better than wars doing the same. Calendar-jumping Enemy Lines is the first in a wave of such cinematic conflicts. And even if two of them -- No Mans Land and Black Hawk Down -- werent being released for year-end awards consideration it would be easy to speculate that others will be better. It wont take much to surpass Enemy Lines.

Starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. Directed by John Moore. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Behind Enemy Lines"" tips its hand early. Before the credits are over were treated to a sequence of soldiers and flags and fighter planes landing and taking off. All of it is done in shaky jump cuts with the soundtrack blaring. Then we meet our hero a flight navigator named Burnett played by Owen Wilson. Hes introduced in conversation with his pilot talking about all the rock stars killed in plane crashes and how a decent pilot might have saved Ritchie Valens from being ""a one-hit wonder."" The conversation has a few things wrong with it Its not funny. It says nothing about the character except maybe that hes an idiot which is not the intention (Ritchie Valens had several hits). And it has nothing to do with the movie. So we get the bad news. ""Behind Enemy Lines"" has a wretched script and a director (first-timer John Moore) who either has no taste or doesnt know what hes doing. The rest of the picture only confirms that impression. There is one flicker of hope though. After 15 minutes of having to watch Wilson we see his plane blow up over Bosnia. For a few seconds we think ""Oh great Wilsons out of the movie. Now it can really start."" But no. He has an ejector seat attached to a parachute. He and his pilot eject and land safely . . . behind enemy lines. Gene Hackman may have a big role but this is Wilsons movie. Nothing against Wilson. He can be amusing as a comic supporting player. But here hes the star in a drama. Even worse hes the star in a drama with a weak director and a script that would probably take a team of chimpanzees an afternoon to write. Under those circumstances there are only two things that could save ""Behind Enemy Lines"" star appeal and a compelling situation. The casting of Wilson undermines both. Acting serious Wilson just seems snide and sour. Hackman plays his superior officer a crusty admiral and the emotional heart of the movie is supposed to be the admirals growing affection for the young man. But what is there to like? Similarly the audiences involvement in the story hinges on just how much it cares whether Wilson makes it out safely. The American uniform will get an audience partly involved but there needs to be something else too. ""Oh no what will happen to Tom Cruise"" -- that might have worked. ""Oh no what will happen to Owen Wilson"" just doesnt cut it. ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is presented as though it were a true story but in fact it takes place in the near future. American peacekeepers working within NATO guidelines are flying reconnaissance missions over Bosnia. When the American plane goes down the admiral wants to send out a rescue team immediately. But NATO wont let him move. So the young navigator finds himself deep in hostile territory on his own looking to make it back to a safe zone. To survive he has to outwit armies and assassins and even run inches ahead of a series of exploding land mines. Hes quite a fella. Much of ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is made up either of action sequences or of scenes of Hackman in a control room monitoring the situation. Moores filming of the action which might have been a saving grace is inept. Every moment of tension becomes a montage but Moores no Abel Gance. Instead of giving us one strong composition he gives us 20 bad ones in five seconds then jiggles the camera just in case were not excited yet. Were not. On top of that he has a choir -- yes a choir -- belting out high notes over the sound of gunfire and the thundering score just to get us more nervous. Were not nervous. The current style of filming action is to film it neither from the perspective of the participants nor from that of an omniscient observer but rather as though a freaking-out newsreel photographer just happened to be standing there. Its a limited angle psychologically weak and lacking in information. . This film contains graphic violence.

As he awaits rescue by his Navy brothers Lieut. Chris Burnett must run for his life to elude his cold-blooded pursuers among them a tracker so inured to pleas for compassion that he smokes even while shooting a man in the head. (Somewhere in a parallel universe entertainment magazine editors are buzzing because popular prolific Russian actor-director Vladimir Mashkov costars as said nearly mute hitman in a Hollywood movie with the dude from Shanghai Noon) There are however some snafus to the successful deliverance of one stranded American in a perpetually gray land not his own Naive international types say the aviator had been unlawfully spying in a restricted fly zone--he photographed something incriminating that he wasnt meant to see--and a NATO bigwig doesnt want to further aggravate the locals by violating the peace treaty meant to keep warring smoking men from killing one another. The pilots commander Adm. Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is thus torn between behaving diplomatically--by inference spinelessly--as a cooperative peacekeeping partner and behaving heroically as a nuts-to-you American individualist courageous enough to rescue his boy no matter what the damage to NATO to prospects for peace or to his military career. The clock ticks towards a showdown involving a giant hilltop statue of an angel with a shot-off face and wing a daredevil U.S. Marine dangling on a rope from a helicopter and an attitudinal clash never anticipated by the studio What might have been enjoyed--or at least understood--three months ago as a dumb but harmless thriller about clever American soldiers who decisively triumph over murderous difficult-to-fathom Balkan squabblers with tar in their lungs and revenge on their minds now feels particularly boobish and trivial in a homeland enrolled in a crash course on internecine tribal warfare. Although the movie probably never had any intention of being taken seriously--for Petes sake the dude from Zoolander plays the kind of role in which Nicolas Cage usually glowers and flexes--the genres throwaway triviality feels all the more wasteful with daily headlines fixed on miseries in difficult-to-fathom Afghanistan. The enemies in Behind Enemy Lines are recognizable by their crappy Slavic nylon track jackets their slouching Slavic posture and the subtitles on screen whenever they talk their ruthless Slavic talk; these foreign foes might just as well have been represented by helium balloons tied to sticks for all their humanity. ""Give me a fight I can understand"" Lieutenant Burnett challenges shortly before his ill-fated recon mission. But this strenuous feature debut by Irish-born commercial director John Moore (who previously won advertising wars for Adidas Guinness and SEGA) isnt really excited about analyzing the battle--or the stakes either. He and his producers are far more jazzed by the visual kick of exploding land mines cocky flight maneuvers and easy-to-read signifiers of American cultural dominance. (The Muslim resistance fighters who give Burnett a ride in their rickety truck include a guy dressed like late-era Elvis and a teenager whose T-shirt bears the face of the rapper Ice Cube.) Wilson is as always an endearing performer--better his fetching grins than say Vin Diesels action-figure grimaces any day--but Wilson is also by temperament a persona whose natural gait is an amble not a sprint. Soaking in a tub in Shanghai Noon or even shaking with fear in The Haunting he charms with a stoners laconic calm the same geniality that made him so effectively creepy as a serial killer in The Minus Man. Hustling by contrast doesnt come naturally to him and many of the actors responses feel overly thought-through (or worse overly discussed with Moore while the makeup department supplied him with artful smears of blood and dirt). Left to his own devices meanwhile Hackman--even Hackman who is so gifted at portraying men whose commitment to good or evil can never be taken for granted--runs his character by the numbers. ""Life is tough Pull yourself together Evade and survive We will bring you home"" Reigart snaps to Burnett over the field radio by way of a pep talk by way of The Last of the Mohicans. ""I intend to put you in harms way"" he later barks to the troops about to go in for the pyrotechnical finale. We the people are meant to cheer in response but the spirit isnt willing. War is hell but so is peace--at least when it comes to movies in a no-mans-land like this one.

Owen Wilson stars as Chris Burnett a Navy aviator whos shot down and chased across the snowy Bosnian countryside while Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman) his tough-love commanding officer eggs him on with terse walkie-talkie-fed instructions. Moores idea of mixing it up is to alter the angle of the terrain Wilson plunges down while enemy soldiers try to kill him. And boy do they ever try to kill him. Before its all over hell have to sidestep more abrasion-raising assaults than Osama Bin Laden. At the beginning of the picture Burnett and his pilot/best friend Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are frustrated by a situation thats come to be a staple of modern war movies Americas supposed refusal to let its armed forces win a conflict. More often than not the ""Why wont they let us win?"" speech is connected to Vietnam -- remember how the spit flies when Sylvester Stallone delivers his address in ""First Blood?"" -- but an imaginary situation in Bosnia is ""Behind Enemy Lines"" more topical substitute.
