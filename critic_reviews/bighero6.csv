And theres a Feast before the film even starts. Go to Disneys Big Hero 6 and youll see a wonderful movie the short cartoon before the animated feature. In Feast a Boston terrier named Winston feeds on the treats his master tosses him bacon and eggs pizza nachos -- all the snacks a single man thrives on. When the man begins seeing a woman the scraps left for Winston turn organic a Brussels sprout topped with a sprig. In six minutes writer-director Patrick Osborne synopsizes a dozen years in a mans life from loner to dater to husband and father as seen and shared by winsome Winston. Shot with a narrow color palette and dramatically flat shapes and overflowing with heartful wit Feast is a banquet for all lovers of dogs food and movies. Stick around for the feature attraction -- on which Osborne worked as co-head of animation -- and youll find another non-human character every bit as appealing as Winston. Its Baymax a robot caregiver for young Hiro the hero of Big Hero 6. In repose Baymax fits into a small suitcase. But when it hears the word ""Ow"" it inflates into a six-foot white vinyl balloon animal with black eyes and the pudgy shape of the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters or Po the Kung Fu Panda. Programmed to speak in a benign avuncular tone (voiced by Scott Adsit) as he detects and corrects health problems Baymax becomes the fussy guardian of Hiro his friends and virtually any other creature it sees. Finding a big orange cat Baymax pets it and soothingly whispers ""Hairy baby"" Hiro (Ryan Potter) needs help. In the future city of San Fransokyo this 14-year-old brainiac makes his living as a petty criminal hustling his own prize robot at underground bot fights. Adhering to a Disney tradition as old as Snow White and as recent as Frozen the new movie makes Hiro an orphan who must fend for himself. He then loses his big brother and fellow science genius Tadashi Hamada (Daniel Henney) in an act of sabotage at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology where they have both become students. To solve the mystery of his brothers death he teams with four other SFIT misfits perky Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) lumbering Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) cool GoGo (Jamie Chung) and party-hearty Fred (T.J. Miller). Add the resourceful Baymax and you have the Big Hero 6 team. Directed by Don Hall (Winnie the Pooh) and Chris Williams (Bolt) and very loosely based on a lesser galaxy of Marvel Comics characters this is the rare Disney animated feature that sets out to establish a franchise. (If its a hit therell surely be a Big Hero 6 2.0.) Except for Baymax and possibly Hiro the team members are rudimentary sketches of clumsy or foxy nerds; the amiably doltish Fred for example is simply a pale copy of Shaggy the Scooby-Doo sidekick voiced by Casey Kasem. Initially meant to illustrate the effective use of brain power the kids transform themselves into a military-industrial complex becoming weapons masters in a montage scored to Fall Out Boys ""Immortals."" (Even Baymax gets outfitted in red Iron Man armor.) In sum they are the Mission Impossible crew relocated to San Fransokyos Mission district -- or to make a Disney-Pixar comparison The Incredibles without the emotion or verve. The plot which involves the theft of the microbots Hiro has invented is also on the generic side a Kabuki-masked villain has turned Hiros potentially life-saving bots into an army of evil shape-shifting dominoes. But in the screenplay by Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts theres also an odd parental twist. Having killed off Hiros mother father and older brother and allowing the other team members no visible parents the writers introduce two father figures who are either untrustworthy (tech titan Alistair Krei who is voiced by Alan Tudyk and looks like a sleazy Julian Assange) or violently missing presumed dead (the Malden-faced SFIT Dean Robert Callaghan voiced by James Cromwell). So its odd that the third act should turn on a father who is both grieving and enraged. If the story doesnt grab you the visuals will. San Fransokyo is sumptuously designed as a clash of Tokyo and Bay Area architecture; the Golden Gate Bridge tower is pagoda-shaped. The kids like those in anime books and movies have Japanese-American features suggesting the melding of races as our future world interbreeds attractively. Finest of the movies hybrids is Baymax a robot whos also a mensch. He doesnt have much competition but hes the most human character in Big Hero 6. On the high-quality scale set by the Disney animated features in their latest Renaissance -- The Princess and the Frog Tangled Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen -- this one doesnt quite measure up. But Big Hero 6 is sure to entertain millions of smart kids and their escort parents. They may all want Baymax as their personal caregiver. And if they see the adorable Feast therell be a run on Boston terriers as Christmas pets. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

(Photo Disney)Baymax is a loveable huggable inflatable robot -- who doesnt want one of those? -- and he belongs in a movie more loveable and huggable than ""Big Hero 6.""A computer-animated mash-up of Japanese and American cultures (it takes place in San Fransokyo a dream rendering of San Francisco and Tokyo) ""Big Hero 6"" is a friendship tale and an action flick that winds up lost in translation.The story centers on Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) a kid genius and his relationship with Baymax (Scott Adsit) a puffy bag of air who resembles an untoned version of the Michelin Man.Baymax -- every time a character says his name it sounds for the world like ""Betamax"" -- is soft sweet and gentle his sympathetic eyes and mouth formed by what looks like the outline of a barbell. Hes a robot programmed to provide health care -- an interactive Minute Clinic -- and Hiro rewires him to become his superhero pal.The world already has plenty of superheroes of course and ""Big Hero 6"" which is based on a Marvel Comic because most things these days are based on a Marvel Comic falters as a superhero movie. The relationship between Baymax and Hiro provides enough to play with that ""Big Hero 6"" doesnt need to turn into a loud cluttered action film but thats where the story goes.Hiro teams up with a group of brainiac students who use their amateur inventor skills to become superheroes themselves to take on an evil genius in a Kabuki mask who is threatening naturally to take over the world.In our pro-nerd tech-heavy superhero-obsessed culture ""Big Hero 6"" hits on all manner of popular themes. It favors brains over muscles and celebrates the power of friendship -- good messages all.But the big heroes who make up the ""6"" feel like bit players instead of full-fledged characters. Only the slacker-type Fred (voiced by T.J. Miller) stands out; the others arent memorable enough to fill their own action figure molds. Theyre like the Avengers not-very-interesting nieces and nephews.Directors Don Hall (co-director of 2011s ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (co-director of ""Bolt"") start strong but ""Big Hero 6s"" inconsistent script builds to an overly busy standard action movie climax that detracts from the simple story about a boy and his cuddly robot pal.""Big Hero 6"" does make strides in terms of diversity and setting and its refreshing to see a movie for kids that acknowledges a world bigger than America. It may have more to do with worldwide box office potential than education but its a start.Kids will leave the theater wanting their own Baymax and who can blame them? Its the rest of the ""Heroes"" that dont measure up; the robot full of air is the most real thing in the movie.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaBig Hero 6GRADE C+Rated PG for action and peril some rude humor and thematic elementsRunning time 105 minutes 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1qsN2Ws MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/11/07/big-hero-movie-review/18608507/,200,bighero61,bighero6,detroitnews
"Taste the Rainbow The Mouthwatering Colors of Big Hero 6 << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Taste the Rainbow The Mouthwatering Colors of Big Hero 6 Disney Movies November 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Whats the word for the experience of being overwhelmed by one sense so intensely that it makes your other senses jealous? The aroma of coffee can make you mad that its rarely how coffee tastes. This is the exasperating exhilaration of a certain state-of-the-art mass-market animation You want to eat it and you cant. Im not talking about Ratatouille which is set in kitchens and features long stretches of cheese and vegetables and sauce. And Im not not talking about it because the food is co-cooked by a rat. The meals in Ratatouille look perfectly real and edible. I mean movies like Bolt and two installments of Rio and parts of Despicable Me movies that dont need to be about food because they are food. This is the particular miserable bliss of Big Hero 6 a movie so slick-looking and richly glazed that its weird of Disney not to serve it on a plate. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage Coloring in animated movies has reached a place beyond conventional realness. Its in a hyper-sensory realm. Merely watching Big Hero 6 feels inadequate. It does something synesthetic. Its true that I didnt see it in 3-D but Im not sure getting closer to the images would have kept me from trying to leap through the screen. This movie is so energetically fulgent and steroidally sweet that watching it is basically like losing your mind in the drug-store candy aisle. You want to lick the light and bite fake plastic and metal. (This must be what its like for kids to stand in front of a Jeff Koons.) I dont know whether scientists have found a correlation between films that look like this and childrens addiction to them. But The Lego Movie looks like a galaxy of hard candy and happens to have grossed a zillion dollars. There are movies that treat you like a toddler and movies that reduce you to one. Big Hero 6 is the latter. You want to shove the whole thing in your mouth. The superhero story here comes from a Marvel comic book that has been rejiggered to pluck emotional chords. This version is a dramatic comedy about a 14-year-old science genius named Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) who loses his big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) in a fire and winds up forming a costumed collective to chase a bad guy all over the city of San Fransokyo. The collective is aided by a big white health care robot named Baymax that Tadashi invented and Hiro perfected. Some of the pleasure in the movie comes from the high standards of verisimilitude that movie animators set for themselves. Baymax speaks with the kind mildness of Scott Adsits voice and looks like a blob of inflated dessert. The animators have found the right light to reflect all of the balloon characters synthetic surfaces fashioning an illusion of featherweight density that is also believably matte. Your fingers want to feel it. Its easier to like this movie because of the casual low stakes of the enterprise. Big Hero 6 was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams from a script credited to Robert L. Baird Dan Gerson and Jordan Roberts and produced by John Lasseter and none of them is trying to reinvent anything here. The themes of death and loss are the dramatic centerpiece but they dont overwhelm the movie. Theres a moment of altruism near the climax that might get to you but youve probably been more reliant on Kleenex at other animated movies. The movie is not a tragedy. Its a decent action-adventure that makes you fall deeply in love with an instrument of good health. The real fantasy here is reducing insurance premiums and curbing awful infectious diseases. Its possible to see a subplot involving a wormhole a father and a daughter and to think about Interstellar though Big Hero 6 is certainly the zippier movie. They do share a belief in sciences power to improve lives. But Big Hero 6 doesnt need to use alarmism to justify that belief. Its agenda lies elsewhere. The saturation of color extends to the ideas of race and ethnicity. San Fransokyo is piquantly Asian the props costumes architecture and characters; the pagodas and Kabuki masks and comic use of a Kaiju Big Battel getup as a crime-fighting outfit. If this movie is making a point its profound for being ancillary Asians do stuff too. The five-nerd team Hiro puts together has just one white guy voiced by T. J. Miller sounding like a stoner. The rest of the gang is made up of two women and a black guy named Wasabi. Their voices belong to actors of color (Jamie Chung Genesis Rodriguez and Damon Wayans Jr.). The filmmakers know that these shifts in perspective are a big deal but theyve concocted a world that obviates a word like ""multicultural."" Multicultural just describes culture. The filmmakers are more interested in using color to make more visceral evocations. Instead of race what you think of is actual color. The villain rides around San Fransokyo on millions of little black ""microbots"" that Hiro invented and the villain stole. Strung together they become gushing licorice. Which makes you wonder Does Baymax offer dental?

It is also a beauty to behold for its skillful digital animation in 3D. Surprisingly perhaps Big Hero 6 is also quite poignant and sophisticated on the emotional side. It deals with tragedy (the death of a loved one). It boldly explores the effect of clinical depression (involving the 14-year-old hero Hiro Hamada). In a related subplot it addresses the senselessness of taking revenge through violence (the super-villain is truly evil for personal reasons). That is a lot to deal with in a movie aimed at youngsters. Fortunately co-directors Dan Hall and Chris Williams do an excellent job of balancing these dark emotional themes with giddy-sweet humour and gonzo adventure thrills. Big Hero 6 is an origins story for a superhero team -- one kid four eccentric and brainy adults and one mind-blowing robot. It focuses on the life of Hiro a genius teen living in San Fransoyko. This is a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo that reflects the East-West cultural mashup and the Americanization of Japanese manga and anime traditions. Both cultures are respected even in the casting. Hiro is voiced with great range and humanity by Japanese-American actor Ryan Potter. As the movie begins Hiro is a science prodigy wasting his time building micro-robots for bot fights. His older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) is a robotics engineer who encourages the teen to enroll in his ""geek school"" to better use his skills. Tadashi has already created a huggable human-sized robot named Baymax (voiced to marvellous effect by Scott Adsit who puts the guile into the beguiling sequences). Baymax is programmed to be a health care worker although Hiro eventually gives him extra oomph. The tragedy launches Hiros depression the revenge plot and the creation of the Big Hero 6 team. In between these extremes the co-directors give Big Hero 6 a lot of fun stuff as well as a lot of action scenes that remind me of other action movies. But it is worth noting that Hall (who co-directed Winnie the Pooh) and Williams (who helmed the under-appreciated Bolt) are at the top of their game as is their computer animation crew. Older viewers (and reportedly some executives from the Marvel Cinematic Universe) might find the Hiro-Baymax relationship and the robots design to be too Disney-fied. As in childish. That may be a legitimate concern. But look at it another way. Baymax is instantly likable especially for children. But the character is also powerful in communicating his peaceful tender nature. Meanwhile the design was inspired by soft-bodied robots being developed in the real world to make artificial intelligence less threatening. This Disney movie is tapping into something profound here. Big Hero 6 is not a perfect movie however. The action sequences get repetitive and tiresome some backstory is convoluted and ""The Big Reveal"" is not much of a surprise. These are faults but not game-breakers. Big Hero 6 still has so much going for it that the obvious sequel will be welcome in my world.

But the huggable Baymax in Disneys newest animated sensation Big Hero 6 is one of the many elements of surprise in this superhero origin tale.The story begins in the streets of San Fransokyo an imaginary futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo where cocky teen prodigy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is about to pull one over on an underground robot fight. When things start to get heated big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) whisks Hiro away from the shady world only to be caught by the police. Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) who became the boys guardian after the deaths of their parents when Hiro was just a toddler must bail them out. As the lone father figure in Hiros life Tadashi tries to persuade Hiro who graduated high school at 13 to use his genius in a positive way. Tadashi seemingly gives in to Hiros vice and offers to take him to the next robot fight. Instead Tadashi takes a detour to his school lab at San Fransokyo Tech where Hiro meets his brothers nerdy friends and gets inspired by their science projects.Theres Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) a detail-oriented neat freak who is building a precision plasma blade. Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) is a close-talker chemist who is as bubbly as her chemical concoctions. The sarcastic speedster GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung) is a tough-as-nails daredevil who uses maglev discs as wheels on her bicycles and on foes. Lastly theres Fred (T.J. Miller) who is seriously just a dude. The unregistered student hangs out at the lab for kicks. Hes the ultimate fanboy and comic book aficionado who always has ideas for what his brainiac friends could invent for the superhero quests in his mind. After meeting the coeds Hiro is introduced to Tadashis pride and joy Baymax (Scott Adsit) a healthcare bot that he hopes will help millions someday. When someone has a medical ailment Baymax springs into action. He assesses the persons health (""On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate your pain?"") helps with treatment and wont deactivate until the patient is satisfied with the care the robot provides. Hiro is impressed but is ready to go to his next fight when he runs into Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell) the head of the robotics program and Tadashis mentor. The 14-year-old boy genius is so in awe of the professor that he vows to try to get into the school. Hiro works feverishly to create an invention that would wow Callaghan at the schools expo. When he gets stuck Tadashi urges Hiro to ""use that big brain of yours to think your way out."" At the expo a tragic event forces Hiro to find his own way in the world. With the help of Baymax and his new band of lab brothers and sisters Hiro sets out to solve a mystery and as Fred aptly puts ""Do you feel this? Our origin story begins."" Big Hero 6 is very loosely based on the Marvel comics of the same name. But aside from the title and the names of some of the characters the film weaves a completely original tale. Thats OK because most viewers likely have never heard of the 1998 comics.The Disney foray distinguishes itself not only in the animation but also the storytelling. If the scenes in San Fransokyo look like nothing youve ever seen in 3-D its because Walt Disney Animation Studios created a proprietary system that allows filmmakers to animate hundreds of thousands of unique background characters. But it is the story that will enrapture audiences with its delicate balance between pain and empowerment humor and humility and grief and the pursuit of goodness. Big Hero 6 offers something for everyone action camaraderie superheroes and villains. But mostly Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering and a hug that can be felt through the screen.Dont miss the opening short Feast about a dog named Winstons appetite for love and stay until the very end of the credits for a comedic cameo that fangirls and fanboys will especially appreciate.

But who wouldnt want a health-care provider like Baymax of ""Big Hero 6""? Sure Hiro Hamada may be the young brainiac with the story arc in Disneys zippy animated feature but the over-sized inflatable robot invented to be a personal health assistant is irresistible. The action starts in a Amer-Asian burg called San Fransokyo. Under-age Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) is visiting a robot-fighting gambling parlor. Only the innocent with a rudimentary bot isnt such a naif after all. And that bot well... Big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) saves the 14-year-old prodigys hide. Better he tricks the rebellious Hiro into a visit to his university where Tadashi has been designing robots including Baymax. There Hiro meets a group of appealing geeks GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Wasabi (Damon Wayons Jr.). Theyre the sort of eclectic crew youve come to expect of superhero teams snarky and gifted driven and quirky. Colorado native and ""Silicon Valley"" star T.J. Miller lends his affably slacker cadence to Fred a sci-tech fanboy with unexpected means. ""Big Hero 6"" celebrates nerd culture. And not merely the pop-culture- obsessed version (comic books) but the lets-invent-something-cool kind. Hey kids this PG flick asserts its good be taken with technology crushed out on code wowed by chemistry. Smitten by what he sees at the school Hiro designs a bot that impresses Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) as well as corporate honcho Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk). Maya Rudolph rounds out the movies adult contingent as Tadashi and Hiros legal guardian Aunt Cass who loves the boys if she doesnt always understand whats going on in their eggheads. ""Big Hero 6"" introduces tragedy then teases with a masked villain who steals Hiros invention. The inspiration for this movie is a Marvel comic and its easy to imagine this clique interning for the Avengers Tony Stark. The group uses their skills to create superhero personas. The transformations are fun and funny but writers Robert Baird and Daniel Gerson never lose sight of the true character of these accidental crime fighters. They also make sure that in trying to remake the utterly compassionate Baymax (Scott Adsit) into an armored toughie Hiro learns much about his own makeup. David Bowie should repurpose the lyrics of one of his and Brian Enos best tunes for this joyrides protagonist his bot caretaker and aspiring nerds everywhere. Yes ""We could be Hiros.""

It Just Did Is Toy Story 3 the Best Pixar Movie Ever? All Stories >> Alert all social media The breakthrough star of the season is here. His name is Baymax and hes impossible not to love. Every home should have one. This irresistible blob of roly-poly robot charisma is a digital doughboy who steals every scene hes in. The 3-D animated Big Hero 6 from the caffeinated marketing minds at Disney and Marvel would be a ton less fun without him. More News Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff The Best and Worst Movies of 2014 So Far Can a Good Movie Top the Box Office? It Just Did Is Toy Story 3 the Best Pixar Movie Ever? All Stories >> Set in a futuristic Asian-fusion melting pot called San Fransokyo (get it?) this cinematic take on a Marvel comic I never heard of focuses on two orphaned tech-nerd brothers. Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a teen into making technology a game of bot fights. His college student bro Tadashi (Daniel Henney) is more into design and brainiac concepts.  Then in the Disney manner disaster strikes. Poor Hiro is alone in the world. Except for Baymax (endearingly voiced by Scott Adsit) a chubby hunk of inflatable white vinyl with two black eyes and the gentlest disposition a computer ever generated. Baymax is a walking version of Obamacare a bot whos been built to heal. But if  Hiro is going to find the evildoers  behind the disaster  and enlist Tadashis pals in the process he must first teach Baymax a few handy  kung-fu street-fighting tricks. You can see where this is going. Luckily directors Don Hall and Chris Williams cover familiar ground with bracing energy and style. The physical comedy involving the bonding of Hiro and Baymax is pure pleasure. And credit screenwriters Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts for showing respect for the grief Hiro is feeling and Baymax can only try to heal. Big Hero 6 falls short of the Pixar genius at work in say The Incredibles and WALL-E but it flies high on unabashed hilarity and heart. This ones a winner. And Baymax baby call your agent.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Big Hero 6s considerable graces as an animated film--its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion--are offset by its deficiencies as a second-rate superhero flick. The movie is imaginative in its handling of Baymax--its Miyazakian balloon-man often seen looming over a runty teenage boys shoulder or struggling to squeeze past furniture--and its Japanese-American near-future setting and derivative in most other respects. Ultimately it sacrifices something unique and poignant in favor of the kind of loud instantly forgettable team-effort showdown familiar from countless live-action Marvel movies of the past decade. Thats a shame because Baymax--an inflatable medical robot designed by a college student and left in the care of his whiz-kid brother--is such a terrific image of both otherworldliness and gentleness a figure without angles barely able to get through a doorway guided by pure programmed selflessness. In the age of computer animation which is increasingly concerned with applying realistic textures and physics to non-realistic figures the smooth white Baymax seems like a throwback to the playfulness of hand-drawn animation his shape and movements continually distorted. Voiced by Scott Adsit with a mixture of naivete and deep-seated caring Baymax acts like a visitor from another more generous world--the world of technological promise.Very very loosely adapted from an obscure Marvel title (lets just say the original Baymax is anything but cuddly) Big Hero 6 is set in San Fransokyo an imaginary hybrid city with San Franciscos geography and Tokyos architecture where Blade Runner-style airships crisscross the sky and remote-controlled robots duke it out in back-alley betting parlors. Here 14-year-old orphan Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) enlists Baymax in his search for a kabuki-masked villain who is wreaking havoc using an army of nanobots based on one of Hiros designs. There is something elegant in the idea of pitting Baymax bumbling symbol of altruistic science against a dangerous and misused technology and theres more than a hint of poignancy in the fact that Baymax is aiding Hiro because he is his ""patient"" believing that spending time with friends (i.e. assembling a superhero team) and going on adventures will help the boy deal with unresolved grief. But once the team--laser-wielding neat-freak Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) high-tech chemist Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) disc-throwing speed-skater Go Go (Jamie Chung) and kaiju-obsessed freegan stoner Fred (T.J. Miller)--comes together and Hiro outfits Baymax with a rocket-powered exoskeleton the movie loses sight of all the things that made it special. When Hiro and Baymax--his body deflated and his speech slurred because of a low battery--sneak around the house where Hiro lives with his aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) they register as characters; blasting away at the bad guy while dressed in brightly colored reflective armor they seem like little more than a couple of generic costumes doing battle with a hackneyed trope.

Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a wayward boy genius who gives up back-alley bot-fighting for more purposeful scientific research with his brother. But when that brother is killed in a freak explosion all Hiro is left with is a bottomless well of grief and his siblings masterwork invention a robotic ""health care companion"" named Baymax. This inflatable golem of empathy is at the center of Disneys marketing for the film and for good reason--with his adorable naivete and perfectly deadpan line readings courtesy of 30 Rocks Scott Adsit he bounces away with the whole movie. The initial scenes between these two are among Heros best but the film starts gearing up early for the third-act climax a smash-and-fly destructathon that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a blockbuster superhero or otherwise in the past 10 years. Hiro Baymax and four research buddies equip themselves as tech-assisted warriors to take on a masked supervillain controlling millions of tiny swarming microbots and a giant threatening portal to another dimension. All this kicks up a lot of narrative detritus but the story knows when to pull back. Hiros sadness over his brothers passing isnt just treated as a one-and-done origin story--it infuses every decision and emotional junction in the film. Baymax programmed to be tender and nonviolent is a wonderful antidote to the countless big-screen superprotagonists who walk away from the moral ramifications of their collateral damage like they do from big explosions without looking back. At times Big Hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms.

"Big Hero 6 Disneys new animated kids movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Marvel Makes Its Play for the Animated Kids Movie Demo Marvel Makes Its Play for the Animated Kids Movie Demo Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 7 2014 1150 AM Marvels Coming for Your Kids Big Hero 6 is pretty good--at grooming its young audience to love live-action comic book blockbusters for life. By Dana Stevens Hiro and Baymax in Big Hero 6. Photo courtesy Disney Its been a good year at the movies for large benevolent goofy nonhuman sidekicks. There was Guardians of the Galaxys lovable plant-man Groot Interstellars selfless space robot TARS and now Baymax the marshmallowlike inflatable health aide whos pledged to protect the 14-year-old protagonist of Disneys newest 3-D animated feature Big Hero 6. Baymax (voiced by 30 Rocks Scott Adsit) has been programmed to offer a range of health care options from chest defibrillation to Band-Aids and he wont rest--or deflate--until the human hes serving is satisfied. This sentient puff of white vinyl has a face thats surprisingly expressive given that it consists of nothing more than two black dots connected by a straight line. From the moment hes accidentally activated Baymax proves as loyal persistent and endearing as a pet Labrador retriever--and often appears to grasp whats going on at about Labrador level. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. With his lumbering egg-shaped body and stubby kneeless legs Baymax at first seems like an odd protector for the boy Hiro an aspiring young superhero who teams up with the robot and four others to make the ""big six"" of the title. Dragged along on a frantic foot chase Baymax warns his companion in a neutral robot voice tinged with a hint of Eeyore sadness that ""I am not fast."" But Baymaxs guileless devotion and pleasingly rotund animation are the best things about this lively and appealing if less-than-original family movie (which has been adapted from a Marvel comic book property but which feels in spirit and style more like a lesser project from Pixar--in fact though its directed by Disney veterans Don Hall and Chris Williams the executive producer is Pixar guru John Lasseter). The second-best thing about Big Hero 6 is the animation design of the fictional city where it takes place a sunnily futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo. The Golden Gate Bridge (a frequent center of the action most notably in one exhilarating scene of flight) is now topped by architectural flourishes like those on an ancient Japanese temple. Victorian houses and noodle stands line the whimsically imagined streets above which twist interlocking elevated highways. Asian culture in Big Hero 6 isnt just an exotic bit of stage decor but a constantly felt presence right down to the half-Japanese half-Anglo ethnicity of Hiro (very nicely voiced by Ryan Potter). Especially when Baymax is doing his adorable-puffy-robot thing Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids movie. Advertisement Like his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney)--a robotics student who invented Baymax as part of a college project--Hiro is a technology whiz. He graduated high school at age 13 but since then hes been wasting his brainpower on designing miniature fighting robots for the shady back-alley bot battles that will apparently be the illegal dogfights of the future. A visit to the university lab where Tadashi and his tech-geek cohorts have been working on an array of absurdly rad inventions inspires Hiro to get his act together and apply to the elite program himself. But the unveiling of his big audition project is interrupted by an unforeseeable disaster. In the aftermath an unknown party makes off with a sample of Hiros project--an army of thousands of flying microbots who execute their owners every command. Hard to imagine what off-label uses that might have should it ever fall into the hands of say a Kabuki-mask-wearing supervillain ... Especially when Baymax is onscreen doing his adorable-puffy-robot thing Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids movie with enough cross-generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee. But I couldnt shake the feeling that this film was designed to function as a starter kit for future Marvel aficionados a way to start grooming the still-under-4-foot-tall crowd for the rollout of live-action comic book blockbusters thats now programmed up through 2019. Perhaps thats why the movie Big Hero 6 most resembles in its action scenes (of which there are too many) is Guardians of the Galaxy albeit in a gentler more child-friendly guise. Theres also a familiar sniping camaraderie among the supernerd team that eventually assembles to help Hiro get his bots back persnickety Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) shambolic Fred (T.J. Miller) tough girl GoGo (Jamie Chung) and ultrageek Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez). The intrigue with the Kabuki-masked villain and the stolen micro-bots barely clears the solvability bar of a Scooby-Doo plotline and the tragic backstory provided for the bad guy is depressingly generic. (Can we go back for a while to having villains who are mean just ... cause?) Top Comment Wait so the criticism is ""Your kids may like this movie too much""?  More... -Mark Russo Join In As for Baymaxs motive for helping young Hiro retrieve his lost invention its just altruism a selfless (albeit software-based) drive to keep the boy as healthy and happy as possible. Im not sure we can impute that level of altruism to Disney/Marvels relationship with the kids who are Big Hero 6s target audience. These two entertainment behemoths (joined into a single unholy entity by the formers 2009 acquisition of the latter) may come at our progeny with their cute puffy arms extended for a hug but theyre not planning on releasing them from that embrace anytime soon.

Entertainment 6 Reasons To Fall In Love With Disneys ""Big Hero 6"" The latest Disney movie is more than just the animation giants first superhero feature. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Disney ID 4182398 1. Theres plenty of Pixar to it. View this image > Disney Big Hero 6 which is directed by Don Hall (Winnie the Pooh) and Chris Williams (Bolt) is the product of the ruthlessly calculated mating of two giant brands -- Marvel owners of the comic book superhero team on which the movies loosely based and Walt Disney Animation Studios Disneys flagship of animated features going back to 1937s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. But in spirit it owes just as much to Pixar the other animation studio that executive producer John Lasseter oversees and that isnt releasing a film this year. Big Hero 6 is a childrens film but its one in which death is a real presence. Its more emotionally sophisticated dealing with themes of grief and finding your place in the world that are more grounded than the high-flying adventures theyre surrounded by would have you expect. It recalls at times Monsters Inc. as well as Pixars own superhero movie The Incredibles and theres a touch of DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon and Brad Birds The Iron Giant to it as well. Its not on the level of Pixar at its best -- its superhero origin story is by the book and does nothing unexpected -- but the central relationship between its 14-year-old protagonist Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) and the robot Baymax (Scott Adsit) definitely shares the right kind of endearing weirdness and surprising resonance. ID 4182376 2. Its set in a city thats a hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo. View this image > Disney San Fransokyo is a cleverly conceived and gorgeously realized fantasy metropolis filled with alternate universe versions of familiar San Francisco landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge (now shaped like torii) Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. Its got cable cars as well as elevated trains Victorian houses and Japanese signage. Its San Francisco but its also denser taller and more neon with koinobori-inspired wind turbines flying high above the city like kites and presumably generating power a magically mashed-up place. ID 4182399 3. Its hero Hiro is biracial. View this image > Disney And as far as I can figure hes Disneys first multiracial main character -- he and his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) are half-white and half-Japanese and are both voiced by hapa actors. While the Mouse House has offered up protagonists of color before like Mulan Aladdin Pocahontas and Tiana Big Hero 6 offers Disneys most diverse slate of characters to date and its most contemporarily diverse world. It may be Japan-inflected but its setting is thrillingly and matter-of-factly multiracial both in terms of the characters and the actors voicing them including Jamie Chung Damon Wayans Jr. and Genesis Rodriguez. ID 4182401 4. Baymax is a marvel of cuteness engineering. Disney Disney Diversity aside nifty composite city setting aside theres Big Hero 6s breakout character. The round squishy heart and thing everyone will be talking about after seeing the movie is Baymax the robot who accompanies Hiro on his battle against a mysterious masked villain whos stolen the nanobot tech Hiro invented. Baymax has been re-imagined as a medical robot its designer deliberately chose to make out of inflatable vinyl for extra approachability -- its durable and strong but also like a giant marshmallow that comes with its own first aid kit. Baymax gets leveled up and given some handy armor and additions but its main concerns are still the health and well-being of Hiro and his friends. Baymax is the result of some genius-level adorable character design waddling away from danger (""I am not fast"" it unnecessarily notes) inflating itself like an air mattress fixing leaks with tape and attempting to fist-bump which it accompanies with a sound thats never not funny. As voiced by Adsit Baymax is warmly but mechanically even-keeled in everything but its the physical comedy that comes from how Baymax moves and reacts to things that makes the character so instantly endearing. ID 4182405 5. Its characters are unabashed nerds. View this image > Disney Theyre still a very photogenic bunch but the Big Hero 6 team is comprised of robotics and engineering students enrolled at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology -- and Hiro is a 14-year-old prodigy who starts off the film hustling his way around underground robot fighting matches. Theyre a whole team of Peter Parkers self-described nerds who may not make for memorable superheroes (aside from Baymax) but whose powers are nicely matched to the projects they work on at the lab. ID 4182408 6. Its a story about mourning and moving on. View this image > Disney Even as Big Hero 6 hits the usual beats in its superhero arc it spins out a parallel narrative about Hiros process of mourning a major personal loss and how hes dealing or not dealing with his grief. Hes a boy genius but hes also a moody teenager. Hes not always articulate about how he feels and his anger and sadness sometime bubble out in ways that lead him astray. Baymax is the axis on which Hiros personal journey and the whole fight with the masked baddie turn -- the whole reason he helps out is because he believes it will help heal Hiros troubled emotional state. It all comes together in an ending more tearjerking than youd think possible for a mechanical balloon cyborg whose only facial expression is blinking. Superheroes may come and go but kids and their lovable non-human sidekicks are forever.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 07 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 07 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Don Hall Chris Williams Written by Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson Jordan Roberts Starring Ryan Potter and Scott Adsit Classification PG Country USA Language English The Marvel Entertainment movie universe being as much an integrated commercial monolith as it is a narrative one it only makes sense that the company under the auspices of parent overlord Disney would be coming after your children. This season stockings may well runneth over with licensed goodies from Big Hero 6. Master of macabre Tim Burton attends the opening of a new exhibition dedicated to his work in Japan. (Oct. 31) AP Video Video Video Director Tim Burton feted by Japanese film fans Based on a Marvel comic from which it nevertheless liberally departs the full-length CGI cartoon directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams is a fantasy of techno-geek wish fulfilment in which the boy-genius computer whiz Hiro forms a motley alliance of fellow geeks - and one Stay Puft Marshmallow Man of a robot - into a costumed fighting force dedicated to defeating the guy who stole our kids most brilliant invention mini Lego-like bot-chips that can configure into any shape their master wills.This being a Disney product we shouldnt be all that surprised that what this all boils down to is a matter of copyright theft Hiro may be marshalling his nutty avengers - Go Go Wasabi Honey Lemon and Fred - in the interest of avenging the death of a brother who might have perished in the hostile takeover of his concept but whats just as at stake here is rightful ownership. This being a cartoon superpowers are enlisted instead of lawyers.This being a blatant effort at kickstarting yet another Marvel movie franchise the movie is obligated to navigate the expositional startup swamp that bogs down so many spinoff-minded superhero movies. In this case the simple setting up of the superheroes and their mission takes up so much time that the mission itself - getting those misappropriated mini-bots back from the bad guy in a kabuki mask - gets backloaded and squeezed into an frantic final third. And it leaves you wondering How many kids really I mean really care how the Big Hero 6 got to be that way and why as long as theyre the Big Hero 6.That being said its in the movies structural weakness that youll find both its comic and animated strengths. The balloon-like robot Baymax a walking inflatable pillow-man who repairs his own sprung leaks with Scotch tape and gets sloppy-drunk clumsy and maudlin when low on battery power is an extraordinarily funny cartoon creation and the scenes where Hiros simply trying to get this ungainly airbag under control are easily the movies most golden moments. (Not to mention the reason theyre the ones dominating the movies trailers.) Indeed whenever Baymax isnt around or even when hes in fully armoured superheroic mode the movie itself starts to sputter and sag.Also commendable is the overall conceptual visual design of Big Hero 6 which plays out in a richly articulated pan-Pacific metropolis called San Fransokyo that provides one of the most arresting hybrid-Amerasian urban landscapes since Blade Runner. Although perhaps partly tactical - the movies target audience being as globally mashed-up and borderless as the city itself - the setting also ensures a constant level of background visual excitement in a movie that can certainly use the distraction. So if its less a cohesive experience on its own than a trailer of sorts for future spinoffs Big Hero 6 isnt entirely without its own attractions. Consider it a more family-friendly Guardians of the Galaxy with the added kiddie appeal of a big inflatable windbag to laugh at and love.

(Disney)By David Hiltbrand Inquirer Staff WriterPosted November 08 2014Gorgeous and disturbing Big Hero 6 is a departure for Disney a film targeted at older kids and the studios first venture into straight-up comic book culture. Walt would flip in his cryogenic chamber if he saw this anime-style production.The protagonist is a 14-year-old robotics genius named Hiro Hamada whose nanotechnology creation promises to change everything. Until it is stolen.The film is presumably set in the near future in a San Francisco altered by Asian influences. The Golden Gate Bridge for instance has become a Shinto span. The renderings of the city both panoramic and street-level are absolutely stunning.Its a jaunty jazzy setup with distinctive characters and 3-D effects that feel organic. The problem comes when Hiro transforms his gentle guardian a sweet inflatable robot named Baymax who resembles the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into an armored warrior bot. In fact Hiro weaponizes all his companions.Without warning Big Hero 6 very loosely based on a Marvel Comics series of the same name jumps from fuzzy to vicious in a manner as startling as the mutable creatures in Gremlins.The villain is scary and the chase and battle scenes are decidedly vivid particularly for a PG film. Maybe our children have become so inured to violence that they dont get nightmares anymore.Big Hero 6 is unusual in another way. It didnt recruit illustrious stars for its voice cast. Baymax for instance is vocalized by Scott Adsit best known as Pete on 30 Rock. The most enjoyable performance belongs to T.J. Miller ( Silicon Valley) as Fred a scruffy guy in the vein of Scooby-Doos Shaggy.This being Disney the tone shifts back to warm and wholesome for the finish. Alls well ending well. But at 108 minutes it sometimes seems this spirited but schizy film will never end. dhiltbrandphillynews.com 215-854-4875 daveondemand_tvBig Hero 6 1/2 (out of four stars)Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams.

But wait those whove seen the trailer might ask. Isnt this that funny action cartoon with the giant poofy robot? Well yes and therein lies part of the dissonance with this often-wonderful deceptively strange movie. You could get emotional whiplash watching it. The film starts off as the story of two orphaned genius brothers young Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) a smart neer-do-well who likes to spend his time hustling at back-alley robot fights; and college student Tadashi (Daniel Henney) a diligent robot designer at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. (The boys live in a vaguely sci-fi version of San Francisco one that blends the moody charm of the port city with Asian-fusion design flourishes.) Desperate to get the brilliant Hiro out of the dangerous and illegal world of bot-fighting Tadashi introduces him to his fellow grad-school nerds at the Institute. Hiro is inspired to join them but before hes able to do so the entire university -- and tragically Tadashi himself -- is consumed in a calamitous fire. All thats left of Tadashi it seems is Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) a giant marshmallowlike health robot that the boy had built before his death. Responding to any expression of pain Baymax sets about trying to diagnose the distraught Hiro but not unlike the Terminator he cant quite understand ""loss"" -- at least not yet. Either way before they can bond too much the two discover a mysterious Kabuki-masked figure who may or may not have been involved in the fire and Hiro realizes hes found himself a nemesis. Baymax knows over 10000 medical procedures but he has no idea how to fight. Not a problem; Hiro just uploads him some kung-fu skills. ""Will this help you heal?"" Baymax asks the boy. To this gentle robot even fighting is a therapeutic act. Soon enough the two are whooshing around town like a crime-fighting team and Hiro eventually enlists Tadashis fellow students from the Institute to help outfitting them with their own superhero gear. In its broad strokes Big Hero 6 has a plot thats mostly indistinguishable from a Saturday-morning cartoon. Its fun action-packed and adorable. The devil is in the details with this sort of thing and the films ability to patiently work little moments of slapstick is endearing. A scene in which Hiro and Baymax visit a police station to file a report with a skeptical cop prominent in the films trailer is expertly staged and timed. And the paradoxical nature of Baymaxs powers -- he can do just about anything but hes been programmed to heal not hurt -- leads our heroes down fun little paths. But its also rare for a film like this to have such a palpable sense of loss. Tadashis death itself isnt so uncommon; that sort of thing happens regularly in kids movies and comics. (Think of the dead parents in Frozen or Uncle Bens death in Spider-Man.) But the film keeps returning to this primal hurt. His brothers death leaves a huge hole in Hiros already orphaned heart and nothing -- not even Baymax really -- can quite fill it. Were reminded of this constantly. Its even echoed by some later plot details that Ill avoid spoiling here except to say that how we deal with loss eventually emerges as the films key theme. At the same time constant reminders of death could be problematic for some younger more sensitive viewers. I wont lie; I saw numerous seemingly inconsolable young uns after my screening. It even worked me over a little too -- but in a good way. The loss gives a real urgency to this otherwise-familiar story of a boy and his robot. Heres a kid whos lost everything you start thinking. Please dont let him lose this too.

"Review In Big Hero 6 a huggable robo-hero pops up in the future - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review In Big Hero 6 a huggable robo-hero pops up in the future Big Hero 6 Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Big Hero 6 the new animated movie from Disney. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Big Hero 6 the new animated movie from Disney. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Review Big Hero 6 is a big step for Disney animation and step into the future for a Marvel comic The new animated action-adventure ""Big Hero 6"" might sound like more of the same Marvel-inspired superhero stuff already saturating movie theaters with its flashy 3-D animation and futuristic nerd kids doing their world saving in bright plastic-plated armor and spiffy Spanx.Which it might have become if not for the big guy the awwww-inspiring Baymax. This towering huggable robotic bag of air and brains steals the show and probably seals a franchise. Baymax who looks like the love child of the Pillsbury Doughboy and the Michelin Man also represents another interesting evolution in the kind of animation we can expect from Disney.Based on a little-known comic pulled from Marvels apparently endless vaults directors Don Hall and Chris Williams create a smart forward-thinking and yet emotionally old-fashioned world. Like the video-gaming battles in the 2012 Disney hit ""Wreck-It Ralph"" ""Big Hero 6"" is a little edgier its humor a little grittier and its sensibility very 21st century setting it on a different path than the studios classic fairy tale staples. Screenwriters Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts handled the adaptation expanding and embellishing the origin comic. The film is very clear about its international influences. It starts with ""Big Hero 6s"" pan-Pacific setting the city of San Fransokyo a hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo in landmarks as well as name. It extends through the animation itself a mash-up of old-school style and Japanese manga. While all the mushing and mixing make for images that seem to leap off the screen the subtext is that the future will be multicultural and the sensibility pop so get over it. Take a look at scenes from Walt Disney Animations ""Big Hero 6."" Thank Fall Out Boy for some of that snap. Though the bands new track ""Immortals"" wont hit ""Frozens"" chart-crushing ""Let It Go"" (which for parents may be a blessing) it fits the punk genius at the storys center a 14-year-old robotics whiz kid named Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter). It also fuses well with composer Henry Jackmans (""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") synth-inflected orchestral score.The film begins as so many of these origin stories do with the parentless boy destined for greatness. At 14 Hiros already graduated from high school but instead of college hes applying his high-tech savvy to building a better back-alley fighting bot. The film begins as so many of these origin stories do with the parentless boy destined for greatness. Hes got sweet Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) making sure theres a roof over his head and food on the table. But older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) who spends his days with a smart circle of scientific brainiacs at San Fransokyo Tech worries that Hiro is headed toward trouble. Tadashi gets Hiro to tag along to Tech one day to see what hed miss by skipping college. Between all the gizmos being ginned up and the demonstration of Tadashis invention Baymax a touchy-feely care-giving medical robot designed to read moods as easily as vitals the boy wonder starts thinking perhaps there is more to life than street-fighting bots.Hiros bid to be accepted into the prestigious school lies in impressing professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) so he creates a mind-controlled microbot -- well zillions of them which swirl like magnetized metal shards into whatever the teen telepathically instructs. The microbots can morph into a building a bridge and in the wrong hands -- perhaps a global robotics mogul like Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk) -- are an unbeatable weapon. They make for some of the films best visuals impossible to pull off without animation that mesmerizes.To take Hiro from smart boy to superhero calamity must fall. It does right in the middle of Hiros demonstration at an elaborate science fair. As impressive as the morphing microbots are the explosive destruction of the fair is tailor-made for animators to go crazy and ""Big Hero 6s"" massive crew does.In the wake of the fairs ruin Hiro and Baymax are thrown together to as all superheroes must seek justice unmask villains solve mysteries. Hiro enlists four of his brothers friends to help (and to make six big heroes). They include Fred (T.J. Miller) the resident slacker who may be more than he seems; GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung) sarcasm and spinning wheels are her specialty; Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) kind of a Wolverine with dreads a paunch and slightly different but no-less-lethal blades; and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) your basic chemistry chick in short skirts and glasses.Hiro has all the right stuff to be the leader while Baymaxs huge hugs carry as much power as his punch. And as comic book mythology demands these superheroes have their own special attire. Hiro pushes the soft-touch Baymax into a ""slimming"" new plastic suit that offers power and protection. But inside it Bay loses some of his charm.That charm is substantial and should the big boy return for future adventures Disney might rethink the styling.While a robot designed to be the ultimate medical caregiver might not sound like the right superhero stuff from the first time Baymax pops up from his container like an inflatable jack in the box (the real deal not the fast food franchise namesake) hes irrepressible and irresistible.Surprisingly some of the attraction is Baymaxs synthesized voice. So annoying when its a telemarketer so soothing when Scott Adsit is at the controls. The actor best known as the droll producer who kept ""30 Rock"" sane opposite Tina Fey is able to shift from concern to bone-dry humor in the blink of Bays very big eye.All of the bots sweet puffery keeps ""Big Hero 6"" afloat as it plows into the relatively typical terrain of superhero-villain battles fought with the fate of the world hanging by a thread. Amid all the nerd-inspired firepower that gives the movie much of its flash the big boys droning tone proves to be the films stealth weapon perfect for pulling off highly targeted comic strikes.

"Big Hero 6 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; big-hero-6 ) Big Hero 6 (United States 2014) November 06 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli In 2013 Frozen arrived in theaters to capture the hearts minds and imaginations of young people (especially girls) around the world. Big Hero 6 is Disneys follow-up and its unlikely to have the same seismic impact. Although competently made and consistently engaging theres nothing special about this animated superhero origin story. The first collaboration between Disney animation and Marvel Comics it lags behind The Incredibles Disney/Pixars previous foray into this genre. The story takes place in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo a cultural geographical and architectural fusion of East and West. The protagonist is young teen Hiro Hamada (voice of Ryan Potter) a robotics prodigy who accompanies his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) to college one day and falls in love with what he sees in the lab. In order to prove his worthiness to enter the university he must invent something to impress the head of the department Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell). Hiro receives support from his brothers friends and cohorts live wire Go Go Tomago (Jamie Chung) chemistry whiz Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) big-but-loveable Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) and superhero-obsessed Fred (T.J.Miller). Also in the mix is Tadashis inflatable robot creation Baymax (Scott Adsit). Tragedy occurs when Tadashi and Professor Callaghan are killed in a mysterious fire. Hiro discovers that the fire wasnt accidental - it was deliberately set to cover up the theft of his invention which is being (mis)used by a kabuki-masked figure with dark plans for San Franksokyo. This is the second animated film of 2014 to confront death with a deftness of touch that wont overly upset children. It happened in How to Train Your Dragon 2 and is being repeated here. In the past traditional animated films have mostly avoided the subject (there are exceptions - Bambis mother for example) but this may be an acknowledgment that kids are growing up faster and able to handle somber content. Although Big Hero 6 addresses Tadashis death carefully and respectfully the films overall tone remains light. Theres a fair amount of comedy and several obligatory action sequences that could easily be converted into playable video game levels. The filmmakers deserve credit for the seamless way in which they incorporate the serious elements into the overall story. This potential minefield is successfully navigated. The films marketing-friendly creature is the robot Baymax which look a little like a cross between the Michelin Man and a giant Pillsbury Dough Boy. Big white and fluffy (except when wearing his armor) Baymax is a toymakers dream. Although not as cuddly as the average Disney mascot this robot is guaranteed to capture childrens imaginations. Big Hero 6 is geared more toward boys than girls so the animators have refrained from making Baymax too cute (no singing or dancing). Despite the superhero stuff going on one could make a convincing case that Big Hero 6 is really about the relationship that develops between the lonely Hiro and the creation of his beloved brother. After immersion in the novel visual styles showcased in The Boxtrolls and The Book of Life the ""standard"" approach used in Big Hero 6 feels a littlea|vanilla. The backgrounds are eye-poppingly rendered - San Fransokyo looks great - but the foreground images occasionally lack sizzle. As for the 3D - call it ""serviceable."" The voice acting is solid but unremarkable with Disney opting to use ""character voices"" (for lack of a better term) than immediately recognizable A-list talent. This has its advantages because familiar voices can overwhelm a character. The superhero types on display here are of the Batman/Iron Man variety - normal people whose ""powers"" come as a result of technological improvements rather than through mutations or innate abilities. The film presents positive messages about the emptiness of revenge and the importance of friendship while offering an adventure designed for viewers too young for the more intense storytelling of The Avengers. The screenplay is smart enough to be considered adult-friendly. This isnt ""classic Disney"" but its an experience parents and children can enjoy together in the dark and sometimes thats all one can ask of a big-budget animated film.

"Big Hero 6 is a marshmallow man mash-up review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBig Hero 6 is a marshmallow man mash-up reviewWalt Disney meets Marvel Comics in Big Hero 6 but theres more of a mash-up happening in this animated adventure than perhaps these titans are willing to admit.Hiro Hamada voiced by Ryan Potter gets the big squeeze from Baymax voiced by Scott Adsit in Big Hero 6.  (THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 6 2014Big Hero 6An animated adventure featuring the voices of Ryan Potter Scott Adsit and Maya Rudolph. Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams. At GTA theatres. 102 minutes. PGWalt Disney meets Marvel Comics in Big Hero 6 but theres more of a mash-up happening in this animated adventure than perhaps these titans are willing to admit.The movie is like a variety pack sampler of previous toon tales with obvious lifts from The Iron Giant The Incredibles How to Train Your Dragon and Scooby-Doo. Article Continued BelowAppropriate for a movie that spans the divide between East and West -- the action occurs in a San Francisco/Tokyo megalopolis called ""San Fransokyo"" -- theres also a debt owed to the art and characters of Studio Ghiblis vivid fantasies in particular the giant magical caregiver of My Neighbor Totoro. Yet what Big Hero 6 lacks in originality it makes up for in charm. Chiefly through the whimsical presence of Baymax a giant robot companion voiced by Scott Adsit from TVs 30 Rock. Hes like brainy HAL 9000 (minus the killer instinct) inside an inflatable suit that resembles the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters or Michelin Tire man from a different commercial realm.Baymax is the ""personal health care companion"" of Hiro a 14-year-old computer whiz voiced by Ryan Potter whom at first meeting is busily wasting his youth and talent on back-alley cage matches involving the pint-sized fighter robots he seems to make as easily as PBamp;J sandwiches.Hiros big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) takes a paternal interest in the teen and leads him to his workplace the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. (Hiro also has a scolding aunt voiced by Maya Rudolph since this is one of those Disney family movies were no mom or dad are around.)While Tadashi works on the robot helper who will become Baymax Hiro invents an easily reproduced microbot that swarms like a locust infestation but which promises to revolutionize the construction industry. Such versatility can also be employed to nefarious ends as is quickly demonstrated in a series of events that include a fire tragedy and the emergence of a masked villain who looks as if he stepped out of a Tim Burton film yet another influence. Its a truly scary villain too hence the ""parental guidance"" rating.Fortunately for Hiro hes got Baymax to watch his back and also to take his blood pressure and administer random health-care advice. Baymax observes that Hiro suffers from ""pubescent mood swings"" but stating the obvious isnt just a robot thing. A human character makes a comment on the plot at one point while another complains that he doesnt understand what the plan is.Hiro also gets a big assist from goofy guardians of the inner-city galaxy brainy goofy and brave pals with names that will go great with their inevitable Happy Meal figurines Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) GoGo (Jamie Chung) and Fred (T.J. Miller).Consider them all introductions to a series of films that directors Don Hall (Winnie the Pooh) and Chris Williams (Bolt) along with their corporate masters will take as far as the market can bear. Which is more than a little ironic given the films emphasis on the evils of corporate exploitation of noble ideas.Happily there is Baymax who is innocent of all cynicism and is all the more enjoyable for it. He gets a charge of doing those fist-bumping tricks that all the cool kids discovered eons ago. ""Are you satisfied with your care?"" Baymax asks.Not entirely if we consider the question in terms of Big Hero 6. But theres satisfaction enough to warrant a recommendation to see the film and to look forward to the sequel.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDreaded Ice Bucket Challenge of 2014 paid for ALS research breakthroughMillions raised for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research from viral stunt funded research that identified a gene NEK1 that contributes to disease.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Thats a lot of cooks and the broth shows it. (The ""its a kids movie"" defense doesnt hold up too well when even a kid can spot the plot holes under the slapstick and body armor.)

Students in the lab learn a masked villain caused the conflagration and turn their inventions into weapons to fight him. As they don costumes -- because how can you fight supervillains without costumes? -- one kid says ""This is our creation story.""Then you realize oh yeah Big Hero 6 loosely adapted from the Marvel comics series is an elaborate setup for a new superhero franchise for kids. With Disney as the owner of Marvel Studios since 2009 expect merchandise theme-park rides and many more kid-size superhero series to follow.The Disney tinkering begins with the setting. Instead of Tokyo everything happens in a mythical San Fransokyo with cable cars on sharply inclined streets. The story is retooled to focus on young orphan Hiro (Ryan Potter) who is raised by his clueless Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) and his gentle older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Both urge him to apply his brilliance to his studies.Hiro finally signs on and with the help of lab companions who will be dubbed Go Go Tomago Wasabi Honey Lemon and Fred he creates a multitude of minibots he can move by telepathic control. The invention is so amazing that someone is willing to kill to get it.The convoluted story gives the villain a motive that doesnt really make sense and is patched in too late in the narrative. Still the 3-D animation is incredible. Younger kids should particularly like the Disney reworking of the robot Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) as a giant with a sweet spirit motivated even in the midst of battle by his desire to help Hiro.Not missing a step Disney has the Baymax toys already on shelves waiting to pop out of holiday gift wrapping.Stick around for the end of the credits to meet Freds dad in a moment where Disney pays respect to Marvel and Marvel in turn gives Disney its blessing. Its worth the wait.BIG HERO 6 (B)Directed by Chris Williams and Don Hall. PG (action and peril some rude humor and thematic elements). 108 mins. In wide release.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1246 p.m. EST November 7 2014Hiro Hamada voiced by Ryan Potter right gets a hug from Baymax voiced by Scott Adsit in a scene from ""Big Hero 6.""(Photo AP)The most endearing character in Disneys animated superhero animated movie is a one-man Affordable Care Act. (Make that a one-robot ACA.)Baymax the irresistible blobby hero in Big Hero 6 ( out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) was created by a brainy college student to optimize his cuddly qualities with his prodigious health-care assessment skills. On top of providing spot-on diagnoses the benevolent bot in the inflatable suit is flat-out lovable. Its hard not to love the movie he stars in too. With its appealing array of nerdy characters inventive architecture and striking cross-cultural production design Hero is a vibrant romp.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A young boy and a plus-sized inflatable robot develop a special bond in Big Hero 6. The pair team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes. A Disney film based on a Marvel comic Hero strikes just the right notes for a kid-friendly superhero adventure emphasizing brains over brawn and helping people over hurting them.The story takes place in a futuristic urban mash-up called San Fransokyo an East-West blend where Victorian row houses share space on hilly streets with cherry blossoms and the Golden Gate Bridge has Shinto shrine flourishes. Fourteen-year-old robotics whiz Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a quintessential denizen of this heterogeneous city. A prodigy who graduated from high school at 13 hes been using his smarts to build micro-bots then gambling on them to win battles in back-alley competitions. Orphaned at 3 Hiro lives with his big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) and their loving but clueless Aunt Cass(Maya Rudolph).Tadashi attends an MIT-style college where he has been perfecting his health-care companion invention aka Baymax. Hiro is dazzled by a glimpse of the lab his brother shares with gung-ho fellow students including engineering genius Go Go (Jamie Chung) laser specialist Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) chemical expert Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and fanboy/dropout Fred (T.J. Miller).Once Hiro sees their mega-cool projects he desperately wants in. As part of his application for admission Hiro creates an elaborate system of magnetized robots which later falls into fiendish hands.A devastating turn of events propels Hiro to seek comfort from the sweet-natured pot-bellied Baymax (Scott Adsit). Equal parts naive and perceptive Baymax is also a world-class hugger.The bond between Hiro and Baymax is the heart of the film as the robot becomes a warm-hearted surrogate parent figure to the orphaned boy genius. The overblown size and shape of Baymax is fodder for jokes galore as are his uncool efforts at a fist bump. When his batteries are low he hilariously stumbles and slurs as if hes drunk.As they race around San Fransokyo the citys beautifully rendered blend of cultures is nothing short of enchanting recalling the work of Japanese master animator Hayao Miyazaki.Some action scenes grow excessive. Villains surface chases happen and revelations bubble forth as Hiro and Tadashis college pals join forces Avengers-style to fight a nefarious corporate type who stole Hiros robotic design. An ill-considered plot twist involving a university professor is unnecessary.The best scenes are the comical interactions between Hiro and Baymax and the poignant moments when Hiro grapples with grief.With Guardians of the Galaxy and now Big Hero 6 its been a banner year for fresh Marvel Comics superhero sagas. Like Guardians leafy gentle giant Groot the kindly Baymax looms large as a winner for kids and adults alike. 114 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1u48Rkh",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/06/big-hero-6-review/18101693/,200,bighero621,bighero6,usatoday

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it A robotic nurse named Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) helps 14-year-old orphan Hiro (Ryan Potter) dig out of a deep depression. (AP/Disney) By Michael OSullivan November 6 2014 Ive been stumped trying to come up with a snappy shorthand to describe ""Big Hero 6"" Disneys animated tale of the friendship between a boy and his robot a plus-size health-care droid named Baymax who resembles a more socially awkward Pillsbury Dough Boy. On the one hand the movie borrows a key strand of its DNA -- the boy-bot dynamic -- from ""The Iron Giant"" yet its really nothing like that 1999 film. With a plot built around the formation of a team of misfit heroes its more like an ""Avengers"" origin story for the Saturday morning cartoon crowd. But neither of those elevator pitches feels exactly right. My difficulty merely reflects the movies striking originality. Though loosely based on an obscure out-of-print series of comics from Marvel which Disney owns ""Big Hero 6"" is fresh and inventive enough in every important way -- visuals storytelling and most significantly in terms of character -- to satisfy even the most jaded animation fan. Lets start with the look. Set in the fictional metropolis of San Fransokyo a slightly futuristic vision of the City by the Bay overlaid with a rich lacquer of Japanese style ""Big Hero 6"" is part of the recent boom in great-looking animation that includes ""The Boxtrolls"" and ""The Book of Life."" You dont have to be an obsessive to want to see this film more than once. The story is equally engaging. When 14-year-old orphan -- and high-tech prodigy -- Hiro (voice of Ryan Potter) loses his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) in a suspicious fire the teenager falls into a deep depression. It is only Baymax (Scott Adsit) a robotic nurse that Tadashi had been working on for a college project who is able to pull Hiro out of his funk. First its by offering his services as an ad hoc therapist. Only later is Baymax recruited as an accomplice in Hiros investigation of the blaze which seems to have been started by a cynical industrialist (Alan Tudyk) interested in some micro-robotic technology that Hiro has developed. Its a rusty plot straight out of ""Scooby-Doo."" Here however it chugs along like a well-oiled machine thanks mainly to the charm and character -- yes character -- of Baymax. Initially he isnt much of a sleuth. The sluggish mechanical manikin -- a skeleton of metal hydraulics surrounded by an inflatable skin -- suggests a miniature Macys Thanksgiving Day parade balloon one that moves with all the grace of ""The Jungle Books"" Baloo but with a full diaper. Baymax isnt just slow on his feet -- hes slow-witted too. If it doesnt have something to do with medical diagnostics he just isnt very good at it. Still hes an adorable klutz. Only later will his medical expertise be put to good use along with a couple of martial-arts upgrades that Hiro adds to the bots programming. As Hiro and Baymax get sucked deeper into the storys intrigue four of Tadashis former classmates at what Hiro calls ""nerd school"" (Genesis Rodriguez Damon Wayans Jr. T.J. Miller and Jamie Chung) also throw in with them. Like the robot they arent born crime-fighters yet each soon develops a real-world application for his or her pet research project plasma blades magnetic-levitation discs and other high-tech toys that turn out to be surprisingly effective against bad guys. Baymax even acquires a suit of armor that makes him look like an overweight Iron Man one of many effective sight gags. Its a movie thats as fun to watch as it is funny. But the real appeal of ""Big Hero 6"" isnt its action. Its the central characters heart. That may sound strange to talk about a movie thats built around a robot in that way but Baymax -- like WALL-E and other amiable automatons -- ultimately wins the day not by overriding his inner Florence Nightingale but by harnessing it. In the end as it happens ""Big Hero 6"" isnt ""Triumph of the Nerds"" but ""Triumph of the Nurse.""    1/2 PG. At area theaters.

Its a mix of superhero action humanoid robotics and consistently funny character comedy. November 6 2014 -- 909pm Video (0235)  ""Interstellar"" doesnt turn tragedy into rich drama. ""Big Hero 6"" is an engaging mix of superhero action humanoid robotics and consistently funny character comedy."" David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Big Hero 6"" opens with sweeping views of its hybrid metropolis San Fransokyo. Its similar to northern Californias principal city yet strikingly Asian-toned. Its like something out of a Japanese manga comic or ""Pacific Rim"" for youngsters. The twisted design quickly establishes the new cartoons tone a mix of superhero action humanoid robotics and consistently funny character comedy. Its also a reflection of a debut partnership. This is Walt Disney Feature Animations first try to turn a Marvel Comics franchise into animation. While that effort isnt as sophisticated as ""Frozen"" or ""Wreck-It Ralph"" its a good couple of hours away from home for the kids. The movies world of the near future is home to Hiro a young robotics wizard trying to find his life path. Hed rather earn money in illegal robot fights than build socially useful androids. His guide to grown-up cool is his older brother Tadashi a college student with Renaissance-man potential. Tadashi is creating Baymax a top-line health care robot that resembles a big white balloon. Baymax is inquisitive with the benign personality and appealing form of a huggable teddy bear. He is so devoted to human health and happiness that he will tiptoe across a room rather than create a disturbance. Then Tadashi suddenly leaves the picture and Baymax moves forward to fill the void. But since a Kabuki-masked baddie is attacking the city with a regiment of microbots Hiro wants more than a kindly sidekick. He customizes Baymax into a world-saving sumo-sized unit of weapons legs and fists. He dons his own high-powered combat uniform and invites four of Tadashis school buddies to join the battle in a squadron of fighting costumes. Of course he does. Hes a rational 14-year-old human Baymax stops moving around like a penguin and starts throwing knockout punches against evildoers. He remains lovable though. During cease fires he continues his preferred pastime examining Hiros health. Of course he does. Hes a rational domestic robot Disney Hiro and Baymax are out to save the world in ""Big Hero 6."" The central appeal of the movie is its masterful visuals. It presents every image as a vibrant complex gorgeously lit phenomenon handsomer than anything seen in daily life. If the animators handwork takes first place the nine-member screenplay committee succeeds as well showing a fine grasp of the casts personalities. This superhero origin story presents the required catastrophe but it is even more attentive to introducing Hiros dissimilar squad of new friends. One is a daydreamy dropout another is a sassy engineering magician another is a touchy perfectionist. Each ones theme shows up in their plucky attack strategies. This is a movie where a brave fighters slapstick becomes a key element of saving the day. Like San Fransokyos cityscape its the extravagant mix of genres that makes ""Big Hero 6"" an ambitious trip.

An exhilarating scene in which Baymax and Hiro fly over the city is so beautifully rendered its liable to put a tingle in the back of your knees. Photo Disney / Associated Press Image 8 of 8 Big Hero 6 review A funny animated film for everybody 1 / 8 Back to Gallery ""Big Hero 6"" is shot after shot an intelligent and artful creation. Theres a scene in which the filmmakers convey a funeral taking place with a medium shot of black umbrellas opening. They pull back to show people standing at a cemetery in the rain and then dissolve to a post-funeral gathering filmed from the outside of the house through rain-spattered windows. And all the while the camera is slowly moving. At the same time ""Big Hero 6"" makes full use of the animation medium. It takes place in the fictitious city of San Fransokyo a mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo with elevated trains and a pagoda design for the Golden Gate Bridge. Its a pleasure just to ride the back of the camera as it swoops above these cleverly reimagined streets. And this is even before the story kicks in which is a good one. Without giving anything away its about the partnership between a teenage robotics prodigy and a home health care robot who join forces to solve a crime. The robot is adorable. I know its weird (and more than a little pathetic) to call something adorable that doesnt really exist except as a computer rendering but Baymax the robot truly is lovable -- white inflated very fat with a soothing unthreatening voice (Scott Adsit) and a desire to help everyone. Baymax and Hiro (Ryan Potter) go off into the San Fransokyo streets to solve a mystery and along the way theyre joined by a group of computer nerds all experts in robotics. In future movies they will be known collectively as Big Hero 6 and they very well might become as annoying as the Fantastic Four. But the story of their origins makes for pleasant viewing. ""Big Hero 6"" is a funny movie and not in that forced way of older animated films with a few jokes aimed over the head of the kiddies just to make the ordeal tolerable for adults. The humor here works for all ages. Theres a sequence that equates a robots running out of battery power with a persons getting drunk. That might not sound like a scream just hearing about it but in the movie its very funny. Once the writers establish Baymax as a character they never forget his potential for comedy so that even in the midst of action sequences they come up with comical bits of business. These include physical bits (like being too fat to fit through a window) recurring jokes and jokes based on character such as his assumption that his job is to look after everyones health. The visuals are splendid. Even close-ups of face and hair are something to marvel at. Theres an extended sequence in which Baymax and Hiro fly through the city thats gorgeous and exhilarating. It produces that ""knees weak"" sensation thats really more like a tingle in the back of your knees. The only thing ""Big Hero 6"" has going against it is its length. It begins to drag after about an hour and though its too witty and well made to become tiresome nobody who sees it will wish it were longer. A 10-minute trim -- with a scissors not a meat ax -- would take this movie up a level. The film is preceded by a short film called ""Feast"" about family life as seen from the perspective of a dog who like all dogs is concerned mainly with eating and being sociable. Its an enchanted little film funny and moving truly a thing of beauty. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Our setting is San Fransokyo a hybrid of California and Japan where everyone loves tech gadgets and sushi. (Whether the city is fictitious or simply the near future is up for debate.) Boy wonder Hiro (Ryan Potter) a 14-year-old orphan who lives with his college-age older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) and goofball aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) is wasting his brains entering -- and winning -- robot gladiator fights. His weapon is a tiny grinning machine that looks like a metal rag doll but is held in place by magnets. When a battle bot slashes Hiros invention with a buzz saw it simply pulls itself back together and attacks.Hiros making money but setting himself up for a criminal record and a couple broken limbs. As the film opens directors Don Hall and Chris Williams swoop us above the shining nighttime metropolis over the sound of suspenseful strings almost as if theyve mistaken this PG cartoon for a Bruce Willis action thriller. For kids Big Hero 6 comes nail-bitingly close -- The Little Mermaid this aint and as the tension mounts the tykes in my theater were stricken into silence. The movie wrestles with emotional stakes many children have never felt and when the closing credits rolled the kids I saw emerged into the bright reassuring lobby blinking like sad moles or hiding behind their mothers legs.Film Details Big Hero 6 RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time105 min. More Info Trailer In the first act Tadashi attempts to rescue his younger brothers inventing soul from the streets. He drags Hiro to his university and convinces him that his talents deserve a state-of-the-art laboratory not to mention the oversight of Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell). There Hiro meets his kindred spirits Go Go (Jamie Chung) a hellion with a magnetic bike; Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) a geek who loves lasers; Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) a girlie girl who knows her way around chemicals; and a stoner named Fred (T.J. Miller) whom the wonks allow to hang out and be their dumb cheerful mascot. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Right away Big Hero 6 assures kids that being smart is super cool unlike losers like Fred who begs his friends to build him a fire-breathing lizard costume rather than invent one himself. (The rest of the gang would do if they didnt think the idea was wicked-dumb.) Tadashi for example has prioritized the balloon-like Baymax who automatically inflates whenever someone nearby says ""Ow"" Hiro is less altruistic. He invents microbots small widgets that look like metal-dipped macaroni but can assemble into a giant moving sculpture of whatever Hiro dreams thanks to a headband that reads his thoughts. When Hiro introduces these game-changing gizmos he gives a speech full of such rousing big promises that you almost expect Steve Jobs to disinter himself and applaud.But then an arsonist destroys Hiros (admittedly not very long) lifes work and accidentally offs Tadashi. With only Baymax to analyze his hormones and sit him down for an awkward sex talk (which Hall and Williams cut off before parents can get panicky) Hiro asks his geek friends to set things right -- and equips his brothers kindly robot with imposing armor and a memory card programmed with punches and kicks scanned from kung fu movies. Its here that Big Hero 6 gets glitchy. It wants to convince children that engineers are awesome. Yet engineers tend to play it safe as Wasabi does when he insists on using his blinkers during a dangerous car chase.To make engineers more awesome the movie upgrades the gang into superheroes -- albeit superheroes who use science to figure out how to fly and smash -- which scrambles the message. The script wants to be progressive and often is. (Go Gos fierce catchphrase ""Woman up"") Still before were done cheering a cartoon about clever women in lab coats theyre all stripped down to leotards. Sigh.Big Hero 6 is easier to admire than to love. It veers from chipper to noisy to dark stretches where it grapples with adult-sized grief. Moments in here nearly measure up to The NeverEnding Storys Artax in the swamp a movie death that taught a generation to mourn. This conduit Hiro isnt just a sweet moppet Hes full of rage and despair and ego. He needs Baymax to be his family which means training him to fist-bump and groaning when the robot runs out of battery and acts like a stumbling slurring drunk -- a moment that could have kids later suspiciously checking their own parents for a plug. Yet the film continually and smartly reminds us that Baymax is still a computer which means that while Hiro can love him the robot can never love him back. At least even in this future not all of our humanity can be outsourced.BIG HERO 6 | Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams | Written by Robert L.

Big Hero 6 (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Big Hero 6 (PG) Disney takes a break from princesses with this tale of a boy and his super-powered bodyguard. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/6/2014 Editor rating 3.5 In Big Hero 6 the animation wizards at Walt Disney Studio give the princesses and magical heroines a break and make one for the boys (and the boys at heart). Directed by the team of Don Hall (Winnie the Pooh) and Chis Williams (Bolt) the film was inspired by the Marvel Comics series of the same name although its edges have been rounded and its violence toned down to kiddie-levels. On a story level the picture is just as derivative as any other superhero movie with a band of good guys teaming up to bring down a powerful villain. But story is not the main attraction here. Set in a city called San Fransokyo (a wonderfully inventive cross between San Francisco and Tokyo) the movie focuses on Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) a young orphan who lives with his aunt and older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Hiro happens to be a science prodigy who hopes to enroll in a prestigious academy. Tadashi himself no slouch in the brain department has built a robotic nurse Baymax (Scott Adsit) who looks like a smaller version of a Thanksgiving Day parade float - a white puffy towering giant of kindness and care. Then tragedy strikes the way it often does in Disney films (gently but moving) and Hiro decides to reprogram Baymax from healer to fighter to avenge a death. He rounds up four of his equally smart friends all of whom develop their own scientific gimmick - levitation discs plasma roller blades - and relying on the versatile Baymax for muscle who can suddenly do a lot more than he was originally intended to the kids go after the bad guys. What follows could pass as a light comic spin on The Avengers but you dont watch Big Hero 6 for the plot. Its the stunning animation which continues to get better with every Disney release that keeps you entranced. Baymax is an ingenious creation soft as a marshmallow and fat like a balloon but his personality is so likable and straightforward (hes pure logic like Spock) that you cant help love him (prepare yourself for an onslaught of Big Hero 6 spin-off toys). The kids too are great fun each with a distinct personality and talent that adds something to their group. There are moments in Big Hero 6 as beautiful as anything Disney or Pixar have ever done You bask in the gorgeous images and fantastic animation. Unlike most Disney fables there arent any real morals or lessons to be learned here. This one is pure sheer fun. And even though the movie couldnt be more formulaic predictability is never a problem. With a film this funny exciting and visually stimulating who cares if you know exactly whats going to happen next and when.

Comments (5) click to enlarge Big Hero 6 3D Video Rated PG  108 minutes  2014 A teenage programming prodigy develops an emotional bond with a robot designed by his brother who has since died and because this is adapted from a Marvel Comics series (by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau) both boy and robot become superheroes the sweet-tempered story devolving into a series of disaster-movie set pieces. This computer-animated feature from Disney takes place in a Steve Jobs wet dream where computers are treated like people and people aspire to be like machines (the boy and his human friends become ""super"" by affixing high-tech gadgets to their bodies). Theres enough tried-and-true Disney sentiment here to counter the rampant antihumanism and the futuristic settings look spectacular but this left me feeling gross.

Updated July 29 2016  853 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Big Hero 6 should thrill kids and adults alike By Calvin Wilson / calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Calvin Wilson Nov 6 2014 (...) Like many an adolescent Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) lacks direction. Hes a tech geek who spends way too much time hustling cash in the back alleys of San Fransokyo (an imaginative mashup of the cities its name suggests) betting on a tiny but dangerous robot that consistently throttles the fiercest competition.Hiros big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) has more ambitious things on his mind. Through repeated trials and considerable error hes finally perfected a robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit) that can detect health issues and dispense accurate advice. The robots medical credibility is only slightly undercut by the fact that he looks like an inflatable snowman.Tadashi is certain that he can persuade Hiro to use his geek skills for the common good. But just when things look promising tragedy strikes. And its up to Hiro to thwart a nefarious scheme involving a mysterious man in a mask. Assembling a backup team of Tadashis friends -- Go Go (Jamie Chung) Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller) -- a determined Hiro and a willing but somewhat clueless Baymax embark on a quest to bring down the bad guy.Inspired by an obscure Marvel Comics property ""Big Hero 6"" is the kind of movie that parents dream of -- easy for kids to enjoy but with plenty to engage moviegoers for whom puberty is a distant memory. Working from a screenplay by Robert L. Baird amp; Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts directors Don Hall (""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") strike a deft balance between emotion and action. This is the latest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios which wowed multiplex crowds with ""Frozen."" But the Mouse House has clearly learned a lot from Pixar. The storytelling is solid propelled by characters that you come to care about. And that should make ""Big Hero 6"" a big hit.What ""Big Hero 6""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 148  Content Action and peril rude humor thematic elements Tags Big Hero 6 Calvin Wilson St Louis Post-dispatch Damon Wayans Jr. Marvel Comics Walt Disney Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the high-tech city of San Fransokyo a young robotics whiz uncovers a sinister plot. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Marvel plus Disney plus John Lasseter equals an enjoyable jumble of kid-approved action. CAST Ryan Potter Scott Adsit Jamie Chung Damon Wayans Jr. LENGTH 142 A trailer for the animated film ""Big Hero 6"" features a 14-year-old boy Hiro excitedly telling a cop about a sinister figure whose Kabuki mask can control an army of microbots. The cop is one of those droll seen-it-all types who says things like ""Let me get this straight kid."" The crazier the story the funnier his straight-faced reaction becomes. If youre an adult you might feel a little like that cop while watching ""Big Hero 6."" If youre Hiros age or younger however superhero myths and origin stories are probably in your DNA -- along with a meta-awareness that allows you to deftly juggle cultural tropes -- and ""Big Hero 6"" was made for you. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break A splashy colorful jumble directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams ""Big Hero 6"" is what happens when superpowers converge -- by which I mean Marvel and Disneys John Lasseter the executive producer. Based on a little-known comic series ""Big Hero 6"" tells the story of Hiro (the voice of Ryan Potter) a robotics whiz who comes into possession of Baymax an inflatable home health care aide. Baymax is clearly not built for action (Scott Adsit provides his endearing voice) but when that Kabuki guy enters the picture Hiro decides its time for some upgrades. Like jet engines And a rocket-powered fist That covers perhaps a fraction of the story. The title of ""Big Hero 6"" refers to Hiros assembled team which includes science nerds with colorful names like Go Go (Jamie Chung) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.). Along with their sidekick plain old Fred (T.J. Miller) theyll battle those microbots track down the wealthy tech guru Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk) discover a teleportation device and -- well you get the picture. The real star of ""Big Hero 6"" may be its backdrop a fanciful city named San Fransokyo rendered in rich vivid colors and filled with clever details (the masts of the Golden Gate Bridge now resemble Japanese torii gates). Its a delightful grab bag of notions much like the movie itself. 228 MoviesDisneys Big Hero 6 First trailer advertisement | advertise on newsday Robot backstory Walt Disney Co. animators spent more than three years transforming Baymax a dragon-like robot bodyguard from an obscure Marvel Comics series into a sidekick as lovable as Jiminy Cricket. John Lasseter chief creative officer of Disney Animation had the ""Big Hero 6"" team put up images of movie robots from C-3PO to lesser-known Japanese designs. Animation artist Lisa Keene came up with the idea to make the robot huggable. Director Don Hall toured robotics labs from Tokyo to Cambridge Massachusetts searching for inspiration. At Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Hall found engineers working on inflatable robots -- in particular nurses who could comb hair and feed patients. In the movie Baymax is a ""personal health care companion."" He becomes much more after being adopted by Hiro a teenage robotics prodigy who sets out to battle a villain who has stolen his big invention. Baymax becomes a surrogate for Hiros lost family member. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Grief experts were brought in to learn how kids deal with loss Hall said. Baymaxs soft round eyes came to Hall on a trip to Japan after seeing bells in a Tokyo temple. ""Theres something so peaceful and calming about that"" Hall said.

"Big Hero 6 review  three stars - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Big Hero 6 Big Hero 6 (Trailer) ""Big Hero 6"" is an animated film perfect for the kids and the entire family. This Disney film is about a group of smart robots that must take on the difficult task of saving the place they live. ""Big Hero 6"" is an animated film perfect for the kids and the entire family. This Disney film is about a group of smart robots that must take on the difficult task of saving the place they live. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The robots more beguiling than his movie. But the movies pretty good. In ""Big Hero 6"" we have a robot considerably more beguiling than his movie. Yet theres enough visual invention afoot and enough spirited interplay among the human characters to keep things bobbing along.Baymax is the name of the robot in question. He resembles a flotation device or the Michelin Mans blobbier brother. He and his adventures come from the pages of Marvel Comics which marks a first for Disney animation. It will not be the last; Disneys purchase of Marvel five years ago opens up all sorts of avenues for our collective superhero fatigue. The ""Big Hero 6"" gang first appeared in the Marvel pages in 1998. Its crime-fighting mystery-solving band of techno-geniuses as adapted by screenwriters Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson and (in a separate draft) Jordan Roberts arrives on screens three months after the rougher more violent live-action fantasy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" asserted the box-office appeal of misfit outcasts and their team-building exercises.The setting is quite wonderful a hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo. The Golden Gate Bridge laden with pan-Asian design flourishes dominates the skyline. The hero of the tale is Hiro a 14-year-old prodigy who graduated high school at 13 and now spends his hours engaged in robot battles in grimy undisclosed locations. Hiros older brother Tadashi disapproves and steers Hiro toward his own place of employment the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Tadashis passion project is a new and cushier breed of robot conceived as a ""personal health care companion"" of gentle demeanor and reliable intelligence. The robot doesnt enter the story for a while. At the institute Hiro develops tiny mind-controlled nanobots which he presents to Tadashis supervisor. But a mysterious fire leads to tragedy Hiros tantalizing microbot research vanishes and a Kabuki-masked villain appears to be readying the technology for nefarious and action-climax purposes.While were on it Many Disney (and Pixar) animated pictures succumb to this temptation of the protracted action climax. This is one of them. I dare Disney not to end their next three animated features this way. The more ""Big Hero 6"" avoids this stuff and devotes its time and attention to its biggest hero the more charming the results. San Fransokyo architects built a new world for Disneys Big Hero 6 Rebecca Keegan Before the directors of the new Walt Disney Animation movie ""Big Hero 6 settled on their story they created the world in which its set a jammed vibrant place called San Fransokyo.A mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo set in the not-too-distant future San Fransokyo is a dense hilly city with...

(Rebecca Keegan) Hiros human colleagues out to unmask and defeat their masked adversary include Tadashis motley lab partners.

Miller times his self-narrated action movies (""superjump"") just so.Baymax informs Hiro that ""our programming prevents us from injuring a human being"" but hes adaptable upgradable. Hiros improvements to his brothers invention give the robot the ability to fly and the joy ride Hiro and Baymax take high above the bay is a high-velocity standout. Its also a handy companion piece to the films ""Bullitt""-inspired street-level car chase with Hiro and pals pursued by the murderous villain. Without making a big deal out of it ""Big Hero 6"" features a shrewdly balanced and engaging group of male and female characters of various ethnic backgrounds. Itd be nice to live in a world where this wasnt worth a mention but it is. And yet the movie belongs to the big guy. While Baymax has his limitations -- ""I am not fast"" he says when urged to run by one of his human pals -- somehow his face delineated by two black dots connected by a straight line expresses plenty of human emotion. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Scott ""30 Rock"" Adsit voices Baymax aptly as a kind of Americanized mecha-Jeeves ready to serve. Fist-bumped by one of his human comrades he asks for a definition of the phrase. Then sounding like an unusually helpful HMO representative he notes ""I will add fist-bump to my caregiving matrix.""""Big Hero 6"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG (action and peril some rude humor and thematic elements)Running time 145Opens Thursday eveningmjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Big Hero 6 Reviews T.J.

"Big Hero 6 a delightful alternative to dark superhero flicks - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeBig Hero 6 a delightful alternative to dark superhero flicksBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 11/05/2014 031335 PM PSTUpdated 11/06/2014 090713 AM PST At one point during ""Big Hero 6"" my 12-year-old whispered to me ""I want to go to college.""Bingo.If the films only redeeming quality were that it made heroes out of a lab full of college nerds developing mind-bending spectacular gizmos it still would be worth taking the kids. That the new Disney film is funny emotional imaginative well-constructed and beautifully animated makes it a no-brainer for families looking to share a great film experience.In an unspecified age in the skillfully designed place called ""San Fransoyko"" Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a boy genius who despite graduating from high school at 13 is only using his smarts to scam people in back-alley ""bot"" matches. Then his tech wiz college-age brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) convinces Hiro to better channel his energies by showing him the incredible work of his charismatic group of friends at college. Motivated to join them Hiro develops game-changing technology that immediately becomes coveted by tech megaboss Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk) who has a history with the groups adviser professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell).Advertisement Predictably after Hiros triumphant tech presentation tragedy strikes. On his own (the brothers are orphans raised by their Aunt Cass played by Maya Rudolph) Hiro discovers his brothers greatest invention has survived the tragedy. Its name is Baymax (Scott Adsit) a medical robot who looks like a simpler version of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man from ""Ghostbusters."" And he completely steals what was already a captivating movie simply by being an earnest-but-bumbling creature intent on helping people while chaos swirls around him. He becomes the heart and moral compass of the film and provides easy laughs by being oblivious to how his body relates to the world around him and arriving at some humorous well-timed observations (Disney cleverly manages to stay PC while going to the funny drunk-guy well by making Baymax a stumbling mess when his batteries run down). (L-R) Hiro and Baymax in Big Hero 6. (Disney) ( Disney ) Once Hiro transforms his brothers college friends -- adrenaline junkie Go Go Tomago (Jamie Chung) sensitive muscle man Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) chemistry nerd Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and fanboy/surfer dude Fred (T.J. Miller) -- into a patchwork group of superheroes (yes theres a musical training montage) the gang goes after Yokai the Kabuki-masked villain who stole Hiros micro-bot technology. But not before a gorgeous scene in which a modified Baymax -- clad in armor -- takes Hiro on a flight above San Fransoyko (which looks like someone held Tokyo over San Francisco and shook it until its culture rained down). Its the films most striking scene and though it does advance the plot it also serves as a ""look at what we can do"" statement from the studio.The movie grows more predictable as the mystery begins to resolve. But directors Don Hall (""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") overcome this by capitalizing on the evolving relationship between Hiro and Baymax. Meanwhile theres some seriously fun action scenes (without some of the darkness and violence of other superhero films) that recall ""The Incredibles."" The frantic action is balanced by some of the studios most emotional work since ""WALL-E.""Of course theres a big climax that fantastically blends vivid animation with surprises and real emotional resonance. ""Big Hero 6"" is a lighter and much funnier alternative to the onslaught of upcoming superhero team movies from DC (""Justice League"") and Marvel (""The Avengers""). Though ""Big Hero 6"" is based on a Marvel comic series its not produced by Disney-owned Marvel studios even if it does salute Marvel founder Stan Lee. In a film world thats quickly becoming oversaturated by superhero franchises heres hoping we havent seen the last of the characters from ""Big Hero 6.""Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks.Big Hero 6    Rating PG for action and peril some rude humor and thematic elements.Cast Ryan Potter Scott Adsit Jamie ChungDirector Don Hall and Chris WilliamsRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The pair team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 551 p.m. MST November 5 2014Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have made a terrific movie about a boy (Ryan Potter) and his robot friend who seek answers to a deadly tragedy.Hiro and Baymax from the Disney animated film ""Big Hero 6.""(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsCritics review 4.5 starsDirectors Hall and Williams trust their young audience to handle tragedy.The look of the film is amazing.The difference between revenge and justice fuels the movie.Sometimes ignorance really is bliss.I walked into ""Big Hero 6"" knowing next to nothing about it. I hadnt seen any trailers and somehow in a busy month of screenings Id managed to avoid all studio mention of the film except for where it was showing and when. Maybe a cute robot or something?Im really glad. Because Disneys animated feature took me completely by surprise.So theres the quandary. How much to share how much to let you discover for yourself? Well walk a fine line here not giving away too much but trying to persuade you that you really need to see this movie.Its set in the future in a city called San Fransokyo where 14-year-old genius Hiro Hamada (voice of Ryan Potter) channels his brilliance into ... fighting microbots in back alleys in secret. This doesnt much impress his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) a college student at what Hiro calls ""nerd school."" Tadashi wants Hiro to channel his talents and along with friends GoGo (Jamie Chung) Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller) he convinces him that nerd school may not be so bad.Related azcentral.coms newest movies | Fall movie guideAll of these people are geniuses but Hiro proves to be at least their equal if not more creating mind-controlled nanobot technology to impress Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell) who holds the keys to admission.Things turn tragic and Hiro is scarred.Then he happens upon Baymax (Scott Adsit) a health-care robot (who looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man) that his brother was working on and stumbles onto evidence that the tragedy might not have been an accident. Hiro changes Baymaxs programming and collects the others in a high-tech ragtag group of heroes in search of justice.Only not really. Hiro is more interested in vengeance. How he deals with that struggle is an affecting part of the movie.But then again so is everything else.When a dangerous plot starts to unfold in San Fransokyo 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada transforms a nurse robot named Baymax into a high-tech fighting machine. (Photo Disney)Enough plot already. All you really need to know is that there is a truly menacing-looking bad guy (and like the best bad guys that also means he looks cool) and that directors Don Hall and Chris Williams -- along with the usual army of animators -- have created a fantastic-looking world for these characters (based on a Marvel comic) to play around in.In a post-""Toy Story"" era studios sometimes seem to struggle to come up with compelling ideas for animated films. On the face of it ""Big Hero 6"" seems sort of like that -- an idea that isnt really fully formed just a reason to draw a really cute inflatable robot.Nothing could be further from the truth.This movie has many reasons to exist and many to be watched. It has kids solving problems with their brains (which doesnt mean there isnt any action just that the characters have put some thought into it beforehand).It has a diverse bunch of kids working together -- and it never draws attention to that. And its laugh-out loud funny.The animators do a good job incorporating the actors personas into the characters. We never see Millers real face of course but one scene in which Fred is just standing with the others wearing a ridiculous costume had me in stitches in part because it captures Millers goofy good charm and because the suit is just ridiculous.The film also trusts its young audience. Tragedies remain tragic unlike in many movies aimed at kids. It makes the story all the more compelling.Take my word for it or better yet go find out for yourself ""Big Hero 6"" is a treat.AZCENTRALBig Hero 6 (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBig Hero 64.5 starsDirectors Don Hall Chris Williams.Cast Ryan Potter Scott Adsit Jamie Chung.Rating PG for action and peril some rude humor and thematic elements.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Disney) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 5 2014 545 PM Title Big Hero 6 Film Info With the voices of Ryan Potter Scott Adsit. Animated adventure about teens-turned-superheroes. Directors Don Hall Chris Williams (148). PG Violence mature themes -- including death. Area theaters. In 3D where available. A charming introduction to the Marvel universe Disneys animated adventure ""Big Hero 6"" will be embraced by every kid whos left home while their big siblings go see ""The Avengers."" Directors Don Hall (""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") have done a great job creating a pint-sized origins story inspired by the titular comic book heroes. In a mildly futuristic appealingly multicultural city called San Fransokyo grad student Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney) and his friends Go Go (Jamie Chung) Fred (T.J. Miller) Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) spend their time building amazing inventions. Big Hero 6 was executive produced by Pixar guru John Lasseter. You can see the influence in the high quality. After Tadashi unveils the adorable Baymax (Scott Adsit) a marshmallowy mechanical companion his 14-year-old brother Hiro (Ryan Potter) is inspired to create a collection of shape-shifting nanobots. When tragedy strikes and a masked villain steals the nanobots Hiro and Tadashis friends band together with Baymax using their technological creativity to turn themselves into superheroes. ""Big Hero 6"" was executive produced by Pixar guru John Lasseter. You can see the influence in the high quality from the appealing 3D animation to the unusually sharp story and script (a cooperative effort credited to seven people). Hiro and Baymax in Disneys Big Hero 6 (Disney) Though much of the movie is funny young viewers may be unsettled by the dark undertones. Death and loss are woven throughout in familiar Disney fashion. Hiro endures levels of heartbreak that come to feel unnecessarily crushing. The villain too is a disappointment especially for those old enough to guess his identity immediately. But between the well-conceived leads inventive action scenes and awesome gadgets theres plenty of compensation for these complaints. Hall and Williams have given us one of the rare family films that can fairly boast of having it all humor heart and huggability. Seriously -- place your orders for a stuffed Baymax now. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews big hero 6 don hall chris williams daniel henney jamie chung t.j. miller damon wayans jr. genesis rodriguez ryan potter scott adsit Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Disney MOVIE REVIEW Big Hero 6 Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor and action). At the Lincoln Square the E-Walk the 84th Street others Big Hero 6"" is one of those Disney movies in which you can practically see the hot breath of the marketing guy condensed on the neck of the screenwriter. The hapless scribe must have said ""You know what? You write this thing."" Why does the villain wear a kabuki mask? ""Itll look cool on the action figure"" Why is there a team of superfriends if theyre not going to do much of anything? ""We need a full set of figurines for the Happy Meal."" Why are Tokyo and San Francisco merged if nothing is going to be made of this? ""Japan is a huge sales target."" Despite painstaking effort to make this story of two siblings Hiro (Ryan Potter) and Tadashi (Daniel Henney) as resonant as the one in ""Frozen"" ""Big Hero 6"" is marred by slow development bland characterizations limp jokes and meaningless action scenes thrown in at random. Hiro 14 is a mildly rebellious tech genius being raised by a wise kindly equally gifted and boringly perfect older brother who creates an inflatable robot nurse named Baymax that becomes the boys puffy mentor while the kid tries to solve a mild one-twist mystery. Hiro has invented ""microbots"" tiny metallic elements that can be telepathically assembled into any shape. When a masked fiend steals the microbots and turns them to evil Hiro has to figure out the villains identity with the help of a dull team of fellow tech nerds (T.J. Miller does some tired Jeff Spicoli schtick as one; Damon Wayans Jr. is another a neat freak). Hiro is a tech genius being raised by his older brother who creates an inflatable robot nurse Baymax that becomes the boys puffy mentor.Photo Disney I was trying to figure out why a guy with such superpowers is so incompetent Couldnt he just turn some of his microbots into bullets? Throw jail cells around the kids? Handcuff them? Instead hes forever conjuring forth bridges and towers that create exciting opportunities for the animators but allow the kids plenty of time to simply run away. Clad in armor and taught some karate moves Baymax -- Iron Man meet Michelin Man -- becomes Hiros sidekick/a merchandising opportunity and though there is some nice warmth and camaraderie between the two the three screenwriters cant come up with much in the way of laughs. (When Hiro says something great is ""sick"" Baymax believes he means ""unwell."" Also the robot thinks a cat is a fuzzy baby.) Soon boy and blob are zooming above San Fransokyo for no reason except that flying sequences look cool. This is preparatory to a noisy clattering but unengaging battle scene in which the villain again just doesnt seem to be trying. Moreover the baddie lacks depth or nuance and turns out to be both thinly motivated and laboring under a misunderstanding that defeats his purpose. ""Oops nevermind"" is a line that isnt in the script but could have been. A product of Disney buying Marvel comics (though it feels like the reverse) ""Big Hero 6"" even has a title that sounds like a product ordered off the takeout menu of the type of restaurant that recombines a few elements in many ways. That could work fine if any of the ingredients were particularly flavorful.

Its a heartwarming relationship at least in science fiction where it stretches from the crude baby boomer days of TVs ""Gigantor"" and ""Lost in Space"" to modern more sophisticated entertainments such as ""The Iron Giant"" and yes ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day."" Disneys new ""Big Hero 6"" falls roughly in the middle. An overcalculated attempt to both tap into Japanese anime style and appeal to overseas audiences the story is set in a kind of ""Blade Runner"" California where Tony Bennetts favorite city is now called ""San Fransokyo."" But its not a dystopia (despite a few evil-Orient cliches like gambling dens). And its home to Hiro and Tadashi two Asian-American teens who love robotics and -- in kid brother Hiros case -- running around and getting into trouble. But then its Tadashi who runs into real trouble. And Hiro decides only Tadashis last invention a giant robot can help. Unfortunately the giant robot is also soft as a pillow sweet as an all-day sucker and permanently programmed as a tireless ""health-care companion"" who offers worried diagnoses endless Band-Aids and occasionally big caring hugs. Not quite the fearless automaton Hiro needs. Unless he can do some major reprogramming ... This is all fine and Baymax the robot -- who is nicely voiced by Scott Adsit and drawn to look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man -- is a truly wonderful character taking dainty steps and offering motherly advice in the midst of danger. His scenes with Hiro -- first as they get to know each other and later much more dramatically as they learn to depend on each other -- are truly felt and the best in the movie. In between though theres the rest of the film in which Hiro -- adequately voiced by Ryan Potter -- recruits four fellow geeks from Tadashis college. And thats where the movie machinery begins to show as Hiro hands out superhero costumes and powers and assembles what will be along with Baymax Big Hero 6. Theres one girl whos tough (she likes motorcycles) and another whos all girly. Theres one guy whos kind of a doper (albeit in the drug-free way that Shaggy was on ""Scooby-Doo"") and another whos African-American. (Really thats about all the writers could come up with Hes black.) The team quickly spies a mysterious villain in a Kabuki mask -- a character who at least gives the movie some flavor -- and the action begins. But apart from T.J. Millers toasted line readings as the addled Fred theres not much life or interest to these people. Its well-realized visually of course -- we even see the shadows that rain-streaked windows throw on walls -- but everything and everyone feels dully mechanical. And so the movie goes on until it ends in exactly the way most superhero movies seem to end these days -- with the discovery of a giant power source the destruction of a large part of the city heroic sacrifices and the promise of an inevitable sequel. Again as boy-and-his-robot stories go its strictly in the middle of the movie pack. Interestingly though the feature starts with a bonus unrelated cartoon about a man and his dog called ""Feast."" Its about shared pleasures true love and junk food tells its simple story without a line of dialogue and seems guaranteed an Oscar slot for best animated short. Probably because -- unlike the main feature -- it doesnt feel like it was made by machines. Ratings note The film contains violence. Big Hero 6 (PG) Disney (102 min.) Directed by Don Hall Chris Williams. With the voices of Scott Adsit Ryan Potter.

Big Hero 6 has been adapted from an obscure comic owned by corporate sibling Marvel telling the nonetheless familiar story of Hiro (Ryan Potter) a teenage robotics genius who learns to use his brainpower for good by assembling a science-driven superhero team including a pudgy nurse robot called Baymax (Scott Adsit). Baymax becomes a clever meditation on the superhero mission Hes programmed only for gentle helping and healing not engaging in cool-looking battles although the movie sometimes downplays that subtext in favor of generic huggability. Fair enough for a movie that should delight kids but on the adult side Big Hero 6 proceeds less idiosyncratically than Ralph or Frozen. Despite the Marvel-style origin story its derivative of better Brad Bird cartoons like The Iron Giant and The Incredibles. Still the animation is fluid and inventive balancing action and slapstick with aplomb. Its an enjoyable diversion from a studio that usually offers more.

(Video) Guardians of the Galaxys Dancing Baby Groot Coming to a Store Near You Marvels Daredevil First Looks Released by Netflix (Photos) Marvel Comics to Celebrate 75 Years With Hour-Long ABC Special in November Yes its a super-team origin story but one told with wit style and human feeling Complain all you want about the current vogue of superhero movies but if every so often we get a ""Big Hero 6"" -- a kid-friendly saga that features an Asian protagonist an ethnically- and gender-diverse group of costumed crusaders and positive messages about science education and compassion -- then it justifies the genres existence. Directors Don Hall (the lovely under-appreciated 2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") have incorporated the visuals and the adrenaline of Japanese anime into an American context resulting in a film that feels thrillingly global yet relatably specific. (The setting of ""San Fransokyo"" is one of the best melded fantasy movie metropolises this side of ""Babe Pig in the City."") See video Cuddly Robot Baymax Is a Crime-Fighting Marshmallow in Latest Big Hero 6 Trailer (Video) Fourteen-year-old high-school graduate Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) wastes his talents at electronics on underground bot-fighting until his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) convinces him to join him in college; far from the ""nerd school"" Hiro had assumed San Fransokyo Tech is where Tadashi and his friends -- including Gogo (Jamie Chung ""Once Upon a Time"") Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and goofy sidekick Fred (T.J. Miller) -- are making exciting discoveries and inventing really cool stuff. Tragedy strikes when Hiro presents his extraordinary thought-controlled nano-bots as his admission project theres an accidental explosion costing Tadashi and distinguished professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) their lives. Hiro is devastated at the loss until he discovers Baymax (Scott Adsit ""30 Rock"") the sweet-natured health-care robot that Tadashi invented (and imbued with his sense of kindness and understanding). Baymax is blobby and inflatable and in no way the kind of robot you would imagine would be helpful in chasing down bad guys but when Hiro realizes that someone has stolen his nano-bot tech for nefarious purposes he attempts to retool Baymax into a flying karate-kicking mecha-weapon of vengeance. Tadashis old friends get outfitted with superhero costumes and tricked-out weapons but the situation gets complicated when they (and Baymax) realize that Hiro is blinded by revenge in his pursuit of justice. Also read Interstellar Big Hero 6 Tracking for Blockbuster 60 Million Box Office Openings ""Big Hero 6"" offers spectacular visions mixing a realistic sense of place and people with delirious flights of inter-dimensional heroic fancy remaining true to its comic-book source (Pixar vets Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson loosely adapt the Marvel miniseries) without ever losing the human element among the larger-than-life finale. Its in that third act that you can feel the film getting tethered to the tracks of kid-movie narrative but ""Big Hero 6"" has built up so much creative goodwill by then that its easy to forgive. The lush and vibrant visuals help in that department; this is one of the few 2-D films Ive ever seen that I want to go back and see again in 3-D. Also read Women Blacks Gays Warner Bros. Catapults DC Ahead of Marvel in Superhero Diversity Race Even with Tadashis death (to say nothing of the fact that the Hamada brothers are in true Disney fashion orphans) the film balances out the mournful moments with lots of big laughs. The screenplay offers the kind of gags certain to be cited during fist-bumps and ""On a scale of 1 to 10 describe your pain"" prognosis for years to come. Sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious ""Big Hero 6"" comes to the rescue of whats become a dreaded movie trope -- the origin story -- and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights.

Loosely adapted from an obscure Marvel Comics title and set in the slightly futuristic city of San Fransokyo (where cable cars and cherry blossoms co-exist in perfect harmony) the funny and heartwarming story about the bond between a teen tech geek and a gentle robot represents another cant-miss proposition by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Read More Disneys Big Hero 6 A Primer on the Obscure Marvel Comic Like Frozen Big Hero 6 co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams handily defies convention in regard to presumably skewing more to one gender demo over the other. Sure its got robotics and superheroes but it also has plenty of emotional resonance and of course merchandising gold in the form of an oversized huggable vinyl balloon of a Personal Healthcare Companion that bears more than a passing physical resemblance to the star of Hayao Miyazakis My Neighbor Totoro. The appealing result should cast a very wide net for Disney with a strong potential for future heroics. Read More Tokyo Film Festival Market to Open With Animation Focus A 14-year-old prodigy who graduated from high school at 13 Hiro Hamada (affectingly voiced by Ryan Potter) hasnt exactly been living up to his potential preferring to spend his time and money entering his microbot in back-alley battles. When his big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) is killed in a fiery accident grieving Hiro takes comfort in the companionship provided by Tadashis invention -- a gentle nurse robot named Baymax (a pitch-perfect Scott Adsit). Upon discovering that his brothers death was in fact the result of a nefarious plot Hiro goes after the culprit but not before making a few upgrades to Baymax that bring him up to crime-fighting specs. He also receives some heroic backup from Tadashis friends including adrenaline junkie GoGo (Jamie Chung) neat freak Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) alchemy whiz Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and ultimate fanboy Fred (T.J. Miller). Of the 17 main characters on display in this technically ambitious production Baymax handily steals the show with directors Hall (Winnie the Pooh) and Williams (Bolt) working from a script by Robert L. Baird amp; Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts pitching the gentle giants various physical challenges to maximum comic effect. The films big-ticket action sequences while unmistakably state of the art ultimately fall short of matching the visual exhilaration of those gorgeous San Fransokyo backdrops which present a seamless fusion of traditional Japanese and Victorian-influenced American architecture. That top-notch voice cast also includes the always reliable Maya Rudolph as nurturing Aunt Cass who has cared for the boys ever since their parents died. Of course it wouldnt be an animated Disney movie if both mom and dad were still in the picture. Screenings of Big Hero 6 will be preceded by Feast Patrick Osbornes sweet elegantly animated dogs-eye-view take on life love and especially food that contains all the ingredients of an Oscar front-runner.

With ""Big Hero 6"" an obscure Marvel Comics title gives the Mouse Houses toon division just enough raw material to assemble its own superhero franchise starring millions of robots -- including one a balloon-bellied virtual nurse named Baymax that youll never forget. Co-directors Don Hall and Chris Williams borrow the character names and a few key details from their pulp source but otherwise succeed in putting a thoroughly Disney spin on things delivering appealing personalities bright peppy animation positive life lessons and what looks like a world record for the sheer amount of hugging featured in a superhero movie. More male-skewing than ""Frozen"" the relatively hip result should do big business for Disney especially in Asian territories with easy expansion possibilities via additional movies comics or a TV series. Set in a beautifully rendered futuristic hybrid city called San Fransokyo -- which combines familiar NorCal features like steep hills the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay with skyscrapers neon signs and characteristically Japanese architectural flourishes -- ""Big Hero 6"" synthesizes American and Asian cultural sensibilities across the board. Displaying a special love for Japanese robotics screenwriters Robert L. Baird Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts integrate elements of manga anime and science fiction into the very fabric of the computer-animated project but also succumb to the same pitfalls faced by so many other superhero pics Namely after establishing its fresh and relatable origin story the movie gets bogged down with a relatively generic villains power-hungry schemes. Still theres enough thats new and different about ""Big Hero 6"" to get excited about especially for those still too young for Marvels more intense live-action fare. A couple of decades ago Disney went out of its way to diversify its princess lineup featuring characters such as Mulan and Pocahontas in culturally specific stories designed to reflect their unique backgrounds. ""Big Hero 6"" seems wonderfully color-blind by comparison centering on a Japanese-American lead 14-year-old Hiro Hamada (voiced with contagious enthusiasm by Ryan Potter) in a role that could have gone to a character of any race or gender. Hiro is crazy-smart for a kid his age. An amateur inventor with a special interest in robotics he graduated from high school at 13 and now spends his time hustling bigger mecha at underground bot-fighting competitions -- a hobby that jumpstarts the high-energy story with a few ""Real Steel""-style scenes early on. Older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) wishes Hiro would pick something safer to occupy his time arranging an impromptu tour of the university science lab in hopes that the teen might be tempted to enroll. Pay special attention to the four inventors who work alongside Tadashi in the school lab since they will soon join Hiros band of amateur crime-fighters. These misfits include cycling junkie GoGo Tamago (Jamie Chung); laser-blade innovator Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.); chemical-reactions specialist Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez); and Fred (T.J. Miller) a shaggy-haired weirdo obsessed with Godzilla and other freak-of-nature phenomena. As a group they come across less like the Avengers than the dorky members of Scooby-Doos mystery-solving squad. So whos the sixth member of Hiros gang of heroes? That would be Baymax a robotic Healthcare Companion unlike any A.I. auds have previously encountered onscreen. (As voiced by ""30 Rocks"" Scott Adsit the character serves as a walking comedy routine -- a throwback to the way Paul Reubens played things in ""Flight of the Navigator"" a generation earlier.) In a movie that boasts no shortage of creative design elements Baymax is by far the most compelling inspired by a new class of ""soft robotics"" being developed at Carnegie Mellon U. whose mechanical endoskeletons are completely hidden by puffy nonthreatening vinyl. With his squeaky inflatable suit and gentle demeanor Baymax looks like a cross between the Marshmallow Man and a giant panda. Personality-wise the benign bot represents an extreme case of Asimovs first law ""A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm."" In his naive uniquely amusing way Baymax is hyper-attentive almost to the point of smothering dispensing lollipops and hugs as the situation demands. But hes also a quick study learning as he goes which makes the movie feel a bit like ""How to Train Your Robot"" for the first hour or so complete with high-flying bonding sequences that take us throughout the elaborate densely detailed world of San Fransokyo -- in dynamic stereoscopic 3D no less. Before his disappearance Tadashi programmed Baymax to look after his younger brother. Now that Hiro is all alone (except for his oblivious Aunt Cass played for grins by Maya Rudolph) the robot serves almost as a surrogate parental figure -- albeit one that can be upgraded according to its childs whims. The pics most entertaining sequences feature Hiro tinkering with his new gizmo trying to take what looks like an embarrassing baby toy and toughen him up whether that means updating Baymaxs database to include a full library of advanced karate moves or creating custom body armor to mask his harmless appearance. Lately Disney has been taking turns making toons for girls (""Tangled"") and toons for boys (""Wreck-It Ralph"") and though ""Big Hero 6"" falls squarely in the latter camp Baymax is such an endearing character it shouldnt be hard to attract auds of both sexes. Still given the emotional sincerity of the pics first half its a shame the filmmakers felt obliged to resort to a testosterone-fueled battle with a less-than-special villain whose identity comes as a surprise (but maybe not enough of one). What sets this bad guy apart is the fact that his ""power"" is derived from one of Hiros own inventions a system of micro-bots that do their masters bidding resulting in a hypnotic ever-evolving force to be reckoned with a bit like ""Terminator 2s"" liquid-metal shape-shifter or the gloopy black symbiote seen in ""Spider-Man 3."" The villain who hides his identity behind a kabuki mask and the members of Hiros wisecracking team all remain recognizable human characters throughout. Theyre not suddenly blessed with imaginary new powers or miraculously transformed by gamma rays like so many other Marvel types. Instead the film eliminates the stigma of being a ""nerd"" illustrating how college-level intelligence gave them the tools to make themselves special boasting a few useful lessons on anger management and the futility of vengeance in the process. By now the Disney-Marvel universe is already filled to bursting with big heroes and its reasonable to ask whether the world really needs six more especially when all but Baymax feel like kids in high-end Halloween costumes. The movie hypes this new sextets introduction by blasting Fall Out Boys anthemic ""Immortals"" on the soundtrack (which employs a stock rock-music score courtesy of Henry Jackman) but hasnt entirely convinced us by the end that we need more adventures from these characters. Couldnt the Mouse House focus on doing that ""Incredibles"" sequel first? As an amuse bouche to the talky main attraction ""Big Hero 6"" will be accompanied in theaters by a virtually dialogue-free six-minute short called ""Feast."" In a fun twist the film is told as a montage of meals tracking a dozen years in the relationship between a Boston Terrier and his owner as seen from the insatiably hungry dogs perspective. Technically speaking this is an experimental short in its visual style and its narrative approach and it takes a bit of time to get ones bearings but the emotional core is so strong that we cant help choking up. If director Patrick Osborne can do that in six minutes with ""Feast"" perhaps its fair to ask more of the feature that follows.
