Comments click to enlarge Year One 2009 Harold Ramiss career as a big-studio filmmaker might well have ended with The Ice Harvest (2005) a classy grown-up crime comedy that flopped miserably. Luckily for Ramis he has fans in high places Judd Apatow the hottest comedy director in the business (Knocked Up The 40-Year-Old Virgin) grew up worshipping the stuff Ramis wrote in the late 70s and early 80s (SCTV Animal House Caddyshack Stripes) and stepped up to produce this new feature. Creatively its a giant step backwards with Jack Black and Michael Cera playing to the kids as inept hunter-gatherers who stumble across various Old Testament characters. With David Cross and Paul Rudd (as Cain and Abel) and Hank Azaria and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as Abraham and Isaac). PG-13 97 min. By J.R.

There are only two problems its kind of dull and just isnt funny.The films most obvious inspiration is Mel Brooks notably History of the World. Its an appropriate comparison the films share a similarly ramshackle structure reliance on pop-culture references and shameless mugging from a largely wasted cast. Dominating proceedings here is Jack Black going through the madcap motions as hapless cave-schlub Zed banished from his tribe with only naive sidekick Oh (Michael Cera) for company. The pair find themselves traipsing through the Old Testament encountering David Crosss murderous Cain and Hank Azarias circumcision-crazy Abraham before ending up at the fall of Sodom.If the stage seems set for some Life of Brian-style religious lampoonery forget it Ramis and his writers arent about to risk saying anything remotely controversial. Instead were treated to farting peasants slapstick violence and a series of increasingly tiresome gay jokes courtesy of Oliver Platts Sodomite high priest. Ramis makes the best of spectacular locations but the set and costume design is so shoddy the film looks more like a student revue than a Hollywood blockbuster. Which is another apt analogy with its adolescent exhibitionism scattershot improv and a general air of jokes-for-the-boys Year One belongs more to the college theatre than the multiplex.

By Peter Rainer June 19 2009 Save for later Saved In this image released by Columbia Pictures Jack Black left and Michael Cera are shown in a scene from ""Year One."" Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The first thing to be said about ""Year One"" is that it does not take place in Year One. The second thing to be said is that it doesnt live up to its hilarious poster featuring a Neanderthal-ish Jack Black and Michael Cera and the tag line ""Meet Your Ancestors."" The third thing to be said is that it is only marginally better than ""Land of the Lost."" The fourth thing to be said is that as you may have deduced from No. 3 it is grindingly unfunny.Since I am an aficionado as twere of dumb/smart goofball comedy I was disappointed to realize early on that ""Year One"" is basically just dumb/dumb. Jack Black plays Zed a human furball who looks and acts pretty much the way Jack Black does in every one of his movies. Michael Cera as Oh is pretty much the same old Michael Cera - anxious tentative virginal. That last part comes in for a lot of ribbing in ""Year One."" Didnt anyone in the Paleozoic Era see ""Juno""?But as I already mentioned most of this movie takes place in a biblical/Roman-era mishmash with some Egypt thrown in. Zed and Oh buddies banished from their village encounter everybody from Abraham (Hank Azaria) to Cain (David Cross) to - I hope Im not giving anything away here - Zaftig the Eunuch (Kyle Gass). Director and co-screenwriter Harold Ramis is aiming for a Hope-Crosby road picture feel which only works if the lead actors know how to riff off each other. Here they dont. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If youre in the mood for this sort of thing why bother with ""Year One"" when you can rent ""Caveman"" or Mel Brookss ""History of the World - Part 1"" or better yet any old Monty Python movie (especially ""Life of Brian""). The people who made ""Year One"" seem to think that all you have to do to make a hit comedy is get a bunch of jokesters together. But where are the jokes? Grade D+ (Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout brief strong language and comic violence.)

Its script isnt worth the papyrus its inscribed on. Jack Black and Michael Cera are Zed and Oh two hapless cavemen who are chased out of their huts and run into a series of Old Testament characters suggesting the title year is off by a few centuries. MOVIE BLOG Get the latest film news The main gag is to describe every situation in modern slang. Zed eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge ""Its got sort of a knowledge-y taste."" People wander around saying ""Buh-bye"" or ""Were good"" or ""When do you think the smitings gonna go down?"" Other gags include being all ancient-y about modern references ""What transpires within the confines of the walls of Sodom stays within the confines of the walls of Sodom."" To pass the rest of the time Black picks up some dung and tastes it people break wind in each others general direction and Cera while hanging upside down pees on his own face. Never would I have guessed that I would exit a movie longing for the relative wit of the B.C. comic strip that used to run in the newspapers. Zed ""What are those big round things?"" Response ""Theyre wheels numbskull"" Numbskull? Is Fred Flintstone writing this stuff? Like many an ancient civilization most scenes come to abrupt and inexplicable ends. One minute Cera has a deadly snake or a cougar wrapped around him then we cut to the next bit. Only in rare moments do the talents of the two stars -- Black strong like bear; Cera skittery like chicken -- enable them to maketh with the giggles. Among his accomplishments says Oh is ""building a shelf system in my hut."" Informed that Sodom and Gomorrah are full of despicable lustful harlots he asks ""Which one of the two cities has the most whores?"" Cain (David Cross) kills Abel (Paul Rudd) then kills him again and then a third time but it never gets any funnier. Accused by his papa (Harold Ramis who also directed the movie) and his sister Cain says ""Lets be honest. Lilith is a lying bitch."" Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse a k a McLovin from ""Superbad"") tells his homicidal dad Abraham (Hank Azaria) ""If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff would you do it?"" Naturally Zed starts calling Abraham ""Abe"" for extra hilarity. Much of the audience doesnt like to hear Bible stories mocked and the rest wont recognize the stories in the first place. (""Whats Liliths last name -- Fair?"") The nonstop raunch -- sheep-copulating draws a lot of interest -- doesnt conceal the fact that youve seen Book of Genesis jokes done about CLXX times before. Haircuts-of-Genesis jokes would have been fresher considering some of Peter Gabriels 70s looks and more relevant to the audience. For lo it has come to pass that the first two Google hits for Genesis are about the band not the book. ""Year One"" producers had better start praying to the pagan idols because the box-office soothsayers are murmuring that this thing isnt going to gross 10 shekels. kyle.smithnypost.com YEAR ONE Goeth nowhere. Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (crude and sexual humor profanity comic violence). At the Lincoln Square the Orpheum the 34th Street others.

""Year One"" Movie Review -- And lo It came to pass in those days of rain without end and of the bugs that biteth the limbs even with Off and the investments that do sinketh like millstones that there was a need for merriment. And so a cry went forth. Year One (PG-13) Columbia (100 min.) Directed by Harold Ramis. With Jack Black Michael Cera. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING ONE STAR Rating note The vision doth contain much to offend and little to amuse. And the people did wail and gnash their teeth and rend their garments except those nice ones they just got at Chicos and they did shout unto the heavens ""Lord relieve our woe with a comic film. And the studio did open ""Year One."" And the people did see it. And then the wailing and gnashing of teeth did truly begin and the people did rend their garments once more even those cute white capris that they just got at such a sale you wouldnt believe. For the film was an abomination. And its sins were not just against the sacred texts and a screenplay which did put cavemen with Adam and Cain and Abel and Abraham and Sodom and Gomorrah all at once and mixed together like that nice taco salad you had last week at Chilis. And its evil was not just that it put Oliver Platt in mascara and stripped him to the waist and oiled him. Or that it put Jack Black in a loincloth and stripped him to the waist and had him shake his hips which is a thing outside of nature except maybe one or two bars in Chelsea. No its sin was worse than that. For it was the sin of not being funny. And it made some speak of enchantments including the scribe of visions who is wise and deserving of respect and did write the very text you read now. For truly was this not a film made by the man who had once busted ghosts and directed ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Caddyshack""? And had this work not tarried in the fertile fields of producer Judd of Apatow? And did it not count among its people Michael Cera of ""Superbad"" and Christopher Mintz-Plasse who will forever labor to escape and yet be bound to the name of McLovin? For it did. And in truth that did augur good and well. But lo Although the seed of comedy was planted the plant that rose was sickly. And it grew as blasted as the tree of Job and as mean as the deserts of Egypt and as small and joyless as that man on Route 9 with the comb-over who does your taxes. For there was little humor in it. There was only silliness and ugliness and much body hair and much senseless stupidity. For instead of irreverence it offered ignorance. And what might have been a jest in the Flying Circus of Monty was a torture in the hands of Harold Ramis. In truth the players under his command labored mightily. Black did raise one eyebrow and then lower the other and caper like a yak. And Cera spoke in soft sad tones and searched for laughs in every scene like a slave sent to sift through the dungheap for his mistresses lost jewels. But even when found the reek was inescapable. For the film had neither wit nor wisdom nor charm nor beauty. It merely had much talk of penises and their foreshortening and Sodom and its backwards practices. And there was a scene in which Cera did pass his own water into his face and a scene in which Black did eat an animals waste. And the audience did say truly those two got off easy. For at least they did not have to sit here with us and watch this. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

"Year One | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; year-one ) Year One (United States 2009) June 18 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Two weeks ago I wrote that while watching Land of the Lost I felt a sense of depression. That feeling revisited me during Year One an inexplicably unfunny comedy made by two people who have proven they can do much better director/co-writer Harold Ramis and co-producer Judd Apatow. Filled to the point of overflowing with gross-out humor Year One might get some belly laughs from six and seven year olds who cant resist giggling at the image of someone farting or peeing on himself but I found the most extreme material to be so tasteless that it voided all comedy. And when one gets beyond the scatological elements the rest of the jokes are obligatory rarely generating more than cursory chuckles. Year One treats the Biblical book of ""Genesis"" not as a chronology of events but as a geographical roadmap. The Garden of Eden is here; Cain Abel Adam and Eve are there; Abraham and Isaac are in yet another location; and Sodom and Gomorrah are elsewhere - all separated not by time but by distance. I was a little disappointed that the world isnt big enough for Noah and Moses but I suppose its necessary to hold something back in the (hopefully unlikely) case theres a sequel (which would I suppose be called Year Two). The film isnt precisely a satire of Bible stories - it might have worked better had that been the objective . Instead its a mismatched buddy movie that tosses in some Biblical names and locations. Knowing Ramis track record (admittedly spotty of late but strong overall) and recognizing the underlying premise I was hoping for something along the lines of Monty Python and the Life of Brian. Fifteen minutes into the film I had downgraded those expectations to The History of the World Part One. Another quarter hour later I was desperately wishing that Year One wouldnt go as far off the tracks as Land of the Lost did. It managed to avoid a complete derailment but only barely. The film opens by introducing two early men inept hunter Zed (Jack Black) and equally inept gatherer Oh (Michael Cera). Neither has much luck with women - Maya (June Diane Raphael) the object of Zeds lust views him as an unlikely provider and Eema (Juno Temple) Ohs would be bedmate doesnt know he exists. When Zed violates tribal law by eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge while Oh gets wrapped up by a boa constrictor the pair are exiled. They wander around a bit before coming upon quarreling brothers Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd). After killing his brother Cain brings his new buddies home to meet Mom and Dad. The next day its back on the road. A few misadventures later Zed and Oh are headed for Sodom and Gomorrah where Maya and Eema are being held as slaves. As they approach the city Zed is certain he is the Chosen of God but Oh isnt so sure. For me a little Jack Black generally goes a long way. Blacks best work has been in supporting roles; his prickly hammy personality quickly wears out its welcome when he has too much screen time. That happens in Year One by about the ten-minute mark. His coupling with Michael Cera is ill-conceived. Cera has an extremely limited range - the insecure teenager - in which he is effective. Outside of it as is the case here he appears lost. Year One wants us to see Zed and Oh as the stone age equivalent of Oscar and Felix but the attempt fails so utterly that it wont occur even to those who know who Oscar and Felix are. Perhaps the great mystery surrounding Year One is how it wrangled a PG-13 rating from an increasingly inconsistent MPAA. (Slumdog Millionaire R; Year One PG-13 - can someone explain that?) Apparently there were some edits but the end result is still easily the most raunchy PG-13 I have seen. A few years ago Judd Apatow declared that he was going to put a penis in every movie. He doesnt get a flesh-and-blood one into Year One but there are more phallic symbols than in a telephone pole farm. There are dick jokes and gay jokes and those are the ones in good taste. Moments that will have the seven-year-olds rolling in the aisles include a fart that goes on far too long and includes more than a whiff of diarrhea Zed munching happily on human excrement and Oh urinating all over his face. The question isnt what this material is doing in a PG-13 movie; its what its doing in any movie. Many things are forgiven in the name of comedy but this isnt funny. Its just gross. People sitting around me were cringing not laughing. Arguably the comedic highlight of Year One (to the extent there is one) is Hank Azarias Shatneresque interpretation of Abraham. His ultra-serious deadpan delivery brings a smile to the face although it doesnt last long due in large part to Azarias limited screen time. Abraham isnt around for more than a few brief scenes; hes just a colorful side character on Zed and Ohs Genesis road trip. After fleeing during the night after Abraham starts talking about cutting foreskins its on to Sodom and Gomorrah and thats where Year One already barely treading water sinks like a stone plummeting all the way into Disaster Movie territory. If theres a moral to Year One its something financial planners always warn about past performance does not guarantee future results. In the case of Harold Ramis and Judd Apatow this film is an object lesson as far as that precept is concerned. As punishment they should be forced to watch 10000 B.C. and Wholly Moses five times each.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 18 2009 333PM EDT Last updated Saturday Jun. 20 2009 354AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Year One Directed by Harold Ramis Written by Harold Ramis Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg Starring Jack Black and Michael Cera Classification 14A In the beginning back in the late seventies and early eighties there was Monty Pythons Life of Brian  Mel Brookss History of the World Part I and Harold Ramis first of SCTV and later Caddyshack and Groundhog Day fame. They begat a new generation of comics including the bumptious fatted Jack Black and producer Judd Apatow whose comedies which multiplied upon the screens included Superbad  starring the sensitive string bean Michael Cera. Lo the Hollywood gods declared that this was good and profitable and someone had a bright idea ""Why dont we get Ramis to direct one of those historic episodic sketch comedies with a couple of contemporary dudes?"" Thus Black and Cera posed in cave-man outfits for an amusing poster. Then the movie was brought forth and things went downhill. In Year One  Black and Cera star as stone-age buddies Zed and Oh (respectively) who are as unskilled in romance as they are in the only two careers available hunting and gathering Zed yearns for the curvy Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Oh is crushing on the sweetly dizzy Eema (Juno Temple). But before they can make any headway Zed and Oh are banished from their village after Zed eats from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil which doesnt make him any smarter. While wandering away from their forest home they see evidence of other humans and Zed snacks on some poop which doesnt make the movie any smarter either. They wander across the desert into Old Testament times and meet a truculent Cain (David Cross) fighting with his brother Abel (an uncredited Paul Rudd). Later they meet the zealous Abraham (Hank Azaria in the movies best performance) who is attempting to sacrifice his unwilling son Isaac (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse a.k.a Superbad s McLovin). These Biblical encounters featuring characters who mix intellectual obtuseness and a penchant for violence are the scenes most obviously derived from Monty Python. When Abraham tries to introduce them to his new idea for honouring God Zed and Oh save their foreskins by running away to Sodom. There they spend the last half of the movie trying to rescue Maya and Eema who have gone from being cave girls to slave girls. Perhaps the best that can be said for Year One is that it aims low and hits the mark. Black blusters and Cera bumbles in very familiar ways here and they react to a sequence of humiliations with their contrasting speech volumes. Even if you never tire of Black and Ceras personas the material - written by Ramis and The Office s Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg - is flimsier than Salomes veil. Jokes that are mildly funny seem to be repeated three times and those that arent a couple of times more than that. The city of Sodom is portrayed as a sort of blend of prison and 24-hour toga party where guards and leaders have unexpected English accents and virgins are sacrificed to encourage rainfall. (""What a waste of a perfectly good virgin"" sighs Zed.) The court has a sympathetic princess (Olivia Wilde from the TV series House ) who becomes their ally. Theres also a running gag that grows progressively homophobic with Oliver Platt playing a mincing heavily made-up high priest with a fondness for hot-oil massages. As part of its bits-and-pieces approach to comedy Year One features a number of cameos including appearances from Saturday Night Live s Horatio Sanz and Bill Hader and even a part for Kyle Gass Blacks partner in the musical duo Tenacious D. He plays a eunuch who carries his petrified testes around in a cloth bag. For anyone curious to know what Year One could have possibly left out the closing credits are accompanied by a collection of flubbed takes which are about as funny as whats in the movie. They reveal that the performers at least appear to have been having a good time.

In Year One Jack Black left and Michael Cera play two inept cave men who are banished from their village and explore their prehistoric world. Photo SUZANNE HANOVER  COLUMBIA PICTURES Year One 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dawn-of-time music thunders portentously from the soundtrack as a band of primitive hunters track down a wild boar. For about 30 seconds of Year One we could be watching a drama -- or something even more ridiculously straight-faced and somber such as a historical re-enactment in a TV documentary. And then one of the hunters screws up badly and we meet Jack Black as Zed an overly confident loudmouth cave man who somehow cant find his place in prehistoric culture. Year One has one joke but its a good one played for many variations over the course of an often very funny comedy Its the contrast between the modern sensibility embodied by Black and Michael Cera and that of a brutal early period of history. The comedy turns on the spectacle of a pair of modern-seeming people who keep finding that their best attributes -- wit sensitivity loquaciousness inventiveness -- are useless in a world in which courtship consists of hitting a girl over the head with a club and dragging her to the hut. Blacks and Ceras comic styles are quite different. On screen Blacks persona tends to be self-promoting and easily exasperated a character in constant collision with his environment who acts before he thinks and tries to get by on bluff. Cera by contrast is watchful and paranoid sardonic and full of dread who thinks hard before he commits in any direction. These contrasts make them a superb comic duo and so does their one similarity They both operate under the implicit assumption that the world is a threatening place that must be mastered either by forceful action (Black) or careful thought (Cera). Actually Black and Cera have something else in common. They are both very skilled very precise comedians. In the case of Black this is well-known and in the case of Cera its no surprise considering his performance in Superbad. Still its a striking thing to find a 21-year-old actor with such self-assurance such innate timing and such a thorough understanding of himself as a screen entity. Even Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin didnt really get under way until they were about 25. Director Harold Ramis who wrote the story and co-wrote the screenplay never lets Year One settle. He keeps the plot moving introducing new elements and finding new opportunities for comedy. He mines each environment for laughs and moves onto another and he doesnt worry about anachronisms. And so the two cave men presumably living about 20000 years ago come down from the mountains and run into the farmers Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd). Soon we find ourselves in early Biblical times with Zed and Oh (Cera) running into Abraham (circa 2000 B.C.) at a crucial moment. ""We are the Hebrews"" Abraham announces ""righteous people but not very good at sports."" Abraham tells them about Sodom and Gomorrah which he describes as horrible cities in which people drink and celebrate all day and where the women are so licentious that sex is given freely to anyone just for the asking. Watch Blacks face as he hears this description. His eyes practically roll up into his head as he tries to figure out how to politely ask for directions. Year Oneis not always laugh-out-loud funny but its always lively. After 30 years of writing and sometimes directing some very fine comedies (Groundhog DayAnalyze ThisCaddyshackGhostbustersAnimal HouseStripes) Ramis knows exactly what it takes to hold an audiences attention in comedy. Every character is made vivid and absurd from the breezy but wicked Cain to the righteous but oblivious Abraham (who thinks everybody should want to be circumcised) to the flamboyant (and hirsute) high priest of Sodom (Oliver Platt). Ramis never lets his guard down never gives the audience a chance to relax even if it means hanging a lead character upside down and making him urinate on his own face. Theres no vulgar or not vulgar here just funny or not funny. Year Oneshows what has been true since the beginning of time that its anything for a laugh. mlasallesfchronicle.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

"Harold Ramis Year One reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Harold Ramis Year One reviewed. Harold Ramis Year One reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 19 2009 112 PM Two Cave Men Walk Into the Old Testament The pleasing conceptual simplicity of Year One. By Dana Stevens Year One Year One (Sony Pictures) the cave man buddy comedy directed by Harold Ramis and starring Jack Black and Michael Cera is a slapdash concoction with an overreliance on scatological gags and a long lag time between laughs. I freely admit that. Yet I have a certain affection for this movie if only because of its conceptual simplicity. Year One doesnt avail itself of digital animation or elaborate time-travel scenarios; Ramis doesnt hire consultants to create a credible prehistoric language or worry about historical consistency. He just plonks two guys in pelts down in a world where Stone Age cave men coexist with biblical characters and lets the unstructured and intermittently funny sketch comedy roll. In the primitive village where Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) live there are only two career possibilities hunting and gathering. Zed is an incompetent hunter while Oh is a daydreaming gatherer. When Zed is exiled from the tribe for eating from the tree of forbidden fruit (see what I mean about consistency?) Oh follows him on a trek to whats supposed to be the end of the earth. Instead they run into Cain (David Cross) who promptly murders his brother Abel (Paul Rudd) and enlists the hapless cave dudes in a pathetically transparent cover-up. Eventually the boys flee with Cain to the decadent city of Sodom where they must free two cave girls from their own village (June Raphael and Juno Temple) whove been sold into slavery. Advertisement If Year One is about anything at all (which is debatable) its about the absurdity of religious dogma. As they wander through the tradition-bound world of the Israelites Zed and Oh innocently puncture one taboo after another (the eating of the forbidden fruit the violation of the holy temple) and time after time nothing happens. When pompous patriarch Abraham (Hank Azaria) tries to talk up the sacred rite of circumcision he has trouble finding takers You want us to cut off what? Many of the bit players especially Azaria and Oliver Platt as a high-camp high priest have a grand time with the scripts juxtaposition of lofty Old Testament diction and contemporary speech. ""We are the Hebrews"" intones Azaria ""a righteous people not very good at sports."" The essential question of a buddy comedy of course is whether and how the two leads bounce off each other and while they may not be the next Laurel and Hardy I found Black and Ceras teamwork to be reasonably bouncy. Blacks me-so-crazy shtick can get grating--I thought hed worn out his welcome definitively in Tropic Thunder--but hes a natural collaborator that rare comic who actually listens to his interlocutors instead of just waiting for his turn to riff. And I cant get enough of Cera a sad-eyed beanpole whose delivery is so dry its almost uninflected. He has a way of stepping on the very end of Blacks lines with quickly blurted put-downs that gets me every time; its the comedy of passive-aggression a tart counterpoint to Blacks oleaginous self-assurance. Ceras critics complain that he always plays the same role but Ive said it before and Ill say it again We need Michael Cera to keep being Michael Cera. Nobody else knows how.

"The Proposal; Year One Two Canucks two formulas | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Proposal; Year One Two Canucks two formulasHidden within the swamp of Year One and the romantic jungle of The Proposal are springboards for rising Canadians Michael Cera and Ryan Reynolds.Michael Cera in Year One (left) and Ryan Reynolds in The Proposal.  (SUPPLIED PHOTOS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 19 2009 Year One (out of 4) Starring Jack Black Michael Cera Oliver Platt Hank Azaria and David Cross. Directed by Harold Ramis. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The Proposal (out of 4) Starring Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds Betty White Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson. Directed by Anne Fletcher. 107 minutes. At major theatres. PG Hidden within the swamp of Year One and the romantic jungle of The Proposal are springboards for rising Canadians Michael Cera and Ryan Reynolds. But will the two actors bounce or bonk? Bramptons Cera (Juno Superbad) and Vancouvers Reynolds (X-Men Origins Wolverine) are on the brink of major stardom with recent hits having raised their profiles in Hollywood and beyond.Theyre being heavily promoted in their respective new comedies yet the attention they are getting is not without risk. Cera and Reynolds are essentially playing the same characters as always and theyre in films that rely heavily on formula. Stars can fall just as quickly as they rise.In Year One a ragged farce by the erratic Harold Ramis the geography is even shakier than the history. It begins in prehistoric jungles moves to biblical desert towns and metaphorically ends up in a bad Catskills nightclub.The jokes are so laden with groaners you almost expect to hear rim shots after every line. Its not long after the scene shifts bizarrely from caveman jungle to Old Testament sin city Sodom for example that somebody reworks the ""what happens in Vegas ..."" line - to scant amusement and zero surprise. And you can only begin to guess the riffage on the sodomy gags.On paper the teaming of the human apostrophe Jack Black with the man-child Cera as the films reluctant heroes seemed like a grand idea. As fur-clad Neanderthals Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) they do make for an amusing couple of buddies in bad (old) times clinging to companionship after being exiled from their tribe for hunting incompetence and spiritual irreverence.They are lumbered by a script that seems to have drawn inspiration from Mike Myers 2008 turkey The Love Guru with its penile obsessions and lame religion-themed plot rather than Ramiss avowed influences of the historical comedies of Monty Python and Mel Brooks.This is yet another star-driven laugher the recent Land of the Lost being another prime example where it seems the actors went before the cameras without a finished screenplay hoping for ad-lib magic that never happened.There are so many leaps of logic - how could anyone simply walk from prehistoric times to biblical times? - you start wondering if producer Judd Apatow got a rental deal on leftover movie sets and just strung the ideas together.Ramis who has Ghostbusters Groundhog Day and Caddyshack in his ""win"" column co-wrote the screenplay with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg of TVs The Office. The three know funny but their mirth meters need a tune-up. Were they afraid to go too far in lampooning Bible characters?They take the road too travelled by making Blacks Zed blustery and accident-prone and Ceras Oh timid and nerdy just as weve seen them many times before. Cameo shots from Apatow laugh factory toilers offer some novelty. Hank Azaria is great as Hebrew leader Abraham who invents circumcision but has a tough time selling the idea. An almost unrecognizable Bill Hader is great as a prehistoric soothsayer who has to explain to Zed what tribal exile means. And David Cross makes a fine Cain who has mixed emotions about knocking off his brother Abel (played by an uncredited Paul Rudd).Others are less enlivening. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbads McLovin) is one short flat note as biblical son Isaac while Oliver Platt is a long homophobic drone as the queenly High Priest who demands frequent oil rubs. The female players - Olivia Wilde as a Sodom princess June Raphael and Juno Temple as Zeds and Ohs amorous interests - have to content themselves with being mainly eye candy.This latter concern isnt a problem for Sandra Bullock in The Proposal a screwball comedy where reverse sexism is at work. Shes the poor mans Meryl Streep in her role as Margaret Tate a New York book editor whose introduction tracks that of Streeps in The Devil Wears Prada right down to the ridiculously complicated Starbucks order delivered by her servile assistant. He refers to her as ""Satans mistress"" under his breath.The twist here is that the serf Andrew is played by Reynolds who normally does the hip cynic. Its an eye-opener to see him playing a pathetic pup one who heels to every cruel whim of his employer rather than the manoeuvring hound of his Van Wilder fame. The freshness doesnt last long though as The Proposal defaults to rom-com formula. Seems Margaret is an uppity Canadian - irony alert - whose U.S. resident status is about to be revoked by an overzealous immigration agent (Denis OHare).Margarets solution is a quickie engagement to Andrew who allows himself to be bullied into plans for a subsequent marriage of convenience. But his cojones grow back when a plot contrivance shifts the action to Alaska and the formula fun turns from screwball into fish-out-of-water. City slicker Margaret has to cope with the rural foibles of Andrews kooky kin including his meddling mom (Mary Steenburgen) gruff dad (Craig T. Nelson) and kinky granny (Betty White ever the scene thief) whose 90th birthday occasions the trip. Theyre hicks but also high rollers - ""Alaskan Kennedys"" as Margaret observes - and they have impulsive plans of their own for the presumed lovebirds in their midst.Nobody who ever attended a date movie will be surprised by what happens but The Proposal has low expectations and good vibes in its favour. Director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses) never overplays her hand or the script by rookie scribe Peter Chiarelli. Bullock and Reynolds click both comedically and romantically making the most of their kid-friendly bedroom frolics. Its nice to see a movie where the leading ladys 12-year age gap over her younger leading man isnt an issue or even a plot point.So which Canuck gets the career boost from this weekends movie releases? Im betting Reynolds for giving us something at least a little stronger than the same old maple syrup.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Jack Black Michael Cera Olivia Wilde Director Harold Ramis  Editorial Review Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) are dumb even for cavemen in ""Year One"" a lowbrow only fitfully amusing comedy about the misadventurers of two inept hunter-gatherers expelled from their primitive village after accidentally setting it on fire. Not as dumb however as this movie.How dumb is dumb?Paul Rudd the enormously likable star of ""I Love You Man"" gets killed off in the first 15 minutes. Whats up with that? Making a cameo as the biblical Abel Rudds adorable face is bashed in by his brother Cain (David Cross) only seconds after our misfit heroes have met him. And for a moment there I thought that this movie from Judd Apatows production company might actually be going somewhere.Zed and Oh soon find themselves traipsing through various Bible episodes eventually winding up in Sodom where the homophobic jokes fly fast and furious. Its as if the script (by director Harold Ramis Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg) had been written by someone with grasp of Bible history as tenuous as one of Jay Lenos ""Jay Walking"" All-Stars and with a sense of humor as evolved as that of a high school sophomore. Dont get me wrong. You will laugh as long as you dont expect much more than a series of loosely connected sketches. But youll also very likely groan in disgust just as often over jokes involving circumcision urinating on ones own face rubbing hot oil into a high priests (Oliver Platt) hairy chest and -- ew -- coprophagy.Look it up.

ABOUT THE MOVIEYear One  (out of four)Stars Jack Black Michael Cera Hank Azaria David Cross Oliver PlattDirector Harold RamisDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout brief strong language and comic violenceRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Year One is rated PG-13 but a better guideline might be No one older than 16 should bother seeing it. The humor largely centered around bodily functions and bathroom habits is almost exclusively sophomoric. While there is chemistry between the loud buffoon character played by Jack Black and Michael Cera as his meekly soft-spoken sidekick this caveman saga/biblical retelling misses more often than it hits. It starts promisingly enough. Zed (Black) is reviled by his tribe of zealous hunter/gatherers for his lack of skills. When he admits that hes not a good hunter everyone -- individually and collectively -- always adds ""Or gatherer."" Oh (Cera) is brainier but his hunting/gathering aptitude adds up to zero. Some of the movies funniest moments take place as they struggle awkwardly to fit in within their primitive village. The screenplay which plucks random characters and modifies scenes from Bible stories also seems to have drawn liberally from the Unabridged Encylopedia of Gross-Out Jokes. Zed is prone to delusions of grandeur early-man style. He defiantly eats from the tree of forbidden fruit. Convinced he has gained untold knowledge he taunts Oh to test him. ""I might know everything"" he proclaims. ""Ask me something."" ""Where does the sun go at night?"" Oh asks. ""Pass. Next question"" he responds. And so it goes. Upon fleeing their village they meet Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd). Cain and Abels father gives Zed his daughter to ""lie with"" while Oh must bunk with Cain and Abels flatulent brother. You can see where this is going. And its not a good place. Later they run into Abraham (Hank Azaria) just as he is about to sacrifice Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). While Azarias circumcision gag is initially funny it grows old. They walk a few paces and end up in Sodom which is where the comedy nearly comes to a standstill. Zed is convinced he has been chosen by God while Oh is forced to spend hours massaging oil on a hirsute high priest (Oliver Platt). A few scenes feebly rip off Monty Pythons Life of Brian. While Cera is humorously low-key and Black has a few funny moments Year One is scattershot and silly squandering its potential by relying on juvenile bawdy humor.

Year One Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2009) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/year-one-2009,200,yearone20,yearone,rogerebert
"Year One movie review - Year One showtimes - The Boston Globe - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Year One ""Year One takes a charmless trip back in time Boston.com article page player in wide format. By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 19 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + When the movie summer of 2009 is writ in the annals Hank Azaria may turn out to have been its secret star. Certainly he deserves a plaque for most saves. He alone made ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian bearable as the prissy evil pharaoh and his handful of scenes as the biblical patriarch Abraham - promising mass circumcisions followed by wine and sponge cake for everyone - offer the only laughs in the endless plain of unfunny that is ""Year One.Unfortunately for us the stars of the movie are Jack Black and Michael Cera playing two cavemen Zed and Oh who wander off the grid into various early civilizations. Ceras dreamy geekboy sex appeal is still working for him - barely - but Black is way past his expiration date. The actors unvarying comic shtick - blubbery egotism and over-enunciated dude catchphrases - has never seemed feebler.The movie mulches recent movies like ""Apocalypto and ""10000 B.C. with a big serving of ""Monty Pythons Life of Brian minus the brains. Zed and Oh are failures as either hunters or gatherers and anyway Zed has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge (not that you can tell) so he and Oh are exiled to the mountains and beyond. First stop is Bible-land where they witness Cain (David Cross annoying) slaying Abel (Paul Rudd here and gone) and stop Abraham from sacrificing Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse the raging nerd from ""Superbad).Then were off to a suspiciously Roman-looking Sodom with a bad king (Xander Berkeley) a hot-to-trot princess (Olivia Wilde) a poofter bear of a high priest (Oliver Platt under pounds of makeup) and the heroes tribemates taken as slaves including true loves Maya (June Diana Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple). A promising orgy scene with Cera spray-painted gold gets diverted into endless giggly-pansy jokes involving Oh the priest and hot oil.Theres also the scene where Zed eats a turd and the bit in which Oh hanging upside down in a dungeon urinates on his own face. Are you laughing yet? The problems with ""Year One are easy to identify the script the direction the editing the performances. Under the hand of director Harold Ramis (whose ""Groundhog Day is looking more and more like a fluke) scenes stumble to a halt unfinished and the actors are forced to vamp in the void. Some like Azaria are up to the challenge and every so often the movie gets off a decent sight gag like an ox-cart chase scene that whips along at 7 miles per hour.Any good will the movie generates though is grated right back off by Black whose obnoxiousness has lost whatever charm it once possessed. ""Year One matches him stride for puerile stride playing like a lesser Bob Hope-Bing Crosby ""Road movie rewritten by a team of potty-obsessed 12-year-old boys.

In todays film comedies from here to eternity.Or in the case of Year One backwards from here to the dawn of man.The premise for this dopey but resourceful yukfest is simple Take primitive Mesolithic tribesmen and load them up with modern vernacular and a standups fast-twitch delivery.So you have guys in loincloths talking about ""downtime"" and ""pooching the dog.""The fall guys in this slapstick saga are Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera). Theyre total losers with the ladies and at their jobs - respectively hunter and gatherer.The actors make a surprisingly effective comic team with Blacks manic energy trampolining off Ceras deflated passivity.If all they did was hang around the village youd have the makings of a Saturday Night Live skit. A short one. Hunt boar end up getting chased by boar.But producer/director/writer Harold Ramis another Hollywood smart guy mining dumb humor has some tricks up his sleeve.Zed and Oh are exiled turning Year One into a raucous road comedy.They step out of the primordial forest into a large and elastic world. Run out of gags? No problem. Simply move our hapless wanderers on to the next civilization. Historical eras be damned.In short order Zed and Oh drift from early agrarians to Israelites marooned in the desert to a Phoenician outpost to the glory that was Sodom.Zed and Oh join the military garrison in that degenerate city. Strapped into his oversized helmet Cera looks like Marvin the Martian.Ramis has assembled an all-star supporting cast to play the Old Testament figures they meet along the way. David Cross and Paul Rudd for instance are Cain and Abel. Hank Azaria is Abraham. (""We are the Hebrews"" he proclaims ""A righteous people. Not very good at sports."")Abraham is intent on introducing the ritual of circumcision to our horrified heroes. Year One never drifts far from penis and poop jokes. Its other go-to gag Bible-era double entendres.Oh who shrinks from any physical contact is thrown repeatedly into homoerotic situations as with the flamboyant head priest (Oliver Platt) who wants oil rubbed all over his outrageously hairy body.The itinerants are constantly being forced into bondage. At one point Zed explaining his reluctance to trust Cain says to him ""You did sell us into bondage."" ""Hold a grudge much?"" responds the king of fratricide. ""That was like a fortnight ago.""OK its a thin concept. Maybe thats why its antic silliness spreads so evenly over its hour- and-a-half duration.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet If theres one literary work crying out for a hilarious movie adaptation starring Jack Black its the Old Testament. In Year One Black and Michael Cera play primitive hunter-gatherers who banished from their tribe for stupidity and general uselessness wander down from the mountains and into history--stopping along the way to eat fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge. Its a potentially funny tricky premise and in the hands of someone as talented and slightly skewed as writer-director Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day Caddyshack Ghostbusters) and a pair of writers from The Office it should have worked. But for the most part it doesnt. Year One isnt dreadful; it just isnt nearly as funny as it hopes to be. Solidly in the Mel Brooks tradition (History Of The World Part I being an obvious antecedent) Year One whips jokes at the screen as quickly as possible theorizing that if one doesnt get a laugh the next might. The hit-to-miss ratio is frequently too low though and Blacks cocksure face-pulling (a surprisingly good pairing with Michael Ceras timid Michael Cera-ness) can only rescue bad jokes so often. There are dick fart poop pee and body-hair gags all time-honored subjects served up almost completely wit-free. (Okay Cera hanging upside down and peeing on his own face is a little funny but Black picking up a piece of shit and eating it is just tired.) The supporting cast does its best to bring a sideways look at the material David Cross plays Cain as gleefully mean double-crossing Cera and Black one minute and embracing them the next. Hank Azaria turns the father of modern religion Abraham into a hammy goof obsessed with circumcision and his son played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbads McLovin) loves to sneak off to Sodom and party. Oliver Platt on the other hand turns up solely for some flat gay-panic/hairy-guy jokes and the two female leads--whom the heroes are ostensibly trying to save when they arent goofing off--are so inconsequential that they might as well be inanimate treasures. Even the bright performances cant save a wedged-together totally unnecessary plot and Year One commits comedy heresy when Black ends up learning a lesson at the end. (He isnt he realizes the ""chosen one"" after all.) Aiming for broad appeal the movie casts too many stones most of which miss their targets.

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 18 2009 1110 AM Title Year One Primitive pals roam the Earth circa the year 1 B.C. With Jack Black Michael Cera. Director Harold Ramis. (137). PG-13 Crude humor comic violence. At area theaters.Talk about a disaster of Biblical proportions.""Year One"" falls flat from its genesis to its outtake-filled credits scene never moving beyond obvious set-ups or jokes that have been as beaten to death as Abel. The one person wholl be happy after walking out may be Will Ferrell since ""Land of the Lost"" is no longer the only turkey around.In a land before time hunter Zed (Jack Black) and gatherer Oh (Michael Cera) offend their tribe and set out to walk to the end of the Earth. Then Zed after eating some glowing fruit from the Tree of Knowledge has what he thinks is an evolutionary leap and decides the planet isnt flat. (He does wacky ninja moves and boomerang eyebrows all the time so its hard to tell if hes advanced.)Soon theyre loping through a kind of Old Testament theme park that includes run-ins with Cain (David Cross) and his unfortunate brother (Paul Rudd) Abraham (Hank Azaria) and his would-be sacrificial son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and a Roman King (Xander Berkeley) and centurion (Vinnie Jones) who turn burly Zed and girly Oh into orgy slaves along with the loinclothed honeys they love.To compare the inane ""Year One"" to a Monty Python comedy like ""Life of Brian"" is like saying a Natural History lecture is as thrilling as Raquel Welch in a pelt. It isnt that coasting was the sole intent of director Harold Ramis (whos always welcome when he wants to make something as fun and anarchic as ""Caddyshack"" ""National Lampoons Vacation"" or the undeniably great ""Groundhog Day""). At times it seems that he Black and cameo actors like Azaria really want to put on a good lark.But Holy Moses--whats wound up on the screen is more like an amateur improv show full of mugging pokes in the ribs and bits that Mel Brooks would have rejected even in his most uninspired spoofs.Making matters worse is that Cera and Black are poor choices to tie it all together. No ones idea of a classic comedy team Cera sing-songs his way through his stammering-victim moments while Black--whose performances have become so arch and flip we should worry hell break his back the next time he shows up--is insufferable almost from his first scene his every line spoken with air quotes around it. He can do better than this.During all of the films oh-so-long 97 minutes ""Year One"" barely earns a snicker. Anyone wanting as much as a sustained chuckle will feel as if theyre frozen in time.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"movie review year one year one movie review jack black michael cera - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Year One -- 2 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Year One is this summers The Love Guru this weekends Land of the Lost.Its a throwback to the ""star comedy"" the days when hit movies were outlandish farces built around larger-than-life comics playing broad cartoonish characters. As all of America lines up for another weekend of The Hangover -- the latest romp to feature no real stars playing believable characters behaving badly -- a ""star comedy"" feels star-crossed and out of date. This hunter-gatherer giggle is part satire part Bathroom Practices of the Bible. Jack Black and Michael Cera are the stars a pairing that works well enough because of their contrasting styles. Black is old-school BIG as Zed an incompetent ""hunter"" who isnt subtle about tasting fresh feces to find out how long ago a group of humans passed. Cera (Juno Superbad) plays Oh doing his sensitive weakling shtick. Hes a gatherer. ""Hunters think theyre so cool.""Neither guy really fits in their tribe neither has any chance of ""getting the girl."" And when Zed tastes the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (it doesnt make him smarter) Zed and Oh are banished setting off on their own past ""the end of the world"" as they know it. And thats where things turn Biblical.They stumble into short-tempered Cain (David Cross a hoot) as hes bashing his brother Abel and hiding the crime.They stop the religious fanatic Abraham ( Hank Azaria funny as always) as hes about to sacrifice his son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse whiney as ever). Alas Zed and Oh are too busy saving their own skins to prevent Abraham from inventing circumcision. And then theyre off to Sodom which sounds swell in the travel brochures but turns out to be a town of violence and virgin sacrifice. They learn that the tribeswomen they longed for (Juno Temple and June Diane Raphael) have been kidnapped and are in line to be killed by the furry-sissy high-priest (Oliver Platt).Black works for his ""big boned"" laughs -- doing the eyebrow thing shaking his money maker to entice the hot Princess of Sodom (Olivia Wilde). Cera doesnt let the fact that he wears a loincloth throw him off his hangdog ""She doesnt know I exist"" game. Look for cameos by members of comedys ""Frat Pack"" -- Blacks Tenacious D partner a star of I Love You Man a Saturday Night Live cast-member in blackface as a village shaman. Co-writer/director Harold Ramis has a cameo as Cains suspicious dad -- you know the name. Ramis is Caddyshack old school and was going for something Mel Brooks would have been proud to call his own -- a little lewd a little crude a little Hebrewed""We are the Hebrews a righteous people just not very good at sports.""That makes Year One for all its shock laughs (not that many) toilet jokes and post-Apatow vulgarisms kind of quaint.In a comic era of baby masturbation gags simulated sex with tigers and the other consequences of a Hangover quaint would be a relief if Year One had turned out funnier.

In the 60s when the desire to find our way back to our primitive shaggy-haired selves was all the rage there was a vogue for caveman slapstick -- The Flintstones the comic strip B.C. and of course the Raquel Welch loincloth oglefest One Million Years B.C. (not a comedy at least not intentionally but whos counting intentions?). In our current all-snark-all-the-time meta-culture where there are twice as many late-night talk-show hosts devising new ways not to take anything seriously as there are network news anchors we have Year One starring Jack Black as Zed a facetious jabbering mock-fierce hunter and Michael Cera as Oh a facetious monosyllabic mock-ineffectual gatherer. The two are bedecked in loincloths pelts and unkempt Neanderthal hair but under the barbaric ensembles theyre meant to be ludicrously contemporary outrageously civilized misfits stuck in a tribe of head-conking brutes. Theyre such outcasts that within the films opening 20 minutes they get booted out of the tribe. They then trek to the mountains that are supposed to mark the end of the world and land in the middle of...the story of Cain and Abel. You heard right. Year One directed by the veteran card Harold Ramis (Caddyshack Groundhog Day) from a script he co-wrote with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg sets us up to expect a caveman comedy but the film turns into a blockbuster game of bait and switch. It takes these two lugs who barely seem like lugs and sets them down in a series of half-cocked Bible stories where they unleash their frazzled too-much-bad-?cable-TV derision on a bunch of long-?bearded scowlers who speak in ""Art thou?"" Scripture-ese. The movie could be Bill amp; Teds Old Testament Adventure or maybe Hope and Crosby?meets?Jimmy Kimmel on The Road to Sodom with the second half set entirely inside that walled-up sin city. Year One has a handful of chuckles but its also harmless and scattershot without much primitive bite. These targets were savaged far more cuttingly 30 years ago in Monty Pythons Life of Brian. Then again that was satire. This is just silliness run mildly wild. One reason that Im always up for a Jack Black comedy is that he never ever loses his enjoyment of idiot cool. Each time he gleams lustfully or offers one of his I must be on drugs if you just said that discombobulated rejoinders its as if for the first time (though lets be honest its probably the 501st time). In Year One Black rides a horse-drawn cart as if it were a roller coaster and he also threads his way through smiting fratricide and the invention of circumcision with his incredulous stoner logic. When a girl is about to be sacrificed to God Black will not miss a beat before saying ""Seems like a waste of ?a perfectly good virgin to me"" And the thing is he means it. Michael Cera tries to coax his more passive style into a tude as tricky as Blacks only Ceras presence doesnt pop. Hes attempting to be an ironic wimp but he seems not just wimpy but neutered. He comes off as a contradiction -- a flatly sincere almost academic cutup. Fortunately there are terrific supporting jesters in Year One. Hank Azaria turns the imperious Abraham into a very grand wack-job; David Cross makes the murderous Cain a figure of hilariously matter-of-fact ego; and Oliver Platt freeing himself from his usual mopiness is a marvel as Sodoms high priest a lisping libertine dandy who having made Ceras Oh his slave of the moment forces the poor young man to baste him in body oil. Platt more than anyone is the soul of the movie because he makes even the most? primitive perversity sound...well civilized. B?

An amiable stroll through biblical times featuring Jack Black and Michael Cera as exiled Neanderthals ""Year One"" lacks seismic guffaws but elicits many mild smiles. Borrowing the understated run-on gag structure from co-writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (""The Office"" for which director Harold Ramis has helmed a few episodes) and adding several players from producer Judd Apatows stable this low-tech opus offers an ironic commentary on the utter idiocy of religious superstition and received knowledge all the funnier for being delivered by world-class idiot Black. Still the PG-13-rated CG-free comedy may prove too tame to score big with target auds.""Year One"" opens on a slapstick wild-boar chase in a primordial environment with few employment possibilities other than professional hunter or professional gatherer. Accident-prone hunter Zed (Black) having eaten the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge is kicked out of his village. Reluctantly accompanied by nerdy gatherer Oh (Cera) Zed crosses over mountains (and several millennia) to arrive in time to witness Cain (David Cross) slay Abel (Paul Rudd in a hilarious cameo) not once but several times each new assault more ""accidental"" than the last. After enjoying a brief sleepover at Adams (Ramis) and thwarting the human sacrifice of Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) by dad Abraham (Hank Azaria) the Neanderthal pair wind up in Sodom for the last half of the picture trailing half the cast with them. Naming himself ""the Chosen"" Blacks Zed keeps tearing down belief systems -- that the world ends over the next hill that virgin sacrifices bring drought-relieving rain -- only to replace them with elaborately rationalized purely ego-driven elevations of himself as the worlds savior until reality (or else the more sarcastic Oh) hauls him back from his delusions of grandeur. Fittingly for a movie that denies religious causality the jokes themselves seldom have defined beginnings middles or ends. Some gags have no payoff whatsoever (Oh fatally wrapped in a huge yellow python shows up unscathed in the next scene without explanation). Blacks partner-friendly stylings as evidenced in his couplings with Hector Jimenez in ""Nacho Libre"" and Mos Def in ""Be Kind Rewind"" pay off beautifully here He and Cera bounce off each other brilliantly Blacks braggadocio neatly complementing Ceras sadsack understatement. But other casting choices in this overpopulated spoof seem like so much excess baggage. Apatow discovery Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad"") fails to rekindle his McLovin magic as a tagalong Isaac. June Raphael as brunette bombshell Maya doesnt spark even negative magnetism -- unlike Juno Temples ditzy Eema who ultimately divests Oh of his teen-virgin status. Ramis has been ridiculing the sanctimony of pious religious epics at least as far back as his legendary mid-70s SCTV lampoon of ""Ben-Hur."" Here the helmer entertainingly skirts sacrilege with skits skewering a Sodomite high priest (a bejeweled Oliver Platt) and a colorful spin on Old Testament happenings including the reading of entrails (""To me I see a happy face""). Despite its irreverence the pic seems unlikely to pique interest by courting religious opposition. Unlike Kevin Smiths ""Dogma"" ""Year One"" so muddles its orthodoxy and telescopes its timeline as to make any protest seem more absurd than the film.
