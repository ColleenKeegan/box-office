The problem stems one suspects from Jewisons debt to a simpler age when the 60s Civil Rights movement was at its peak. But its another century and racial politics have moved on leaving Jewison a veteran of liberal conscience movies with his embarrassing white-people-cant-dance jokes a toe-curling script and leaden stereotypes. Not to mention pale imitations of boxing scenes from Raging Bull. Washington cant be faulted as the wronged fighter while Shannon shows promise as the teenager who inspires Carter to fight for his release. But both soon become powerless observers of their own lives dependant on the whim of heroic white knights and authority figures.

Starring Denzel Washington and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Norman Jewison. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""The Hurricane"" Denzel Washington accomplishes an amazing feat of heavy lifting. He is in a picture that in every way besides his performance is obvious manipulative and at times corny. But he raises it to the level of importance with an acting job thats one unbroken chain of intense emotion. Give director Norman Jewison credit for two things 1) He made the movie; 2) He let Washington run away with it. After that credit goes to Washington. A natural heavyweight he lost 60 pounds and trained so he could play Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter a middleweight who was imprisoned for two decades for murders he did not commit. In ""The Hurricane"" which opens today Washington gives a penetrating portrait of life at its most extreme. He takes the viewer into the mind of a man experiencing confinement and physical deprivation. More profoundly he shows what its like to deal every day with the torments of wild rage and impotence despair and hope. How does a person survive for 20 years under such circumstances? ""Hurricane"" is at its best and most honest in exploring this question. The answer There is no one way. At times Carter survives by cutting himself off from desire and hope. At other times he needs to connect with people. Nothing works fully and nothing works for long. ""The Hurricane"" is a strong personal story that weakens only when it reaches clumsily for political significance. The title is the tip-off. It doesnt refer only to the man but to the turmoil of the 50s -- and 60s. Carter wasnt just the Hurricane. He was swept up in it. The film takes time to hit its stride. The narrative has little momentum in its first hour cutting from scenes of Carters early life to the story of an African American boy living in Toronto in the 1980s with three Canadian guardians (played by Liev Schreiber John Hannah and Deborah Kara Unger). The three guardians are apparently nice white people and thats about all we ever know about them. Jewison is under the impression that he can make Carters story more important by relating it to broader issues of racism. He cuts to archival footage of white cops beating black protesters. He also shows Carter losing a fight thanks to racist fight judges something that apparently didnt happen. In fact Carters story is enough of an indictment of racism to stand on its own and its uniqueness is in itself justification for the big-screen treatment. While its busy preaching ""Hurricane"" leaves out important details. Why for example did two juries in two trials in New Jersey -- not Mississippi -- believe Carter to be guilty? The movie would suggest that some people are just plain evil while others are only good and thats why Carter was sent up. Thats not enough. We ought to know something about the case. Fortunately Washington takes over after the movies shaky start. It would take paragraphs to describe fully everything going on in his face in the moment when Hurricane is sentenced to life in prison. Its a mix of anger terror dignity and fatalism -- all playing out at once. He has another fathomless moment late in the film hearing yet another verdict. Theres a sense of privilege in seeing such acting. Its like stepping into someones soul. Early in his sentence Carter is put into solitary and in one of the most powerful scenes he sits in the dark watching two sides of himself battle for control -- an angry side and a self-indulgent one. The moment physicalizes the psychological fragmentation that comes with long periods alone and shows the psychological challenge Out of these equally flawed sides he has to find the balance to maintain his sanity. ""The Hurricane"" is about a 20- year battle inside one mind and about how a man became a hero simply by surviving. ..

Its almost impossible to imagine ""The Hurricane"" Norman Jewisons heartfelt political drama without Denzel Washington in the lead role of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter the black boxer who was wrongly convicted of triple murder and sent to prison where he spent 19 years before being exonerated and released in 1985. In whats easily his most zealous and fully realized performance since ""Malcolm X"" Washington elevates the earnest occasionally simplistic narrative to the level of a genuinely touching moral expose. Inspirational and uplifting in the manner of old-fashioned American sagas about racial injustice pic will likely be embraced by holiday-season audiences of all ages and races. After a decade of directing mostly light commercial fare (""January Man"" ""Only You"") Jewison here returns to the kind of issue-oriented film for which he is best known (the Oscar-winning ""In the Heat of the Night"" ""A Soldiers Story""). But the emotional impact of this story is slightly diminished by the solemn air of the proceedings particularly in the prolonged jail-set midsection. ""Hurricane"" doesnt quite qualify as a fully fleshed biopic; Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordons richly detailed script based on two books skips several crucial chapters in its heros life and consciously takes some liberties with the facts particularly in its chronicle of how three students became committed to Carters case until they succeeded in getting him out of prison. The first sequence intercuts between 1963 when middleweight boxer Rubin Carter has a big fight with Emile Griffith and 1973 when Carter is in Trenton State Prison angrily protesting that the authorities are after his book manuscript which he perceives as his only chance for being acquitted of the false charges. Brief flashbacks re-create the 1966 murder in which three people are killed by two gunmen in the Lafayette Bar in Paterson N.J. This murder leads to the arrest of Carter and a young fan John Artis (Garland Whitt) who just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They are brought to the hospital where one of the wounded victims who can barely see identifies them as the killers under the manipulation of a malevolent cop Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya). Cut to Toronto seven years later when a black youth named Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) picks up Carters autobiography for a quarter. In a bizarre and fateful turn of events that would have warmed the heart of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski the yarn suggests how the random act of a book purchase can change ones life. After reading the book Lesra an alienated American teenager finds direction and purpose for the first time in his life. A product of poor illiterate parents Lesra has been ""adopted"" by three Canadian students Terry Swinton (John Hannah) Lisa Peters (Deborah Kara Unger) and Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber) who bring him to their bohemian apartment in Toronto. Instinctively convinced of Carters innocence Lesra begins corresponding with the boxer soon enlisting his social-activist guardians to mount a full-time campaign for his release. The Canadian activists basically put their lives on hold to fight for Carter eventually gaining his freedom. Depicting the emergence of esprit de corps the tale emphasizes that the trio of students and Lesra form a unique kind of extended family. The dynamics between Lesra and Carter form the emotional thrust of the story with the latter gradually assuming the role of Lesras surrogate father. But the bond is mutually rewarding; Lesra becomes Carters only ray of light. Before meeting the young man Carter had cut himself off from all those around him. In a painful scene after securing a second trial (in which he is again convicted) Carter forces his wife (Debbi Morgan) to divorce him and never visit him again; he cant even bear to see his little daughter. Integrated into the proceedings are flashbacks to an incident that occurred when Carter as a boy got involved in an attack on a white man that put him face to face with Della Pesca a corrupt and racist cop whose driving force in life is seemingly to incarcerate Carter. The weakest scenes are those involving Carters isolation which becomes his mode of survival in prison and the exchange of letters between him and Lesra which are solemnly read. And Jewison doesnt dramatize in an interesting way Carters spirituality how he throws away his law books and begins to search within himself. But the picture is effective in placing Carter in the broader historical context perceiving this particular case of injustice as symbolic of the way blacks especially prominent and controversial figures like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were treated by the white establishment. Indeed in the 1970s Carters plight became a cause celebre inspiring protests by such luminaries as actress Ellen Burstyn and a popular ballad by Bob Dylan. Pic offers cynical commentary on the politics of celebs suggesting the fleeting nature of their involvement. Whether intentionally or not the filmmakers end up mythologizing Carter as a saint an approach that may be partly determined by the factual material but also reflects the films 60s sensibility. Even so ""The Hurricane"" is so intriguingly plotted and captivatingly acted that its easy to overlook its dramatic flaws and overall soft gaze. Having lost more than 40 pounds a trim Washington delivers a soaring intense performance arguably the richest in his already impressive career. He inhabits all the disparate moods of the yarn. While the central figure dominates all the thesps do well in the same emotionally truthful vein especially Shannon as the idealistic youth and Unger Schreiber and Hannah as the Canadian activists. Only exception is Hedaya who plays the one-dimensional villain as a figure out of a Greek tragedy. Production values are good across the board notably Roger Deakins lensing which mutes the colors when the story gets more somber (in prison) and brings them back for the more upbeat finale.

As Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter the middleweight boxer who served half of his adult life in prison after being railroaded for murder Washington immerses himself even more than he did in Malcolm X in a stare of unforgiving outrage. Its a look that starts as an accusation delivered from on high but that ultimately acquires so many unspoken currents of pride loathing disbelief and bottled-up madness that it attains a truth more complex than the movie around it. In one of the most harrowing sequences Carter arriving in prison announces that he refuses to wear the standard uniform since hes not guilty and therefore no ones prisoner. He is tossed into the hole and he remains there in his street clothes for weeks then months gradually turning into a grimy ghost. When he emerges from his dungeon hes a physical wreck but the first thing he does speaking to an official is straighten his necktie. That simple gesture of mockery and defiance might be too heroic to believe if Washington didnt present it as an act of desperate sanity--another step in Carters mission to retain not just his status but his identity as an innocent man. The Hurricane is the kind of old-fashioned liberal rabble-rouser that the director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night A Soldiers Story) practically has a patent on. Watching the movie you know that youre not getting the full detailed story of Rubin Carter. The rougher edges of his personality have been sanded away (though his lean and hard machine-gun boxing style is vividly captured) and the script molds the intricate facts of his case into pure melodrama drawn with the cleanest of moral lines. Carter is made victim by a vile racist detective (Dan Hedaya) who dogs him from childhood and he is rescued from prison by a team of tireless Canadian freedom fighters. Its not that all of this is made up; its that there were more characters and more shades--to the victimization and to the salvation as well. Still if The Hurricane has been conceived as virtually a generic portrait of injustice as prosaic in its bluntness as the 1975 Bob Dylan protest song that drew national attention to Carters case Washingtons great stirring performance leads us into far more unruly terrain. He plays Carter as fiercely intelligent and articulate (which is accurate) with an intensity of awareness that only heightens his tragedy. The result for all its flaws is a haunting parable of survival--of how a black man wills himself through the nearly Kafkaesque ordeal of being presumed in America to be a criminal. This movie about the nightmare of incarceration makes you taste the meaning of freedom.

With the release of his latest project ""The Hurricane"" Jewison has delivered another excellent film and one that stands with two of his earlier works that also deal with racial injustice ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967) and ""A Soldiers Story"" (1984). VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""The Hurricane"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K The latter nominated for an Oscar for best picture featured the remarkable talents of Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington (he won for 1989s ""Glory""). It seems impossible now to imagine ""The Hurricane"" without him in the title role. Rallying to a cause celebre In 1966 a man named Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter dreamed of winning the middleweight boxing title. Through a combination of bad police work a nearly blind witness and racist cops his dreams were shattered when he and another man John Artis (played in this film by Garland Whitt) were wrongly accused and convicted of killing three white people in a New Jersey bar. Carter used his anger about his false imprisonment as inspiration for writing his 1974 autobiographical ""The Sixteenth Round"" in which he made his case for his innocence. His situation inspired numerous protests over racism during the 1970s. Celebrities including actress Ellen Burstyn rallied to his cause. Singer Bob Dylan wrote a protest song about his plight. But after a second trial in which he was once again convicted Carter turned away from his wife and gave up hope. As the film shows this wasnt the end of Carters story. Enter an African-American teen-ager Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) living in Canada with three social activists who are trying to help him get an education. QUICKVOTE Would you recommend this movie? Yes go see it now Wait for the video Dont bother View Results Martin has read Carters book and believes him to be innocent. He turns for help to his adult friends Lisa Peters (Deborah Kara Unger) Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber) and Terry Swinton (John Hannah). Wanting to encourage his social activism they look into the case and find themselves also becoming champions of Carters cause. Martin and the Canadians move to New Jersey and vow not to leave until Carter is freed. The bond that grows between the teen-ager and Carter his new father figure provides plenty of emotional juice. The fight to gain the older mans freedom results in a profound dramatic arc to a satisfying conclusion. Swinton and Chaiton wrote a book about their fight for Carters freedom ""Lazarus and the Hurricane."" This work along with Carters autobiography form the core materials Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon have used for htis combustible script.

"Hurricane The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hurricane-the ) Hurricane The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Hate put me in prison. Loves gonna bust me out."" Those words spoken by Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Denzel Washington) form the thematic foundation of Norman Jewsions latest film The Hurricane. Alternatively tragic and triumphant it is an exhilarating trip through the life and times of the title character a championship boxer from Paterson New Jersey who spent 19 years behind bars for murders he did not commit. The Hurricane not only details the crime and the miscarriage of justice that followed but shows how Carter survived the long lonely years in prison and how the devotion of a small group of Canadians led to his redemption. Its difficult to state exactly where and when the movie begins since especially during its first half it jumps around freely and frequently in time. There are numerous flashbacks but the editing is clean and sharp which keeps the potential for confusion to a minimum. Its usually easy to determine within a couple of seconds exactly what portion of Carters life into which the current scene offers a window. There are two primary time periods. The first begins in 1963 when The Hurricane defeats Emile Griffith for the World Welter Weight title and continues through 1966 when he is arrested and tried for murder then into the 1970s when he is incarcerated at Trenton State Prison on a life sentence. The second time period occurs during the 1980s when Lesra Martin (Vicellous Shannon) a Brooklyn teenager living in Canada buys a copy of Carters autobiography The 16th Round and develops a passion to meet Carter. Encouraged by the three older people he is living with - Sam (Liev Schreiber) Terry (John Hannah) and Lisa (Deborah Unger) - he opens a correspondence with Carter then travels to New Jersey to visit him. Following the face-to-face meeting Lesra becomes determined to free Carter and enlists the aid of Sam Terry and Lisa in his struggle. Many people became aware of Carters plight as a result of Bob Dylans mid-70s ballad ""The Hurricane"" (which is featured on two separate occasions during the course of the film). Over the years a number of celebrities have leant their support to Carters cause but none of the marches or protests had any effect. What made the difference was the commitment of the group from Toronto who gave up their jobs moved to New Jersey and literally risked their lives to find the evidence to prove Carters innocence and to bring to light the corruption of the Paterson police lieutenant (Dan Hedaya) who hunted The Hurricane like a dog. Their efforts turn The Hurricane into a story of victory rather than defeat. Denzel Washington is amazing in the lead role giving his most powerful and effective performance since Malcolm X. Playing Carter demands a great deal of physicality and emotional range and there isnt a moment when Washington isnt entirely convincing. The actors essaying the Toronto group - Vicellous Shannon American Liev Schreiber (the cuckolded husband in A Walk on the Moon) Brit John Hannah (the ""nice guy"" in Sliding Doors) and Canadian Deborah Unger (Crash) - are all solid. Dan Hedaya interprets the part of the villain like a snake and Rod Steiger has a small but crucial role. For Jewison who has spent the better part of a decade making marginal and/or forgettable motion pictures The Hurricane represents a return to top form. This is a well written wonderfully acted drama about the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. The fact that its a true tale adds to its appeal. Jewison is at his best when making films with a social conscience and this is one of his most moving endeavors in years. The film is a crowd-pleaser but it earns the happy ending. By all accounts it remains true to actual events not only in spirit but in its depiction of them. Jewison rigorously researched the movie before beginning work on it and its apparent from the opening scene (a black-and-white re-creation of the December 20 1963 bout between Griffith and Carter) that a great deal of care and attention to detail went into The Hurricanes composition. The movie premiered as a work print at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival. Jewison Washington and most of the supporting cast were on hand to introduce the film. Also present was Rubin Carter who gave an impassioned 10-minute speech in which he expressed his gratitude to those who had worked to free him and to Jewison for bringing the story to the screen. More than two hours later when the films final frame had faded to black The Hurricane received a rousing three-minute standing ovation. The applause was well-deserved and the enthusiasm in that auditorium will likely be replicated all across the world as audiences file out of theaters after seeing this beautifully crafted and uplifting movie biography.
